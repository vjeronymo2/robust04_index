			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Monday Interview: Presenting a bright new image - Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EC commissioner for internal political relations, talks to David Gardner Joao de Deus Pinheiro is fortunate to have an engineering background since he has taken on a job he is having almost to invent. Despite his formal title as EC commissioner for internal political relations, his real job is commissioner for 'openness'. His task is to clean up the image of the Community - and particularly of the European Commission in Brussels - at probably the nadir of 'Europe's' popularity with its citizens. His approach is simple. 'We will tell the truth,' he says reiteratively. 'We want the citizens to know exactly what is going on,' he insists, adding EC 'information should show things as they are, not as we would wish they should be.' This approach could hardly be in starker contrast to the independent report on EC information policy, presented last Wednesday to universal derision. That report was ordered by the Commission in November from a committee of 'outside experts', dominated by figures from public relations and advertising, and headed by Mr Willy de Clercq, former Belgian minister, ex-commissioner, and now Euro-MP. Its sub-Orwellian strategy to make Europeans like the political and monetary union forseen by the Maastricht treaty prescribed, inter alia: A Euro-office of communications centralised on the Commission, which would secure 'binding agreements' after every significant EC decision about 'the message to communicate and the means for its communication.' 'Positioning' the EC as 'a branded product', with its own symbols ranging from a Euro-birth certificate to a European Order of Merit. The 'targetting' of journalists and editors (also known as 'transmitters' and 'relevant multipliers'), 'so that they subsequently become enthusiastic supporters of the cause'. The 'review' of school text-books, 'not in order to rewrite history, but to ensure that a European dimension is given to our past.' Slogans to replace the 'far too technical' EC treaties with the theme of 'togetherness' (for example: TOGETHER TO PROMOTE, PROGRESS &amp; PROSPERITY, PROTECTION AND PEACE, TOGETHER FOR EUROPE TO THE BENEFIT OF US ALL]). The EC must be brought 'closer to the people', the de Clercq report says, 'implicitly evoking the maternal, nurturing care of 'Europa' for all her children.' Mr Pinheiro says 'we were absolutely taken aback' by this politically tin-eared ad-man's fantasy when the Commission got it a week ago. Another top Commission official was less restrained. 'This crap,' he fumed, 'is just what we need to lose the Danish referendum' on Maastricht - due on May 18, and still as touch and go as the British government's struggle to get the treaty through parliament. The instinct of some senior officials was to suppress an obviously damaging recipe for a public relations fiasco. Mr Pinheiro's credibility, as the man in charge of restoring the Commission's credibility, risked going up in flames. 'What are we going to do?' he says the commissioners asked themselves. 'Should we refuse to go to the press conference?' He insisted de Clercq be told he would not get their support, then went with him to face the press. Amid the tumult of scorn and laughter from the aggrieved 'transmitters', he firmly but politely took his distance. 'The diagnosis is good, but the therapy is not acceptable. . . at least to me,' he said. The Commission would be bringing forward its own proposals in the last week of April. His record as chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 12 during Portugal's presidency in the first half of last year showed that 'there was no manipulation'. 'We're not going to go for propaganda,' he pledged, 'the main task is to tell the truth.' Now he has to prove that this was a first act of openness, announcing a new dispensation in EC information policy. Deus Pinheiro, as he is known in his native Portugal, could well be the sort of man who fits the current mood across Europe. This has as one of its distinguishing features a revulsion against politics as now practised at national or Community level. As Portuguese foreign minister, he was a well-regarded and thoughtful president of the EC council. By 10.30 on the morning after Danish voters sparked off the EC's crisis of confidence, rejecting Maastricht last June 2, he had secured the unanimous support of the 12 to press on with ratifying the treaty. Yet a month later, he decided to leave politics. 'I didn't want to be a professional politician any more. People are tired of the faces they see and tired of the old politics. They want something more responsive to civil society, something which uses the strength of society.' Something, he offers tentatively, 'a bit more like Clinton.' Nor, initially, did he want to accept his government's nomination as commissioner; he preferred going back to his tenured professorship of engineering and to seats on three corporate boards. But when Commission president Mr Jacques Delors suggested he take on the job of opening up Brussels policy-making to greater public scrutiny, 'it was such a challenge I felt bound to accept.' 'A certain humility is called for' within the Commission, he says, in order to 'stop being secretive, admit our mistakes' and be open about internal debate. Currently, one of the main functions of the Commission spokesman's service is to deodorise any whiff of internal controversy, jealously guarded as cuisine interne. 'If we decide on a certain line, we should stick to it, but that is different,' Mr Pinheiro argues. As talks start this week on how to make the EC single market work, Mr Pinheiro says the project is already partly discredited 'because the negative sides of it were suppressed. It was always presented in golden form,' he remonstrates, 'there was no attempt to find a balance.' 'What people want to know is more important than what we want to give them,' and the reforms he intends to put to his colleagues in a few weeks time will try 'to make reality available' in a 'demand-oriented, natural way.' If he gets his way, they will: Overhaul and slim down the ineffectual information directorate general (DG10). Staff will be appointed to gather and provide 'information, background, context and precedent' on demand. 'The structure of DG10 will be such that everyone will know exactly who is responsible for what,' promises the commissioner for openness. Have DG10 monitored forensically by a group of five experts independent of other Brussels departments, and overseen by a regularly rotated consultative council of users, 'to make sure its working as a service,' he says. Make Commission delegations in member states 'of better quality', sifting differing national concerns and feeding back 'sensitivities, moods and demands'. One thing he would like the 12 to do is to allow television cameras into the Council of Ministers '100 per cent' - except for 'delicate matters concerning third countries. . .which are usually done over lunch anyway.' Three Council debates will be televised today and tomorrow, after the current Danish presidency's temporary victory in arguing down vetoes from Belgium, Luxembourg and, as it happens, Portugal. Mr Pinheiro sees changes in the secretive, decision-making habits of some member states coming slowly. But he is determined that 'the Commission will have to change overnight.' Not all his colleagues favour transparency, he acknowledges, forseeing 'a big fight ahead in the Commission.' But he is utterly confident he has Mr Delors' support to effect 'a huge change in attitude, from top to bottom.' 'Vanguards are over, people want leadership, yes, but not vanguards, that's over.'

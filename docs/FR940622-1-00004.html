			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments proposed here would amend those sections in 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72 dealing with assurance of adequate funding for decommissioning. These changes would more explicitly describe the implementation and timing requirements for licensee financial assurance instruments and clarify that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Licensees who have applied for license renewal must provide financial assurance for decommissioning during the period that they remain in timely renewal. This is addressed through the addition of Paragraph (c)(4) to &sect;&sect;30.35, 40.36, and 70.25. Licensees currently in timely renewal would need to have the required financial assurance instrument when this rule if adopted as a final rule, becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Specific comments are solicited on the adequacy of the 90 day time period for licensees currently in timely renewal to obtain the required financial assurance instrument;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each decommissioning funding plan must include a certification by the licensee that financial assurance for decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate. This is addressed through a modification to Paragraph (e) of &sect;&sect;30.35, 40.36, and 70.25;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The decommissioning financial assurances provided by the licensee in conjunction with a license renewal or issuance must remain in effect during the period of decommissioning and must be increased or may be decreased, as appropriate, within 90 days of the licensee notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license. This is necessary to cover the detailed estimated decommissioning costs developed as part of the decommissioning plan. This is addressed through the addition of Paragraph (b)(2) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2) to &sect;72.54;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any licensee who submits a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license, and has not provided appropriate financial assurance for decommissioning, shall do so within 90 days of the notice. This is addressed through the addition of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(i) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(i) to &sect;72.54. Any licensee who has already submitted a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license would need to have the required financial assurance instrument when this rule, if adopted as a final rule, becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Licensees may reduce the amount of financial assurance semiannually as decommissioning proceeds and radiological contamination is reduced at the site, with the approval of the Commission. This is addressed through the addition of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) to &sect;72.54. The semiannual interval is proposed as a balance between the financial incentive that this provision gives to licensees to proceed promptly with the decommissioning work after approval of the decommissioning plan and the burden imposed on both the licensee and staff in implementing a reduction. Specific comments are solicited on the interval proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this proposed rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 6 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6&hyph;F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;3019, (3150&hyph;0017, 3150&hyph;0020, 3150 0009, and 3150&hyph;0132), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

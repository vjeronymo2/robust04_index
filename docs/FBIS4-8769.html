			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The inferno in Gorazde is growing bigger and  bigger. The chetniks from the nearby hills are firing more and  more on the city center. After they directly hit the hospital  crammed with the wounded with howitzers and tanks this morning,  the chetniks fired at the windows and walls of this medical  institution with anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft  guns from Biserna and (?Mare).    Dozens of civilians have been killed on the left bank of the  Drina River, in the very center of the town. The wounded cannot  be taken to the medical center where they need urgent medical  treatment, because the bridges in this town are subjected to  constant and strong sniper fire.    NATO aircraft, which overflew this volcanic crater on  several  occasions, could see a real hell in Gorazde. Smoke [words  indistinct] is everywhere. There is smoke from burning village  houses that were abandoned yesterday and today by their owners,  who were fleeing in front of the chetniks to save their lives.  In Gorazde, in the town itself, there is real chaos, a  confusion in which no one knows what is going on. Confused  people with tears in their eyes do not believe what is  happening. They do not understand that they were handed over to  the chetniks, that they were sold in the name of some, to them,  unknown and incomprehensible policy. What they do understand is  that they are a constant, open target for the chetniks in the  hills, that the chetniks are constantly killing them, that their  murders are at the gate of Gorazde, and that they are facing a  bloody party if they enter the town.    The defenders of Gorazde are investing superhuman efforts to  save the lives of the 60,000 people in this town. Nevertheless,  the situation here is increasingly dramatic. It has become more  dramatic with the total blockade of movement through the town  and with the reinforcement of the chetnik forces on all hills  around the completely surrounded Gorazde.    Life is here no longer counted in hours. Every minute of  life here represents an exceptional gain. Human life here is  the cheapest commodity in the world. If they do not get killed  by bombs, these people face a collective death from starvation  because humanitarian convoys for Gorazde do not exist at all.  The last convoy with food arrived in this town on 22 March this  year.    This is Enes Musovic reporting from the Press Center of the  Gorazde District.</p>

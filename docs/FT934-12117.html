			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Oftel warns over new phone codes COMPANIES and other non-domestic telephone users have less than a year to prepare for a change in national codes that will add an extra digit to all telephone and fax codes from April 1995. Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, warned yesterday that testing of new numbers would begin next June, by when businesses with call barring and other network management facilities ought to have their equipment modified to cope with the new codes. Call barring allows employers to limit the types of calls that can be made. The codes will add the digit '1' to all area codes after the initial '0', with entirely new codes for Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester and Bristol. Oftel yesterday published several guides to assist businesses with the changes. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'Operators, apparatus suppliers and maintainers have a particular responsibility for guiding their customers through the change.' Although the code change takes effect from April 16 1995, there are two key dates for businesses next year. From mid-June, British Telecommunications and other operators will be testing new numbers on their networks, so callers may find new numbers in use. From August, the old and new numbers will both be accepted nationwide. The new international access code '00' will also be operational from August, by when equipment barring international calls needs to be modified. The numbering change is to deal with a shortage of new codes to satisfy the expected rapid growth in telecommunications services.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said here today that there are some "hopeful signs" in  resolving the crisis with the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) on nuclear issue.    "But we have to know what the facts are, and we will be  attempting to determine that," Clinton told NBC program "Today".    Former President Jimmy Carter said in Washington yesterday  he  thought that the crisis with the DPRK is over and there are "no  unanswered questions" following his talks with DPRK leaders on  how to resolve the nuclear crisis.    "If North Korea wishes to talk and is willing to freeze  their  nuclear program," Clinton said, "then that would be a step  forward."    "Now we have to verify that. So that's the question,"  Clinton stressed.    In answering a question, Clinton said that "I think what we  have to do is to look to the present and the future and say we  will evaluate words in terms of actions."    Clinton believed that the United States has the capacity, if  the international inspectors and the monitoring equipment are  going to be left in the DPRK, to evaluate whether the DPRK's  nuclear program has been frozen.</p>

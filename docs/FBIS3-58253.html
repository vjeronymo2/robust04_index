The prime minister found it hard to conceal a certain  irritation at his news conference, preferring to stress the  "excellent" relations and the "convergence of views" between  these "two friendly countries." Admittedly, his office had been  careful to adopt a low profile before his departure for Riyadh  and not to make any reference to a framework accord, speaking  instead of a new "reorientation" of bilateral relations. But  during the flight to Saudi Arabia, Gerard Longuet [foreign trade  minister], Francois Leotard [defense minister], and Alain Juppe  [foreign affairs minister] displayed what proved to be excessive  optimism less than 24 hours later.    Apart from the important diplomatic aspect of the visit, the  only commercial benefit to come out of the prime minister's trip  will have been the confirmation "in principle" by the Saudis to  uphold the three maintenance contracts as planned: the ROH  [expansion unknown] program for frigates purchased in 1980, a  contract concerning pyrotechnics, and a contract relating to the  Shahine self-propelled missile sold by Thomson in 1984. "An  agreement in principle," stressed the prime minister's office,  worth approximately 9 billion French francs [Fr]. It now  remains to finalize the details. The Matignon [prime minister's  office] pointed out that the timetable of work and financial  terms of the contract remained to be settled. A joint committee  of experts will be charged with this task.    By contrast, no precise agreements have been reached  regarding the Sawari-2 program (purchase of three new  antiaircraft frigates, for some Fr20 billion). Nothing either  about the Airbus which Paris wants to sell to Riyadh to renew --  at least in part -- its civil air fleet. "The Airbus is on the  list of matters of common interest," was the prime minister's  sober comment. Nothing yet either on the other potential major  civil contracts, such as the RAMS mobile telephony project  (Thomson-CSF), or the installation of 1 million telephone lines  which Alcatel is hoping for. As to the petroleum deal, it  appears that these are the negotiations which are proceeding the  most slowly. Nevertheless, Paris sees the confirmation of this  week's visit to France by Muhammad Bin-Fahd -- the king's son  and governor of the Western province with its rich oil resources  -- as a positive sign. But how are we to explain what appears  to be a semifailure on the part of French trade diplomacy?  Gerard Longuet believes that "the Saudis do not want to go any  further" for the time being to concentrate on intergovernmental  relations, while the Matignon points out that a factor which  could explain this "slowdown" could quite simply be the economic  problems which Saudi Arabia is now also facing. It is true that  it announced last week a 20-percent cut in expenditure for 1994.  Also, on the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Riyadh, it  asked three of its U.S. arms suppliers to extend payment terms.</p>

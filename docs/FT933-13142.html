			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Greenspan upbeat on US economy: Strong second half forecast by Federal Reserve chairman THE US economy has regained momentum after a disappointing first quarter, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday in a generally upbeat assessment of economic trends. He signalled a potentially important change in the way the central bank assesses monetary conditions by emphasising that increased attention is being paid to the level of real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. Since real short-term rates have been close to zero for a year, many analysts interpreted his remarks as an oblique signal that the Fed is looking for an opportunity to nudge rates higher. Delivering his twice-yearly monetary report to Congress, Mr Greenspan also warned that financial markets would respond negatively and push up long-term interest rates if congressional negotiators failed to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) in deficit reduction over the next five years. Mr Greenspan brushed aside fears that the economic recovery is faltering. 'Smoothing through the quarterly pattern, the economy appears to have accelerated gradually over the past two years.' Gross domestic product appeared to have grown at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the second quarter, a sharp improvement on growth of 0.7 per cent in the first three months. Nearly 1m new jobs had been created since the beginning of the year. But performance on inflation had been disappointing this year. 'Despite disinflationary forces and continued slack, the rate of inflation has at best stabilised, rather than easing further as past relationships would have suggested,' he said. Mr Greenspan said the relationships between money and national income and prices had largely broken down, depriving the monetary aggregates of their usefulness as guides to policy. He announced a reduction in the target for M2, a broad measure of money, to 1-5 per cent this year rather than 2-6 per cent as announced in February. However, this was only a technical adjustment and did not reflect a tightening of policy. Because the money figures were so unreliable, the Fed was putting more emphasis on real interest rates as a monetary guidepost, reflecting their 'key bearing on longer-run spending decisions and inflation prospects'. He said it was important to prevent real rates moving too far from a long-term 'equilibrium rate' - the rate consistent with steady non-inflationary growth. If interest rates were held below this level for too long, bottlenecks and inflationary pressures would be created, eventually leading to another economic contraction. In a strong hint that the next move in short-term rates would be up, Mr Greenspan noted that real short rates had been 'in the neighbourhood of zero' for nine months. Long-term real rates, over which the Fed had little control, were appreciably higher, indicating that financial markets expected a rise in short rates. Mr Greenspan said the Clinton deficit reduction package should be regarded as only a first step toward fiscal consolidation. 'We are going to have to take another shot at the deficit,' he said. He refused to comment on the detail of congressional negotiations but repeated previous warnings that unless action was taken to reduce the rate of spending growth, ever- increasing rates of taxation would be needed to balance the budget. While predicting a stronger second half, Mr Greenspan said the Fed had revised down its forecasts for economic growth since February. The 'central tendency' was now for growth of 2.25-2.5 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993, against a projection of 3-3.25 per cent six months ago. The Clinton administration also recently reduced its growth forecast for 1993 from 3.1 per cent to about 2.5 per cent. The Fed has grown more pessimistic on inflation, following unexpectedly sharp price increases early in the year. The latest forecast is for an increase in the consumer price index of 3-3.25 this year against a projection of 2.5-2.75 in February. For 1994 the Fed is projecting economic growth of 2.5-3.25 per cent and inflation of 3-3.5 per cent. Mr Greenspan said these modest growth rates reflected the impact of structural drags on the economy, such as cuts in defence spending and weak balance sheets after excessive borrowing in the 1980s. However, provided the US got to grips with the budget deficit and challenge of healthcare reform, the US economy would 'eventually emerge healthier and more vibrant than in decades'.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: Retail side back in black at Sears, Roebuck SEARS, Roebuck, the large Chicago-based retail and financial services group, has reported a modest Dollars 16.5m profit at its troubled retail division in the first quarter of 1992. This compares with a Dollars 14.1m loss a year earlier. However, comparisons are still muddied by one-off items. In the merchandise division, which is being overhauled, a Dollars 54.5m after-tax gain from the sale of a minority interest in Sears Mexico more than offset a Dollars 38.5m restructuring charge, largely for severance costs. The retailer also reported that merchandise revenues rose just 3.3 per cent, to Dollars 6.85bn. Domestic store sales improved, it said, but Sears Canada and the catalogue operations decreased. The financial services operations fared better. Allstate, the large insurance group owned by Sears, reported profits of Dollars 261.1m, up 22.2 per cent. Dean Witter, the securities house subsidiary, made profits of Dollars 143.5m, compared with Dollars 78.1m a year ago.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation Rank Organisation provides a telling example of the stark reality of post-devaluation Britain. After Black Wednesday its shares rallied briefly - and arguably without much justification since the company is well hedged against currency movements. Then last week, they resumed a seemingly inexorable decline with a fall of 10 per cent. The drop is all the more eye-catching as the price is now roughly a third below its peak in May. Could there be particular grounds for worry? After all, debt is uncomfortably high at nearly Pounds 1bn and Rank Xerox, over which it has no management control, has been doing badly in Japan. There is a more prosaic, if still depressing explanation. By comparison with other leisure shares Rank is traditionally volatile, but it has paced the sector over the past year as a whole. Progress with its plan to raise between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m by selling its UK hotels is painfully slow. And weak consumer confidence has eaten away at the revenues of its UK holiday business. So capital spending is having to be held down and may even have to be reined in further. It seems unlikely that the company will be able to trade its way into a more comfortable debt position. But Rank is not the only cyclical stock facing similar problems. Devaluation has not made unwanted assets any easier to sell. Nor has it turned out to be a panacea with a magical promise of higher revenues. In Rank's case, there is some consolation in the form of a yield of nearly 8 per cent. Whether that is enough to sustain the shares is another matter.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (16): Keeping down costs - Company Profile / National Power NATIONAL POWER prides itself on having one of the most advanced information technology systems in the country. In computer networking the UK electricity company 'is probably the leader in Europe', according to Mr Paul Miles, the company's IT department services manager. Mobile communication services are used extensively by National Power. But the resources allocated to the services by the IT department are relatively small. Though 350 people work in IT, Mr Miles employs only one person to look after mobile communication services. The company uses four different mobile communication services - on site paging, on site trunked mobile radio, radio-paging and cellular telephones. There are on site paging and trunked mobile radio systems on most of National Power's 400 sites, with an average of 30 to 40 pagers and 25 to 30 trunked mobile phones per site. Both services link into National Power's private telephone network, which connects the 400 sites to the head office in Swindon. National Power has 8,500 staff, of which 1,000 are located at head office in Swindon. Cellular telephones are the company's most expensive item of mobile communications expenditure. National Power's 570 cellular telephones rack up an annual bill of just under Pounds 280,000, divided equally between monthly subscription and call charges. Its 300 radio pagers cost Pounds 60,000 a year in service and rental charges. Mr Miles acknowledges that cellular is an expensive system to use compared to the ordinary network. In National Power's case, the cost to a departmental manager of supplying staff with cellular telephones is particularly high, compared to the fixed telephone network. No internal charge is levied for intra-company calls on the private network and 'it comes as quite a shock for managers to see the size of the cellular telephone bills,' says Mr Miles. Cellular costs are kept down by the extensive use of a Cellnet service called Call Access. This allows National Power cellular telephone uses to make calls to head office or to any of the regional sites at roughly half the normal cellular telephone call rate. To subscribe to Call Access, National Power has had to install a private circuit between its head office in Swindon and a point on the Cellnet network that connects into the BT system. All calls between National Power cellular subscribers and its head office and regional sites pass along the private circuit. Cellnet would normally have to route calls from its radio base station to the interconnection point on the BT network. The speech quality of cellular telephones is 'variable' according to Mr Miles. But National Power works very closely with Cellnet and its service provider British Telecom Mobile Communications to discuss black spots in the system. BTMC and Cellnet are 'very responsive' says Mr Miles, and Cellnet has in the past acted on its recommendations to improve coverage in different regions. National Power has four different accounts for its cellular activities, all of which are held with BTMC. But the four accounts are to be rationalised and the company has asked for new quotes from BTMC and other service providers. Large account holders such as National Power can usually obtain discounts of around 10 per cent from published tariffs on call charges and monthly subscriptions. The majority of National Power's 570 cellular telephones are used by managers in Swindon who spend a lot of time travelling to and from sites, and by what Mr Miles describes as 'technical doers'. A small number - roughly 40 cellular telephones - are used by field service staff. Budgeting for mobile communications services is done on a departmental basis. The job of the IT department is to provide an internal service to internal customers, and it is up to individual managers to decide what services they can afford. All in all, National Power is satisfied with the mobile communications services it uses. New services such as the European digital GSM system and mobile data hold few attractions for the company, according to Mr Miles. 'We do not see digital cellular as a need and the same goes for mobile data.'</p>

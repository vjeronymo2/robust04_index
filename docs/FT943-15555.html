			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Higher costs cut Gold Greenlees to Pounds 3m Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m for the year to April 30, against Pounds 4.3m  -a fall of 29 per cent. The results were in line with a profits warning issued by the group in March, the second time in five months that GGT found itself acting to dampen City expectations which had originally been forecasting profits of about Pounds 6m. Turnover increased by 8 per cent from Pounds 275.4m to Pounds 298.2m, but administrative costs increased by 17 per cent, or 11 per cent at constant exchange rates. Operating profits were down 29 per cent to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 5.84m). Earnings per share were down 44 per cent from 15.63p to 8.77p. A proposed final dividend of 2p makes a total for the year of 5.3p, compared with 8.3p. Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said that much of the increase in revenue had come from new business, rather than higher levels of income from existing clients. This had led to the need for additional resources to service the business before the receipt of the resulting income. 'The disappointing financial performance does not adequately reflect the progress made during the year,' he said, adding that he was 'encouraged by the outlook for the current year'. The group announced that Mr Michael Gold, co-founder and joint chairman with Mr Greenlees, would be leaving at the end of July, having moved with his family to France. Ms Jan Hall, until recently chairman and chief executive of Coley Porter Bell, the design consultancy, will join the board in the newly-created role of chief executive, GGT Europe. Mr Peter Quinnen has been appointed a non-executive director. The shares rose 5p yesterday to close at 182p.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Greens tighten campaign belt THE Green party has launched its local-election campaign on a shoestring budget to promote policies for giving people direct control over councils. Their preparation for the May elections comes amid recognition by members that the party faces a financial crisis. The spring conference in Bridlington yesterday passed an emergency motion giving national officers powers to cut spending in order to reverse a deficit of Pounds 7,500. Such an amount is small by other parties' standards but abhorrent to a party without guarantors, with a falling membership and which rejects spending beyond its means. An emotional debate included an offer to resign by Mr Ron Bailey, national campaigns co ordinator, and accusations of past profligacy. The conference increased membership fees by nearly a third but then agreed to reconsider cuts to campaign budgets. Some 1,400 candidates, a tenth of the party membership, will fight council seats, largely relying on local campaigning. Nationally, the party has set aside Pounds 10,000. A party political broadcast for next week has been made at a cost of Pounds 2,000. Green themes make no concession to the other parties' preoccupation with local taxation. The Greens' alternative is to allow councils to choose from a series of alternative tax schemes. They also want to give voters the right to change councils' agendas and challenge regulations. So far, 200 candidates have agreed to stand on a 'recall' basis - agreeing to recontest their seat at any time if 20 per cent of voters demand a re-run. Party officials reject accusations that their proposals are a recipe for chaos. 'Not consulting and making decisions quickly can actually take longer in the long run - look at the poll tax,' said Mr Mallen Baker, party co-chair. The 22-strong Green party council was given power by the conference to cut, if necessary, the paperwork sent to all members as part of a constitutional obligation to give all members equal say in decision-making. At the weekend, across-the-board cuts were agreed in the party's budget. Members were unanimous in describing the party's predicament as one of crisis proportions, although one, Miss Penny Kemp, of Maidstone, was forced to withdraw her claim that 'the party is bust'. Amid acrimonious debate, there were signs that the dedicated Green activists were relishing their immersion in the Greens' particular style of politics. Mr Andrew Simms, another party speaker, told members proudly: 'I am a convener of a committee of one which has agreed to a cut in its budget to zero. Just shows how consensual we can be.'</p>

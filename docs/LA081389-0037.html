			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BARGAIN CORNER: TRANSPORTATION CARDS FOR AUSTRIA AND GREECE  </P> <P> Greece and Austria have launched discount transportation cards for travelers.  </P> <P> The Greek card, which must be bought in Greece, covers both rail and bus  travel. It is good for 10, 20 or 30 days.  </P> <P> During this consecutive-day time span you get unlimited second-class travel on  the rail system and on the bus network. Passes are available for one to five  persons.  </P> <P> Based on the current value of the dollar, rates for one person are $40 for 10  days, $60 for 20 days and $89 for 30 days. The cost for two, three or four  persons is based on the single rate. For example, the cost of a 10-day pass for  two people would be $80.  </P> <P> For a group of five, however, the cost is $100 for 10 days, $125 for 20 days  and $195 for 30 days.  </P> <P> Overall, the discount off regular rail and bus prices is about 45%, according  to the Greek National Tourist Organization.  </P> <P> Greece also is a member of Eurail, with this pass good for unlimited rail  travel in Greece as well as 16 other European countries. The Eurailpass also  offers various bonuses, including ferry rides to some of the Greek islands.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 West  6th St., Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696.  </P> <P> The Austrian Railway Network has introduced a Rabbit Card that allows travelers  to choose any four days out of a 10-day period for unlimited travel on its  system. The Rabbit Card also is valid for boat trips on Lake St. Wolfgang and  narrow-gauge trains throughout Austria.  </P> <P> The pass also provides a 50% discount for boat trips on Lake Constance, and on  all scheduled boat service on the Danube River within Austria.  </P> <P> The cost of the pass is approximately $99 first-class and $68 second-class.  Until the age of 26 you can get a junior version of the Rabbit Card for $53  first-class and $38 second-class.  </P> <P> The Rabbit Card can't be bought in the United States, but can be at major train  stations and travel agencies in Western Europe. Payment would have to be in the  currency of that country.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Austrian Railways has dropped its nine- and 16-day rail passes that  were on a consecutive-day basis. You can still buy a 30-day pass, allowing  unlimited rail travel within that period, for about $538 first-class and $238  second-class. Austria is also part of the Eurail system.  </P> <P> Contact the Austrian National Tourist Office, 11601 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2480,  Los Angeles 90025-1760, (213) 477-3332. JACK ADLER  </P></p>

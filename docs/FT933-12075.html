			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Italian hauliers debate offer as strike continues A STRIKE by thousands of independent road hauliers in Italy was set to continue today as union leaders consider a government offer unveiled last night. Officials of the Unatras union said the offer comprised about L150bn (Pounds 63m) in tax breaks and an increase of 2 to 3 per cent in state-controlled tariffs. Unatras has demanded L250bn of tax breaks and a 20 per cent rise in tariffs. Mr Raffaele Costa, the transport minister, expressed hope that the strike could soon end as the government yesterday tried to minimise the impact of the first day of a two-week strike, during which queues built up at petrol stations. Some stores claimed supplies of fresh food and vegetables were running low. Mr Michele Sellitti, a junior transport minister, underlined the rights of non-striking drivers to continue working and warned the government might intervene to guarantee supplies if talks with Unatras failed. 'It is unthinkable in a modern law-abiding state to leave big cities without supplies of food or fuel for a fortnight,' Mr Sellitti said. The signs of flexibility on the part of the government reflected by last night's offer contrasted with a clear determination by ministers not to let the striking hauliers gain the upper hand. Government officials took pains to point out that many petrol stations would continue to be supplied normally, as many big oil companies had their own tanker fleets. Some fuel tankers were escorted by police yesterday. Officials from non-striking transport unions noted that Unatras drivers represented only about 30 per cent of Italy's road hauliers. Up to 60 per cent of petrol is distributed by either non-striking unions or by the oil companies' own fleets, according to one estimate. However, panic buying by motorists or the possibility of blockades of fuel depots by striking hauliers means there is still a risk of some petrol stations running dry. The government and non-striking hauliers are also concerned that striking drivers might obstruct highways and frontier crossings if they believe the strike is not having enough effect.</p>

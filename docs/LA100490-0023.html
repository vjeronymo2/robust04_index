			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A LESSON IN GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Will the persons responsible for the graffiti on the Hollywood, Ventura and San  Diego freeways please stop.  </P> <P> Freeway driving is ugly enough. I do not need you to make it more unpleasant.  </P> <P> And will the department in charge of removing graffiti from public areas please  do so. I have had to look at this filth for too long.  </P> <P> And will the parents of these individuals, since you have failed in raising  these hoodlums, at least teach them to spell. "The" is not spelled t-h-a.  </P> <P> STAN SELLERS  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zou Peiyan (6760 3099 7346)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Drawn up on the basis of  the "International Health Regulations," our Frontier Health  Quarantine Law symbolizes a move to embody China's health  quarantine work in law. After eight years of enforcing the  Frontier Health Quarantine Law, China's health quarantine has  gradually moved closer to converging with international practice.    As health quarantine is an important element of our  preventive medical science, China has all along attached  importance to strengthening legal provisions for health  quarantine undertakings. The "Provisional Procedures for  Transportation Quarantine" and the "Provisional Procedures for  Civil Aviation Quarantine" were promulgated during the early  days of our People's Republic; the "PRC Frontier Health  Quarantine Regulations" were promulgated in 1957; China  recognized the "International Health Regulations" in 1979; the  "Health Supervision Procedures for Frontier Ports" were  promulgated in 1981; the "PRC Frontier Health Quarantine Law"  was promulgated in 1986; and the State Council approved the  rules for implementation of the Frontier Health Quarantine Law  in 1989. All these have made our health quarantine laws and  regulations system increasingly complete. The quarantine law's  implementation has played an important role in safeguarding the  people's health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.    As the country is now in a period of transition from the old  to the new system, our health quarantine work also extends from  quarantine examination to international travel medicine, disease  and health control at ports, and hygienic supervision of  imported foodstuffs. As the task of health quarantine becomes  increasingly demanding, there are many new problems in both  legislation and law enforcement that need to be studied and  inquired into. A Frontier Health Quarantine Law Society was set  up recently to enable our health quarantine law enforcement  personnel to carry out theoretical study and inquiry into the  Frontier Health Quarantine Law aside from fully enforcing it in  practice, thus upgrading the law enforcement standard. The  society will actively carry out theoretical studies and academic  exchanges on health quarantine laws and regulations of different  countries and analyze typical cases to provide a basis of  reference for problems encountered by health quarantine  personnel in law enforcement practice and to promote legal  studies on health quarantine.    It has been learned that this year the State Health  Quarantine Agency is also sponsoring, with Jilin University, a  Master of Law course, which won the praise of Wu Jieping, vice  chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.  He believes it is really meaningful for health quarantine  organs, being law enforcement departments, to train  transcentenary qualified personnel for health quarantine law  enforcement to upgrade health quarantine law enforcement and  promote legal construction in our health quarantine. He said it  will leave a glorious page in our health quarantine history.</p>

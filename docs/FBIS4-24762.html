			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Special article' by staff reporter Liu Chun (0491 5028) </F> from Shanghai: "Why Has Clinton Changed Policies Toward China?"]    [Text] When interviewed by this paper the other day, Ding  Xinhao, a Chinese expert on international relations,  systematically analyzed and expounded on the causes and effects  of the decision made by the Clinton administration to  unconditionally renew China's MFN status. Ding Xinhua,  president of the Shanghai U.S. Studies Society, Shanghai  International Research Institute research fellow, and Shanghai  U.S. Studies Office director, also provided some background  material for reference. Ding Xinhao had just attended the  "International Symposium on Economic Sanctions" in the United  States.  <H5>  Big Differences Within the Clinton Administration </H5>   Ding Xinhao said: According to an executive order signed by  President Clinton on 28 May, 1993, the U.S. President has to  announce his decision on whether to renew China's MFN status  before 3 June 1994. As there were two antagonistic views, one  favoring economic interests, the other favoring political  interests, in the country and major differences of opinion  within the administration, the President was caught in an  embarrassing dilemma.    Within the Clinton administration, nearly all of the  officials in charge of economic affairs opposed applying  sanctions against China, including Treasury Secretary Bentsen,  Commerce Secretary Brown, the president's representative for  trade negotiations, and some others. They greatly differed in  opinion from Clinton's China policymakers. The U.S. officials  insisting on sanctions against China were Secretary of State  Christopher; National Security Adviser Lake; Suterbo [suo te bo  4792 3676 0130], national security committee executive chairman;  and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord.    As the two opposing factions had great influence over his  China policy, Clinton had no choice but to reconsider his  position on the MFN issue. Ding Xinhao noted that, since coming  into office, Clinton has adhered to three foreign policy  principles, specifically, revitalizing the U.S. economy,  maintaining a certain military strength, and implementing  democracy in the world. On the premise of differences of  opinion within the administration, Clinton began comprehensively  reevaluating U.S. interests. In the end, he decided to  unconditionally renew China's MFN status with a view to  "revitalizing the U.S. economy."    On the other hand, while Clinton was caught in this dilemma,  the Chinese Government, without compromising its basic  principles, adopted a positive approach toward the human rights  issue, thus giving Clinton an honorable way out.  <H5>  Why the China Policy Had To Be Changed </H5>   The executive order signed on 28 May 1993 exposed several  flaws in the Clinton administration's China policy. The  executive order, a product of compromise between the President  and the Congress, stated: China's MFN status can be renewed  with no strings attached for the year 1993. However, China's  MFN status will only be renewed for the year 1994 on condition  that China has met seven "human rights" conditions by that time.  These unrealistic "human rights" conditions placed Clinton in a  "vicious circle": To lose "face" by renewing China's MFN status  or to cause a retrogression in Sino-U.S. relations and make  China and the United States suffer in respect of economic and  trade growth by revoking China's MFN status. All these problems  were actually the result of a very confused China policy.    The "WASHINGTON POST" published on 5 May of this year a  letter written by Winston Lord to Secretary of State  Christopher. Both Winston Lord and Christopher are Clinton's  Asia policymakers. In the letter, Winston Lord complained about  Clinton's unsuccessful Asia policy as well as the confusion in  the Asia policy prevalent at that time. The letter fully  exposed the differences and policy confusion among the  administration's Asia policymakers.    The decision made yesterday by Clinton to unconditionally  renew China's MFN status and delink the MFN issue from human  rights was unmistakably a sign of an impending end to the  administration's confusion about its China policy. No sooner is  the MFN issue resolved than it is time for Clinton to  comprehensively and realistically evaluate his China policy.  <H5>  How Should the Human Rights Issue and MFN Be Delinked? </H5>   Why did Clinton announce yesterday that the human rights  issue will be delinked from the MFN issue?    Ding Xinhao made the following two points, believing that  Clinton had no choice but to reach this conclusion.    First, historical facts have borne out that applying  sanctions against China by revoking China's MFN status to attain  a certain political goal will never work. In the Cold War  years, the United States imposed an "embargo" on the socialist  countries to no avail. The embargo on grain shipments to the  Soviet Union in 1980 failed to prevent the Soviet Union from  sending troops into Afghanistan. Since the end of the Cold War,  tremendous changes have taken place in the world. It has now  become even more impossible to attain political goals through  economic sanctions. The economic sanctions that the United  States has imposed against certain small countries have only  resulted in the loss of those countries' markets for the U.S.  "allies" and have not achieved any benefit for the United  States. As the economic sanctions applied against those small  countries have failed, how could they succeed when applied to a  country as large as China?    Second, the practice of unilaterally linking human rights  with economic issues and imposing sanctions against China is  bound to make both sides suffer. According to a World Bank  report, should the United States decide to revoke China's MFN  status on the basis of human rights concerns, China would no  doubt retaliate against it, thereby resulting in a disaster for  both China and the United States. As a result, China's exports  to the United States would drop by 42-96 percent, while the U.S.  consumers would have to pay an additional $14.6 billion to find  substitutes for the lost Chinese commodities. Moreover, China  is expected to import commodities worth $700-1,000 billion over  the next seven years, and the U.S. economy would certainly lose  this opportunity. In 1993, China-bound U.S. exports, which were  valued at $8.8 billion, created a total of 168,000 jobs in the  United States. Should the United States impose sanctions on  China, these jobs would certainly be lost.    On the basis of these considerations, Clinton in the end  decided to adopt a positive approach in order to avert possible  losses.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man suspected in 15 bank robberies in San Diego County was arrested Monday  after he tried to rob an Orange County bank, San Diego police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Eric Raymond Martin, 22, of La Mesa, allegedly tried to rob a Tustin bank  Monday, but was arrested after a plainclothes detective followed him, said Bill  Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman.  </P> <P> Police have dubbed the robberies the "kangaroo bank robbery series" because the  robber put the money in a pouch-like zippered bag at his waist, Robinson said.  The robberies were committed between Jan. 27 and April 25, in areas from  Coronado to Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Martin also is suspected of committing four Los Angeles robberies, Robinson  said.  </P></p>

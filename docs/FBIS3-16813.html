			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Baltic Business Weekly" feature] </F>   [Text] The Estonian Cabinet approved March 17 a bill on  increasing the fuel excise tax rates up to two times from the  present. The draft now enters the parliament.    The draft legislation proposes raising the excise tax on  gasoline from the present 0.40 kroons per liter to 0.80 kroons  for ordinary gasoline, and to 0.60 kroons for gasoline  containing less than 0.013 grams of lead per liter.    Introduction of different rates is aimed at encouraging car  owners to use fuel less detrimental to the environment.    The excise tax on diesel fuel is to be hiked from the  current  0.25 kroons to 0.50 kroons per liter. Rates for aircraft fuel,  liquid gas and lubricants are to remain the same.    The government has said the step is mainly due to the need  to  earn an estimated additional 21.8 million kroons into the state  coffers to pay higher pensions from April.    A representative at the Finance Ministry said the Estonian  Oil Association, a body connecting the country's fuel companies,  had agreed to the motion.    The Oil Association's managing director, Mart Kutsar, told  BNS his association had not approved of the planned step. But  he also said in an interview with the ARIPAEV business newspaper  that despite not approving of the step the association still  understood that the hike was inevitable.</p>

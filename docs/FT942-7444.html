			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disaster costs hit Japan's leading non-life insurers Japan's leading non-life insurance companies posted weaker profits for the year to last March due to increased disaster payouts and a decline in interest income. Pre-tax profits fell for the leading three companies - Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance. However, Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, and Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance posted increases due to profits from asset sales. The five companies' total net premium income, the equivalent of sales at other companies, rose 5.5 per cent to Y3,540bn (Dollars 33.9bn). Premiums from voluntary motor insurance rose sharply, but income from compulsory motor insurance premiums declined. Disaster payouts rose due to the increased typhoons and heavy rains last year. Tokio paid out Y648.3bn in claims, up 4.9 per cent on a year earlier, while Yasuda's overall payment rose 4.6 per cent to Y457.5bn. The insurers said the total balance of bad loans - loans to which borrowers have not paid interest over six months, and those extended to bankrupt companies - fell by 11 per cent from the previous year to Y50.5bn. Yasuda had the highest level of problem loans at Y18.8bn, but 24 per cent lower than a year earlier, and the highest percentage of bad loans to outstanding total loans at 2.1 per cent. Tokio reported a 33 per cent rise in its bad loan balance to Y15.0bn, the second biggest following Yasuda. For the full year to next March, the companies, except Sumitomo, expect a rise in pre-tax profits. Tokio predicts a 1.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y78bn, while Yasuda expects its pre-tax earnings to rise 3.2 per cent to Y34bn.  --------------------------------------------------------------                Japanese non-life insurers (Y bn)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Company           Premium   Change   Pre-tax   Change                    income      (%)    profit      (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Tokio             1,190.0      4.8      76.7     -8.5 Yasuda              852.1      6.0      33.0    -11.0 Mitsui              583.1      6.3      23.2    -18.6 Sumitomo            501.9      7.1      30.6      4.1 Nippon              409.2      3.6      19.0      1.7  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liesl Graz, Berne: "Offshore Landing Dodges Arms </F> Rules"]    [Text] A Swiss aircraft company is planning to move  production to the Isle of Wight to take advantage of laxer  British rules on arms exports.    Pilatus Aircraft, a subsidiary of Oerlikon-Buhrle, best  known  for its sophisticated weapons systems, currently manufactures  its Pilatus PC-7 and PC-9 aircraft in Stans, near Lucerne.    The planes, originally developed for training, have been  widely sold to countries such as Guatemala, Burma, Iraq, Iran  and El Salvador. Swiss law prohibits military sales to `areas of  conflict.'    Pilatus has long claimed that its planes are not military  equipment and that, if armies buy them for training, that is not  the same as buying them for killing. But the Defence Ministry,  which decides when export licences may be granted, is  interpreting the rules more narrowly.    The planes leave the factory equipped for training, but  sometimes acquire gun points by the time they reach their  destination. The Pilatus works and Oerlikon insist that they can  do nothing about what happens to their products at stop-overs.  At least one company in Belgium openly offers gun-ready  conversion services.    Officially, the company says the reason for its move to  Britain is `mostly money.' But the subtext is that the European  Union in general, and Britain in particular, look more  hospitable as export bases.    Pilatus will not say when the production transfer will take  place and a spokesman said last week that no jobs would be lost  in Stans, so aircraft for crop-dusting or training may be built  there, while more problematic buyers are served from Britain.    The Pilatus works are named after a nearby mountain which  commemorates a legend that a Roman, first name Pontius and known  for washing his hands of responsibility, wound up there in his  old age.</p>

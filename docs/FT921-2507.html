			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Maunders declines to Pounds 2.19m JOHN MAUNDERS Group, the Manchester-based housebuilder, unveiled a relatively resilient performance in the six months to end-December. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.19m, against Pounds 2.56m in the corresponding half of 1990. Mr John Maunders, chairman, said that trading conditions would remain 'extremely difficult' until political uncertainty was resolved and purchaser confidence returned. Interest charges fell to Pounds 920,000 (Pounds 1.43m). Gearing at December 31 was about 22 per cent, although this will rise in the second half when most of the group's land purchases are made. Although the period saw more completions - 405 against 371  - turnover declined 8 per cent to Pounds 26.8m partly reflecting discounted selling prices. The average price dropped from Pounds 78,740 to Pounds 66,260. Earnings dipped to 5.97p (6.84p) per 20p share; the interim dividend is maintained at 2.3p.</p>

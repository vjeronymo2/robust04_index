			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: AMI PRESIDENT RESIGNS  </P> <P> Gene E. Burleson has resigned from the posts of president and chief operating  officer at American Medical International, positions eliminated as part of a  management reorganization engineered by the company's new chairman, Richard  Gilleland.  </P> <P> Gilleland, installed as chairman and chief executive of the Beverly Hills-based  hospital chain in January, will assume Burleson's duties. Gilleland said the  position was no longer necessary because he will now work directly with the  managers who had been reporting to Burleson.  </P> <P> "Mr. Burleson's departure is part of a management restructuring designed to  streamline AMI's executive ranks and eliminate redundant positions," Gilleland  said.  </P> <P> Burleson was not available for comment.  </P> <P> Burleson, 48, was named chief operating officer of AMI in June, 1986, and  selected president in January, 1988. He served as chief executive and managing  director of the company's United Kingdom operations from 1981 to 1986. GEORGE  WHITE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commemorative services on the East Rand, Soweto, and  the Western and Eastern Cape to commemorate the assassination of  Mr. Chris Hani a year ago, have ended peacefully, but in  Pietermaritzburg a rally had to be canceled when about 600  people threatened to disrupt the activities.    Thousands of people packed the Orlando Stadium in Soweto  where they were addressed by Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Hani's  widow, Limpo. The rally was preceded by talks between the ANC  and the police after the ANC had received reports of plans to  disrupt the meeting. Rallies on the East Rand were initially  prohibited in terms of emergency regulations but went ahead  after talks with the police.    Members of the National Peace-keeping Force were deployed on  the East Rand for the first time to monitor the rallies. REUTER  reports that troops barred 50 armed right wingers from laying  wreaths on graves of whites at the Elspark Cemetery in Boksburg,  where Mr. Hani's family gathered.</p>

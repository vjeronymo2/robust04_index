			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Late leap for pound THE POUND jumped almost a pfennig against the D-Mark and more than a cent against the dollar in late London trading. The surprise leap was prompted mainly by technical factors. Investors in D-Marks and dollars sold both of these currencies for sterling as the exchange rates hit stop-loss levels. Analysts were reluctant to attribute the rise to a reappraisal of fundamental sentiment towards sterling. 'I would love to say that this is a reappraisal of the pound, but it is really a technical forward move,' said Mr Marc Hendrix of Swiss Bank. As a result, many analysts expect the pound to open weaker on Monday. It closed last night at DM2.4550, up  3/4 of pfennig on the day. Against the dollar it was a cent stronger at Dollars 1.5055. Many dealers remain perplexed over the recent weakness of the pound. Concerns appear to revolve around rather hazy political concerns and prospects for a rate cut before the end of the year. Yesterday there were some jitters following a rumour that extracts from Lady Thatcher's memoirs in the Sunday newspapers would severely criticise Mr John Major, the current prime minister. But as one analysts said: 'I don't find any of that particularly conclusive.' The dollar lost a pfennig off the day's gains after US data did not live up to expectations. Much of the data fell short of economists' forecasts and dashed hopes that the market would finally receive signs of solid US economic activity. The dollar closed at DM1.6310 compared with the previous day's close of DM1.6365. During the day it tested DM1.6430 ahead of the release of the figures. The Belgian National Bank responded to market rumours that Belgium was allowing the franc to slip against the D-Mark by saying that there was 'no question' of changing central bank policy. 'There is no change at all in the policy of the bank. There is no question of letting the Belgian franc float,' said the bank. It cut its key central rate on Thursday by 10 basis points to 9.65 per cent from 9.75 per cent, surprising financial markets because the franc had weakened against the D-Mark. The comments were widely interpreted as a response to rumours that Luxembourg wants to break its link with the Belgian currency. The Luxembourg authorities are worried that soft monetary policy in Belgium will bring down the Luxembourg franc, something they cannot allow as much of their income depends on foreign investments.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Election deadlock break seen - Poll Tax THE POLL TAX would 'break the election deadlock in Labour's favour', Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, claimed yesterday as the party published a survey of the provisional poll tax levels of 40 councils. Mr Gould said the figures showed poll tax bills would damage the government during a campaign, and repeated his claim that Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, was planning a 'Budget bail-out' to ensure that poll tax bills were delayed until after the election. Mr Heseltine has ruled out a 'Budget fix' for the poll tax. The highest percentage increase in the 40 councils that have proposed tax levels for the coming year is in Tory-controlled Ashford in Kent, where the poll tax would rise from Pounds 176 to Pounds 244. Labour-controlled Oxford plans to cut its poll tax from Pounds 344 to Pounds 311. Highlighting the 17.3 per cent average increase for Tory councils against the 6.5 per cent for Labour councils, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said the figures exposed the government myth that Labour councils would force up bills. Most of the 40 councils are shire districts, many of which had scope for increasing spending without being capped. Sixteen of the proposed poll tax levels were lower than the government's target of Pounds 257, but six of these included rises of more than 20 per cent. When figures for the larger, metropolitan councils are set the pattern is likely to be of lower percentage increases on higher cash figures. Labour-controlled Birmingham yesterday set its poll tax rate for the coming year at Pounds 295 - Pounds 29 higher than now. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said Labour had produced nothing to alter the government's contention that average charges would be close to the target. 'This thin attempt by Labour to give respectability to its high-spending irresponsible councils smacks of desperation.' A 25 per cent discount on council-tax bills was announced yesterday by the government for households where a disabled person lives with a full-time carer who is not a spouse or parent. The move was welcomed in the Lords, where the legislation on the tax is being examined.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRITNY FOX: A HIGH-VOLTAGE ROCK GROUP WITH A KISS OF METAL  </P> <P> Philadelphia's Britny Fox may look like your average heavy metal band, but the  quartet has more on its mind than the usual heavy metal themes.  </P> <P> "We are more hard rock than heavy metal," lead guitarist Michael Kelly Smith  said during a recent telephone interview. "You can hear a lot of influences  from AC-DC and Kiss, but we have developed our own style."  </P> <P> The group's self-titled first release contains messages about helping out your  fellow man -- unusual for hard rock -- but Smith is quick to point out that the  band is not ready for the pulpit.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to preach anything. If you read the lyrics, we have a  message," Smith said, "but we don't base ourselves on that type of thing. We  aren't trying to tell you what to do or what not to do.  </P> <P> "The song 'Save the Weak' is saying to take a look around you and realize how  good you might have it because a lot of people are less fortunate than us.  Appreciate what you have," he explained.  </P> <P> Another song, "Rock Revolution," deals with censorship in rock and pop music, a  subject that Smith holds a hard line against. "That ("Rock Revolution") is  about the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) and how stupid it is," Smith  said. "Hard-rock bands always get the bad rap. They (the PMRC) act as though  that is the worst thing going on in the world. It's OK to put violence on TV,  but you can't have explicit lyrics. . . . "  </P> <P> Despite its recent success, Britny Fox has also had its share of tragedy.  </P> <P> When the band first formed, its members figured its lineup was set with Dean  Davidson on vocals and rhythm guitar, Billy Childs on bass and former  Cinderella members Smith on lead guitar and Tony Destra on the drums. But  Destra was killed in an automobile accident.  </P> <P> "It was a big blow and a real setback, but we wanted to carry on for his sake,"  Smith said. "He wouldn't have wanted us to quit. Things were going good, we had  record company interests. We went too far to quit." The band pressed on and  replaced Destra with Johnny Dee.  </P> <P> Smith said that Britny Fox, which derives its name from Davidson's 18th-Century  ancestry, has plans for a new album: "We plan on going into the studio this  summer. The record should be out by the fall or the end of the year. We have  songs left over from the last album's sessions, plus we've been working on  material since then."  </P></p>

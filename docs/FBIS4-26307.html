			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The Qiandao [Chien-tao]  Lake incident has not been cleared up and justice not served  even though Mainland Chinese authorities on Sunday executed the  three men convicted in the killings of 32 people, including 24  Taiwan tourists, at the scenic lake in Zhejiang Province in  southeastern China on March 31, a mainland affairs official said  Monday [20 June].    Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,  criticized the mainland's handling of the case, calling it  "improper." He said many suspicious aspects about the case have  not been resolved.    A news release issued by the mainland's Hangzhou  Intermediate  People's Court said Wu Lihong, Yu Aijun and Hu Zhihan, who were  convicted last week for robbing and setting fire to the tourists  and crewmen, were executed at 10:30 A.M. Sunday.    The intermediate court sentenced the trio to death for  robbery and murder on June 12. The Hangzhou High Court approved  the death sentences Saturday.    Many family members of the Taiwan tourists killed in the  disaster insisted that the crimes could not have been committed  by only three people, adding that the case is not likely to ever  be resolved now that the three men have been executed.</p>

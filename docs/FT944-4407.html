			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bowater sniffs profit in Pounds 66m perfume pump deal Bowater, the printing, packaging and coatings company, yesterday announced the Pounds 66m cash acquisition of a French pumps manufacturer. The company is buying SOFAB - the world's leading manufacturer of the miniature pumps and valves used in luxury perfumes - from Bic, the ballpoint pens maker. The acquisition comes just a month after Bowater announced it was leaving the paper business with a deal to sell its Australian tissue and other interests for Pounds 158m. After last month's sale and yesterday's purchase are completed, Bowater is expected to have gearing of about 33 per cent. Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said SOFAB would complement the existing haircare pumps business. It would be managed as a separate business within Bowater's beautypackaging operations. He said it also offered substantial growth opportunities, with the market for SOFAB's products growing at an estimated 20 per cent a year. Mr Lyon said the fragrance market was growing rapidly because customers were buying perfume in smaller packages and using more varieties for different occasions. Last year, SOFAB's achieved operating profits of FFr43.8m (Pounds 5.2m) on sales of FFr171m. Net assets before debt were FFr113m. Mr Lyon said the purchase was not expected to be dilutive.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Sport: Modern sailor goes for gold - Olympic Sailing NO sportsman hates anything more than the 'leather medal'. Fourth] So near, yet so far that when the anthems play and the photographers surround the rostrum one might as well have been 31st. Finn sailor Stuart Childerley travels to Barcelona having got that particular experience out of his system. At Seoul he was 22 and the youngest Finn class sailor ever to represent Britain. Fancied for gold he struggled to make fourth. 'It was like doing a bellyflop after a series of perfect dives,' mused Childerley, just back from Gdansk where he completed his Olympic preparations by taking the class European championship. 'It took me a long time to get over it and even longer to make another Olympic commitment.' What makes this solid, powerful young man particularly interesting is that he is almost the prototype of the modern professional sailor. He has done nothing since leaving school but sail, carefully seeking spots on boats that will broaden his experience. Many dinghy sailors rely on technical knowledge of rig and sails but Childerley sees the problems much more in terms of bringing different inputs to a campaign. Revealingly, when the lavishly-funded Wings of Oracle campaign for the 1991 Admirals Cup began to founder, the panicking sponsor turned to Childerley to skipper a yacht where an RAF crew were mutinying against civilian leadership. The safe choice, would have been someone of Harold Cudmore's generation but Childerley's calm leadership was exemplary. He made few enemies in a situation fraught with anger and thwarted ambition. Superficially, the Olympics looks a quite different proposition. Childerley is, for a start, sailing in the male single- handed class. The Finn, designed in 1950 for the 1952 Helsinki games, has a large sail area and a relatively heavy hull calling for strength, stamina and plenty of individual determination. Childerley went to Seoul as he went on the water, virtually a one-man band. 'Psychologic- ally all my effort went into qualifying and winning the pre-Olympic regatta,' he reflects. 'I thought I'd wrapped it all up before I even got to Korea.' When things began to unravel - beginning with the destruction of his masts by a fork-lift truck at the airport - he was short of wise counsel. 'This time I've put together much more of a group of people - a Finn team - with Stuart simply driving the boat. It takes a lot of the pressure off me,' Childerley explains. Among the group is veteran sailor John Boyce, an amiable middle-aged mainsheet man who has taken time off from his business to travel to European regattas with Childerley this year. 'Going round Europe with a kitbag can be pretty lonely and John is someone who's technically capable of coaching me and whose company I enjoy,' the helmsman commented. Australian sailmaker John Welch plays a similar role in the team, re-cutting and tuning the Finn sails at Childerley's key regattas. He likens it to the team behind a Formula One car. The spotlight is on the driver but dozens of people beaver away in the background. F1 is hugely expensive and needs massive sponsorship to pay its costs. Childerley is no stranger to that arena either. His campaign is sponsored by PowerGen and Owners Abroad (the holiday group), with a raft of smaller corporate supporters. So keen is Childerley to support his sponsors that he is paying a PR company to look after their interests. 'With so many people trying to grab a piece of the action I feel it's vital to ensure that a sponsor gets a proper return and is as fully-briefed as possible,' he commented. Finn sailing is probably the most physically demanding sport on the water. The helmsman must be strong enough to lean out from the boat and support his weight on thigh and stomach muscles throughout a two-hour race. The low freeboard means that he is waveswept for much of the time. At the same time he must have a strong tactical grasp of the race going on around him - with no crew to bounce ideas off. Small wonder that most of the top America's Cup and Whitbread race skippers of the past decade have had Finn experience. Although he is too discreet to say so, it is a reasonable to assume that Childerley's plan is to take the gold medal at Barcelona and use the victory as a platform from which to stand centre-stage in British yachting for the next 20 years. All the pieces are in place. Now it is up to him. 'I've put everything I've learned in the last eight years on this one regatta,' he said. 'But it's an investment not a gamble.'</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 23 February  publishes a front-page 300-word unattributed article in which it  claims that it has obtained a copy of a letter sent to Libyan  Leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by Abu-Nidal (Sabri al-Banna),  leader of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council. The paper says that  this "secret letter" shows that Abu-Nidal wants to return to the  lap of Tripoli.    The paper also publishes a photocopy of the letter, which is  dated 22 December 1993. The following is the text of the letter:    "Brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September  revolution, may God preserve you.    "Sincere Arab greetings,    "O great Arab leader, I send you my sincerest Arab good  wishes and through you to the struggling and mujahid Libyan  masses, which today are rallying around you to express their  unity and reaffirm their choice and affiliation.    "Your voice which reverberated among the Bani Salim masses  on  28 jumada al-thani 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 12 December  1993, has been the best expression of the nation's will and its  right to life and proof of existence.    "Brother leader of the 1 September revolution,    "The Arab nation's masses have heard your powerful voice  with  awareness and heard you reaffirming the unity of its causes and  defending them as an integrated whole, even if some rulers do  not want that. The Palestinian popular revolution is looking  toward you and the stone-throwing children are listening to you  attentively. Your reverberating voice comes when the Arab  revolution's forces, both Arabists and Islamists, are looking  toward Arab Tripoli which is subjected to the ugliest form of  blockade by the Western American circles and their tools. Your  voice has reaffirmed the originality of the 1 September  revolution and the credibility of its leader in order to silence  those of the fifth column and the tools of doubt, treachery, and  plotting.    "Brother leader of the revolution,    "It pleases me to reiterate to you, given my position as a  fighting soldier affiliated to the nation's pan-Arab revolution  and in order to defend the nation's causes, that my comrades and  I will always be sincere and faithful soldiers in defense of any  part of the greater Arab homeland.    "To You, the leader, we send the fragrance of Palestine and  the greetings of its children with best and sincerest regards.    "Revolution until victory.    ""[Signed] Your brother, Abu-Nidal"</p>

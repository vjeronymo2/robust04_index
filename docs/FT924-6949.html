The car will be named Xantia, a break from the recent Citroen practice of naming cars with letters such as AX and ZX. It will follow French rival Renault, which has also switched to names such as Clio and Safrane. The Xantia, pictured, was styled in collaboration with Bertone, the Italian design house.</p>

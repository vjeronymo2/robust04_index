			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPER SKID CUT DOWN TO SIGHS;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES' LOSING STREAK ENDS AT SEVEN WITH A 103-99 VICTORY  OVER SEATTLE.  </P> <P> Forward Charles Smith of the Clippers let out a sigh of relief after the  Clippers' losing streak ended at seven games with a 103-99 victory over the  Seattle SuperSonics Tuesday night at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Smith scored 23 points as the Clippers won their first game since Feb. 8, when  they defeated the Washington Bullets, 105-103.  </P> <P> "It was tough to break out of the losing streak with all the various things  going on as far as different players coming in and out of here and all the  transition we made," Smith said.  </P> <P> The Clippers (22-33), who exceeded their victory total for last season, looked  strong in the second half.  </P> <P> After a dismal first half during which they fell behind by as many as 16  points, the Clippers made 12 of 14 shots and outscored Seattle, 31-21, in the  third quarter to get back into the game.  </P> <P> "It's good to get this streak broken," Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "In the  second half the team rose to the occasion."  </P> <P> With the score tied at 95, center Benoit Benjamin made a free throw with 3:41  left and, after a steal by guard Tom Garrick, set up Danny Manning for a layup  with a nice pass. The Clippers kept the lead.  </P> <P> "Ben played well at a time when we needed it most," Casey said.  </P> <P> Guard Winston Garland helped to key the comeback, scoring six of his 16 points  in the final quarter. Leading 101-97, Garland made two free throws with 7.7  seconds left to seal the win.  </P> <P> Garland also did a good job of playing defense on Seattle guard Dana Barros,  who had a career-high 26 points, limiting him to seven points in the second  half.  </P> <P> "Whenever you stop someone or shut them down, you cannot credit one guy,"  Garland said. "It's the whole team that helps you out defensively.  </P> <P> The game marked the return of guard Quintin Dailey, who played for the Clippers  from 1986 until last season.  </P> <P> Does Dailey hold a a grudge against the Clippers, who failed to pick up his  option after last season?  </P> <P> "Why should I?" Dailey said. . "It's over. I'm trying to stay with this team.  I'm not going to make it a big thing."  </P> <P> Averaging 12.2 points since he was signed by Seattle, Dailey scored 21 points  off the bench, including 15 in the second half.  </P> <P> "Quintin has been playing exceptionally well," said SuperSonic forward Michael  Cage, a former Clipper. "He came in and made an impact right away. He adds an  element that has been missing from our team, crunch scoring."  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> The Clippers signed guard Steve Harris to a 10-day contract. Harris replaces  Jim Les, who was waived on Monday. Harris, 6 feet 5, averaged 25.5 points for  the Columbus Horizon of the Continental Basketball Assn. this season. The  Houston Rockets' first round draft pick in 1985, Harris has played for the  Rockets, Golden State Warriors and Detroit Pistons. "I'm just going to come and  work hard and help the Clippers in any way I can," Harris said. . . . With the  addition of Harris, will Ken Norman be able to move back to small forward, his  natural position? "That's not the underlying plan," said Coach Don Casey. . . .  Clipper guard Gary Grant, who broke his left ankle on Feb. 2., said he's making  progress. "It feels like I can go right now, but I know I can't," Grant said.  </P></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: DTI leaves it late in the day Eleventh-hour changes by the Department of Trade and Industry to UK commercial agency rules designed to bring them into line with the rest of the European Union from January 1, provoked widespread criticism from British companies. UK companies which had been advised to sack their commercial agents and renegotiate their agency agreements or incur a cost of between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 80,000 for each cancellation after January 1, were given just 10 days to make the necessary adjustments. Their anger is understandable given that the EU directive on commercial agents was adopted seven years ago and the DTI first consulted British companies on its implementation back in 1987. But as the furore dies down it appears the impact of the changes may not be as great as first feared, particularly in relation to the method chosen by companies for compensating sacked agents. Those companies which renegotiated their agreements on the basis of the June draft of UK regulations may find they have made the right choice after all. The UK draft regulations are designed to give self-employed commercial agents greater protection, making it harder for companies to terminate agreements and guaranteeing agents compensation if sacked. The regulations provide that compensation should be paid for damage suffered by an agent as a result of the termination of an agreement. But after industry complaints that the clause left companies open to the possibility of paying unlimited damages, the government made a last-minute change to allow businesses to cap compensation. Instead of paying damages companies can agree to indemnify the agent for a sum equivalent to a maximum of one year's commission. The change has been welcomed by companies because of the greater flexibility it affords in negotiating new agreements. But many lawyers believe in most cases companies would be better off paying compensation rather than indemnifying the agent. According to City solicitors Baker &amp; McKenzie, any attempt to fix the indemnity at less than one year's compensation would be open to review by the English courts on the grounds that it does not adequately indemnify the agent as the UK regulations require. Companies should therefore be prepared to pay up to a year's commission before opting for an indemnity. In addition, choosing the indemnity option would not prevent an agent from seeking damages. Where the termination of an agreement amounts to a breach of contract by the company the agent may be able to recover damages on top of an indemnity. By contrast any compensation paid to an agent must be linked to actual damage. Damage will be deemed to have occurred where the agent is deprived of commission to which he is entitled for services rendered under the terms of the contract, and the company has received big benefits from the agent's activities; and where the agent has not been able to depreciate his costs and expenses. According to Baker &amp; McKenzie, in cases where a company allows a fixed-term agency agreement to expire without renewal or even where the company terminates the contract in accordance with its terms, compensation should only be payable if the agent has undepreciated costs and expenses. Baker &amp; McKenzie says careful drafting of an agreement should ensure that an agent is obliged to depreciate his costs early on, and prevent him from incurring further expenditure. The compensation payable by companies following termination of an agreement should, therefore, be minimal and certainly less than an indemnity equivalent to a maximum of one year's commission. Only in the rare circumstances where the certainty offered by an indemnity is crucial will it be the preferable option from a company's point of view.</p>

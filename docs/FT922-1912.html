			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Massacre arouses fury in S Africa THE ALREADY tense relations between the South African government and the African National Congress (ANC) were pushed close to breaking point yesterday following the massacre on Wednesday night of at least 39 people in the Boipatong township south of Johannesburg. The incident follows the start earlier this week of an ANC mass action campaign, aimed at breaking the deadlock in constitutional negotiations. The government had fiercely criticised the campaign, warning it would aggravate violence in the townships. President F W de Klerk yesterday condemned the 'mindless killing' in the township massacre and vowed 'we will not rest' until the killers were brought to justice. He appealed for calm and urged 'all leaders to ensure discipline and restraint among their followers'. The massacre will complicate prospects for reaching agreement at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional negotiating forum, where relationships between the government and the ANC have deteriorated sharply in the past few weeks. Following a trip around the township, near Vanderbijlpark, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, said: 'This type of violence could lead to negotiations being derailed. The negotiations process is going through a stage where it is being jeopardised by the government.' He added: 'The collective charge sheet against the apartheid government is being drawn up and President de Klerk is accused number one.' Most witnesses of the attack - which according to some reports left possibly as many as 50 dead - said it was conducted by residents of the nearby Kwamadala hostel. There were also suggestions of police involvement. The hostel, which houses residents for the nearby Iscor steelworks, is known to be a stronghold of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party. Inkatha denied any link to the massacre and challenged the ANC to provide concrete evidence of the involvement of hostel dwellers. The failure of the government to curb violence has long been a main point of contention between it and the ANC, which has repeatedly accused the police of complicity in or indifference to acts of violence against black people. Captain Craig Kotze, a police spokesman, said yesterday: 'It is now quite obvious that the political temperature has been pushed unacceptably high (by mass action) and has created a climate which can make incidents such as these that much easier to happen.'</p>

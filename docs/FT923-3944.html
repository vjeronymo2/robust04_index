			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hopewell posts rise to HKDollars 1.62bn HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 126 per cent jump in net profits to HKDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 209.6m)for the year to June, compared with HKDollars 718.9m a year earlier. The bulk of the rise in earnings was from one-off property sales and interest income from the proceeds of last year's HKDollars 5.8bn rights issue; their combined contribution came to more than HKDollars 900m. The figures were in line with expectations, boosted by the sale of the group's Broadwood Road luxury residential development site just before the year end. This helped nudge up earnings per share by 1 cent to 42 cents. Hopewell is going through a lull. Investors await returns from its infra-structural projects in China and Thailand. Earnings are expected to increase in 1993, but only through further property disposals; and then in 1994, it will receive the first returns from its long-awaited Shenzhen-Guangzhou super-highway. The company said the first phase of the toll road would be open to traffic next year. This would ensure a sizeable early completion bonus equivalent to the toll revenue up to the contract completion date of June 30 1994. Analysts believe this could contribute HKDollars 500m. Hopewell is developing commercial centres in 10 of the interchanges on the first phase. Hopewell will pay a final dividend of 16 cents, making a full-year payout of 30 cents.</p>

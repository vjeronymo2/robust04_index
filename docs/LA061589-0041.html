			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> POLICY CALLED 'GORBACHEV'S BEST BET';  </P> <P> SOVIETS SEE STRONG TIES TO EUROPE AS WAY OF FUTURE  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, after decades of costly pursuit of superpower status, took a  significant step this week toward reintegrating itself politically,  economically and culturally with the European continent.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pledging with West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl that their countries would work together to develop "a peaceful  European order," made clear Moscow's preference for a place in the "common  European home," as he put it, over the role of a superpower with global  interests.  </P> <P> "Although the continent has been divided for decades, the awareness of Europe's  identity and common assets has endured and is becoming ever stronger," the two  leaders said in a joint declaration. "This development must be encouraged.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany consider it a paramount  objective of their policies to continue Europe's historical traditions and thus  contribute towards overcoming the division of Europe. They are resolved to work  together in the search to develop a Europe of peace and cooperation -- a  peaceful European order, a common European home. . . ."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union hopes that such efforts will end its long isolation from the  political coalescence and the economic development that have brought Western  Europe such stability and prosperity and now threatens to leave Moscow and its  allies in Eastern Europe behind completely as the European Community moves to  establish a unified market in 1992.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev realized -- and it took much insight and integrity to do so -- that  the Soviet Union had lost in the arms race to the United States, was losing in  the economic race to Japan and the European Community and would become a third-  or fourth-rank power in 20 or 30 years," a senior European ambassador said in  Moscow recently. "The Russian fear is that they will be thought of as Asians,  irrelevant to Europe, and just forgotten as we move ahead.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev's best bet, politically and economically, was to return to Europe if  the Soviet Union has any chance of keeping up. But that means ending the old  thinking of 'We are bigger and stronger than you' or 'We have a better system  than you,' and it means more than slogans about peace, friendship and  cooperation. If the Russians want a place in Europe, they will have to earn  it."  </P> <P> In West Germany, however, Gorbachev found a partner willing -- more than  Britain and France so far have been -- to respond to Soviet needs and accept  Moscow's desire to participate in shaping the Europe of the 21st Century.  </P> <P> "The 'division of Europe' has a special meaning here," a senior West German  official remarked Wednesday, "and while Kohl understands something different  from what Gorbachev means when he says it, there is enough common ground for us  to cooperate."  </P> <P> A political commentator put it more tartly on West German television Wednesday:  "Mikhail Gorbachev was looking for a solid boulder to be his anchor while he  winched the Soviet Union into political and economic modernity, and Helmut Kohl  said the Federal Republic of Germany would be that boulder."  </P> <P> In return, the Soviet Union has already begun to soften its opposition --  adamant and often angry in the past -- to the possible reunification of East  and West Germany. Talking with journalists after signing the joint statement,  Gorbachev said of that issue, "Let time decide."  </P> <P> "I think that the world is changing, and changing for the better," the Soviet  leader said, "and it is opening possibilities for better contacts between all  states.  </P> <P> "If we are wise and far-sighted, then a good number of profound changes can  take place in Europe and in the whole world."  </P> <P> In October, Gorbachev had bluntly told Kohl in Moscow that even talking about  reunification was dangerous, for it threatened Europe's postwar stability.  </P> <P> And one Soviet specialist on Europe, Vladislav Belov, went as far last week as  to suggest that he could see growing cooperation between socialist East Germany  and capitalist West Germany leading to a decision by them -- as "two  independent and sovereign states" -- on some sort of reunification.  </P> <P> The Berlin Wall, Belov added, would then be little more than a museum piece if  it still existed.  </P> <P> "As a symbol, I believe the Wall will be destroyed sometime," he told a  briefing at the Foreign Ministry in Moscow.  </P> <P> On this trip, Gorbachev emphasized that, in signing what has already become  known as the "Bonn Declaration," "we are drawing a line on the postwar period .  . . (and taking) a decisive step in the direction of one another."  </P> <P> For the Soviet Union, the joint statement signed by Gorbachev and Kohl does  mark a substantial change in the way it views the world -- and itself.  </P> <P> As one of the fundamental shifts in Soviet strategy under Gorbachev, the  decision reflects a harsh appraisal by the Soviet leadership of the country's  problems and capabilities, according to senior Gorbachev advisers.  </P> <P> "We inherited an empire and made it even grander, but we cannot afford it or  even run it," one top Soviet foreign policy specialist said here, explaining  the reorientation of his country's strategy. "Today, our people realize that,  until we build our own country and make it strong within, anything we do abroad  will be little more than an adventure. . . .  </P> <P> "But, if we are not to be a superpower, then what are we? First of all, we are  a European country -- not a small one, perhaps even a great one, but definitely  a European nation. So, let us find our place in Europe."  </P> <P> Moscow, which until a year ago refused to recognize the European Community,  although its 12 members were reshaping the continent, accepts now that its  future in Europe requires active cooperation with the community and with the  larger Council of Europe, which it had also long disdained.  </P> <P> The joint efforts pledged by Gorbachev to elaborate with Kohl and other  European leaders new concepts of cooperation will give a Soviet foreign policy  a different and, in some ways, a tighter focus so that European concerns become  far more prominent.  </P> <P> "These are relations between great powers," Vitaly V. Zhurkin, director of the  Soviet Institute of Europe, said in appraising the Soviet-West German summit --  diminishing the Soviet Union as he elevated West Germany a bit.  </P> <P> Moscow realizes, of course, that its international responsibility will  continue, senior Soviet foreign policy specialists say. Soviet military power  remains second only to that of the United States, and arms reduction agreements  will require time to negotiate.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is also a major Asian nation, facing Japan and bordering on  China, and these interests must be balanced with the new emphasis on Europe.  </P> <P> "We will have a European focus and an Asian focus and a special relationship  with the United States," a Soviet political commentator with the Gorbachev  delegation remarked, "but the chronic overreaching of the past has ended."  </P> <P> Moscow is hoping, however, that a significant improvement in relations with the  West as a whole will follow.  </P> <P> "Our relations with West Germany will go a long way toward shaping Europe for  the rest of this century and well into the next," Georgy A. Arbatov, director  of the Soviet Institute for Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, said here. "This  will also have a substantial impact, we believe, on Soviet-American relations.  </P> <P> "We should recall that when something happens in our relations with West  Germany, it signifies a turn for the better, as happened with our peace treaty  in 1970, or for the worse. There is a strong movement for global changes that  are ripe, or even overdue, and this development should help them."  </P> <P> Changes in domestic policies are also implicit as the Soviet Union seeks to  re-establish itself as a European country and no longer emphasizes the  socialist character of its political and economic system.  </P> <P> After dismissing the democracies of Western Europe as "bourgeois" or even  political shams for many years, the Soviet Union has committed itself to a  political order in the Bonn Declaration that enshrines their most basic ideals.  </P> <P> With its own economic system evolving away from central planning toward "market  socialism," the Soviet Union is actively seeking assistance from West Germany  and other capitalist countries not just to develop its backward economy but to  train market-oriented managers to run it.  </P> <P> "The future is economic integration, not isolation," an economist in the Soviet  delegation said. "We thought central planning could do it all, and we were  wrong. We thought that by relying on our own resources we could grow faster and  become stronger, and we were wrong. And, quite foolishly, we thought we should  protect our 'socialist purity' from contamination by the market."  </P> <P> Although Soviet ideologists had long claimed that socialism had created a "new  Soviet man" and a "new Soviet culture," both superior to anything in the West,  the country will now be seeking to re-establish what was European in its  traditions as a basis of ensuring the country's reintegration into Europe.  </P></p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Codelco president resigns Mr Alejandro Noemi has resigned as president of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, shortly after the publication of an internal report confirming losses of some Dollars 206m on metals futures trading. Mr Noemi, who led the internal probe, said: 'I am pained by this huge stain on my record and I have only continued (as president) in order to complete the investigation and control the damage.' Codelco's report concluded that failure to implement controls had allowed Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the chief futures trader, to mount more than 5,000 operations last year leading to losses of Dollars 206.7m.</p>

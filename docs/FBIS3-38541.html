			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of the </F> Environment: "DOE Expands Construction Trade Mission Programme"]    [Text] Construction Minister Sir George Young today  announced a major programme of construction industry trade  missions for this year.    The five missions -- each led by a Minister -- will support  the export efforts of British contractors and consultants, and  building materials producers.  <H5>  Unveiling the Programme, Sir George said: </H5>   "I am delighted to announce that Secretary of State John  Gummer, Tony Baldry and I will be spearheading a much-expanded  construction trade missions programme during 1994." The  programme will cover India, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and Malaysia,  Chile and Argentina, and Vietnam and the Philippines.    "As sponsors of the construction industry we must help  ensure  that the many skills and services that our industry has to offer  are effectively promoted in the markets that the industry sees  as providing the best opportunities overseas.    "Our programme has been drawn up after careful and extensive  consultation with the major construction industry trade  associations. This is an ambitious but necessary programme if we  are to maintain and improve our position in the fiercely  competitive international construction market.    "Last year's missions to Lebanon, Taiwan and China were a  great success and gave an edge to the industry's efforts to  compete in these markets. I, and my Ministerial colleagues, look  forward to working closely with industry representatives to make  this year's missions equally, if not even more, successful."  <H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>   The Secretary of State for the Environment launched the new  Construction Sponsorship Directorate on 27 September 1993 with  the specific brief of "Listening to the industry"; "Explaining  Government policies and priorities"; "Advocating on behalf of  the industry both at home and abroad"; and "Promoting exports,  productivity and innovation."    A new Construction Export Promotion Division has been  created  within the Directorate and this is the first trade missions  programme organised under the new structure.

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / New approach to an ageing problem: Today sees the implementation of the government's care in the community initiative which moves the onus on to local councils BRITAIN'S population is ageing. The number of people of pensionable age rose 16 per cent between 1971 and 1991 and will increase a further 38 per cent - to 14.6m - by 2031. There will be twice as many people over 65 in the Britain of 2021 as there were in 1951. Within this ageing process there will be a particularly sharp rise in the very elderly, who demand the most extensive - and expensive - medical and social care. People in their late 80s consume about 10 times the health expenditure of 40-year-olds. During the 1980s the increase in the numbers of elderly, coupled with a decline in long-stay hospital provision, led to rapid growth in the numbers accommodated in private homes. It was good news for the private residential care sector, but social security benefits paid the bills. Places in private homes almost quadrupled from 39,300 in 1981 to 155,300 10 years later. Social security payments for people in private and charitable residential and nursing homes have jumped sharply from Pounds 10m in 1979 to Pounds 2.5bn this year. The care in the community reforms coming into effect today are designed to redirect care away from institutional settings towards supporting people in their own homes wherever possible.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese begin to think the unthinkable - Metals companies are casting aside tradition to survive THE JAPANESE non-ferrous metals industry is facing its worst crisis since the two oil shocks of the 1970s. The economic bubble of the late 1980s has well and truly burst leaving the Japanese little choice but to tighten their obis. Already there are concerns that traditional work practices will not survive the changes needed to maintain Japan's leading position in an increasingly international marketplace. Domestic demand even for the comparatively healthy aluminium and copper markets has slumped significantly. For example, in 1992 Japanese aluminium consumption fell for the first time in 11 years, dipping 4 per cent to 3.7m tonnes, according to the Japanese Aluminium Federation. The contribution of the seemingly recession-proof aluminium cans sector - up 6.8 per cent last year - was robustly countered by a reduction in the remaining markets of machinery, building and construction, electric and telecommunications. The motor industry has been particularly badly affected with Nissan the first to propose plant closures. As a result, in 1992 aluminium sheet shipments for car manufacture slumped for the first time in 15 years, falling 4.7 per cent to 78,238 tonnes. Extruded products fell 7.6 per cent to 92,688 tonnes - the first decline for six years. The copper market has fared no better. Domestic consumption was down from 1.6m tonnes in 1991 to 1.4m tonnes last year, compared with output of 1.1m tonnes. Faced with a 300,000-tonne demand deficit the producers are still pumping out the metal - but any plans for domestic expansion have been discreetly shelved. Japan's biggest copper unit, Nippon Mining's Saganoseki smelter, is conveniently waiting to see the results of a feasibility study before committing itself to cranking up production. In its traditional way Japan is doing all it can to make the best of the situation and save face. In most cases the 'job for life' tradition is being upheld, although the 'job for the wife' is another matter. Part-time workers  -usually married women working eight-hour days - and immigrant labourers have been the first to lose their jobs in the initial wave of rationalisation. As a result Japan saw its first decline in people employed in seven years in February, with the figure falling 250,000 - or 0.4 per cent - to 62.8m. Leading the way with lay-offs are western companies like IBM, which have had less compunction about cutting back staff to meet decreased demand. At the moment, for the worst-afflicted industries - like secondary (recycled) aluminium, of which the motor industry is a major consumer, and the ferro-alloys that go into the ailing steel industry - production cuts are the answer. The major aluminium alloy producers have reduced output by 10-15 per cent and few will report healthy profits for 1993. Daiki Aluminium, Japan's leading producer, registered a loss for 1992, the first in its operating history. In response the company, which at 200,000 tonnes-a-year has the world's greatest capacity, has slashed output by 15 per cent and workers have already left volunatrily. According to executive vice-president Mr Takaari Yamamoto, the second quarter of this year will see more serious restructuring. Mr Yamamoto, who is set to take over the helm from his father, suggested some of the smaller smelters could close. 'This is a time of change for the kitchen shop smelters. A new generation is taking over,' he said, suggesting that some of the sons in line for the dubious inheritance of an ailing secondary smelter might grab the yen and run. Clearly, there are indications that Japan's own baby boomers - softened by years of plenty, western standards and materialism - will be less inclined to keep up appearances. Elsewhere, the ferro-vanadium producers have cut back capacity to about 3,000 tonnes a year, with the resulting 1,000 tonnes annual supply deficit made up by cheap imports. According to Nissho Iwai official Mr Shoji Uematsu, whose trade house acts as an intermediary for the producers and also sells cheap Czech ferro-vanadium to south-east Asia in direct competition: 'The Japanese converters are not competitive enough. The time will come when some part of the industry will need to be replaced by imports'. At the moment the Japanese are still maintaining the tradition of quality, refusing to use lower grade Russian imports. But the Japanese are monitoring the material, with small amounts of Russian imports for testing showing up on the statistics sheets. The Japanese are also monitoring investment possibilities in the former Soviet Union. A large delegation of Japanese government and private-sector representatives recently embarked on a two-week mission to the central Asian states of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to survey non-ferrous mines and refining operations. On a smaller scale, Tokyo-based trade house Tomen is sending a delegation to Moscow to look at possibilities, while Nissho Iwai is faring better than most from its shrewd marketing arrangement with the Czech ferro-alloys producer Mnisek. On the domestic front much hangs on the government's spending initiatives, which injected Y10,700bn (Pounds 64bn) last year and are set to stump up a further Yl3,000bn this year. But business confidence has taken a severe battering and no one is predicting a vigorous economic recovery. Mr Kunio Ino, manager of the purchasing department of Furukawa Electric, which produces aluminium sheet and extrusions, revealed that his company's sheet production for the can industry had been cut from 20,000 to 17,000 tonnes a month. He believes that over-investment is responsible for poor results in the Japanese aluminium industry, which has poured money back into new projects and expansion to keep pace with sustained growth of 10 per cent a year. 'Fortunately, we did not have enough money to invest abroad,' he said, adding: 'Recovery (nationally) is possible next year, but the pace will be very slow. The (aluminium) industry invested too much over the past five years. Next year will see much lower investment, with investment decreasing by 5 to 10 per cent per year over the next two or three years.' Mr Yoshihiro Shito, managing director and general manager of the non-ferrous metals division of Tomen, agreed that over-investment had added to the burden of high overheads, producing tiny profits compared with turnover. For example, the big five steel companies recently reported turnover down 'only 7 to 10 per cent with profits slashed by 60 to 100 per cent'. Suggesting that the Japanese will do anything to save face he added: 'The Japanese economy cannot be sunk. (Some companies) have sold assets to offset losses, to make a round figure . . . Japan is standing on a turning point, it is looking to the US for leadership.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> International </F>Language: &lt;f 105&gt; Lithuanian  Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Seimas has rejected the president's  veto on a law devoted to improvements in agriculture. Today,  the Seimas endorsed the law passed in December. This document  was returned by President Brazauskas to the Seimas to  reconsider. It was stated in his decree that some norms of the  law did not correspond with the principle of establishing market  economy. The government diktat, legalized by this law, to all  agricultural producers, irrespective of the form of their  ownership, was the most unsuitable to the president. The law,  among other things, provides for quotas of the purchase of  agricultural products, fixed by the government, to all  enterprises processing agricultural products.    According to the constitution, the law repeatedly passed by  the Seimas, must be signed by the president within three days  and announced without delay.</p>

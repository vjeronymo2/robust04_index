			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- The shadowy Azanian  National Liberation Army [Azanla], military wing of the Black  Consciousness Movement [BCM], on Wednesday [27 April] denied  responsibility for the bomb blast that rocked Jan Smuts Airport  and injured 16 people, two seriously.    Azanian Peoples Organisation [Azapo] official Dr Gomolemo  Mokae said by telephone: "To the best of our information Azanla  was not involved in the placing of the bomb."    Azapo is a BCM member and is boycotting the all-race  election.    Dr Mokae said it was not uncommon for "De Klerk and company"  to respond to such activities by condemning not only the white  right, but also the black left.    He was responding to a caller claiming to be from Azanla and  claiming responsibility for the blast. "It is a bogus call  initiated by the white regime to try to get rid of the egg on  its face."    Dr Mokae added although Azapo remained opposed to  participating in the election, it believed it was the democratic  rights of anyone to take part in the polls.</p>

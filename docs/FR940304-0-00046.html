			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule, we have revised our estimate of the number of physicians who reported ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes before the requirements of section 1842(p) of the Act were established. As stated in section III of this preamble, we provided for a 6-month grace period following the statutory implementation date of April 1, 1989, during which no claims would be denied for lack of coding. The grace period ended on October 1, 1989. It has been our experience that, when grace periods are established, providers usually do not comply with the required provisions until the end of the grace period, presumably because of lack of training or need for a preparation period. In this case, however, approximately 90 percent of the claims were coded using ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM during the first month of the grace period, and the compliance rate remained at approximately 90 percent for the duration of the grace period. Moreover, intermediary review of these claims revealed no significant coding problems. Since the number of physicians that complied with the coding requirement remained stable throughout the grace period, we believe that the number of physicians who reported codes during the grace period is indicative of the number of physicians who were reporting codes before the requirement was established. Therefore, we now estimate that approximately 90 percent of physicians reported ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes before April, 1989 (that is, approximately, 512,000 physicians). The discussion below reflects this revised estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If all the physicians who did not report ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes before April 1989 needed new coding books, ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Volumes 1 and 2 at a cost of $65.00 per set, the total cost would have been approximately $3,700,000. In practice, however, we believe that not all of these physicians needed to purchase new coding books. For example, some physicians belonged to group practices, some worked for hospitals and do not have their own patients, and some already owned coding books. For purposes of this impact analysis, however, we assume that all physicians who did not code before April, 1989 purchased new coding books.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, in calculating costs of training and coding for physicians who did not code before April 1989, we estimated the average wages of a physician's office staff person at $4.50 an hour. In response to the July 21, 1989 proposed rule, we received several comments stating that we had underestimated the average hourly wages for a physician's office staff member. We agree that our estimate of $4.50 per hour was too low. In this final rule, we are revising our estimate of the hourly rate based on comments received on the proposed rule and our examination of the hourly wages of physicians' office staff in the monthly publication ``Employment and Earnings'' (U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``Employment and Earnings'' Vol. 37, No. 4, April 1990, p. 131 (Washington, DC)). Our revised estimate of the typical wage for a staff person at the time the requirement was established is $9.65 per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on claims data, we believe there were approximately 320.1 million physician claims processed for the period from April 1, 1989 to March 31, 1990. We estimated that the clerical cost of coding each claim was $0.16 for a total of $51,216,000 for the first year that the requirement was in effect. We arrived at the $0.16 figure by assuming an hourly rate of the typical physician's office staff person to be $9.65 per hour, as explained above. We believe that it takes 1 minute to code a claim, therefore $9.65 divided by 60 minutes results in a $0.16 cost per claim. However, we believe that 90 percent of the claims were being coded prior to April 1, 1989. Thus, 10 percent of the cost of coding claims (approximately $5,120,000) can be attributed to the provision of section 1842(p) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

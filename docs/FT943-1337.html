			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: A glimmer in the September gloom - London The stock market's black September lightened a touch near the week's end, but equities continued to feel sore from a whiplash of shunts from the US and bumps from Germany. There was little domestic comfort either, as it became clear just how decisively last week's interest rate rise has transformed the investment outlook. Until the modest recovery on Thursday and Friday, September had developed into the cruellest month for equities in 1994, with the FT-A All-Share index already showing a bigger decline than the 6.78 per cent drop it suffered in March. As well as equinoxes and unsettled weather, those two months also mark the high tides of corporate reporting. The September peak has passed, with most companies providing little grounds for optimism to offset the prevailing malaise. On Wednesday, Kleinwort Benson Securities translated this sentiment into hard numbers, cutting its forecast for earnings growth in 1995 from 10 per cent to 8 per cent and counselling clients to look towards bonds rather than equities for the time being. It will not be easy in bonds either. The yield on 10-year gilts breached 9 per cent on Tuesday for the first time since October 1992. By yesterday, however, it was down to 8.86 per cent. The government bonds market took in its stride news both of a Pounds 2bn gilts auction, on the low side of expectations in terms of size, and the German announcement of a rare issue of floating-rate bunds. The latter proved a puzzlement, giving no explicit pointers to the timing - or direction - of the Bundesbank's next interest rate move. London was evenly divided between judging the move desperate or clever. Figures published on Tuesday showed a lower than expected rise in bank and building society lending and a fall in lending to the corporate sector in August. This helped to allay worries of inflationary pressures, although the British Bankers Association also noted a jump in lending to individuals and a fifth monthly rise in consumer credit, suggesting that the April tax increases were beginning to be felt in household budgets. Friday's GDP figures not only appeared to bear this out, but indicated the squeeze had begun even earlier. According to these data, real personal disposable income fell by 1.8 per cent between the first and second quarters of 1994, the biggest such decline for 13 years. But some analysts noted that the figures were contradicted by strong retail sales data in the second quarter. Never mind the ambiguity, equities found solace in even a hint of news that arrested the slide. The FT-SE 100 index gained 7 to 3028.2 on Friday, to limit its loss for the week to 36.9 points. The worst day was Tuesday when a widening US trade deficit spooked markets everywhere and cost the FT-SE 100 41.8 points. But the next day brought better than expected German money supply figures, which gave London a respite, before US housing statistics knocked shares down again. While most of the market was in the dumps, Browning-Ferris Industries of the US thought it could find treasure in trash. It launched a surprise takeover bid for Attwoods, which has attracted as much attention over the years for the colourful characters on its board and in its orbit as for the garbage business itself. Attwoods said 'rubbish', in Cityspeak, to the Pounds 564m bid and its shares now stand at 116p, against BFI's 109p offer. A dawn raid by the Mirror Group picked up 14.9 per cent of Scottish Television's shares for Pounds 37.4m. Although Mirror, as a national newspaper publisher, faces a 20 per cent regulatory cap on its potential stake in the ITV company, the shares of other medium-fry regional broadcasters jumped. Another rare pillar of support came in the electricity distribution sector where Northern Electric helped to buoy sentiment by buying in 10 per cent of its shares. And drugs proved a more pleasant distraction than for the Liberal Democrats in Brighton. Speculation about a merger between pharmaceutical giants Zeneca and Wellcome pushed their respective shares 1.4 and 4.1 per cent higher on the week, although their attractions faded as the general market firmed. Spirits were not as high at Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. United Distillers, on which Guinness relies for two thirds of its profits, saw first-half operating profits fall by more than 4 per cent to Pounds 258m. GrandMet devoted more than half of a Pounds 280m restructuring charge to a shake-up at International Distillers and Vintners, the world's biggest spirits producer. Speaking of dog's breakfasts, GrandMet also sold its US pet food brand Alpo to Nestle for Dollars 510m (Pounds 325m). British Aerospace trebled its interim underlying profits to Pounds 90m, but worried the market with increased losses on commercial aircraft and a Pounds 115m cash outflow in spite of selling Rover to BMW for Pounds 800m. Its shares initially fell 26p to 445p, but recovered most of the loss by Friday. A BAe spin-off was one of two recent flotations whose price charts now resemble Niagara Falls. Aerostructures Hamble, bought by management from BAe in 1990, fell 50p to 73p after warning of problems with contracts. It floated at 120p barely three months ago. McDonnell Information Systems, which came to market in March at 260p, saw its price cut in half to 112p on poor interim results.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Nuclear risk provides top Lloyd's profit A Lloyd's underwriter who insures nuclear power stations produced the best profits for his Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - in 1991, when the market as a whole had losses of Pounds 2.05bn. Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, posted the 1991 figures last week, bringing its cumulative losses since 1988 to about Pounds 7bn. Details of the results of individual syndicates, published in the latest issue of Limelight, show that 111 of the 349 syndicates trading in 1991 made profits, with the small nuclear syndicate 1176 doing best of all - with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.8m, compared with gross premium income of Pounds 4.8m. Before deductions for personal expenses its 782 Names made Pounds 4,858 for every Pounds 10,000 traded. The underwriter Mr Michael Dawson, whose agency Cox Newton and Harman started the syndicate in 1991, mainly covers the risk of physical damage for western-built nuclear power stations and is advised by Mr Walter Marshall, who was chairman of the former Central Electricity Generating Board. Second in the list of top performers at Lloyd's in 1991 is Mr Peter Butler, who specialises in high-risk catastrophe business. Another small syndicate, 1179, with premium income of less than Pounds 3m, made profits of Pounds 4,246 for every Pounds 10,000 of capacity - the amount of premiums the syndicate is allowed to write. A much larger syndicate, Janson Green 386, which specialises in non-marine liability business, was third most profitable, while Bankside syndicates 45 and 318 occupied the fourth and fifth places in the profitability league. Most of the 20 worst-performing syndicates in 1991 have been closed by their agents. For every Pounds 10,000 traded on the the worst performer  - syndicate 833, a marine syndicate - its 677 members face losses of Pounds 10,577. Limelight: Lloyd's Syndicate Results 1993. Limelight Sales, Greatness Lane, Sevenoaks, Kent TN14 5BQ. Pounds 50.</p>

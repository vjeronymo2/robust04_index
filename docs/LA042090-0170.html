BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UPJOHN TO HELP RESTORE RIVER  </P> <P> The Upjohn Co. has agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle a 5-year-old suit  alleging pollution of the Quinnipiac River by the company's North Haven plant.  </P> <P> Two environmental groups announced in New Haven Thursday that Upjohn has agreed  to set up a trust fund to help restore the Quinnipiac River, which the  company's North Haven plant has been accused of polluting over the years.  </P> <P> The federal lawsuit accused Upjohn of more than 1,100 violations of the Clean  Water Act in dumping toxic substances, including carcinogens, into the river.  </P> <P> The trust fund, to be administered by the New Haven Foundation, will use up to  $1.2 million to improve the ecology of the river, New Haven Harbor and their  watersheds. The rest of the settlement will be used to cover legal costs.  </P> <P> Katherine H. Robinson, senior staff attorney for the Connecticut Fund, said the  agreement is believed to be the largest penalty ever paid for permit violations  in Connecticut.  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Falling metals prices push Asarco into loss ASARCO, the integrated US copper producer, reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 30.9m, or 74 cents a share. A slide in metals prices and damage from heavy rain at its biggest Arizona copper mine contributed to the loss. The company reported a profit of Dollars 6.4m, or 16 cents, excluding special accounting charges. Sales were Dollars 457.1m, down from Dollars 458.9m last time. Asarco's average realised copper price fell to 99 cents a pound in the first three months, from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. Copper prices have continued to slide, which would affect second-quarter results, the company said. Lower metals prices accounted for an after-tax operating earnings decline of Dollars 6m in the first quarter. A scheduled 30-day maintenance shutdown of Asarco's smelter in Hayden, Arizona, cost the company about Dollars 7m in first-quarter earnings, while the effects of heavy rains, which continued through late February, cost the company about Dollars 20m after tax in damage and production losses.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Gardening: Where green is the colour - Robin Lane Fox visits designer David Hicks' garden where highly-trained trees keep to the straight and narrow THE sun has been shimmering on the cornfields in these late midsummer evenings; mirages have been everywhere, but I have just emerged from an oasis whose owner was waving his hands in disgust. The offending object was his rosebed. Its roses looked innocent enough, a selection of pale beauties from the David Austin stable. 'Out,' exclaimed David Hicks, one of the uncrowned kings of modern interior decor. 'Out, out, out: those roses simply have to go. They lower the tone.' Since the mid-1970s, the vision of designer Hicks has undergone an unusual enlargement. It has moved from patterns on carpets and curtains to the art of landscape gardening, not to rosebeds but to ground plans with bold designs. Hicks' gardens are now dotted round the globe, from South Africa to Portugal. What is the Hicks eye seeing which the Lane Fox eye is too dull to imagine? Part of the answer is green, clipped and formal. In the mid-1970s David Hicks moved house to the sort of site which haunts my nightmares. The house had no real garden and only a random wall or two in its vicinity. There were no hills in the vista and no specimen trees. The prospect was a prairie in all directions. In my mid-50s, I think I would have remained with carpets. Not so David Hicks. He has grown to love gardening and to concentrate professionally on his ideas of it. On site, he has thought big, humanised a blank wilderness and brought life to a setting on Buckinghamshire's answer to the Urals. As we walked round the ground plan, I had a rare opportunity to measure apparent maturity against the passage of time and so to put my nightmare to rest. If you find yourself banished to a cornfield, think big, think green, give yourself five years and plant palisades. Palisades, I learnt, are not a smaller variation of the stockade at the centre of Treasure Island. They are a neglected garden feature from pre-revolutionary France which Hicks has cleverly revived for his main vistas. In the foreground, you need to plant pleached trees the trunks of which are kept bare to a height of 4-5 ft, while the upper branches are trained sideways and clipped to make solid hedge. David Hicks opted for standard hornbeams from Notcutts Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk, and spaced them about a yard-and-a-half apart. At first, he had them tied to tall stakes and trained the branches on to plain wire between them. Others have often done the same, but pleaching becomes palisading if you add a second row behind the pleached trunks. You have to plant a hedge of the same variety and clip it as a background to the trees so that it fills in the gaps between them. After three years, results were beginning to show; after five years, they were hardening. Now, after 15, palisades of formally-clipped hornbeam line and define the main view in a flat garden, giving it a charming style. Palisading may sound grand, but it rests on a principle which gardening books ignore. Hedging plants do not have to be set out in single or double lines. Small clusters of them can be clipped into cubes, low buttresses, or backing and filling. These uses do not require long views and broad acres. Elsewhere, David Hicks repeats the idea in an area which is scarcely 10 yards square. Here, the central trees are the dewy willow (salix irrorata) which are trained on much narrower trunks to a dome of wire through which their upper branches grow and form a grey-green hat. Yew, choisya or (my own favourite), the shiny Osmarea will then grow on to make buttresses and fill in the gaps between the tree trunks. These touches of formality can be scaled down to give style to much smaller plants. Around the new palisades run the David Hicks avenues in which miscellaneous trees are trained so as to arch into a tunnel on supporting hoops. Here, he has some advice from experience. The hoops must be made of metal: modern black plastic substitutes are useless because they cannot support the weight of a closely-clipped frame of trees. By his own mistake he has learned that these archways should be as wide as your pocket can afford. By now, we were into the swing of it and the designer's vision took wing in words. On either side of the clipped palisade run long strips of unmown grass, allowed to grow to their midsummer height. They are not an economy. In Hicks' view, too few gardeners can distinguish between their lawn and a golf course. Down the Hicks fairway, therefore, run these patches of deliberate rough which lead up to the arable prairie and the horizon. Did he not feel at risk to the taste of surrounding farmers, presenting him with a grain-dryer, maybe, or a shed for deep litter chickens? Not in the least, he assured me: 'We own the surrounding 1,500 acres.' We turned past a new gazebo, beautifully built in a subtle mixture of designer cement and good old pebble dash. Keystones mark out the corners, and round windows a builder has draped ribbons and swags in artful concrete. It wins my award for the prettiest new garden building this year: what, dare I ask, would it cost? It began as a birthday present, acquired a budget of Pounds 20,000, but ended up as several presents in one. Behind the cement gazebo, flowers took a segregated turn, in a walled enclosure where borders of old roses waved to each other on the usual stakes and frames. Beyond them, down a separate vista, the Hicks eye has bought a post-modern touch to container gardening. Circling around, we reached the other main vista from the house, framed by an ingenuously-chosen hedge of horse chestnuts, clipped into a wall about 20 ft high. Beyond it, a big avenue of yet more chestnuts extends the theme far into the estate. In front, he has put a narrow swimming pool with dark, mottled walls which rebukes those of us who follow the marketing ideals and sink a liner pool in a brilliant shade of Californian blue. As the vistas opened, so did their owner's enthusiasms. No, he had no time for variegated leaves: they are as vulgar as bi-coloured cars. Yes, he had deliberately planned a series of gothic points of emphasis but 'when I say gothic, I mean gothic: I do not mean gothick with a k' By now, I was admiring the vision of it all. At the tennis court, I learned another trick. Outside the court's wire surround, a second surround had been spaced about three yards away and climbers had been grown up it to make a covered walk round this potential eyesore. What, though, were these climbers which were not only growing but flowering their heads off in a robust shade of carmine red, a riot of single-flowered rambling roses?. 'I have to have them,' their owner explained, 'because I grew up with them years ago in Essex.' Essex Man turned designer? He rather liked the notion. Faced with an English rose, even Essex Man loses his insistence on the principles of green, straight and narrow.</p>

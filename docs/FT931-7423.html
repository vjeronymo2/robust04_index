			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rate cuts give new impetus to market in convertible sterling bonds THE opening of the market in Euroconvertible sterling bonds was given further impetus yesterday as BPB Industries, the UK building materials group, brought the third issue the market has seen in three weeks. This formerly quiet corner of the international capital markets is widely expected to become a focus of attention in the weeks ahead, with speculation rife that more prominent companies, ranging from National Westminster Bank to British Airways, may prefer to raise money through convertibles rather than an issue of straight equity. Two factors explain the renewed interest in sterling convertibles. One is the fall in long-term UK interest rates: 10-year gilt yields were at 7.8 per cent yesterday, 50 basis points lower than a month ago. Such rates are low by historical standards, tempting corporate treasurers back into the sterling bond markets. BPB's Pounds 64m, 15-year issue - which is redeemable after five years - carries a coupon of 7 1/4 per cent, while the coupon on Northern Foods's Pounds 91m convert-ible was 6 3/4 per cent and Sun Alliance's Pounds 155m of bonds paid 7 1/4 per cent. The relative steepness of the UK yield curve helps to explain why such yields look attractive to investors. With UK base rates down to 6 per cent, and widely expected to fall further, funds geared to paying investors a high level of income are in search of higher-yielding products. An instrument with a 7 1/4 per cent coupon and the chance to convert into equity looks attractive in such circumstances. The second factor explaining the sudden appeal of convertibles is the good run that equity prices have had in recent months. That has pushed down equity yields, again tempting investors to switch into higher-yielding instruments. BPB's shares had risen from a low of 123p last September to 234p yesterday morning, pushing the yield down to around 4.5 per cent. The pick-up offered by the convertibles, and the chance to lock in some of the recent equity gains, encouraged BPB shareholders to switch yesterday into the new instruments. The company's share price fell to 217p at the close. The latest batch of issues is generally seen by convertibles experts as expensive for investors, reflecting the shortage of such bonds and the growing demand for higher yields. As a rough guide, according to one, investors look for a coupon at least 3 per cent higher than the yield on the underlying shares, with a conversion price set at 16 to 18 per cent above the current share price. The yield pick-up on BPB's bonds was 2 3/4 per cent, while the premium was 15.7 per cent - at the tight end of the ranges indicated when the bonds were first offered, and seen as expensive given that BPB is an unrated company standing outside the FT-SE 100. Nevertheless the bonds were bought up quickly, and the issue was raised from its initial Pounds 60m. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] One of the unintended side effects of last week's  French intervention in Rwanda has been to allow journalists more  freedom to report on what is going on in the west of the  country, which is largely under the control of the interim  government. In the past, journalists who ventured into the area  have complained of harassment by militias who were widely  believed to have been trained by the government during the rule  of President Habyarimana. Rwanda's ambassador to Uganda, Claver  Kanyarushoki, is in close contact with the interim government.  In Kampala, Mwambu Wanendeya asked him how they see the French  intervention.    [Begin recording] [Kanyarushoki] The French Government has  had a long cooperation history with Rwanda in many fields  including the security [word indistinct], so it is true that  France had cooperation with Rwanda, and among the fields of  cooperation were the military and gendarmerie and so on.    [Wanendeya] But these allegations that they trained these  militias who people perceive as being responsible for most of  the massacres. Is there any truth in that?    [Kanyarushoki] I do not believe so. Definitely, they train  the Army, parts of the Army like the Belgians were doing, like  the Germans were doing with the gendarmerie, so they trained the  regular Army, there is no doubt about it, but for the militias,  I do not think they did unless there is any hard evidence, but I  will doubt very much that they did ever train the militias  outside the regular Army.    [Wanendeya] Do you think the media coverage of this war has  been biased in favor of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]?    [Kanyarushoki] Yes, definitely.    [Wanendeya] And why do you think this?    [Kanyarushoki] I do not know. Perhaps, there might be so  many reasons including the ground work done by the RPF itself,  by their public relations, and by their own propaganda. I do  not know, really. There might be some other reasons, but I  think those are the ones, which is the fact that they do have a  good network of public relations and good contacts in the media  and so on. [end recording]    Meanwhile, refugees sheltering in a church in the Rwandan  capital have once again come under artillery fire. The 8,000  people in Sainte Famille have been waiting for weeks in the hope  of being rescued by UN Forces. UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda] has been trying to ferry people across the battle lines  during the sporadic lulls in the fighting between interim  government forces and the RPF rebels. On the line to Kigali,  Raggi Omar asked Serge Arnauld of the French News Agency if the  church had been badly damaged in the attack.    [Begin Arnauld recording] Yeah, it did not hit the church  itself. It was close to the church, but as there are so many  refugees -- UNAMIR estimates that there are around 8,000 -- five  of them have been killed this morning.    [Omar] Have you managed to get down to the Sainte Famille  Church yourself?    [Arnauld] Yeah, a few journalists could go there with the  UN,  but we came after the shelling so we only saw the impact of the  mortar shell. We did not see the bodies of the wounded.    [Omar] What was the situation at the Sainte Famille Church  once you were able to get there?    [Arnauld] The situation is horrible. I mean there are  thousands of refugees in the church, which is dark and  (?stinks). It is really terrible. They are all asking to take  them out. Now, the UN is... [pauses] It is already 10 days that  they have not done... [pauses] They cannot do anything for  these refugees, so the situation of these refugees is worsening  and worsening.    [Omar] Is there any idea as to who might have been  responsible for the mortar bomb or is that impossible to tell?    [Arnauld] There is an idea. It should be the rebel forces  because they are shelling in this direction. The church is  located in an area of the government troops who normally could  be... [pauses] It should be the rebel forces who fired the  shell.    [Omar] Has this been the only incident of its kind today?    [Arnauld] It was the only incident of its kind today. The  fighting was not as strong as yesterday--only sporadic shelling,  so it was the only incident we know. [end recording]</p>

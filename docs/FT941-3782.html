			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / City landlords rebuild for the future An improvement in prospects for the City of London office market is prompting some landlords to consider upgrading buildings that were damaged by an IRA bomb attack last April. Hammerson, the property company, intends to spend Pounds 65m on rebuilding 99 Bishopsgate, a 290,000 sq ft building which it bought for Pounds 25m from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation last week. Part of the sum will be recovered from the building's insurers. 'We anticipate that, with the continuing take-up of new space in the City and the low level of new development, there will be a shortage of quality space in 1996 when works are completed,' said Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive. The total cost of bomb damage is estimated to be Pounds 600m, according to the Association of British Insurers. The final sum is still unknown because many owners are still negotiating with insurers and tenants of bomb-damaged buildings. Plans for 1.2m sq ft of buildings that were severely damaged have not yet been finalised, according to the Corporation of London, the local authority for the city. Work is under way or completed on a further 1.7m sq ft of damaged property. The slack state of the office market has allowed landlords to delay finalising their plans. 'If the office market had been buoyant there would have been much more pressure to get buildings back on line quickly,' says Mr Peter Gilder, district surveyor at the corporation. Plans are still being drawn up for the refurbishment of the NatWest Tower, the largest building damaged by the bomb. In December National Westminster Bank appointed design and engineering specialists to consider its options, which could involve a complete re-cladding of the building. Work is likely to begin in the late summer. Last year's bomb stimulated the take-up of 600,000 sq ft of office space and the withdrawal from the market of 500,000 sq ft of damaged offices, according to Savills, surveyors. Together with an upturn in demand from occupiers, this cut the amount of empty office space in the City by nearly a fifth last year.</p>

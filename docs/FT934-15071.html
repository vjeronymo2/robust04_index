			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O strong Transport and property group P&amp;O moved against the poor market trend after BZW recommended the stock. The securities house was said to have met with the company on Monday evening and yesterday issued the recommendation which saw the shares put on 6 to 594p, in trade of 1.8m. The stock has been a poor performer since a slide in the shares in early September which followed the release of figures that disappointed the market. Analysts and brokers from other securities houses remain cautious about the stock, not least because of the competition P&amp;O is likely to face with next year's planned opening of the Channel Tunnel. One analyst said: 'It is a little too early to start being positive on P&amp;O' A broker's recommendation helped Glynwed International stand out in an otherwise dull day in the engineering sector. The shares advanced 9 to 330p, after Smith New Court upgraded profit estimates. Leaving its current year estimate at Pounds 43m, the broker lifted the following year's forecast by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 61m, and penciled in Pounds 86m as its forecast for 1995. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith said the group has reported an improvement in a number of its business areas and 'growth in group earnings will accelerate the rate shown by the market by perhaps another year.' Disappointing interim figures that were accompanied by a warning of lower than forecast full-year profits hit FR Group, sending the shares tumbling 18 to 232p. British Aerospace moved 3 1/2 forward to 407p after James Capel was reported to be favourable on the stock. Strong two-way business following Monday's favourable figures, continued in automotive and aero-engine components group Lucas Industries. Turnover at the close stood at a hefty 7.6m, although the shares remained unchanged at 167p. Optimism over Wellcome ahead of next week's conference in New Orleans continued to buoy the shares and the price rose 8 to 736p. Volume was above average at 3.9m and Mr Peter Laing at Salomon Bros said the shares had begun to look oversold and looked ready to catch up ground lost to Glaxo and Fisons. The rest of the sector enjoyed similar investment interest with many of the stocks making steady progress. Glaxo added 3 to close at 668p with 5.6m shares traded; Fisons moved ahead a penny to 167p and Zeneca jumped 5 to 760p. Although some industry analysts are still cautious on drugs, one influential US brokerage, thought to be Wertheim Schroder, has just gone positive on the whole sector. Profit-taking was the main element in the food manufacturing sector, which earlier in the week had seen one of its increasingly few bright days. Northern Foods shed 5 to 265p, Hillsdown 5 to 162p and United Biscuits 3 to 363p. Food retailers also succumbed to profit-takers after their recent bounce. Argyll Group slipped 8 to 297p, J Sainsbury 10 to 427p and Tesco 4 to 209p. Talk of one broker trying to place a large line of Storehouse, left the shares unruffled at 207p. Boots, subject of speculation in recent sessions over its home improvement and drugs divisions, continued to climb, the shares adding 8 to 502p. The climb by United Newspapers of 15 to 538p was ascribed largely to a broker's upbeat presentation at a lunch for investors. An upbeat profits forecast for BSkyB from Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp ricocheted through stocks with an interest in the satellite broadcaster. Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, put on 14 to 542p, while Granada added 15 to 487p and News International gained 3 to 270p. Although the predictions were in line with most analysts' expectations, the effect on newspaper-orientated stocks was attributed by one industry specialist to the fact that investors have been lacking good news in the sector and are fearful of the imposition of VAT on newspapers. A steady climb was mustered by BOC which advanced 4 to 642p in moderate volume of 1.6m. The stock has been bolstered by a recent buy note from Hoare Govett which points to a healthy dividend. ICI fared poorly, losing 9 to 723p, albeit in low volume and without obvious motivation. The threat of an investigation into compact disc prices in the US undermined Thorn EMI, the shares retreating 19 to 933p. An investigation is already under way in the UK by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. CDs account for around 40 per cent of the group's profits. Selling just before the market close, said to be from the US, brought a sharp retreat in ADT and the shares closed 21 lower at 560p. Sentiment in the stock has been weak on fears that stake holder Laidlaw was about to dispose of its holding. Last week's profits warning from rival Automated Security has also dampened enthusiasm for the stock. Shares in Automated lost another 6 to 97p. McKechnie, which reports figures later this month, was in demand and the shares hardened 8 to 453p. News group Reuters was in favour, the shares adding 13 to 1531p, after an announcement that it had signed an agreement to distribute several key information data bases of Standard &amp; Poor's Equity services group in the US. UK airports operator BAA put on 4 to 882p after it said September traffic through its airports rose by 6.4 per cent to 8.1m passengers, on a year ago. There was further selling of Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel, following Monday's interim statement at which the company said it needs to raise a further Pounds 1bn by mid-May 1994. The shares fell 29 to 459p, with most of the day's trading once again said to have been carried out in Paris where the shares are also listed. The firm performance of the Hong Kong market helped Standard Chartered brush aside a reported profits downgrade from UBS. The shares finished 15 ahead at 1008p.</p>

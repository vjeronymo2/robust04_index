			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Marine insurers report improvement in results Rises in insurance rates paid by shipowners have led to an improvement in the results of London-based insurance companies specialising in marine insurance. The Institute of London Underwriters, which provides services to 74 London marine and aviation companies, said yesterday that its marine underwriters were experiencing the strongest upturn in rates for many years. Yet it warned that it would be some time before profitability was restored, following severe price competition and heavy losses in recent years. At least 18 companies withdrew from the market last year. The institute said 40 members had resigned since 1990. Mr Peter Evans, the institute's chairman, said: 'The London market is undergoing a transformation on a scale never seen before and at a speed hard to comprehend.' Institute companies - which account on the same three-year basis as Lloyd's  -said preliminary figures showed a strong rise in profitability last year. Premium income registered for hull business increased from Pounds 361m in the first year of the three-year 1991 account, to Pounds 624.2m for the first year of the 1993 account. In the same period hull claims rose to Pounds 63.5m from Pounds 60.5m. Underwriters saw a similar improvement in cargo and aviation business. Last year saw a sharp drop in marine casualties, with 121 vessels of 500 tonnes or more lost, compared with 134 in 1992. The value of ships lost in 1993 is expected to exceed the 1992 figure of Dollars 590m, when figures are finally confirmed. Aviation underwriters have also increased premium levels. Total losses of western-built jet airliners fell from 26 in 1992 to 22 in 1993, but the value of claims rose to Dollars 433m (Dollars 432m). Partial losses rose to 42 (Dollars 302m) in 1993 from 26 (Dollars 112m) in 1992.</p>

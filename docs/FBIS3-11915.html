Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia were there in a clear  expression of the Group of Three's [G-3] firm intention to  expand its sphere of commercial influence to the Caribbean.    The Caribbean Common Market, Caricom, sponsor of the idea,  presided over the meeting of experts and drafted the AEC  charter, which is scheduled to be signed by heads of state and  government in Barbados next July.    Cuba and the Dominican Republic, which have long been trying  to join Caricom, sent high-level delegations headed by deputy  ministers and expressed their special interest in expediting  their integration with the English-speaking Antillean states and  the rest of the Caribbean Basin member countries.    In addition, the disparity between the insular Caribbean  states and the so-called Latin American intermediate powers,  represented by the G-3, the powerful members in the future AEC,  could only be offset by maintaining indefinitely the current  protective approach by these powers in their relationship with  the Antilleans.    The Jamaica meeting defined terms such as categories of  participation, membership, goals, main bodies, decisionmaking  bodies, and financing, all key elements in starting the  organization, which will include some 38 territories.    One of the most intensely debated points was the degree of  participation in AEC, where relatively developed countries share  membership with countries barely out of metropolitan tutelage, a  few of which still are colonial possessions.    Apart from the structural differences among the members,  there persists a consensus on the need to create the AEC as soon  as possible as a general protection measure against the  difficult times ahead that will result from large economic and  commercial blocs.    Cuba's participation in AEC, something to which the United  States objects, was supported by a tacit consensus among the  participating experts at the Jamaica meeting. Caricom and G-3  leaders, however, had already made a political decision about  Cuba's participation as early as 1992.    Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said in  Kingston: "Cuba believes it has the duty and obligation to  fully support the efforts to create the AEC in light of Cuba's  cultural, geographic, historic, and economic ties with the area  countries."    In addition, Mexico, through its delegate Ambassador Luis  Ortiz Monasterio, said it intends to support this effort and to  strive to eliminate any obstacles that could hinder the creation  of the AEC.    In the opinion of the experts drafting the document to  create  the AEC, another meeting might be necessary before the proposal  is approved at the ministerial level. Once that stage is  complete, the presidents of the member countries will officially  create the AEC during the 15th Caricom summit in Barbados in  July.    This organization, devoted to stimulating cooperation and  commercial, cultural, economic, educational, and environmental  exchange, as well as political consensus among its member  countries, will for the first time begin to paint the dissimilar  faces of the countries looking toward the coasts of this sea or  immersed in its waters with the emerald shade of the Caribbean.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Banking on training Bank managers in Germany and the Netherlands take greater account of management experience, entrepreneurial skills, training and qualifications than their British counterparts when assessing business propositions. British bank managers, in contrast, place greater weight on financial criteria when assessing risk. These are among the findings of a three-country study of financing practices in the West Midlands, Baden-Wurttemberg and Twente by researchers from the University of Central England Business School. In Germany, in particular, bank managers were able to call on a range of additional information when assessing business plans. There was a high level of networking between business support organisations and rival banks. It is probably more difficult to get started in Baden-Wurttemberg because entrepreneurs are required to provide much more information to potential backers, but it is likely that start-ups are of a higher quality than in the UK, the researchers suggested. Partly because bank managers have more information about the businesses they back they are able to be more generous in their funding. In the West Midlands bankers were uncomfortable with gearing ratios of more than 1:1 while ratios of 2:1 were normal in Twente and as high as 5:1 in Baden-Wurttemberg. The UK venture capital sector is more highly developed in the UK but equity finance is often not available in the small amounts needed. In Germany equity is available from local stock exchanges, private investors and the banks. The study suggests policies which could be adopted in the West Midlands: closer co-operation between chambers of commerce, banks, colleges and local authorities; broader training by the banks to emphasise the importance of management skills; increased publicity for specialist funding schemes for, for example, high-tech firms. *Comparative European Practices in the Finance of Small Firms.

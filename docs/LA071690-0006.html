			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA BIAS ON ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> Can I believe my eyes? Just yesterday you finished an excellent, in-depth  series by Shaw on the extent of blatant pro-abortion bias in the media. Today,  as I open my paper (July 5, Page B2), I see that the listing of Los Angeles  area hot lines includes (of course) an abortion referral service but does not  include any of the pro-life agencies which exist to render medical, financial  and emotional support to those courageous young women who refuse to abort their  developing children. It kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?  </P> <P> ANN K. GRIVICH  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

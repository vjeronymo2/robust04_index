			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: High renewal rate helps Maid double to Pounds 440,000 Maid, the online business information supplier, more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 439,832, against Pounds 207,108, in the first half of the year. Turnover rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds 2.6m). The market anticipated the improvement, however, and the shares were unchanged at 74p, having moved up from 60p over the past few weeks. The company joined the main market at 110p in March, but saw its share price slide almost immediately reflecting worries about competition for customers and for sources of data available to the company. Its core services - Researchline, Newsline, Companyline and Brokerline  - provide business information in a variety of formats. Yesterday the company said that usage of its information services had increased by 68 per cent over the same period in 1993. New subscribers numbered more than 130 and renewal of subscriptions was more than 85 per cent. Earnings per share were 0.39p, against 0.24p. There is net cash of Pounds 10.7m. Mr Michael Mander, chairman, said that more than 50 companies were using a version of Maid designed to run under Lotus Notes, the leading software for groups. He also said that a version running under Microsoft Windows was expected to be launched in the first quarter of 1995.</p>

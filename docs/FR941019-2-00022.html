Statutory Authority and Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct; Pub. L. 102&hyph;486), the Secretary of Energy with the Energy Information Administration, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is required to establish a voluntary reporting system and database on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reductions of these gases, and carbon fixation. DOE is required to publish, after public comment, guidelines setting procedures for the accurate voluntary reporting of information on: (1) Greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis for the baseline period 1987 through 1990, and for subsequent calendar years; (2) annual reductions of greenhouse gases and carbon fixation achieved through any measure; and (3) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved voluntarily, or as a result of plant or facility closings, or as a result of State or Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidelines and supporting materials finalized today will assist those who wish to participate in determining or developing information capable of being reported. The reporting forms and database system required under Section 1605(b) are to be developed by EIA and must be consistent with the guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft guidelines and supporting materials were made available for public comment on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28345); that notice discusses the draft guidelines. A public hearing on the draft guidelines was held on June 29, 1994. The draft supporting document for the agricultural sector was made available June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33733). Comments were provided by individuals and associations representing: public interest environmental and land use groups; investor-owned and publicly-owned utilities; independent power producers; oil production and use; coal production and use; motor vehicle manufacturing and use; chemical manufacturing; and academic, commercial, and public interest forestry interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Organization of the Final Guidelines and Supporting Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments, the final guidelines and supporting materials have been re-organized from that presented in the draft. The coverage of each sector-specific supporting Part, however, is the same as that contained in the parallel Part of the draft documents. The final guidelines and supporting documents, DOE/PO&hyph;0028, are organized in three volumes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Volume 1_General Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volume 2_Sector-Specific Issues and Reporting Methodologies Supporting the General Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> Part 1_Electricity Supply Sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

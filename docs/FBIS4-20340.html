			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Correspondents Liu Shanxing (0491 0810 5281) and </F> Zheng Hui (6774 6540): "Deputy Chief of General Staff, Major  General Li Jing (2621 2529), Talks About a New Direction in  Military Training Throughout the Armed Forces During 1994"]    [Text] As one year ends and another one begins, this  journal's correspondents interviewed Major General Li Jin,  deputy chief of General Staff responsible for troop training  throughout the armed forces, about plans for doing a good job of  military training throughout the armed forces during the coming  year.    Pushing aside a thick stack of dispatches and telegrams on  his desk, General Li engaged enthusiastically in a cordial  exchange with the correspondents.    Correspondent: A new year has begun; spring has  returned. Military training of troops throughout the armed  forces in 1994 is about to begin in earnest. We would like to  ask Deputy Chief of General Staff Li to discuss how troop  training at the basic level can be improved.    The General: First, I would like to take this  opportunity to extend New Year's greetings via JIEFANGJUN  SHENGHUO to comrades throughout the armed forces, particularly  to the large numbers of officers and men at the basic level! I  want to express warm congratulations and cordial solicitude to  the advanced groups and advanced individuals who made a  contribution to military training throughout the armed forces  during 1993!    In talking about military training during 1994, I would  first  like to review briefly military training throughout the armed  forces during 1993. Overall, thanks to the correct leadership of  Central Military Affairs Committee and the common efforts of  officers and men throughout the armed forces, military training  of troops throughout the armed forces scored some very big  accomplishments in 1993. Leading cadres in the Central Military  Affairs Committee are satisfied with this. These accomplishments  were manifested primarily in the following: First, leaders at  all levels paid very close attention to military training work.  The central role of military training was rather well expressed,  and the understanding of the rank and file of officers and men  about the position and importance of military training in the  new era was clarified and deepened. The sense of urgency became  stronger. Second, was attention to changes in objective  circumstances, to advances made in modern warfare, and to  realities in the building of China's owned armed forces. Major  efforts were made in moving ahead with the study of high science  and technology, and both training reforms and the study of  tactics was intensified, many results obtained therefrom. Third  was extensive efforts to produce instructors and outstanding  staff officers having the "three skills" and the "four  abilities," and to train advanced units. Throughout the armed  forces a number of advanced individuals and groups also came to  the fore. Fourth was intensification and improvement of  ideological and political training in view of the new  circumstances and new problems under the socialist market  economy. This stirred cadres and men to love the armed forces  and cherish their weapons, and to train hard in skills for  killing the enemy. Troop training throughout the armed forces  was infused with vigor and vitality, a fine momentum of steady  development taking place.    Correspondents: What are the overall requirements  and the guiding thought in military training throughout the  armed forces in 1994?    The General: We will strive to make 1994 a bumper  harvest year for training reforms. We must realize clearly that  the international situation remains very serious. The world is  still not at peace. The possibility of limited wars and armed  clashes cannot be ruled out. Our military training is still a  long way from meeting the requirements of modern warfare.  Specifically, the characteristics of warfare under high  technology conditions that the Gulf War revealed pose many new  issues for military training. Therefore, the overall  requirements for military training throughout the armed forces  are to respond to situations as they develop and meet needs in  fighting a high technology war, to discharge the basic functions  of good military forces, train soldiers well, be prepared to  stand up to foreign aggression, and maintain the stable  environment needed for the building of socialism. We must adopt  a brand new posture, a spirit of reform, and a tenacious work  style to complete military training tasks in 1994. We must  increase, across the board, the ability of our armed forces to  win limited wars employing modern technology, particularly high  technology.    As for the guiding ideology, I feel the following five  points  to be of greatest importance: First is to use as a basic guide  Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng Xiaoping's thought about  the building of armed forces in the new era. These are the  summarization of the experiences of the older generation of  proletarian revolutionaries in the building of our armed forces  during the past several decades. They serve as the theoretical  basis for our good performance of all tasks, and they provide  fundamental support for maintenance of a correct orientation in  military training. Second is the need for thorough  implementation of the instructions of Military Affairs Committee  Chairman Jiang of "politically qualified, militarily superb, an  outstanding work style, strict and impartial discipline, and  strong support." This is the general requirement for our good  performance of all tasks, and it is also the combat goal of all  military training. Third is the need to focus on the winning of  limited wars using modern technology, particularly high  technology. This is an objective requirement for the development  of military combat now and for some time to come, and it is also  a basic point for military training. Fourth is the need to make  reform the main line in training. This is a basic means for  ensuring that military training continues to meet circumstances  and steadily moves ahead. It is also a basic force for  increasing the pertinence of training for outstanding  fulfillment of military training tasks. Fifth is the need to  apply training laws and regulations, strictly regulating  training according to law. This provides important support for  better building of regularized armed forces and improvement of  training quality.    Correspondent:Deputy Commander Li, you jut  referred to the need for all military units to devote major  efforts, in accordance with Military Affairs Committee leaders'  instructions, to improvement of ability to win limited wars  using modern technology, particularly high technology. Applied  to the basic level, just what are the main things that must be  done?    The General: I believe that completion of the new  year's military training mission will require that every unit,  particularly the rank and file of officers and men at the basic  level, show achievements in the following several regards:    First is the need to reform training in a positive and  innovative way so that military training will be better able to  meet the needs of modern warfare. Despite the numerous  achievements made during 10 years of training reforms, which  have spurred the development of military training, we still must  realize that military matters constantly change. Old problems  are solved only to have new problems appear. This is a basic law  of the development of things. This applies to military training  as well, and it requires that advances must be sought in the  course of steadily solving new problems. Current events show  fundamental changes have taken place in the strategic world  situation. Science and technology have developed rapidly, and  have been widely applied to the military realm. The weaponry,  military thinking, and combat style of military forces of all  countries have developed substantially. Consequently, modern  warfare has a high technology character, which poses new  challenges for military training. Responding to circumstances  and meeting challenges requires that officers and men throughout  the armed forces focus on the new circumstances and new features  of military combat under the new circumstances. They must rouse  themselves to vigorous efforts, study assiduously, carry on  traditions, dare to innovate, and link training to practice.  They must boldly reform the content, the organization, the  methods, the techniques, the management, and the support of  training. They must find new tactics and new training methods  that meet the needs of combat under the conditions of modern  technology, particularly high technology.    Second, cadres in general, and key cadres in particular,  must  strive to improve military quality. They must improve the  organization of training and ability to lead troops in battle.  Basic level military officers and squad leaders are the ones who  organize and lead the military training of units at the platoon  and squad levels. They are the ones who must carry out  instructions from above. Troop training depends on their  organization and implementation. The military caliber and the  organizational abilities of basic level officers and squad  leaders have a direct bearing on the quality of military  training. Therefore, major efforts must be put into the  improvement of military quality and organization and command  skills. I hope that our basic officers and squad leaders will  study diligently Mao Zedong military thought and Deng Xiaoping  thought for the building of armed forces in the new era. This is  the basic way to master the standpoint, the point of view, and  the methods of the older generation of revolutionaries in  building the armed forces and directing combat to establish a  correct combat outlook and methodology. They must strive to  study modern science and technology. This is a required course  in the study of modern warfare and mastery of modern warfare.  Diligent study of modern military thought, combat theory, and  command techniques are important ingredients in improving the  level of military training and increasing organizational and  command skills. Efforts during this year must bring about new  changes in cadres in general and key cadres in particular.    Third is the need for diligent study of military skills to  improve units' basic quality and live warfare capabilities.  Superb military skills and specialized skills are the product of  scientific training in combination with diligent training.  Officers and men throughout the armed forces must employ  scientific methods in the training of soldiers. They must put  major efforts into activities for the rigorous training of crack  troops. New soldiers entering the armed forces in 1994 must be  given a good grounding in political ideology, military skills,  work style discipline, and physical condition. Old soldiers must  receive training that makes them jacks of many trades and  masters of one, efforts made to improve their ability to carry  out combat tasks. We must continue activities that produce  "sharpshooter riflemen, sharpshooter gunners, and skilled  technicians," and instructors and staff officer professionals  having "four abilities" to provide superb training personnel. We  must improve combat logistics training, live ammunition, live  explosion, and live input training, and psychological training.  Units having requisite conditions must train personnel to swim  while carrying weapons and bayonet training. The difficulty and  intensity of training must be increased. Bivouac training must  be organized in a planned way, training given to provide skill  in fighting, eating, living, and hiding while on the move. The  nighttime training times and requirements that training plans  provide must be followed to provide combat training using  nighttime techniques. Combat exercises above the platoon level  must be conducted continuously day and night in an effort to  improve troops ability to fight under modern technology,  particularly high technology, conditions.    Fourth is the need to intensify coordinated training for  constant improvement of the total warfare capabilities of all  service arms and branches of service. Integrated training and  combined warfare are important trends in modern warfare, and  they are also important tasks in the intensification of reform.  All service arms and branches, and all specialties must improve  their sense of being part of a whole and their outlook on the  overall situation. By training level by level, working in  coordination level by level, and shaping a total combat  capability level by level, they can first bring about a  coordination of forces within their own branches of service and  service arms, and then bring about a coordination of all  branches of services in all service arms. They must lay a  foundation around the combining of forces to learn skills based  on tactics. Through sustained efforts, they can raise the  combined combat capabilities of China's armed forces to a new  level.    At the end of the interview, Deputy Chief of General Staff  Li  asked the correspondents to tell all military commanders the  following through JIEFANGJUN SHENGHUO: "The whole year's work  depends on a good start in spring." He hopes that units  throughout the armed forces will painstakingly plan and carry  out training during the coming year in accordance with  instructions from the Central Military Affairs Committee and the  General General Staff, make full ideological preparations,  organizational preparations, teaching preparations, and material  preparations to do a good job of training, and ensure that units  begin training on time, thereby creating good conditions for  satisfactory fulfillment of military training tasks in 1994.</p>

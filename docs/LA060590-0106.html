			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Jailbirds for Jesus: A group of convicted murderers and other criminals in  Nashville, Tenn., have recorded four gospel songs in hopes of repaying the  victims of their misdeeds. The New Faith Singers, made up of a dozen Tennessee  State Penitentiary inmates, recorded their songs for Warner Bros., which has  the option of releasing the music.  </P> <P> Songwriter and minister Moses Dillard is promoting the singers and said he will  ask Gov. Ned McWherter to move them to a minimum-security prison so they can  get out to perform for churches, schools and civic groups. Dillard organized  the singers while ministering to them in prison. He said the state refused to  allow them to leave for recording sessions, so a temporary studio was built in  the prison chapel. Two studio musicians came in every day to back up the  singers.

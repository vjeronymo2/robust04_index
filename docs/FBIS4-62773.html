"In connection with the appointment of a new minister for  nationalities and regional policy, even without taking formally  into account the opinion of the vice-premier in charge of the  nationalities and regional policy, I request you to release me  from the post of deputy prime minister," the document says.    "I'd like to hope that the appointment of a new minister is  not connected with my order on financial inspection at the  former state committee for the north's affairs as well as with  the pressure of various groups from the Krasnodar Territory and  their representatives in Moscow," Shakhray stressed.    According to Shakhray, his resignation "does not mean he  would join the opposition to the president and the government  and does not mean any personal offence", "although I'm also a  man", he added.    He noted that his resignation points to his unwillingness to  hold up to any posts. [as received]    He did not feel any resentment against the president or the  government, and he would not make any opposition statements,  Shakhray assured. "I hope they have no grounds to make serious  reproaches against me," he said, adding that he had no conflicts  either with the president or the premier. "I have not got any  reprimands for the nationalities and regional policy," Shakhray  underlined.    The vice-premier singled out in the statement achievements  scored by his Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy.  Firstly, the ministry ended to draft the concept of a state  regional policy. [as received]    Secondly, the concept of a state policy towards Cossacks has  been drafted. Thirdly, the drafting of a concept on local  self-rule and and national-cultural autonomy is nearing  completion.

The draft economic agreements and draft treaties with the  Kaliningrad region, Kabardino-Balkaria and Bashkiria have been  prepared. Cooperation with inter-regional economic associations  has been started. The government drafted and initialled the  general agreement with all the eight inter-regional economic  associations.    The ministry laid foundations to normalise relations with  the  Chechen republic and to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.  "The consistent and active work with members of the federation  ensured their support for the president and the government  during the days of difficult political crises," Shakhray noted.  He wished great success to new Minister Nikolay Yegorov.    Speaking about his deputies at the Ministry for  Nationalities  and Regional Policy, the ex-minister specified that Ramazan  Abdulatipov left the ministry right after his election to the  post of deputy speaker of the Russian parliament upper house.

"There will be no avalache consequences of my resignation  for  my party colleagues," he continued. "My resignation does not  change the attitude of the PRES to the president and the  government.

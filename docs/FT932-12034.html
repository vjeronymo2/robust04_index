			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Tenfold interest rate rise urged on Russia THE RUSSIAN central bank should raise interest rates tenfold to more than 1,000 per cent to reduce inflation and remove economic instability, a top official from the International Monetary Fund said yesterday. Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, deputy director of the IMF's division dealing with the former Soviet Union, said too soft a monetary policy had allowed a surge in credit in Russia. This was 'clearly excessive' and underlined efforts to transform the country into a market economy. Mr Hernandez-Cata's strong words underline concern by many western observers that Russia should be stepping up its own efforts towards economic reform as a condition for receiving large financial assistance from the industrial world. He said there was a clear need to increase Russian interest rates, now at about 100 per cent, to more than the annual rate of inflation, now running above 1,000 per cent. Such high rates of interest would 'hopefully' be needed only for a short time to check over-loose monetary conditions, Mr Hernandez-Cata said. He said that the surge in borrowing - much of which has gone to struggling industrial enterprises - had both led to rapidly rising prices and a depreciation of the rouble. Because of the unstable economic conditions it had also contributed to large amounts of money being transferred out of Russia. 'We have advised the Russian central bank at all levels to make price stability its fundamental priority,' said Mr Hernandez-Cata. 'Industrial policy and selective resource allocation should not be the preserve of the central bank.' A problem identified by the IMF is that the Russian central bank is answerable to parliament rather than President Boris Yeltsin's government. As a result, it has frequently not acted in concert with Mr Yeltsin over plans for economic reform. Mr Hernandez-Cata said he was encouraged by the results of the Russian referendum which he hoped would strengthen Mr Yeltsin's hand in pushing for change. He contrasted Russia's handling of monetary policy with the actions of Estonia and Latvia which he said had both made considerable efforts to bring down inflation by tough monetary policies presided over by their central banks.</p>

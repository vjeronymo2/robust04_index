			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Unloved Electra battles to overcome suspicions - Philip Coggan on the performance of a very different financial animal / Investment Trusts ELECTRA is a completely different animal from the other trusts profiled so far in this series: one statistic makes that clear. Shares in some of the popular trusts, such as TR City of London, stand close to asset value, or at a premium; Electra shares are trading at a 34 per cent discount. What makes Electra shares so apparently unpopular is that the trust specialises in unquoted investments. There have been so many disasters in trusts of this kind - at Drayton Consolidated and Ensign, for example - that investors have become naturally suspicious. As the graph shows, recent performance has been poor. Net asset value at the end of the trust's last financial year was still below its level at the end of September 1987, and was nearly 20 per cent below its peak at end September 1989. In the wake of that decline and the widening of the discount, the shares have underperformed the All-Share substantially early in the 1990s. The recession has tended to be the problem. Unquoted companies often are small and concentrated on a particular sector, so they are vulnerable to a downturn in their area. Electra also had investments in many major management buyouts; such companies normally have high borrowings and thus suffered heavily from high interest rates when Britain was in the exchange rate mechanism. And liquidity is a problem; it is difficult to sell a stake in an unquoted company in the middle of a recession. All these problems have, inevitably, led to questions about the valuation of Electra's stocks. There is normally an element of subjectivity in valuing an unquoted portfolio; and investors have been alarmed by the drastic write-downs of assets announced by other trusts in the sector. What the wide discount on Electra's shares seems to indicate is that the market fears that its valuations might be over-optimistic. The trust argues that it follows the guidelines set down by the British Venture Capital Association in this field; in its annual report, it cites its 'prudent and consistent view' on valuation. Over a third of its unquoted holdings are valued with reference to market prices, it says. Electra grew out of the old Cable &amp; Wireless company, as a vehicle for holding the group's overseas licences. When C&amp;W was nationalised in 1948, Electra was left as a separate investment company, eventually becoming part of the empire of Globe, once the UK's largest investment trust. The trust is managed by Electra Kingsway, which also runs a large private partnership fund investing in development stocks. The investment trust takes part in the same deals as the private fund. Electra is an international trust; it has 34 per cent of its assets in the US, where the recovery seems to have started; and if recovery also comes to the UK, small companies on both sides of the Atlantic will benefit. Lower interest rates have already eased the problems of the more heavily-borrowed companies. Electra is by far the largest investment trust in the development capital sector, with a market capitalisation of around Pounds 370m. Investments are made by five teams of executives (three in the UK, one in the US and one in France) who work for managing director Hugh Mumford; there is a further team of ex-industrialists which monitors the companies in the portfolio. Because of its concentration in unquoted stocks, private investors may not have heard of many of the trust's 10 largest holdings. At September 30, they were Nimex Resources, Parker Pen, Unipart, German government bonds, Head Insurance, Ryan Group, RJR Associates, Electra Kingsway Managers, Jarvis Hotels, and Orthofix International Investments. The Parker Pen investment shows how one success can make up for many disappointments in the venture capital area. After selling off various tranches of its holding, the effective original cost of Electra's investment in Parker is just Pounds 100,000; the value of its holding (dependent on a bid from Gillette) at end-September was Pounds 23.6m. The question for investors is whether the position of Electra represents a buying opportunity. There are some bullish arguments. For a start, Electra has proved the case for investing in unquoted stocks over the long term; its net asset value has more than trebled since 1982 and it has increased its dividend every year since it was listed in 1976. Furthermore, around 30 per cent of Electra's portfolio is in quoted stocks, which help provide the income to pay the dividend. In another investment trust, such stocks might be valued on a discount of, say, 10 per cent. That means the effective discount on the unquoted shares is even greater than 34 per cent, and allows for a lot of bad news. But Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, points out that unquoted stocks tend to be valued on a historic basis. Accordingly, when Electra next values its holdings, it will still feel the impact of the recession. It could be some time, therefore, before the trust's net asset value moves sharply upwards. And while the trust might be good value for the private investor in the long term, Aaron says, there is not much prospect for growth over the next six to nine months. Key facts In mid-December, when the trust last valued its assets officially, the net assets per share were 297p. Its share price on Friday morning was 214p; and County NatWest estimates the discount at 34.9 per cent. The market capitalisation on Friday morning was Pounds 370m and the yield was 4.2 per cent. Board Electra has a large board, with four executive and seven non-executive directors. The executives are Michael Stoddart (chairman), Mumford, Clive Clague and David Osborne; the non-executives include Tom King, the former defence secretary, Lord Vinson, Sir Christopher Wates and Michael Pickard, chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation. Savings scheme details The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. Maximum dealing charges are 0.25 per cent. Because of its concentration in unquoted stocks, Electra does not qualify for Pep status.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / BCCI deal on claims may be signed A DEAL under which the majority shareholders of Bank of Credit and Commerce International would contribute up to Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to creditors of the failed bank could be signed within a week. This follows six months of negotiation between Touche Ross, the failed bank's court-appointed administrators, and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. Under the deal, all claims and counter-claims between the two sides would be dropped, according to a draft of the agreement produced recently. This would include the liquidators agreeing not to pursue Dollars 4bn of claims against Abu Dhabi relating to promissory notes given last spring. Other main terms are: The remaining assets of all parts of the BCCI group would be pooled, and all creditors would receive the same pay-out. This would prevent protracted legal actions between liquidators of different parts of the group. The liquidators and majority shareholders would co-operate to pursue claims against any third parties, such as the group's auditors, and would share the proceeds of any actions. The deal would only come into effect if creditors owed at least Dollars 7bn between them accepted the terms. Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in BCCI have issued a strenuous rebuttal of statements from Hong Kong suggesting that the sheikhdom had not yet provided a promised guarantee against unrecorded liabilities in the sale negotiations for BCC Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SENATOR WOULD LINK INSURANCE, ZIP CODE  </P> <P> Calling Proposition 103 a "fraud," a state lawmaker who represents eight rural  Northern California counties proposed a constitutional amendment reinstating  territorial ratings as the chief factor in setting automobile insurance rates.  Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Rohnert Park), vice chairman of the Senate Insurance,  Claims and Corporations Committee, said banning the use of ZIP codes to price  insurance under Proposition 103 unfairly forces rural drivers to subsidize  insurance rates paid by urban dwellers. Nielsen contended that urban areas have  a higher likelihood of accidents, lawsuits and fraudulent claims.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD AS CENSOR  </P> <P> In his Aug. 29 article "Box-Office Short Circuit for 'Wired,' " Jack Mathews  gives striking information about an apparently widespread desire within the  Hollywood community to prevent the public from seeing the film about John  Belushi.  </P> <P> Flashback to summer of 1988: Controversy rages around the film treatment of  another public figure for whom people have highly personal feelings -- Jesus  Christ. A movement forms to halt release of Martin Scorsese's "The Last  Temptation of Christ." In reaction, the creative arena is outraged, labeling  the protesters enemies of art and freedom.  </P> <P> If the creative community is willing to use its power to suppress any  "distasteful" project, how effective will it be in protecting its art the next  time the specter of censorship arises? The defenders of art must be credible!  </P> <P> MICHAEL FARQUHAR, Los Angeles  </P></p>

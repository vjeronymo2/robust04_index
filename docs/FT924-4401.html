			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bleak winter for industrial Japan - Sharp falls in profits reflect weak demand FOR THE past few weeks, haggard corporate executives have filled the press room of the Tokyo stock exchange, painting daily a bleak picture of company balance sheets and earnings prospects. The latest six-month reporting season has been a grim business, with Japanese companies turning in their steepest profit declines in 17 years. Hopes for an early economic recovery have dimmed. Most companies have announced cuts in executive salaries, staff and capital spending. Japanese manufacturers have been hit by weak domestic demand and high depreciation. Some of the country's most famous companies have announced losses - and the pattern of returns would have been far worse but for the way large sections of industry deferred losses on securities investments. For the six months to September, pre-tax profits at Japan's leading 516 manufacturers fell 38 per cent on average, and the Nomura Research Institute is predicting a 30 per cent fall in earnings for the full year to March 1993. The sharp profit falls at carmakers and electronics companies reflect the severe decline in domestic consumer spending. Electronics makers - notably Matsushita - have been hit by market saturation of video machines, televisions and stereos, and the sated consumer appetite for upgraded versions of appliances. Matsushita, the largest consumer electronics maker, posted a 66 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits, while Sony fell 61 per cent. The rise in inventories forced NEC and Sanyo Electric to hand out vouchers as part of employees' winter bonus payments. Carmakers were hurt by a 20 per cent fall in new car sales. Nissan Motor (which saw its first pre-tax loss) and Mazda (which posted a 73 per cent profits fall) were hit by surging depreciation costs due to aggressive capital investments. The weakness in the motor and electronic industries filtered through to the machinery, materials and chemicals sectors. The steel industry saw a 60 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. NKK maintained pre-tax profits, but had to take in a Y13bn (Dollars 104.83m) profit on stock sales to do so: Kobe Steel did not include appraisal losses on securities for the half-year. Many industrial equipment makers misjudged the sharp fall in capital spending. Minebea, the world leader in miniature bearings, posted special losses of Y2.4bn due to inventory liquidations at NMB Semiconductor, its semiconductor subsidiary, and other affiliates. Companies which at the peak of the bull market used valuation gains on securities investments to bolster earnings saw the value of their holdings tumble. With the Nikkei average down 55 per cent from its 1989 peak, Minebea posted a Y2.9bn valuation loss. Fuji Heavy Industries increased profits for the first time in three years by postponing a write-off of Y1.2bn for stock appraisal losses. The prolonged weakness of the Tokyo stock market also hurt those companies which raised finance through equity-linked bonds in the late 1980s. Since the funds were raised when stock prices were at their peak, many equity-linked instruments have failed to be exercised, leaving companies with redemptions on bonds. For example, Wacoal, the leading underwear maker, repaid investors for warrant bonds worth Y11.6bn. Redemptions of convertible and warrant bonds are expected to peak next year, with some Y10,000bn worth of paper maturing. Wacoal said its cash in hand and deposits fell due to the repayment, leading to a decline in interests received. Many other companies have also dipped into their cash reserves due to the fall in sales and profits. In contrast, high-technology toymakers posted strong profit increases, with pre-tax profits surging 83 per cent to Y27.4bn at Sega Enterprises, the video game maker. Its rival, Nintendo, improved by 5.5 per cent to Y80.2bn. Aoki International and Aoyama Trading, retailers of cheap office workers' uniform blue suits, saw firm increases in sales and profits. The key elements of an earnings recovery will be capital spending and domestic demand. But the outlook is gloomy. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry says companies are planning to cut capital investment for the year ending March 1993 by 11.9 per cent and heading for a similar cut for the year ending March 1994. Economists are reluctant to predict a rebound in consumer demand. However, construction companies - major beneficiaries of the government's public works projects - may lead the way to an earnings recovery. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, is recommending leading exporting companies, such as electronics groups, on the back of the yen's expected weakness against the dollar together with a recovery in the US economy. Japanese manufacturers are clearly trying to adjust to low growth, and may emerge leaner and stronger from the sharp profit downturn. However, with companies slow to implement use the sort of painful measures taken by Japan's western counterparts - notably in relation to workforce levels - any earnings recovery may take longer than most Japanese executives hope.  ---------------------------------------           JAPANESE INDUSTRY        % declines year on year  --------------------------------------- Sector                Sales      Pre-tax                                   profit  --------------------------------------- Pulp and paper         4.8         60.7 Chemicals              3.5         38.0 Steels                 7.4         60.7 Pharmaceuticals*       4.4          4.0 Machinery              8.8         50.0 Electronics            5.5         54.9 Motors and components  1.6         52.8  --------------------------------------- *Increase  --------------------------------------- Source: Wako Research Institute  ---------------------------------------</p>

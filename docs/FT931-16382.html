			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / People: Chairman for Aitken Hume Bank Bill Brown, who retired from Standard Chartered in 1991 having joined the Chartered Bank back in 1954, is taking on the chairmanship of Aitken Hume Bank; he also becomes a non-executive director of the parent, banking and fund management group Aitken Hume International. He succeeds Stuart Graham, a past chief general manager and group chief executive of Midland Bank, who is retiring at 71. Brown spent 30 years in the Far East, mostly in Hong Kong but with spells in Japan, Singapore and Thailand. He returned to London when Rodney Galpin moved from the Bank of England to become chairman and chief executive of Standard Chartered in 1988. Brown's last executive role before retiring at 60 was as deputy chairman, but he is still on the board in a non-exec-utive capacity. He describes Aitken Hume Bank, which specialises in private banking, as a natural fit for him. 'Most of my good friends are high net worth individuals from overseas territories.' Aitken Hume International's major shareholders are Lee Ming Tee of Hong Kong and Syrian-born businessman Wafic Said. Since retiring, Brown has also taken up non-executive positions at the Korean Export/Import Bank and at Hong Kong Investment Trust, part of the Jupiter Tyndall stable. He will be part-time, spending two or three days a fortnight there, according to the bank. In the past the group has been beset by management upheaval; in the mid-1980s Timothy Aitken was ousted from the board. His cousin and co-founder Jonathan Aitken stepped down from the deputy chairmanship when he became defence procurement minister after the last election. Brown says he believes the group is back on 'an even keel - otherwise I wouldn't have joined.' He points to a new management team in place, including David Griffith, who joined last February and took on the new role of managing director of the bank in April, and Bruce Robinson, who joined as a director in June. In November, Aitken Hume put out a statement that it was in talks with a potential bidder - assumed at the time to be one of the principal shareholders - but has not commented further. Brown, who says he was approached by Graham about the job and had already agreed to take it on before the bid announcement, reckons his position is unlikely to be affected whatever the outcome.</p>

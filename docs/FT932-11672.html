			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Matsushita ends electronics partnership with Philips MATSUSHITA Electrical Industrial is to spend Y185bn (Pounds 1.09bn) to buy out Philips of the Netherlands from their loss-making joint venture in semiconductors. The deal will end one of the most enduring partnerships in electronics between a Japanese and European company. For Philips, the divestment of its 35 per cent stake in the joint venture, Matsushita Electronics Corporation, is a significant step forward in efforts to cut its debts of Fl 15bn (Pounds 5.40bn). Matsushita - the world's largest consumer electronics company which only two and a half years ago paid Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.96bn) for MCA, the Hollywood film company - plans to pay for the transaction by the end of this month by drawing on retained earnings. Philips has repeatedly said it would not sell entire divisions or reduce its 80 per cent stake in PolyGram, the London-based music company, as a quick way of easing its debt burden. The MEC sale will meet the key goal of debt reduction without reneging on previous promises or weakening the company's overall position in semiconductors and components. The sale follows months of haggling over the price after Philips first approached Matsushita last autumn. Matsushita said the partners had decided to break up the joint venture because its operations had become too large and complex and its decision-making too cumbersome. Matsushita executives said MEC's expansion into semiconductor markets outside Japan had brought the joint venture into increasing conflict with Philips' own semiconductor business. MEC employs 18,000 of its 22,000 total workforce in Japan. It manufactures semiconductors in Japan, the US and Singapore and cathode ray tubes in the US, Malaysia and China. Philips will not say how large a book profit the transaction will yield. The company will hold a press conference on Wednesday to announce first-quarter results. MEC, which is valued at Y528.5bn by the sale, is the world's 10th largest semiconductor manufacturer. It will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matsushita, its main customer for semiconductors. According to Dataquest, the research group, MEC had semiconductor sales worth Dollars 1.93bn last year. The joint venture was set up in 1952, with Matsushita keen to gain access to Philips' innovative technology and Philips aspiring to break into the Japanese market. Like Philips, Matsushita's finances are under severe strain. It is being hard hit by the slump in Japanese consumer spending and carries a heavy depreciation charge for past acquisitions. See Lex</p>

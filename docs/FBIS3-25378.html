A  communique issued by the military command says some of the  agents have entered Cabinda through the Chimbuande border post  in Lower Zaire, while others have crossed the Matadi and Boma  border posts toward M'banza Congo. The intention is to cause  unrest behind UNITA lines and to link up with units of the  People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA]  involved in the Bengo offensive.    Details of the enemy plans were gathered from an agent  captured by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FALA]. Agent (Ndombasse Garcias de Jesus Vicente) was trained  in Cuba and integrated a five-man sabotage team. He said the  operation is backed by Zaire's intelligence services in  coordination with the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] embassy in Kinshasa. The military  command says the agents were behind the recent attacks on  fishermen in Quissanga.    The Northern Front's General Staff has advised the Zairian  Government not to let its territory be used as a springboard for  attacks on UNITA as this would internationalize the conflict.  FALA says it will not tolerate any provocations, though  measures have been taken to prevent any incidents. The  communique reiterates UNITA's willingness to establish and  strengthen good relations with all its neighbors.    Meanwhile, FALA's Eastern Command today denied reports  carried by the government-controlled JORNAL DE ANGOLA according  to which UNITA was attacking FAPLA positions. The command says  the report fits within the framework of communist regimes'  strategy of fabricating evidence. The source noted that Luanda  wanted to convince the world that UNITA was involved in a  general offensive, but when the MPLA-PT regime realized that  relief operations depended on security, the Eduardo dos Santos  group changed its tune and called for aid from every quarter.  The fact is that there has never been any clashes in the  region. UNITA has assured the World Food Program and other  relief agencies that they can safely distribute aid in areas  controlled by the MPLA or in UNITA-administered territory. The  source added that independent sources can confirm the situation.</p>

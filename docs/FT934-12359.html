			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Management: The unions step on board - The US steel industry is taking part in an experiment in employee involvement After 10 years of losses, lay-offs and falling market share, the US's biggest steel companies have come up with a new way to improve their competitiveness: allow union representatives on to their boards. Five of the six big integrated steel companies have already concluded agreements with the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) in a move which amounts to one of the most far-reaching experiments in employee involvement undertaken in any US industry. US Steel, the country's biggest producer, could follow suit later this week, if company and union negotiators meet their deadline of reaching a new labour agreement by Friday. No other US industry has ever experimented with union involvement on this scale. Individual companies, most notably Chrysler, have conceded board seats to their unions in the past, but the practice has never taken root across an entire industry before. The agreements also provide for union involvement in committees at all levels of management. Yet the benefits of worker participation on this scale remain unproven. Will it make any difference to the flagging fortunes of the big steel companies, which are struggling to catch up with newer, un-unionised competitors? And will the changes turn out to be anything more than temporary, just another phase in 'Big Steel's' long decline? The US's six big integrated steel companies (those involved in every step of steel production, from making the coke for use in their furnaces, to rolling out and coating finished steel sheets) have already cut their combined workforce from 270,000 at the start of the 1980s to fewer than 100,000 now. They have invested more than Dollars 13bn (Pounds 9.2bn) between them in the past decade to become more efficient. However, with overcapacity in the worldwide steel industry and the inroads made by the small 'mini-mills' and reconstituted mills at home, a return to sustained profitability remains elusive. In new six-year accords struck with the USWA this summer, four companies - Inland, followed by Bethlehem, National and Armco - agreed to appoint union representatives to their boards and to adopt extensive co-management arrangements. A fifth, LTV, has activated a similar plan since coming out of bankruptcy protection at the end of June. There are two ways to explain the development. One - espoused publicly by the companies and the union - is that giving workers more of a say will lead to more efficient production methods and make the companies more competitive. 'It's kind of an unorthodox way of dealing with the problem,' says John Jacobson of Wefa Group, an economic research company. 'But they haven't been very successful with anything else they've tried.' The other, more cynical, view is that companies find it easier to lay off workers or overhaul their working practices if they adopt a less confrontational approach to labour relations: it is difficult for union leaders to oppose big changes if they have been closely involved in their origin. According to some labour relations experts, this motivation may lie behind many of the attempts in the US at employee participation since the mid-1980s. 'When companies have excess capacity, this could be a way of making the cutbacks more palatable,' says John Dunlop, a former US labour secretary and chairman of a commission set up by the Clinton administration in March to look at the legal framework for labour relations in the US. Either way, the agreements should have an indirect benefit for the steel companies in the short term. In return for the promises of greater participation in management and a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies, steelworkers have agreed to a freeze in basic pay for the next two years and to greater job flexibility. But it is less clear whether the participation agreements will yield the sort of sustained productivity improvements their supporters claim. There are at least two reasons why some of the hoped-for productivity gains could prove elusive. First, and perhaps most important, old attitudes on both sides of the union/management divide die hard. Labour relations in the industry have traditionally been adversarial, says John Goodwin, manager of US Steel's Gary, Indiana, plant, the biggest in the US. 'We've got a long way to go - we've got 80 years of history to overcome.' Second, there are very different perceptions of what closer union involvement in management actually means. Will the union's representatives have an influence over strategic and other decisions taken by the big steel companies, or are they simply being invited into the executive suite to observe? Both sides talk glibly of a new-style 'partnering' approach to management, preferring to hide behind this piece of management-school jargon rather than face up to the real question: does the new approach amount to a form of co-management, or simply as an extended exercise in worker communication? 'What they (the union) want is to see what's happening and why decisions are made, rather than trying to take decisions themselves,' says Joseph Emig, manager of Bethlehem Steel's plant at Burns Harbour in northern Indiana, which is now the home of the US steel industry. Some union officials appear to agree. Jack Parton, director of the USWA's East Chicago district, says: 'I can't run a steel mill. I didn't go to business school, and I don't intend to go to business school now.' He and other officials have recently been invited to attend the regular fortnightly meeting of senior Inland Steel executives, called to review progress against the company's plans. They are not there to second-guess the line managers whose responsibility it is to meet certain targets, he says. But other union representatives talk of more positive involvement and it seems unlikely that they would sit passively as decisions were taken that would harm their members' interests. The difference of perception is most acute when it comes to the question of board-level representation. The steel companies point to the legal responsibilities the union's directors will face. 'The first, foremost and only obligation of every director is to represent the interests of shareholders,' says an official at Inland Steel. Union members, though, cling to the idea that the directors they nominate will represent their interests, not those of the shareholders. To some, it seems like an opportunity to fight the old union/management battle from the inside. 'Boards give their management people golden handcuffs - we hope we will now be able to put a stop to things like that,' says Andy Hopkins, a tractor driver at Bethlehem's Burns Harbour plant and a part-time union official. Doug Frazer, a former head of the United Auto Workers, agrees. In the 1970s, he became the first union leader to sit on the board of a leading US company when he was appointed a director of Chrysler. Union-appointed directors are there to fight for the interests of workers, he says. They also have a right to tell their members everything their boards do. 'I said that as far as I was concerned, nothing was confidential. There's not enough openness in these large organisations.' Such comments send shudders through secrecy minded executives. But, in practice, the union-nominated directors are likely to be able to exert little direct influence, even if they wanted to. 'It will not make a difference to the way the company operates. But if it makes all our employees understand better why decisions are taken, it will help,' says Curtis Barnette, chairman of Bethlehem. It is also questionable whether the new arrangements will stand the test of time. The history of US labour relations is littered with similar examples of experiments at employee involvement that did not last. It takes a crisis to encourage companies to let workers on to their boards, says Frazer. When Chrysler had returned from the brink, the union seat was quietly dropped. 'I think they stole that seat from us,' says Frazer. If all the big steel companies agree to let union representatives on to their boards, the experiment this time could at least prove longer lasting.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLEISCHMAN ON ABORTION  </P> <P> The logic of Fleischman's point of view is irrefutable. It is refreshing to  read an analysis that removes the advocacy component of the abortion  discussion.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, this perspective does not sway legislatures to pass  anti-abortion laws, nor masses to march for choice. We are stuck with  emotionalism, illogic, polarization and, I fear, no resolution or compromise.  </P> <P> Abortion has become the central, hysterical issue in many American communities.  Rather, the debate should be conducted within the context of other tough  choices of life and death with which society must deal.  </P> <P> MARILYN GAIMS  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

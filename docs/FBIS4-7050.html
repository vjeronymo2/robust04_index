			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kawi Chongkhittawon: "Arms Register: Thailand </F> Must Allay Fears"]    [Text] Thailand is facing a big dilemma on whether to  join the UN Register of Conventional Arms [UNRCA]. The majority  of Thai military leaders are still very reserved and treat the  country's arms data as a national secret.    However, the call for more transparency on arms has also  been  heard in recent months from a small quarter of liberal Thai  military thinkers. They view Thailand's willingness to report  to the UN on its arms holding and purchases as part of  confidence building measures in the region -- some gestures  which Thailand can undertake right away.    In recent months, there had been some effort to adopt  "openness" within the Thai armed forces. For example, for the  first time in Thai history, the Supreme Command Headquarters  decided to come up with a "Defence White Paper", which contains  Thailand's short and longterm views on security matters.    Although the content of the white paper was revised and  subsequently toned down, particularly sections relating to  Thailand's policy towards neighbouring countries, it is still a  remarkable document. It reveals parts of the hearts and minds  of Thai military strategists.    Since the end of Cold War, the need to have more  transparency  in defence procurements has been widely debated and eventually  accepted as one of the trust-building measures for the region.  Somehow, quite a few military leaders here believe vehemently  that Thailand's security could be further compromised if Bangkok  adheres to the UN arms register.    To the Thai military, the prevailing idea is that an arms  register could mean disarmament in the long-run. They also see  this mechanism as a Western attempt to control the country's  defence and security policy.    On the other hand, Thailand's pattern of arms procurement in  the past two decades also poses a barrier to the principle of  transparency. Although US-made arms remain the core of Thai  weapons, some cheap and sub-standard ones have also found their  way into the Thai arsenal. These weapons, mainly Chinese-made,  were purchased at friendship prices, which were arbitrary.  Also, most of the transactions were not well-documented either  at the source or in the recipient countries. Some of the  military, leaders, have privately expressed concern that an arms  register could expose this weakness which in turn could have an  adverse effect on the armed forces.    Under the UN Register of Conventional Arms, the  participating  countries are voluntarily called upon to provide data on imports  and exports and other general background on procurement and  national holding. Therefore, the Thai arms imports from the US  and other Western countries would be well documented and could  be identified.    Within Asean, Malaysia has proposed the establishment of a  Regional Arms Register to complement the work of the UN  Register. So far, there has not been any consensus among Asean  countries on this issue. The attitude of the Indochinese  countries is still unknown for the time being.    Last year, Singapore was among the eighty countries that  submitted reports for the UN register. The island republic's  report is believed to contain information on its conventional  weapons which includes tanks, armoured combat vehicles,  artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, among  others.    Being the host of the Asean Regional Forum, which will  discuss the arms register issue, Thailand has a crucial role to  play. The military leaders would require a proper understanding  of significances and implications. Indeed, the initiative will  not limit arms export or import of any weapon, it only monitors  with the hope that it could reduce suspicions which in the first  place cause the arms race.    Within Asean, Thailand's embrace of the register would send  a  positive signal to the region, which of late has harboured high  levels of suspicion of Thailand's defence posture. The case in  point is the beefing up of the country's naval forces which has  already caused concern as it could lead to Thailand having a  blue water force capacity in the future. The recent decision to  purchase a used aircraft carrier from Spain does not augur well  with the general mood within the region.    Like it or not, the Thai armed forces have to deal with the  issue of an arms register sooner or later. Instead of having an  apprehensive approach to the whole issue, it would be in Thai  interests to adopt a more forward looking strategy like Malaysia  and Singapore, which have also increased their arms stockpile in  the past few years.    As one of the original supporters of the idea, broached two  years ago after the Gulf War, Thailand could begin to contribute  to this UN effort in a small way by now submitting its defence  white paper to the UN register, like what the British government  did last year. Incrementally, it can file reports on categories  of weapons that the Thais feel comfortable to disclose.    Located centrally in mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand's  transparency is indispensable in shaping the new strategic order  and making the region safer.</p>

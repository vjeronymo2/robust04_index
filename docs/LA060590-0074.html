			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS' MOP MOPS THE BLAST INTO A CORNER  </P> <P> The mop mopped up the Baltimore Blast Monday night.  </P> <P> That's really about what this Wes Wade guy looks like. A muscular mop. When the  rookie Socker forward comes flying down the carpet, you almost look for a  microphone and expect him to start belting out "Stairway to Heaven" or  something equally rock-and-rollish.  </P> <P> But the only melody he created Monday was with his feet, scoring a hat trick to  help the Sockers to a 4-1 victory over the Blast before 7,834 in the San Diego  Sports Arena. The Sockers now have a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven MISL  championship series and can wrap it up at home with a victory in Game 5  Wednesday.  </P> <P> First things first. Wes, thought about a rock and roll career?  </P> <P> "No," he said. "I have no rhythm."  </P> <P> Maybe not on stage. On the field, certainly.  </P> <P> A recap:  </P> <P> Third quarter. Wade took a pass from midfielder Brian Quinn in full stride and  sent one in from 30 feet with his right foot. Sockers 1, Blast 0.  </P> <P> After a Freddie Thompson goal tied the score, forward Paul Wright took an  errant Blast pass off the boards and advanced it up the left sideline. Wade  moved to his inside and took a pass near the top of the penalty box and scored  right footed. Sox 2, Blast 1.  </P> <P> Fourth quarter. Midfielder Branko Segota puts the Sockers up 3-1 with 8:01 to  play. Then, after Baltimore put in Bruce Savage as its sixth attacker, Wade  sent the ball through his legs for his final goal.  </P> <P> Never in his wildest dreams did this 21-year-old guy who serves mainly as a  defensive runner imagine he would do this.  </P> <P> "I did surprise them," he said, "because I surprised myself."  </P> <P> And what his accomplishment did most was prove that this Socker team is more  versatile and diverse than last year's. It relies on many rather than few. A  star was found in the supporting cast on this night.  </P> <P> "He's paid his dues," Quinn said. "He's the kind of player that does whatever  is asked of him. That's the kind of thing that makes a team click."  </P> <P> Wade's first two goals helped the Sockers win the third quarter, 2-1. Baltimore  sandwiched a goal in between Wade's when Thompson touched in a nice pass from  defender Rusty Troy, who hit the ball cleanly as it came down from high in the  air off the boards.  </P> <P> Baltimore was awarded a power play with 23 seconds remaining in the third  quarter when Socker midfielder Ben Collins was called for tripping Thompson.  The Sockers killed the penalty with relative ease.  </P> <P> Blast defender Mike Stankovic gave the Sockers their second power play  opportunity 4:36 into the fourth quarter when he tripped Wright. As usual, the  Sockers failed to capitalize. They have scored just three times in 26  opportunities during the playoffs.  </P> <P> As it turned out, it made no difference. Less than a minute later, Segota  scored his fourth goal in three games, slipping behind Stankovic and sending it  into the left corner with his right foot.  </P> <P> In contrast to Saturday's game, Baltimore went conservative on the Sockers in  the first half, falling back on their goal and pushing it forward only when it  was safe. The Sockers matched them defensively, making timely blocks and  relying on the steady goal keeping of Zoltan Toth, who won his seventh playoff  game in eight starts.  </P> <P> The Sockers had their best opportunity of the first half with just more than  three minutes remaining in the first quarter. Forward Paul Wright was doing a  few jitterbug steps in the middle of the Blast penalty box and was bumped to  the ground. He managed to get his heel on the ball and it rolled through the  legs of goalie Scoop Stanisic.  </P> <P> Stanisic did an about-face and pounced on the ball as it rolled onto the goal  line. Socker forward Rod Castro smashed into Stanisic. It looked as if the ball  might be over the line but the referee called a foul and Castro and Baltimore  received a free kick.  </P> <P> Early in the second quarter, former Socker Paul Dougherty was assessed a  two-minute penalty for tripping Castro and the Sockers went on the power play.  Midfielders Waad Hirmez and Segota took their hacks to no avail and the Blast  killed off the penalty.  </P> <P> The victory gives the Sockers the same opportunity they had last year. All  week, this team has talked of winning a championship in front of the San Diego  fans, something they it hasn't done since 1986.  </P> <P> Last year the Socker were up 3-1 in this series and lost Game 5 and had to  return to Baltimore. Will the Blast do that to them again?  </P> <P> "I don't think so," Wright said. "I don't see it. I think we're playing really  well right now."  </P> <P> Socker Coach Ron Newman remains cautious but you can tell he has a good feeling  about this series. Maybe he has finally found the team he has searched for  through a season of mishaps.  </P></p>

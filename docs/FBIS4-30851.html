			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adam Uklanski from Frankfurt am Main: "Commercial </F> Banks Are Listening; Polish Proposals Described as `Fair and  Realistic'"]    [Text] On Monday, a freeze of the trade in Polish  debt will take place. Private banks which are members of the  London Club should decide on a formula for the debt reduction by  29 June. The first presentation of the Polish proposals took  place in Frankfurt am Main, with the participation of  representatives of German, Swiss, and Austrian banks.    The final date for the signing of an agreement between the  Government of the Republic of Poland and the London Club, was  announced as well -- it will take place in Warsaw on 13  September, followed by individual agreements with each of the  500 commercial banks which are Poland's creditors. Krzysztof  Krowacki, the government plenipotentiary in negotiations with  the London Club, has announced that work on creating legislative  opportunities for investing bonds in Polish companies subject to  privatization, should be finalized at the beginning of next  year. By signing the agreement -- Krowacki added -- the banks  are making an investment in Poland, but they will also benefit  from Poland becoming a permanent element of the European  economy. This is not irrelevant to the banks concerned because  the new business will compensate very significantly for what  they had lost in connection with the debt reduction.    Ernst-Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank who is heading the  negotiations of the London Club's working group stressed that  unlike agreements on debt reduction with Latin American  countries, the agreement with Poland sets no upper limits and  the choice of the way of debt reduction is completely  unrestricted. In Krowacki's assessment, there is a danger,  theoretically speaking: If choosing the "buy back" [preceding  two words in English] formula means that 20 percent of the  entire debt would have to be bought back (about $2.5 billion),  then that would be the upper limit of Poland's repayment  capabilities. However, so much attention should not be directed  at cash because in the unanimous view of the bankers present at  the meeting, bonds are "more attractive." Krowacki announced  that Warsaw will buy "collaterals" [preceding word in English]  in the form of U.S. State Department bonds, which will  constitute a guarantee of the Polish Government's repayment  capability and which should increase the credibility of the  operations for exchanging credit bills of exchange in return for  parity and discount bonds; the operation is scheduled to begin  31 October.</p>

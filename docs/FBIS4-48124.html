			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The new premises of the South African Embassy in  Angola were inaugurated here in Luanda yesterday. The ceremony,  full of pomp and circumstance, was attended by many guests.  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco represented the Angolan  Government. [passage omitted]    South African Ambassador Roger Trammer said a new South  Africa should encourage stronger bilateral relations.    [Begin Trammer recording] The struggle for freedom has been  won but the struggle continues so we can obtain what freedom  offers us. We must now forget the past because the future  beckons. [end recording]    Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco said that the victory  of the African National Congress, ANC, and Nelson Mandela was  also a victory for Africa, the world, and Angola in particular.    [Begin Moco recording] It is in fact a victory for the whole  of mankind. It is not a victory of blacks over whites, as is  often said and as has often been said. This has not been a  victory only for those who were oppressed but also for the  oppressors. As someone has pointed out, the oppressor also  suffers. In South Africa for many decades we saw that  suffering, human degradation, misery, and immorality affected  everyone to some extent, irrespective of their race, creed, or  regional background. All Africans of all regions, colors, and  races felt that suffering. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRADCO MAY SPIN OFF ITS PRINTER PRODUCTS WING;  </P> <P> MARKETS: THE COMPANY WOULD SEEK TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY SEPARATING  IRVINE-BASED GRADCO PRINTER SYSTEMS INC. AND COPIER-RELATED GRADCO JAPAN.  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc., a struggling copier and printer products company that is  in a proxy fight with its biggest shareholder, said Tuesday that it will  explore a plan to spin off its printer products unit to existing shareholders.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the company would seek to maximize shareholder value by  separating Irvine-based Gradco Printer Systems Inc. and Gradco Japan, which is  engaged in copier-related business, into separately traded entities.  </P> <P> As part of the plan, Gradco said it will pay down all of the existing Gradco  Systems debt, write off certain business assets and function as a holding  company owning shares of Gradco Japan, which makes the company's staple sorter  products for office copiers.  </P> <P> Keith B. Stewart, chairman and chief executive of Gradco Systems, said the  disparity between the businesses and fundamentally different markets has  produced "confusion" among company shareholders. In the spinoff plan, the  profitable copier products plant will provide initial working capital to the  money-losing printer business.  </P> <P> Stewart said the printer systems unit has high-growth opportunities and will  seek a strategic partner in the future. He said Gradco is reviewing the  feasibility of the plan, but no definitive action will be taken before the  company's annual meeting on Oct. 12.  </P> <P> Gradco stock closed Tuesday at $6.50, up 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> The announcement is Stewart's first counterpunch to Martin E. Tash, who as  Gradco's biggest outside shareholder started a proxy battle to take control of  the company's board of directors in August. Tash also filed a shareholder  lawsuit against Stewart and top Gradco management, alleging that they tried to  misappropriate the assets of Gradco Japan.  </P> <P> Tash, chairman of Plenum Publishing Corp. in New York, and his company control  9.4% of company stock. Tash is seeking to replace Gradco's board with his own  slate of candidates at the annual meeting. Tash could not be reached for  comment Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> Gradco said it is willing to settle the suit, which the company said  jeopardized efforts to take its copier unit public in Japan. But Gradco said  Tash has not responded to its overtures. Tash said Friday that he would not  negotiate a private settlement that does not affect all shareholders.  </P> <P> The company reported operating losses of $2.3 million on revenue of $20.3  million in its first quarter ended June 30, largely because of the loss of its  biggest customer, Xerox Corp. In its fiscal year ended March 31, Gradco lost  $28.1 million on revenue of $89.5 million.  </P></p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Paintings unfolded - The work of Eugenio Dittborn CHILEAN artist Eugenio Dittborn disarmingly proclaims that 'The politics of my paintings are in the folds' in the video shown along with his exhibition of Airmail Paintings at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. His 'paintings' (the technique of which is predominantly screenprint and collage) are done on very lightweight translucent material, the kind used as interlining in clothes, and travel from exhibition to exhibition across the globe by airmail, folded inside specially designed envelopes. On arrival, they are simply taken from the envelope, shaken out and pinned to the wall. A record of their journeyings, the picture title and often a quotation or other explanatory remark are written on the envelopes, which are exhibited alongside the works. Their support may be flimsy, but the works are on a grand scale, both physically - the unfolded paintings extend for several square feet - and in subject matter. Using a gallery of found images, photos of faces from old crime magazines and government records, newspaper photographs, drawings from an old 'teach yourself to draw' manual and others by his young daughter, Dittborn explores the issues of identity and communication both between and within the so-called 'dominant' culture - the history (including art history) and politics of the west, and that of the 'periphery' - the history and contemporary life of Chile where Dittborn was born and where he still lives and works. Their lightweight format enables their journeys to be made with ease, their intervention into our western artspaces achieved courtesy of the postal service. Images are used repeatedly, most strikingly, perhaps, those of individuals preserved in death, among them the mummified body of a nine year old Inca boy sacrificed in a religious ceremony and the corpse of a man murdered in 1973 during the military dictatorship. Instead of being merely gruesome records of suffering, the images in their new context become transformed, their cruel histories brought before us to ponder and reflect. One of the most moving pieces couples the image of the political prisoner, who still wears the blindfold that concealed his executioners from his last gaze with that of a baby, Dittborn's daughter Margarita, eyes just open, minutes after her birth, seeing the world for the first time. Personal sentiment is linked with political horror, beginnings with ends. The poem 'Night' by Gonzalo Milan, quoted on the painting's envelope says 'And when the night falls, no one knows whether he opens or closes his eyes . . . whether these are the dreams of yesterday or the nightmares of tomorrow.' A new work by Mary Kelly, 'Gloria Patri,' occupies the upper galleries. Its stated subject is 'The pathology of masculinity.' It consists of a wall mounted installation of silver trophies, plaques and shields. The trophies are adorned with phrases such as 'Cut it off and kill it' or 'Kick Ass,' recorded from television broadcasts made during the Gulf War, the plaques with strange devices made by cutting military insignia in half and combining them in random order and the shields with short narratives said to describe 'scenarios which undo a situation of mastery.' Mastery is a term used in the writings of Jacques Lacan, and the shiny surfaces of the shields which reflect our faces as we study the texts on fishing, playing baseball, not eating vegetables, witnessing birth and (the only one with a woman's voice) exercising, are meant to embody aspects of his famous 'Mirror Stage.' Lacan's writing also provided the theoretical basis for Kelly's most famous work, the 'Post Partum Document', presented at the ICA in 1976, and her lectures and writing since then have earned her an influential place in the academic feminist debate. Unlike Document, however (which infamously displayed stained nappy liners alongside texts written on stone recording her son's first words and her own anxious record of daily events, making a powerful point about the the struggle to combine the ordering function of the artistic process with the chaos of child rearing), the present piece seems distant from its purported subject. The military and sporting metaphors it uses might have been worth deeper scrutiny as pointers to the mysteries of masculinity rather than being pressed into the service of a dubious theory lacking the underpinning of profound personal experience which brought the previous work so powerfully to life. Eugenio Dittborn: Airmail Paintings 1983-1992 until May 30, then touring to John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, 17 August 17 - September 18 and to Wellington City Art Gallery, New Zealand. Mary Kelly: Gloria Patri until May 16, Institute of Contemporary Art, The Mall, London SW1Y 5AH.</p>

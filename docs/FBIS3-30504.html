The ship is called Khabarovsk and is transporting six barges  of iron ore for the port of Linz.    Around 2300 local time (2100 GMT] on 1 February, the  vessel's  captain, in a telephone conversation, refused to obey the order  of the officials on duty from the Bulgarian State Navigation  Inspectorate to stop and await the embargo investigation.    According to the latest instructions, such an investigation  should take place during the day. The captain explained that he  was in a hurry for the obligatory investigation that was  awaiting him in Calafat.    The investigation teams in Calafat, where the ship is  expected to arrive tomorrow morning, were briefed on the case.</p>

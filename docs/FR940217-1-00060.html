			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another threat to the salamander is the degradation of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface habitat, particularly at Barton Springs Pool and Eliza Pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following reports of a fish kill in Barton Springs Pool on September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28, 1992 (Austin American Statesman, October 2, 1992; Daily Texan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 13, 1992), the salamander's surface range contracted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about a 400 square meter (4,300 square foot) area to about a 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> square meter (50 square foot) area immediately around the outflow of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spring (see discussion in Background). The fish kill has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributed to the improper application of chlorine used to clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs Pool (Chippindale et al. 1993, TPWD 1993). Previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish kills, although rare events, have also occurred at Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs Pool (Robert Sapronyi, City of Austin Parks and Recreation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department, pers. comm., 1992). Other cleaning procedures and park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations that may have had adverse impacts on the salamander and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its surface habitat include lowering the water levels in Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs Pool and Eliza Pool for cleaning, use of high pressure fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hoses in areas where salamanders are found, and removal of aquatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetation from Eliza Pool. Runoff from the area above Eliza Pool,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which includes a maintenance area and concession stand for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zilker Eagle train, may also have contributed to the decline in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of salamanders found at this location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the September 28 fish kill, the City of Austin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinued the use of chlorine to clean Barton Springs Pool and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliza Pool. The City of Austin is continuing to revise its pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance practices in order to protect the salamander and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, as well as maintain a safe environment for swimmers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Camille Barnett, City of Austin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices at Eliza Pool and other park operations near this pool are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also being reevaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another change that has been observed at Barton Springs is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss of aquatic vascular plants in Barton Springs Pool, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamanders were reportedly abundant in 1946. The plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disappeared during the late 1980's (Chippindale et al. 1993). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause of the disappearance is unknown and may be due to changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality originating upstream (such as increased turbidity),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain pool maintenance operations, and/or other factors. Aquatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants are important because they provide cover where salamanders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can hide from predators. Amphipods and other invertebrates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form the diet of salamanders also depend on aquatic vegetation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Hillis and Chippindale 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reduced water levels in the Barton Springs segment could also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely impact the Barton Springs salamander. The volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> springflow is self-regulated by the level of water in the aquifer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discharge decreases as water storage in the aquifer drops, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historically has been due primarily to the lack of recharging rains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than groundwater withdrawal for public consumption (Slade et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al. 1986). Reduced aquifer levels may lead to the movement of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with high levels of total dissolved solids from the ``bad water''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone to the freshwater zone of the Barton Springs segment, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs (Slade et al. 1986). The increased concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissolved solids resulting from this encroachment of ``bad water''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could have negative impacts on the plants and animals associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Barton Springs. Reduced groundwater levels would also increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concentration of pollutants in the aquifer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for ``bad water'' encroachment is increased with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) pumpage of the aquifer and (b) extended low recharge or low flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions (Slade et al. 1986). Barton Springs lies near the ``bad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water'' line. Under low flow conditions, Barton Springs and a well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near the ``bad water'' line (YD&hyph;58&hyph;50&hyph;216) show increased dissolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid concentrations, particularly sodium and chloride, indicating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some encroachment of ``bad water'' has occurred at Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs in the past (Slade et al. 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District (BS/EACD) (1990), pumpage from the aquifer has increased in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent years, resulting in decreased discharges from Barton Springs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USGS has stated that groundwater withdrawal in the area is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to increase because of further urbanization in outlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of Austin. Currently, discharge from the Barton Springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segment (withdrawal plus springflow) is roughly equal to recharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, an increase in groundwater withdrawal is likely to cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease in the quantity of water in the aquifer and discharge from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs (Slade et al. 1986). Based on the current population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projection, water demands could almost double by the year 2000 (from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 470 hectare-meters/year (3,800 acre-feet/year) in 1982 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 760 hectare-meters/year (6,200 acre-feet/year)) (Slade et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or educational purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No threat from overutilization of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is known to exist at this time. Several citizens have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concern over impacts to the salamander from recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of Barton Springs Pool for swimming. However, no evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists to indicate that swimming in Barton Springs Pool poses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat to the salamander population. Provided that pool maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities do not adversely impact the salamander and its habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see discussion under Factor A), swimming at Barton Springs Pool is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not likely to disturb the salamander.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certain naturally occurring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations as well as captive individuals of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eurycea neotenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shown symptoms of redleg, a bacterial ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aeromonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sp.) infection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Sweet 1978). The Barton Springs salamander may also be susceptible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this disease, although no diseases or parasites of the Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs salamander have been reported. Primary predators of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs salamander are believed to be fish and crayfish;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, no information exists to indicate that predation poses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major threat to this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

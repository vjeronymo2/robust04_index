			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker sells stadium for Pounds 5m BRENT WALKER, the heavily indebted leisure and property group, yesterday sold the Hackney Wick Greyhound Stadium for Pounds 5m to a consortium led by Henderson Venture Managers. Henderson has raised another Pounds 9m to invest in refurbishing the stadium, which will be run by a management team headed by Mr Robert Parker, a racing writer and trainer. Mr Parker said he intends to turn the stadium, which is currently in a run-down condition, into the most advanced in the UK. He plans to build a new stand and upgrade other facilities in a 40-week building programme. The track will remain open throughout. Mr Parker said: 'There is huge potential to develop the sport further.' The stadium will be owned by Fleetwood Racing, with Sir James Harvie-Watt as non-executive chairman. Sir James is a former managing director of Wembley Stadium and was vice chairman of the Sports Council. Senior debt for the project is being provided by Bank of Scotland. Samuel Montagu is providing mezzanine debt.</p>

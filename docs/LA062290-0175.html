			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITAIN CUTS DEFICIT $517 MILLION  </P> <P> Increased exports and strong demand for banking and tourism services helped  Britain cut its current account deficit by $517 million in May to $2.24  billion, the government said today.  </P> <P> The figures, issued by the Central Statistical Office, came as a welcome boost  for Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major after a series of bleak  data on the troubled British economy.  </P> <P> Although May's figures showed Britain's trade balance was still well in the  red, they showed a steady improvement in the country's trade performance,  helped last month by record export sales of $15.4 billion.  </P></p>

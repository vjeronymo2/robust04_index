			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat include those authorized, carried out, or funded by the Corps,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of the Navy, the Bureau, NMFS, FERC, the Service, and EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corps funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversion facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gate or barrier installation. The Corps also develops permits pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 404 of the CWA to the Department of the Navy so the Navy may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredge deep-water ship channels and dispose of dredge materials in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay. The Corps also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducts such activities for the Navy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau and DWR construct, operate, and manage water export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement standards, pursuant to the CWA, if the State standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to be inadequate. FERC licenses water storage facilities on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In 1991, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproved portions of the State Board's Water Quality Control Plan for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Salinity for the Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared proposed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finalized replacement standards for those portions of the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures to protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which NMFS has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service and the Bureau are jointly responsible for implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Activities under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CVPIA include, but are not limited to, management of a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CVP water supply dedicated for fish and wildlife protection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restoration, and enhancement, acquisition of additional water supplies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the same purposes, and screening unscreened diversions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed. Both the Bureau and Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities under the CVPIA may affect delta smelt or its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, requiring consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for the development of a recovery plan. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a Recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan for declining native fishes in the Estuary. The Recovery Plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently in draft form, will develop a framework for Federal, State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and private entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecosystem also will be described in this plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed on October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), as part of the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to list the species. During the 4-month comment period following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of the proposal, the Service received 360 written and oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments from 348 individuals. Of the forty-four people who commented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically on critical habitat, thirty-four opposed and ten supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public comment period on the original proposed critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters_two in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of critical habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852), the Service revised the geographical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area and refined the primary constituent elements described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original critical habitat proposal. The public comment period for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised proposed critical habitat designation was open from January 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, to March 7, 1994, and later extended to March 11, 1994 (59 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3829). During the 65-day comment period, the Service received written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments from forty-three parties on both the critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation and EPA's proposed water quality standards for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bay/Delta. Thirty-two commenters were opposed to critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation, nine supported the decision, and two expressed no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference. Several commenters either referenced or supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments of the California Urban Water Agencies (CUWA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four joint public hearings were held to solicit comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised proposed critical habitat designation, the proposed threatened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status for the Sacramento splittail, and the proposed water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards developed by EPA. A total of 125 people presented oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony and submitted written comments at the hearings, primarily on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt critical habitat and Bay/Delta water quality standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues. The Service received comments from elected officials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested persons, municipal and agricultural water districts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations, environmental organizations, business and industry owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and managers, fishing enthusiasts, farmers, agricultural commissions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dairy interests, biologists, county and municipal officials, power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency representatives, hospital and school district representatives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and building industry spokespeople.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the February 23, 1994, hearing in Fresno, thirty-eight people  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented oral testimony_thirty-six people opposed and two supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat designation. Nineteen people testified at the February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24, 1994, Sacramento meeting_fifteen people were opposed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation, three were in support, and one person was neutral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve people testified at the February 25, 1994, hearing in San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco_nine people supported and three opposed the critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation. At the February 28, 1994, hearing in Irvine, fifty-six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people presented oral and written comments (fifty-one people testified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and five submitted only written comments)_fifty of the fifty-six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters opposed critical habitat, five were neutral, and one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments addressing the issue of available scientific information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to revise the proposed rule were addressed in the revised proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule of January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852). The Service addressed EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, as well as comments provided by the State. All other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments are addressed below in this final rule. Because EPA can better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond to comments regarding the economic analysis and the assumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to develop its Bay/Delta water quality standards, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to EPA's ``Response to Comments'' document for responses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments specific to those issues. However, the Service will respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any comments regarding the relationship between EPA's water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and the biological requirements of the delta smelt in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, and to comments regarding the economic analysis as it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are part of the administrative record and are available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public review. Written comments and oral statements presented at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouped into a number of general issues. These issues, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service's response to each, are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

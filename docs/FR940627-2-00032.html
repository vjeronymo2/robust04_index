			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum Requirements for Project Design <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed project. Inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's application is important since they will be used by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if applicable, should also be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Duration <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section specifies the maximum length of time for the project period; it refers to the amount of time for which Federal funding is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Share of Project Cost <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section specifies the amount of Federal support for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``budget period'' refers to the interval of time (usually 12 months) into which a multi-year period of assistance (project period) is divided for budgetary and funding purposes. The term ``project period'' refers to the total time a project is approved for support, including any extensions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matching Requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section specifies the minimum non-Federal contribution, either through cash or in-kind match, that is required. Applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Grantees must provide at least 10 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACYF share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, if the required match is 10 percent, a project requesting $90,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $10,000 (10 percent of the total project cost of $100,000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anticipated Number of Projects To Be Funded <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : This section specifies the number of projects that ACYF anticipates it will fund in the priority area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

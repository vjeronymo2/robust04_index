			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 06, BNS -- 3,500 men will be called up  for mandatory service in the Lithuanian armed forces during this  year's spring conscription.    Major Gediminas Jurciukonis, assistant head of the Voluntary  Defense Service headquarters, said some 11,000 men aged above 19  could be called up but only 30-40 percent of recruits are fit  for military service.    The conscription will not affect university students, men  aged above 27, clergymen of registered religious communities,  persons sentenced to jail terms of over three years, fathers of  two or more children and men who are the only bread-winners in  their families.    Jurciukonis said over 60 percent of recruits are expected to  report to call-up commissions this year. The major said 57 and  49 percent reported to call-up commissions during last year's  fall and spring conscriptions respectively.    Those who will not report to call-up commissions will be  fined 106 lits. 1,600 men were fined last year but only half of  them paid the fines. Those who do not report to a commission  repeatedly may face legal action.    This year, recruits are examined by medical boards at local  hospitals, which should make the selection better, Jurciukonis  said. In his words, 5 percent of the recruits called up last  year were later pronounced unfit for military service.</p>

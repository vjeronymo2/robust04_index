The sources said that the idea of sending Jordanian  disengagement forces was conveyed to Amman by Yemeni Deputy  Prime Minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib when he visited the  Jordanian capital a while back and held talks with King Husayn  of Jordan on the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis.    The sources said they believed that King HUsayn understood  from Abu-Shawarib that the idea of sending Jordanian forces to  the border between the two parts of Yemen had the approval of  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, and that is why he ordered the relevant  authorities in the Jordanian Army command to prepare these  forces for immediate departure for specified areas in Yemen.    The force, consisting of a number of officers and warrant  officers, boarded a military aircraft which took off for Sanaa  but did not complete the journey, returning halfway through the  flight after receiving orders to do so from the Jordanian  command.    According to the sources, it seems that King Husayn, in a  telephone conversation with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, discovered that  the idea of sending Jordanian disengagement forces to the border  areas was a "northern" idea only, and so he ordered the force to  return to Amman.

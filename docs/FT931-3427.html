			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: European Leisure back to profit with Pounds 54,000 EUROPEAN LEISURE, the disco and snooker hall operator which is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and is beset by high debt, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54,000 for the six months to December 31. Last year there were losses of Pounds 45.8m after a Pounds 34.6m exceptional charge to cover losses on disposals. Sales fell 10 per cent to Pounds 35.3m (Pounds 39.1m). The net interest charge rose from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 4.1m. Debt was unchanged at Pounds 76.6m for gearing marginally higher at 227 per cent. Losses per share were 0.65p (28.6p). Distributable reserves remained inadequate to pay either the preference or the ordinary dividend. Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said SFO investigations over the takeover of Midsummer Leisure were continuing but did not affect the daily operation of the company. Its bank facilities expire in July by which time it hoped to have worked out a programme to take the group forward. During the year the group sold 23 units, and withdrew almost entirely from France. There were six loss-making units in the UK still to be sold. Mr Rock said that at this stage he did not envisage the need for more provisions covering disposal losses. Debt had not fallen as the units sold had made losses and because there had been investment in the remaining 125 profitable disco and snooker units, Mr Rock said. 'There is nothing wrong with the business,' he added. 'The future is dependent on finding a proper solution to our debt problem.'</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Children made to suffer in city of evil IT WAS raining yesterday in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. But Mirsad Beserovic was glad. 'It is awful when the weather gets very hot. The flies and rats descend on the piles of garbage now stacked high on the streets of our capital,' he said. For the past 60 days, the city authorities have been unable to collect the rubbish. Nor can they bury the dead. 'It is like a ghetto. We cannot bury the dead in their rightful places. 'The people of Dobrinja, which is near the airport and which is being starved to death by Serb irregulars, bury their dead in the parks. It is awful. The children hear and see so much evil. There are 50,000 children under the age of 10 in Sarajevo. For the past 60 days, many of them have been in the cellars, without food, without milk, without protein. It is terrible. Some of their brothers and fathers have died while defending the city. What kind of childhood is this? 'I have been unable to go home for 60 days. I do not know if my house has been shelled. I worry about my wife all the time. She is with my parents near Sarajevo. 'I have been living at the Sarajevo Radio studios where I work as a journalist. By day, I work. At night, I stay here at the Radio, like most of the people working here. It is not safe to go out. If I do, I might never come back alive. It is difficult to sleep at night. That is when the Serb irregulars and Yugoslav army start bombing.' 'We live on rice and macaroni. I cannot remember the taste of fruit,' said Mirsad. 'I am not afraid of hunger, but of what I will see when, one day, it will be safe to walk the streets of Sarajevo again. 'I know that when I will walk out there, I will see destruction all around me. They are trying to destroy our beautiful city. They are trying to break the friendships between Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb and Croat population. But they will never succeed.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United  States jointly expressed concern Monday that the North Korean  nuclear row has become more serious and volatile than ever  before.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul  James Laney met in the morning soon after President Kim Yong-sam  chaired a national security session.    Han briefed Laney on what was discussed at the meeting and  called for even closer cooperation in dealing with the latest  crisis stemming from Pyongyang's nuclear program, especially as  President Kim leaves for Russia Wednesday.    "The two countries shared the view that the North Korean  nuclear problem is entering its most serious stage and that the  present situation is extremely worrisome," Ministry spokesman  Chang Ki-ho said.    "They reconfirmed the principle that in order for dialogue  to  continue, North Korea must keep alive the basis for such  dialogue -- that is, the opportunity to sample, secure and  measure the fuel rods from the North Korean nuclear reactor must  not be damaged," he said.    The U.N. Security Council convenes Tuesday to address  Pyongyang's latest refusal to keep this opportunity alive. The  council is expected to adopt a presidential statement or even a  resolution pressing North Korea to reach agreement with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on guaranteeing the  sampling and measurement of the rods.</p>

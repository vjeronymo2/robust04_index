			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: United Friendly depressed A sharp increase in underwriting losses last year depressed profits at United Friendly, the life and general insurance company. At the pre-tax level they fell by Pounds 3m to Pounds 20.4m. The final dividend, however, is increased to 11p making a 16.5p (14.5p) total, payable from earnings of 21.2p (23p) per share. A poor performance by the motor insurance division was largely responsible for the profits decline. Against the industry trend, underwriting losses on motor widened to Pounds 8.4m.</p>

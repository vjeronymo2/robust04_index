			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva: "Republic's First Mortgage </F> Bank Established"]    [Text] The Government of Tatarstan has approved  documents on the establishment of the republic's first mortgage  bank. It will issue long-term credits for the construction of  objects of civic and industrial significance. The main  application of the mortgage is supposed to be in housing  construction.    Market relations are bringing back long-forgotten concepts  and phenomena to the housing sphere. The mortgage--or the  issuance of credit secured by real estate--is one of them.  Although a mortgage law has not been passed yet, a legal basis  has been established for introduction of the mortgage in the  form of laws on security and privatization of housing. An  effective way of resolving the housing problem that is used in  the whole civilized world will appear among the residents of  Tatarstan immediately after it shows up among Muscovites and St.  Petersburgers.    The founders of the mortgage bank are the Tatsotsbank, the  housing investment building corporation Housing Initiative, and  the Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy Association.    According to specialists of the corporation, any potential  investor, after drawing up a mortgage for his old apartment or  other real estate, can acquire credit for the construction of  new housing with the best consumer qualities. Credit will be  issued to the extent of 70 percent of the cost of the mortgage.    Although the system of mortgage credit assumes it will be  long-term, under conditions of high inflation such possibilities  are limited. Therefore at first, until the ruble is stabilized,  mortgage credit will be issued for a year and a half or two  years. Nevertheless, this will make it possible for a family  with even an average level of income to finance the building of  new housing.    It is assumed that the Housing Initiative Corporation will  take on all the work in drawing up the documents for the  planning and construction of the new housing and the sale of the  old at market prices. Its aim is to create a closed building  cycle, performing the role of a general investor.    The issuance of credits under mortgage on real estate is the  main but not the only type of activity of the mortgage bank. It  will also engage in the issuance of securities--housing  certificates. This system is a form of shared participation of  citizens in housing construction. Of course, given the existing  high prices, a majority of the people do not have the necessary  sums to purchase an apartment. Housing certificates, which  record the right of purchasers to an appropriate share of  housing being built, will make it possible to buy apartments in  parts--in installments. However, it may turn out that many  people will not be able to acquire a certificate even for a  square meter of housing. This is taken into account, and the  minimum share for which a security can be bought has been  established on the scale of 0.1 square meters.    When a family is able to accumulate a sufficient number of  certificates for a whole apartment, a certificate of ownership  will be drawn up for the family. Moreover, the purchaser of  certificates knows beforehand the address of the home being  built. If it is impossible to purchase a packet of certificates  for the period of its construction, the right to continue to  accumulate them is automatically carried over to the next home  being built. It is not only well-to-do citizens who will be able  to solve the housing question with the help of the system of  housing certificates, but also people of modest incomes and  those who are unable to get credit because of a lack of real  estate.    Sites under new housing construction will be offered to the  general investor. Appropriate structures under the head of  administration of Kazan have prepared proposals for the  allotment of sites to the Housing Initiative Corporation.    The bank will set itself up in one a reconstructed building,  which was presented in the form of its share of investment to  the authorized capital of the bank by Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy--one  of its founders.    It is assumed that the opening of the mortgage bank will  occur in the near future, after all the documents are  coordinated and approved in Moscow.</p>

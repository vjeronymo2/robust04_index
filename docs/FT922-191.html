			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Buildings shake-up urged in education MUCH of the increase in UK student numbers planned for the 1990s could be accommodated in existing buildings if better use was made of them, according to a report by the university and polytechnic funding councils. More than half the 300,000 increase in students could be accommodated if higher education institutions improved space management and remodelled existing buildings, the report says. An additional 117,000 places would be needed by the end of the century, however, plus extra spending on equipment, libraries, central support and social facilities. The report, published yesterday, recommends the creation of a higher-education finance corporation to facilitate borrowing from financial institutions. Proposals for making better use of existing space in universities and polytechnics include: Increasing the size of teaching groups. Opening teaching space for longer hours and on Saturdays. Addition of a fourth term or switching to the three-semester system (where the present three terms are lengthened, with students divided into groups that attend only two of the three terms). Universities and polytechnics would find it easier to raise finance on the capital markets if government-imposed restraints on using their assets to raise funds were lifted. Lincolnshire County Council is likely to provide Pounds 10m as initial financing for a university in Lincoln, Paul Cheeseright writes. Nottingham Polytechnic has been chosen to supervise the opening of and manage a university college in the city by 1996, and create an independent university early next century. A meeting of the council's education committee recommended the funding.</p>

Van Overbeek of Glendale wrote: "Obviously,  Americans wish to travel by car and airplane" in his complaint regarding  subsidy of Amtrak. Thousands of Americans travel by train and it should be one  of the functions of the government to ensure their safety by means of upgraded  trains and rails. I never travel on planes and always travel on trains, where I  meet some of the nicest people.  </P> <P> LIBBY MARKS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

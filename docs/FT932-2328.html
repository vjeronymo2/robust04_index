			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Hungary in Dollars 800m Russian Mig deal THE HUNGARIAN government has announced it expects to sign a contract in the next few days to acquire Dollars 800m (Pounds 528m) worth of Mig-29 fighter aircraft, spare parts and ammunition from Russia in a swap against Russia's trade debts. The deal for the 28 modern Mig-29 interceptors, which was approved by the Hungarian government this week, is part of the largest arms transaction in eastern Europe since the fall of communism. Budapest will offset the Dollars 800m against Russia's Dollars 1.7bn debt to Hungary, which was the outstanding balance at the start of 1992, when the two countries closed the books on their trade under the old Comecon system. Military and political leaders said they would have preferred western equipment to Russian. Preliminary talks were held with Saab, the Swedish manufacturer, as well as with the US government for F-16s. But officials claim a comparable purchase from the west would have cost up to Dollars 1.5bn, or about two years' defence expenditure, and Hungary's government finances are already overstretched. Hungary believes its only hope of recovering Russian trade debts is to accept repayment in kind. It is also anxious to strengthen its air defences. Mr Pal Teleki has resigned as chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV RT after revelations that he received a Dollars 130,000 a year salary top-up from the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund, an institution set up by the US government to promote private enterprise in Hungary.</p>

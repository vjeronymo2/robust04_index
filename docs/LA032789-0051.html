			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BODY OF GIRL, 7, FOUND; BOY, 14, HELD IN DEATH  </P> <P> The body of 7-year-old Sara Nan Hodges, the object of a three-day search with  police dogs and helicopters, was found Sunday afternoon in a house five doors  away from her Newhall home, authorities said.  </P> <P> A 14-year-old Newhall boy was arrested late Sunday and was being held at the  Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station for investigation of murder, Los Angeles  County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Terry Horner, a visitor to the house on Alderbrook Drive where the body was  found, said the home's owner, Olga Kaczmar, found the body beneath a water bed  mattress while she searched for the source of a sickening odor.  </P> <P> Sheriff's spokeswoman Catherine Neilsen said Kaczmar rented the room where the  body was found to the mother of the boy who was later arrested.  </P> <P> The boy, whose name was not released, was sitting on the mattress when the body  was found, Horner, 27, of Newhall, said. He said the boy had set up a fan in  the room to blow the odor out an open window.  </P> <P> "He (the boy) was crying and he said, 'I didn't do it,' " Horner said.  </P> <P> Horner and other neighbors said the boy and his mother had lived at the Kaczmar  home about a month. He had previously lived in Florida with his father, but had  come back "because he got into some trouble," according to a neighbor who asked  not to be identified.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials would not confirm all of Horner's account.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Sandstrom confirmed that the body was found under a bed  after adults smelled an odor.  </P> <P> Coroner's officials said an autopsy would be performed to determine the cause  of death and whether the child had been sexually molested.  </P> <P> Sara had been living on Alderbrook Drive for about six weeks with her mother,  Linda; her 16-year-old sister, Tisha, and her mother's boyfriend. They shared a  home with Mary Alexander and her three children.  </P> <P> The girl was last seen at 2 p.m. Thursday, playing with neighborhood children  in front of her home. Her family reported her missing about 8 p.m. and a search  began later that night.  </P> <P> Mary Alexander's daughter, Jessica, said the blond, blue-eyed first-grader had  told playmates that she was going to Kaczmar's home to ride horses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wondered About Odor  </P> <P> Horner and Kaczmar attended church and went to brunch Sunday before returning  to the home. They commented several times to each other about the odor in the  house.  </P> <P> "We smelled it . . . and nobody thought it was a dead body," Horner said.  </P> <P> Pastor Robert Bloom of the nearby Village Church helped comfort Tisha, Sara's  16-year-old sister, after the body was discovered. Bloom said Sara's mother and  other family members had secluded themselves in a trailer behind the Alexander  home.  </P> <P> "She cried in my arms a long, long time," Bloom said of Tisha. "I told her that  really, a thing like this takes God and time to heal."  </P> <P> On Friday, about 80 deputies, the Santa Clarita Search and Rescue team,  Explorer Scouts and a sheriff's mounted posse scoured a two-square-mile  wilderness area near the missing child's home. Searchers on the ground used  three teams of bloodhounds, while others in a helicopter employed a  high-intensity searchlight in a vain attempt to find the girl in the brushy  terrain. The effort was called off Friday night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picture Distributed  </P> <P> Since then, deputies had gone door-to-door inquiring about Sara's whereabouts  and searching homes. The child's picture was printed on flyers distributed  throughout the Newhall area and concern over her disappearance mounted through  the weekend.  </P> <P> Deputy Dan Cox said detectives had "in all likelihood" questioned the residents  of the home where Sara's body was found.  </P> <P> Sara's parents are divorced. Her father, Wallace Scott Mann, who lives in  Ventura County, was in seclusion with the rest of the family at the Alexander  home Sunday night.  </P> <P> Despite the disappearance, the child's family had hoped to be able to welcome  her home with an Easter basket bulging with holiday favors and candy.  </P> <P> But the sight of the basket early Sunday had caused her mother to break down  crying.  </P> <P> "We made her an Easter basket, because we want her to come home," her sister,  Tisha, had said several hours before the body was found. But after the tears  began, Tisha said, she hid the basket in a closet -- "where my Mom can't see  it."  </P></p>

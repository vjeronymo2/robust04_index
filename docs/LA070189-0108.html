			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: MILQUETOAST TO BULLY  </P> <P> "My biggest problem is that he was quite milquetoast," says Carl Lumbly,  recalling his good-guy role as Det. Marcus Petrie on "Cagney &amp; Lacey." It's  hardly a factor in his current part. In the 1927-set "Eden" (at the Los Angeles  Theatre Center), Lumbly pulls out the stops as West Indian patriarch Joseph  Barton, a bullying, battering separationist who blames American blacks for the  disintegration of racial purity.  </P> <P> The actor, who originally played the role in 1980, is finding the reprisal a  tough one.  </P> <P> "This man has made me feel old," he says. "Before I had all that youthful  energy. It didn't seem to go as deeply as it does now. Certain things in life  take you to a deeper place. I wasn't a father then, and my (Jamaican) father  was still alive. This time, I see Mr. Barton's brutality and single-mindedness  as less tyrannical, born of fear and hope. I love him a lot more. Of course,"  he says, laughing. "It's my job to love him."  </P> <P> Since the 1988 cancellation of "Cagney &amp; Lacey," Lumbly credits 1-year-old  son Brandon (mom is actress Vonetta McGee) with providing the constancy in his  life.  </P> <P> "Not my work life," he says. "But that's OK. There were parts of the series,  though it was consistent, that it was not really regular -- when you were there  simply to be counted. I think the strength of the show was definitely the two  women; the stories almost always had to come from that point of view. If I were  to criticize, I'd say we could've been more effectively woven into their lives  in the precinct. But I don't think the show suffered from that at all."  </P> <P> Being off a series has freed Lumbly up to do lot of other work (including the  films "Bedroom Window" and "Everybody's All-American") -- and also freed him  from a weekly paycheck. "You do get used to that," he admits. "But I feel  pretty fortunate. And certainly in this business, (regular work is) an  exception. Those five years were quite sweet. But there's a part of me that  never really believed it was happening anyway. It feels like winning the  lottery." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

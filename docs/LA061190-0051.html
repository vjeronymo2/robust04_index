			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET'S LATEST CHALLENGE: WINNING OVER BABY BOOMERS;  </P> <P> INVESTING: BROKERAGES HOPE TO LURE THEM AS THEY NEAR THEIR PRIME INVESTING  YEARS. BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT TO KEEP THIS SOPHISTICATED GROUP HAPPY.  </P> <P> Aging baby boomers, entering their prime savings and investing years, are hot  potential prospects for every hungry stockbroker. But a nagging question dogs  Wall Street: Do brokerages understand how to make clients out of this now  26-to-44 age group?  </P> <P> As investors, baby boomers are likely to be the same tough customers that  they've been in other markets. They're independent, they want high-quality  goods, and over time they'll probably be far more critical than their parents  in evaluating services they buy.  </P> <P> Those traits suggest that it will cost brokers more effort and expense to serve  the boomer crowd -- at a time when brokerage industry profits overall are being  squeezed by other forces.  </P> <P> In the boomers, "we're dealing with the most sophisticated consumer we've ever  had to deal with," admits James Higgins, president of Dean Witter Reynolds'  financial services group in New York.  </P> <P> Despite the challenges, virtually every major brokerage is spending a lot of  time trying to figure out how to nab the boomers. The numbers tell the story:  </P> <P> * As the first boomers enter the 45-and-over age group this year, they will  start a cycle expected to result in meteoric growth of savings and investment.  People age 45 to 54 traditionally are big savers, because those are the prime  earnings years. That age group will grow about 12% a year for the first five  years of the 1990s, and 23% for the latter five. That will be five to 10 times  the growth rate for the U.S. population overall.  </P> <P> * While some experts have questioned whether consumption-happy baby boomers --  who up to now have been so directed toward instant gratification -- will ever  save money the way their parents did, the boomers' intentions seem clear. A  survey of 400 affluent investors last year, done for the investment firm John  Nuveen &amp; Co., showed that 45% of those in the 35-to-54 age group say they  will be investing more over the next five years, and only 9% will be investing  less. In contrast, only 20% of those over 55 expect to be saving more than they  do now.  </P> <P> Who's going to get the boomers' dollars? There's more competition than ever  before. To name a few: banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds  and, of course, brokerages. And increasingly, what each of them wants is not  just to sell a few products to boomers but to strike up personal money  management relationships with these young investors -- via a salesperson. That  person, then, will be the rake that pulls in more money from the boomer  investors as they age.  </P> <P> In Wall Street parlance, this is called "asset gathering." To financial  services companies, offering management of funds rather than just  take-it-or-leave-it products guarantees a steady stream of income, because  clients are charged annual fees (usually 1% to 3% of assets managed) besides  any up-front sales charges.  </P> <P> What's more, "People who have funds managed are likely to stay twice as long  with a firm as someone who just buys some shares of stock," says Perrin Long,  veteran brokerage industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Services in New York.  And boomer investment trends so far suggest they'd much rather have their money  managed than go through the trouble of picking individual stocks. Witness the  continuing boom in stock and bond mutual fund sales.  </P> <P> The tough road for brokerage firms is that relatively few baby boomers now view  a broker as a "primary financial adviser." The Nuveen survey, for example,  studied people who already invest. In that group, nearly half of those 55 and  older said they consider a broker to be their primary adviser. But of those 35  to 54, only 33% said a broker is their primary adviser.  </P> <P> Can brokers successfully sell boomers the image of a trustworthy financial  consultant? John Steffens, the respected head of consumer markets for Merrill  Lynch &amp; Co., suggests that the formula isn't so difficult. "That's how our  whole training program has gone," Steffens says. "We changed the term from  'broker' to 'financial consultant' four to five years ago."  </P> <P> Merrill claims to already have its hooks into many baby boomers via individual  retirement accounts and corporate 401(k) retirement savings plans. The firm  says it holds 2 million IRAs, worth $42 billion. "We're the leader," Steffens  says.  </P> <P> Likewise, the strategy of Dean Witter parent Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is to  deliver up investment clients from Sears' other far-flung financial operations  -- from the Discover credit card to Allstate insurance. "We want to establish a  client relationship well before the person's peak earnings years," said Dean  Witter's Higgins.  </P> <P> Get them early, and as the boomers begin saving more, other needs will surface  automatically, Steffens notes: tax problems, insurance, financing children's  education and general investing. The "financial consultant's" goal is to gather  more assets from the client at each stage.  </P> <P> "The hardest part of it all is thinking long-term -- from the client's  viewpoint and from the salesperson's viewpoint," Steffens says.  </P> <P> But there's another problem with brokers as financial consultants: Can a broker  be objective about where to put the client's money when the broker most likely  earns more from selling his own firm's products (such as in-house mutual funds)  than from selling outside products?  </P> <P> "There are some conflicts in the public mind," Steffens admits. "But the world  is full of conflicts. It's how you manage it.  </P> <P> "There is no such thing as a free lunch," he adds, asking rhetorically, "What  is an (independent) financial planner telling you to do?" The only issue should  be "how you create your long-term financial success," he said.  </P> <P> Other brokerages, however, still believe that the role of their salespeople  should be only that: sales. Brokers at the national firm of A. G. Edwards &amp;  Sons, for example, have no in-house mutual funds or other products to sell.  Their job is strictly to sell clients what they want -- not to gather assets,  which Edwards sees as a high-cost process to maintain.  </P> <P> Where the majority of baby boom investors will fall on that issue remains to be  seen. But brokerages aren't the only firms betting that millions of boomers  will be willing to pay to have their money managed.  </P> <P> * Chase Manhattan Bank is launching a service to direct clients who have at  least $100,000 to money managers who fit the clients' needs. Chase will take a  cut of the management fees for its trouble.  </P> <P> Many banks are broadening the scope of their trust departments, and as federal  restrictions disappear, the banks may increasingly invade the brokers' turf.  </P> <P> * Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund kingpin, is just now ramping up a  "Personal Advisory Service." For a $100,000 minimum investment, Fidelity will  create a diversified portfolio of six to 13 Fidelity funds for an individual  client. Fidelity then will manage the portfolio, shifting money among stock,  bond and money market funds as market conditions change, says James O'Donnell,  senior vice president.  </P> <P> The cost of the service: 1% a year for the first $100,000, with the fee  declining as the amount increases. For that fee, a client gets a personal  Fidelity representative to handle problems or questions at any time, O'Donnell  said.  </P> <P> Until February, Fidelity's minimum investment for the service was just $50,000  -- an amount within reach of more baby boomers. But the firm's experience in  the pilot program for the service was that "our reps were being overwhelmed" by  the time required to deal with clients, O'Donnell said. So the minimum was  hiked to $100,000.  </P> <P> Fidelity's experience raises the one question Wall Street most fears: Will  brokerages' costly asset-gathering and asset-management infrastructures be able  to charge enough to make them profitable? Or will picky boomer customers demand  too much of brokers and refuse to pay up?  </P> <P> The Nuveen study showed boomers already are far more critical in how they judge  their financial advisers -- a sign Wall Street will have to work hard for the  business. While 42% of the over-55 age group in the Nuveen study rated their  financial adviser "excellent," only 30% of the 35 to 54 group gave that rating.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch's Steffens clearly places the onus on the individual broker and  the relationship he or she develops with boomer clients. "If we can deliver  quality, then we can charge the rate," he said. "If we don't do that, then the  whole strategy fails."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BABY-BOOMER INVESTORS: TOUGH CUSTOMERS  </P> <P> Wall Street faces a big challenge in making brokerage customers out of the baby  boomers. They'll have plenty of money to invest over the next decade, but they  may not take it to brokers. And some brokers may not want this finicky group.  Some results from a summer, 1989, survey of 400 affluent investors for John  Nuveen &amp; Co.:  </P> <P> Will you be investing more or less over the next 5 years, versus the last 5  years?  </P> <P> 35-54 Age Group  </P> <P> MORE: 45%  </P> <P> LESS: 9%  </P> <P> SAME: 46%  </P> <P> 55+ Age Group  </P> <P> MORE: 20%  </P> <P> LESS: 30%  </P> <P> SAME: 47%  </P> <P> DON'T KNOW: 3%  </P> <P> Who do you now consider your primary financial adviser?  </P> <P> 35-54 Age Group  </P> <P> STOCKBROKER 33%  </P> <P> NO ONE/SELF 31%  </P> <P> ACCOUNTANT 15%  </P> <P> LAWYER 9%  </P> <P> OTHER 12%  </P> <P> 55+ Age Group  </P> <P> STOCKBROKER 47%  </P> <P> NO ONE/SELF 24%  </P> <P> ACCOUNTANT 8%  </P> <P> LAWYER 4%  </P> <P> OTHER 7%  </P> <P> How would you rate the service from your financial adviser, in terms of general  investment advice?  </P> <P> 35-54 Age Group  </P> <P> EXCELLENT 30%  </P> <P> GOOD 51%  </P> <P> FAIR 16%  </P> <P> POOR 1%  </P> <P> DON'T KNOW 2%  </P> <P> 55+ Age Group  </P> <P> EXCELLENT 42%  </P> <P> GOOD 44%  </P> <P> FAIR 8%  </P> <P> POOR 1%  </P> <P> DON'T KNOW 5%  </P> <P> Source: Hal Riney &amp; Partners, for John Nuveen &amp; Co.  </P></p>

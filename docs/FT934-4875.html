			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Beijing unveils plan to overhaul tax system China yesterday unveiled a drastic overhaul of its tax system aimed at simplifying collection procedures and boosting the central government's dwindling share of revenues. Mr Zhang Zhongcheng, a top official of the National Tax Administration, told an international seminar in Beijing the changes would complement Chinese economic reforms which have produced dramatic growth without a corresponding increase in government revenues. 'Fiscal reform must favour the power of the central government to implement tax laws,' he said. Total tax revenue has dropped sharply in the past decade from 26.7 per cent of gross national product in 1979 to 15.8 per cent in 1991. Among the main features of China's new tax regime, which is to be phased in from January 1, are: A uniform 33 per cent tax rate on all enterprises to replace the 55 per cent now levied on large and medium-sized state concerns. Preferential taxes for foreign enterprises and joint ventures would not be affected initially, but eventually would be brought into line with the corporate rate. The imposition of a value added tax in line with international practice. VAT will be applied at a uniform rate of 17 per cent on all goods in circulation, but an additional excise would also be levied on luxury items such cigarettes, alcohol and beauty products, along with gas and petrol. Personal income taxes are to be overhauled to introduce a uniform system that will apply to foreigners, Chinese citizens and a category described as 'private entrepreneurs'. Nine tax rates are to be imposed ranging from 5 per cent on a base income of 800 yuan (Dollars 140) per month up to 45 per cent on higher incomes. Special taxes will be levied on the extractive industries such as the mining of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and what are described as 'non-metallic deposits'. This would be in addition to VAT. Charges on property transactions will also be levied, along with taxes on stock exchange dealings, inheritances and insurance. Tax laws dealing with Chinese and foreigners will be unified under a 'unified personal income tax law'. Mr Zhang sought to reassure foreign investors that their tax advantages would be preserved under the new regime, but he did not go into detail. 'We think, to attract foreign capital and foreign methods and to accelerate China's economic development, preferential tax treatment applied to foreign investment enterprises are absolutely indispensable,' he said. 'Tax reforms will not change that.' China faces enormous difficulties collecting taxes in an economy undergoing rapid transformation. The central government lacks the sophisticated mechanisms and manpower required to impose a strict regime. Another problem is a shortage of accountants. Tax avoidance and evasion is widespread. Competition between the centre and provinces in tax collection - the two are often engaged in a fierce struggle for a share of revenues - is another factor bedevilling efforts to bolster central government coffers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD]  has reacted to the election of the new federal president, Roman  Herzog, by sharply criticizing Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  and the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. SPD Chairman Rudolf  Scharping told journalists in Berlin on 24 May that the Bonn  coalition had only had an interest in "demonstrating power" in  this connection.    The selection of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] candidate was not marked by the will to  find the best president for the Germans, "but by Helmut Kohl's  power policy calculation." He said the SPD was in agreement  with most Germans that Johannes Rau would have been the better  choice.    The SPD chairman said the SPD would cooperate loyally with  the new head of state. However, the Social Democrats expected  Herzog to conduct his office "in an absolutely impartial way"  and to orient himself at the line pursued by his predecessor,  Richard von Weizsaecker. His first official speech on Monday  evening [23 May] had, however, failed to create this impression,  said Scharping.    The SPD chief also sharply criticized the FDP. By their  attitude in the Federal Convention, they had abandoned their  role as an independent political force. What they presented as  loyalty to the coalition, was complete subjugation, said  Scharping. It was typical for FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel to  virtually have to ask for a vote of confidence, in order to push  through his line.    Despite his defeat, Johannes Rau had met with broad support  in the Federal Convention and above all from the people. The  SPD would make use of this impetus for the upcoming elections  and would make the European elections in three weeks a "fourth  ballot," said Scharping.</p>

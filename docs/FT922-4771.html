			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (1): From pits to science parks - New investment has brought high-technology industries and new skills to the county and helped to reshape its industrial base. Progress has taken place along the M4 corridor, but infrastructure development is still needed further north GWENT IS a curious mixture of the affluent and the not-so-affluent. Parts of the county around Monmouth, Usk and Abergavenny, which have acquired the popular title of the golden triangle, have the highest average income in Wales. Other parts, such as the borough of Torfaen above Newport, have among the lowest. Unemployment in a county that once had some of the heaviest industry in Britain is not unusually high, though. The county's average of 11.6 per cent is only slightly above that for Wales. Even Blaenau Gwent, at the top of the valleys, has only 13.8 per cent. Yet there is still a perception, especially in the south-east of England, that Gwent is a place of dereliction and smoking chimneys. 'Our image is one of the major problems to be overcome,' says Mr John Pembridge, chairman of the county's planning and economic development committee. 'People think we are all about coal and steel: we're not. The only pit left is a museum and the remaining steelworks are places of high technology, run by banks of computers. 'The garden festival at Ebbw Vale, which is open until early October, has been a marvellous opportunity for us to show people what the valleys are really like. Once they see how green and pleasant they are, we go right to the front of the queue as a desirable location.' Mr Graham Moore, the Welsh Development Agency's property director, agrees. 'A feeling of confidence is coming back,' he says. 'The property market is beginning to be more active, with developers starting to turn their plans into more tangible forms.' Mr Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent borough council, points to a 60 per cent increase in lettings in the borough in the first quarter of this year compared with the last three months of 1991. But not everyone is so optimistic. Mr Bruce Woodhead, managing director of London and Cardiff Properties, which is participating in a 170-acre development, Celtic Lakes, at Newport that will include a science park, warns that getting new tenants is still a hard grind. 'People who have been mulling over a new investment for some time are prepared to go ahead,' he says. 'But it is difficult to win new decisions.' Difficult - but not impossible. Gwent has won a lot of new investment in the past year, which has helped to change the face of the county. Perhaps the most important was the decision by Trico-Folberth, one of the leading manufacturers of windscreen wipers for the motor industry, to relocate from West London to Pontypool, creating more than 500 jobs. Also significant was the arrival of Northern Telecom at Cwmcarn which is to increase its workforce from 600 to around 900. At Crumlin, Integra Plasma, a semi-conductor manufacturer, is expanding, as is A. Schulman, an American concern, which is spending Pounds 2.1m to increase output of plastic compounds and resins. Tillery Valley Foods is to invest Pounds 2m in expanding production of pre-cooked meals at Abertillery. Festive Productions is also to spend Pounds 2m to produce more Christmas decorations at Newport. These companies, and others like them, are the new Gwent. The county that was a base for heavy industry is now home to the industries of the late 20th century. Electronics and information technology, financial services, motor industry parts and food processing have replaced the belching smoke-stack industries of the past. Fifteen years ago, almost 40 per cent of the workforce was in mining or manufacturing; by 1989, the last year for which figures are available, the number was down to a third. Those employed in distribution and hotels had risen from 14.9 to 18 per cent in the same period and banking and finance had leapt from 2.6 to 7 per cent with the arrival of TSB Trust, the Patent Office and the Business Statistics Office. Financial services have been a major growth sector. On the industrial side, AB Electronics, the electronics concern, is one of the larger representatives of the new Gwent. 'We have designated our Rogerstone factory, near Newport, as the flagship plant in a new drive to attack the fast-growing market for electronic products in Europe,' says Mr Paul Ryder, the managing director. 'Rogerstone, which employs over 800 people and has some of the largest and most modern electronic assembly lines in Europe, will form the hub of a cluster of AB plants in the UK and on the Continent.' AB Electronics is not alone in the field. Incomers in recent years have included the Japanese company Star Micronics at Tredegar, Nimbus Records at Cwmbran, Newbridge Networks, a Canadian company, which is about to expand to a second site, at Newport and Yuasa Battery and Aiwa, two Japanese concerns, at Ebbw Vale and Crumlin respectively. The financial services sector will get a massive shot in the arm with the completion of property developments now being undertaken in and around Newport, using the M4 motorway as a corridor. The star will be the creation of a science park, Imperial Park, managed by and using the back-up of London University's Imperial College. The science park is part of a larger development, Celtic Lakes, which will provide around 2m sq ft of prime space. Imperial House, the core building is almost ready for occupation as an innovation centre and the science park as a whole is being seen as a marvellous opportunity to develop the potential, and create a new image not just for Gwent but also for the whole of Wales. Across the road from Celtic Lakes, Gwent County Council, in conjunction with the Welsh Development Agency, is extending its technology park that is already home to AB Electronics' R&amp;D centre. With the opening of a second Severn crossing, costing Pounds 270m and scheduled for 1996, the M4 corridor in southern Gwent will be seen as a prime attraction according to Mr Andrew Fretter, the county's head of economic development. 'The county is already one of the most dynamic parts of the UK in growth terms,' he says. 'It has consistently demonstrated this by having the highest rate of VAT-registered company formations outside the south-east of England. 'Although we have had a difficult year, like the rest of Britain, and we have had to deal with more problems among businesses than ever before, there is evidence that we are emerging from that troublesome period. 'Trico was a great shot in the arm but there are others coming and with the science park we should become an international centre for research and development.' The problem for Gwent is to encourage new investment to move up the valleys from the M4 corridor. It is not easy but it can be done. 'Ten years ago, when we began work on the Rassau industrial park above Ebbw Vale and Tredegar,' says Mr David Fallowell, the WDA's executive director, 'people thought we would never be successful. But 3,000 people are now employed on that estate, as well as a large number at another at nearby Tafarnaubach.' Both Mr Fretter and Mr Fallowell believe the garden festival will act as a catalyst to draw people north. 'Communications are excellent at the top of the valleys,' Mr Fretter says. 'The A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which is to be upgraded, offers a good, quick route to the West Midlands. But it is all about image. And this is why the festival is so important. 'Everyone who comes to Ebbw Vale remarks on the site and its potential. The tops of the valleys are our most depressed areas. New jobs and new homes there will make an enormous impact.' To help not just this area but the whole of the county, Gwent has adopted a strategy which puts a premium on partnerships, not just with other public sector bodies but also with the private sector, training initiatives and improvements to the infrastructure. It has set up an image partnership and a business forum and has even backed a private-sector plan for an international airport. With Avon County Council, on the eastern end of the Severn Bridge, anxious to constrain further economic development, Gwent is in a fortunate position, especially when the second Severn bridge is open, to capitalise on the need for industry to find acceptable new homes along the M4. The restructuring and diversification of the past 10 years, which have created a stronger economy, look set to reap ample dividends.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Bangemann gives reply to the EC's minimalists THE Maastricht treaty is a milestone along the road to a federal European state, ensuring that 'more and more decisions can only be taken at the European level', according to Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the European Commission. Mr Bangemann, a former German economy minister and Bonn's senior commissioner in Brussels, said the EC must integrate further before it takes in new members, and that the notion of 'subsidiarity' - ensuring decisions are taken at the most appropriate level of government - 'presupposes the idea of a federal European state'. His remarks, although entirely unexceptionable from a German federalist and not unsupported by the contents of Maastricht and common EC policy, nevertheless provided ammunition to British anti-treaty MPs trying to defeat Mr John Major's government in today's vote on Maastricht. Mr Bangemann, former leader of Germany's liberal FPD, the junior coalition partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, was speaking in Berlin to a conference on Europe's future. His remarks challenge the minimalist interpretation of the treaty Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, have been presenting to their domestic constituencies. As Mr Bangemann recognised, neither he nor the Commission have any powers to determine what decisions are taken at EC level, when the Community should enlarge, much less what the 12 should decide in the review foreseen by Maastricht for 1996. 'It is the Council not Commission which decides on all Community matters,' he underlines. But his remarks constitute an uncompromising if mainstream federalist view of EC development, and of the need for more 'deepening' before the Community 'widens'. They also echo last week's warning from Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, that Denmark risks being left on the sidelines if it fails to ratify Maastricht in a new referendum. In the treaty, 'the goal of a federal European state is spelled out for the first time', Mr Bangemann says. 'Although Maastricht did not see the creation of a federal European state, the breakthrough must come with the next step,' he adds, in a reference to the 1996 review, 'so that the Community can open its doors to new members and assume its Europe-wide responsibilities.'</p>

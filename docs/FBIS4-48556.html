			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency President Bakili Muluzi has appealed  to all political parties and people of this country to forget  the past and work together constructively toward the development  of Malawi.    President Muluzi was speaking at the Kamuzu Stadium in  Blantyre today after being sworn in as the first president of a  multiparty Malawi. He said the democracy which Malawi has now  embraced should be used constructively for the welfare of every  Malawian. President Muluzi also stressed the need to coexist  peacefully and to tolerate people of different political views.  The president pledged that his government would endeavor to  develop the available resources in the country for the  betterment of every citizen. He said his government's  priorities are poverty alleviation and food security.    In his inaugural speech President Muluzi also declared that  he would not condone corruption and mismanagement of the  country's resources because the country is poor. He said he  will ensure that measures are put in place to check corruption.  The president then promised to improve the efficiency of the  civil service to make it more effective in discharging  government services and enhancing the country's economic  development. He explained that he was aware that the morale in  the present civil service was low and promised to look into the  issue soon.    Commenting on the democratization process in Malawi,  President Muluzi said he would make sure that democracy is never  curtailed in the country. In order to sustain this process and  to improve human rights in the country, the president ordered  the closure of (Mukuyu), (Nzaleka), and Nsanje prisons which, he  said, were used to abuse human rights. He also ordered the  release of all political prisoners and commuted death sentences  to life imprisonment. President Muluzi also allowed human rights  organizations to visit this country's prisons without any  hindrance.    In his speech, the president declared the new state house in  Lilongwe as the new parliament and also announced that a  committee would be set up to dispose the country's many state  presidencies. President Muluzi then thanked the international  community for supporting Malawi's democratization process and  hoped for continued assistance. He also expressed gratitude to  churches in Malawi for the leading role they played in changing  the country's political system and urged them to continue being  the society's watchdogs.    Turning to outgoing President Ngwazi [Paramount] Dr. Kamuzu  Banda, President Muluzi said he deserves respect and he will be  remembered for the role he played in this country. At the  ceremony which was attended by thousands upon thousands of  people, Mr. Justin Malewezi was also sworn in as vice president.</p>

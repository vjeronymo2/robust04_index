			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yaroslav Shimov: "Gaydar Grants To Take the </F> Place of Lenin Grants"]    [Text] The Higher School of Economics was set up at the  end of 1992. According to its leaders, this academic  institution is supposed to become a "nursery for Russia's  economic elite." But the problems of Russian higher education,  especially financial, have not bypassed the newly fledged  "nursery."    The "Democratic Choice of Russia" party has decided to give  some support to the young intellectuals. It has instituted  grants for Higher School of Economics students -- 15 for  baccalaureate (first degree) students and 20 for master's degree  (second degree) students, plus 20 grants worth 180,000 rubles  each to allow students from other cities to pay for their  residence in Moscow. It is also proposed to establish a  permanent grant fund to which entrepreneurs wishing to support  economics students can contribute funds.    Sergey Blagovolin, chairman of the organizing committee of  the "Democratic Choice of Russia's" Moscow organization, claims  that the students will receive party grants for success in their  studies and academic work irrespective of their political views.  The fact that academics from such different poles as Yegor  Gaydar and Leonid Abalkin sit on the monitoring council and  figure among the Higher School of Economics teachers could help  to guarantee this to a certain extent.</p>

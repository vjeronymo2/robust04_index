			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- "Jozef Moravcik has  no moral right to be the Slovak premier and I therefore call on  him to resign from his office," Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Deputies' Group, said  today at parliamentary debate on the programme of the new Slovak  Government.    Cabaj said that Moravcik had harmed and dishonored the  Slovak  Republic, pointing to a report worked out by the Slovak Foreign  Ministry when headed by Moravcik before Slovak President Michal  Kovac's visit to the Vatican last year.    The Vatican's state system was characterized in the report  as  a "theocratic and absolutist monarchy headed by the pope," Cabaj  said. He said that the document also pointed to the Vatican's  cooperation with the fascist states in the 30's. Cabaj  described as scandalous the passage in the report saying that  "under the pontification of John Paul II the Vatican has been  evidently seeking to propagate the concept of Christian Europe  and the Christian Pan-Slavism." According to the report the  Vatican is aiming at "strengthening positions of power and the  ideological influence of the Roman Catholic Church and is  propagating the concept of Christian Europe, ideological and  subversive activity and the clerical coalition with the United  States and other NATO states," Cabaj said.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Italian Bonds: Amato still has a long way to go IF MR GIULIANO Amato, Italy's premier, were a film star, he would be gloating over the rave reviews which greeted his latest venture. But for Mr Amato, this is just the beginning: he still has a long way to go before the markets are convinced he has the stomach - and political backing - to take on Italy's debt burden and win. The enthusiasm that rippled through the markets last week followed agreement between trades unions, industrialists and the government to scrap Italy's scala mobile, which has linked wages to inflation for nearly half a century. The deal has yet to be concluded, and a backlash from the more militant Italian unions is possible - though the risk is ruled out in most quarters. The ending of inflation-linked wage rises could wipe 1 per cent off the country's inflation rate in the medium term. The rate could be down to 3 per cent by end-1995, compared with 3.9 per cent if the scala mobile had been retained. The rise in Italian government bonds last week was nearly as extravagant as the praise from the pundits. The gross yield on 10-year BTPs fell to 13.45 per cent from 14.14 per cent a week before. The advance was spurred by the Bank of Italy's 0.5 point cut in the discount rate to 13.25 per cent, reversing in part two recent rises made to defend the lira. With public debt the size of Italy's though, every cut in interest rates helps. A full point off rates would save the Italian Treasury nearly L15,000bn a year  - or around 10 per cent of this year's budget deficit. Mr Amato's credibility rests on his battle against that deficit. His emergency budget may have calmed fears about this year's deficit, but far more important will be the budget for 1993, due this autumn. This is one of the two factors overshadowing Italian bonds. The other is Maastricht. Whatever the administration's successes in tackling domestic problems, foreign investors are unlikely to return in any numbers until the road to monetary union is cleared opening the way for the convergence of European bond yields.</p>

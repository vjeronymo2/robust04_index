			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Clergy may lose security of tenure Consultations on whether clergy should become subject to conventional employment contracts are to be conducted by the the Church of England. At present more than two-thirds of the church's stipendiary clergy are in post on the basis of the ecclesiastical freehold, meaning they cannot be moved against their will. A steering group on conditions of service decided this week to consult dioceses on seven possible alternative arrangements. The church's policy-making general synod will debate the issue next year. A report by the steering group finds that security of tenure in other Christian denominations is 'considerably less' than that in most Church of England clergy. It says the freehold enables clergy to voice their views without fear or favour and protects them from arbitrary action by bishops, fellow clergy, patrons or parishioners. But it impedes mobility and gives an 'unacceptable degree of permanence to the pastorally inadequate and inefficient'. Subjecting clergy to normal forms of employment contract are among the more radical options raised by the report. Another option would replace the freehold with a leasehold arrangement, under which incumbents would be entitled to remain in post for a fixed number of years.</p>

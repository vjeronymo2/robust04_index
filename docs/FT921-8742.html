			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: Sentimental in the sun THERE IS a touch of the Mike Tyson verdict in the audience reaction to Caribbean poet Derek Walcott's play Viva Detroit at the Tricycle Theatre. When a huge, muscular black man mechanically declares his affection for a woman who is offering herself to him on a plate, on the first night there was an audible hiss from the women's section. The protest was directed not against the woman but against the man, who was arguably doing no more than taking his cue and responding to the circumstances. There is also more than a touch of Shirley Valentine. Sonny, the big black man, seems unmistakeably drawn from the Greek boatman who takes the women tourists as they come, tells the same spiel to them all, and prefers to stay where he is. The difference, such as it is, is that this is the Caribbean, not the Aegean: St Lucia in the Windwards, to be precise. Yet before I put anyone off, I should say that the production by the Black Theatre Cooperative, directed by Malcolm Frederick, is excellent. There is a fine set with an outdoor Caribbean bar in the foreground and a Caribbean sun in the background. The performances by all three members of the cast are impeccable. The problem lies with the play. Walcott was born in St Lucia and is now a professor at Boston University. On the evidence of Viva Detroit, he prefers American sentimentality to old world scepticism. The theme of the piece is the effect on the Caribbean islands of hotels and international tourism. Some 30 years ago, before the coming of the jumbo jets, that might have seemed prescient, and indeed tourism has brought all sorts of hazards, notably drugs. Walcott's play, however, is stuck in the romantic past of television soap. An American girl arrives in the island, falls for the local gigolo and wants to take him to Detroit. When the affair fails to work out, her closing line is: 'Happy hours, Sonny. I mean that.' A barman who wears a wig, and admits to being part-Indian, looks on throughout, alternately sympathising with the gigolo and the American. There are some attempted jokes about the Club Med and the rising power of the D-Mark. One joke that comes off is the barman's comment after an exchange between the gigolo and the lady: 'Tourist one, native nought.' I also liked the reference to the privatisation of the local volcano and laughed again when the lady pulls a gun. 'I'm a third world country, babe,' says the gigolo. 'Let's just cancel the debt.' The rest is thin. Marlena Mackey has superb vitality as the American. Norman Beaton could charm anyone as the versatile barman, and one feels for Steve Toussaint as Sonny now that the fashion has turned against muscular masculinity. All three of them deserve better material. Walcott is currently adapting The Odyssey for the Royal Shakespeare Company: no doubt it will be a sentimental journey.</p>

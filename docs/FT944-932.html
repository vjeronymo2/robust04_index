			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Turkish reform party emerges A 38-year-old liberal Turkish millionaire yesterday launched a new political party promising many of the reforms Turkey's international critics are demanding. Mr Cem Boyner, heir to a textile fortune, promised that if elected, his New Democracy Movement (YDH) would dismantle the government's stifling political and economic control apparatus. He also said he would open talks to end 10 years of fighting with the Kurds in south-east Turkey. Although a political novice, Mr Boyner is well known as a former head of the TUSIAD business association and last week ranked third in an opinion poll, with 14 per cent support.</p>

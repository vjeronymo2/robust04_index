			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Education row to flare again as tests begin Controversy over education will return to the top of the political agenda today as tests for 14-year-olds start in schools in England and Wales and the government announces details of its proposed cuts in the national curriculum for next year. Conflict is likely over English, where the government is expected to publish a suggested reading list of novels. Teachers have opposed such a list as unacceptably limiting their professional discretion. The revised curriculum is likely to recommend using the 'phonics' method for teaching reading - a favourite cause for educational conservatives. And team games are likely to be made compulsory between the ages of 14 and 16. Cuts in the national curriculum were announced last year by Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests, following a boycott of tests by teachers that forced them to be abandoned. The announcement of the detail of the cuts is certain to reopen divisions between educational traditionalists and progressives. History has already provoked an angry response from one member of the working party reviewing the draft curriculum. Sir Ron denied the charge that the revised history syllabus ignored the study of English monarchs. After the proposals are announced today by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, government advisers will start a consultation costing between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m. Sir Ron aims to deliver the new curriculum to schools by the end of January for the academic year beginning next September. Teachers' reactions to today's proposals could be critical to the fate of this year's tests. More disruption seems certain as the National Union of Teachers, the largest in the UK, has voted to continue boycotting the tests. Both the other big unions have voted to stop their boycott, ensuring increased take-up of the tests this year.</p>

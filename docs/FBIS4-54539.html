			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Modernizing Poland's outdated telephone  network, the DGT digital telecommunications firm has developed a  telecommunications system that should be able to compete with  foreign-built equivalents. A page 1 article in the 29 March-5  April Warsaw weekly GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA T HANDLOWA, "a paper for  entrepreneurs and employers," described the production of the  DGT3450 system by the firm, which was cofounded by a group of  graduate students from the Gdansk Institute of Technology  (Politechnika Gdanska). According to the article, the firm is  competing on the market with "such giants as Siemens, Alcatel,  Ericsson, and AT&amp;T," a competition that Waldemar Frenkel,  Warsaw  representative of DGT, compares with "domestic car production  competing with Mercedes or Volvo."    The need for digital systems in telecommunications coincided  with a similar need to modernize the public telephone network,  and it became clear that this modernization can be achieved by  putting modern electronic exchanges into service. According to  the article, disclosure by the state of its needs in this regard  produced great interest among the above-mentioned Western firms.  Competing with these firms, DGT also constructed, after several  years of research, its own telecommunications system, called  DGT3450, which is now ready for series production. The DGT3450  system resembles a simple metal cabinet filled with complete and  highly integrated systems, computer processors, and a  microcomputer equipped with at least 640 kilobytes of random  access memory, a hard disk (with at least 40 megabytes), and a  remote control system.    For professionals employed in this field, "construction of  the telephone exchange in the size and shape of a narrow cabinet  was some kind of a revelation." Also proving to be a  revelation, according to the article, was the high technical and  quality level this design offers. One of its features is a  modern switching system that uses integrated circuits,  demonstrating the ability to work together with the outdated  (10-, 20-, 30-, and 50-year-old) equipment of the Polish  telephone network. The new DGT exchange that would replace an  old analog exchange could seamlessly operate with any foreign  electronic or electromechanical exchange. Another important  feature of the DGT3450 is its modular design and open  architecture that allow practically endless expansion. DGT has  flexibility with regard to the number and type of customer  circuits and interexchanges. Last, the system meets the needs of  customers and, by employing energy-efficient technology, is  close to 50-percent cheaper than those produced by foreign  companies. The designers emphasize the versatility of this  "DGT3450 system, which could be seriously considered for  providing telephone services in the countryside as well as  serving middle-sized and large enterprises." In fact, DGT  exchanges are already installed in many hospitals, schools, and  central and government offices. Because of its economic and  reliable nature, the system has also been introduced in some  mining operations, power plants, police stations, the railway  system, and the Army.</p>

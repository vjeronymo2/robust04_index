			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Vasilets: "The Diplomatic Conference in </F> Vladivostok"]    [Text] On March 14 a diplomatic conference took place  in Vladivostok at the bedside of a patient who had started to  develop an ailment--Russian-American relations. The necessity  for the consultation was evident: For a number of weeks already,  on both sides of the Atlantic--in the American, European and  Russian press--a great deal has been said about the noticeable  deterioration in the health of this "patient", who became the  victim of the collateral consequences of the espionage horrors  and the, in the opinion of the West, too independent initiative  of Moscow in Yugoslavia.    In Washington people simultaneously took offense and were  distressed. They took offense when they discovered a Russian spy  in the CIA. They were distressed since the Kremlin did not even  consult with the White House in taking decisive steps in regard  to the guarantee of the security of Sarajevo. However, Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who met on the Far  East shore with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, saw  the problem in a different light: The signs of disharmony that  called forth alarm are only growing pains. Moscow realized that  it should not play in world affairs the role of the "younger  brother" of the United States, which the creators of policy in  Washington regarded as quite suitable for the former superpower.  The Kremlin clearly declared its equality. Before the beginning  of the talks, Andrey Kozyrev told an ITAR-TASS correspondent:  "We are conducting this meeting at the remote edge of our land  and we will hold talks from the positions of mature strategic  partnership." Very likely, "mature partnership" are the key  words that determined the position of the Russian side. In  Vladivostok it had to be clarified how the Americans view this  declaration.    The prelude to the negotiations--a visit by Kozyrev to the  anti-submarine ship "Admiral Panteleyev"--is also perceived as a  demonstration of the justification of the Russian claims. Here  the minister uttered all the words necessary for the occasion.  "A fleet," he declared, is one of the most powerful and flexible  instruments of statehood." The guest of the Far East sailors  spoke for the expansion of the Russian presence in the World  Ocean, having added that "in so doing our partners will only  respect us more." Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, who received the  minister, picked up the subject, having mentioned that this ship  completed a cruise in the Persian Gulf and cooperated there with  ships of the United States naval forces. In the words of the  admiral, the exercises confirmed that "the military technology  and training of our ships is not at all worse than among the  Americans."    Christopher flew to Vladivostok a bit downcast. The day  before he had held talks in Beijing that had proceeded in a  rather harsh tone. Psychologically, the U.S. secretary of state,  it seems, was ready to listen more favorably to Russian  independence considerations: What diplomat will assume  responsibility for the deterioration of relations with two great  powers in the course of one trip! Although, of course,  Christopher in the main followed the scenario worked out  earlier. In the words of a WASHINGTON POST correspondent who had  flown to Vladivostok, Christopher cautioned Kozyrev against  "uncoordinated actions" that could have an impact on the Mideast  peace process.    According to information of a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent,  the secretary of state made it clear to Kozyrev that "the United  States does not perceive Moscow's actions as something natural  and tried to dissuade him from too independent steps in such  regions as Bosnia and Hercegovina, as well as the Near East." In  his turn, Kozyrev explained that Russia cannot be kept on the  sidelines when global problems are decided.    Among correspondents, however, the impression was created  that the discussion was quite civilized, because Christopher  understands very well when Washington will act jointly with  Moscow and thereby will reserve for itself the possibility of  influencing the policy of its partner. It seems that Kozyrev,  too, had no reasons for rejecting the American proposal with  respect to a fuller exchange of information and consultations.    Moreover, the Russian minister took away from Vladivostok a  number of tangible confirmations of the readiness of the United  States for "mature partnership." I have in mind, above all, the  agreement of the Americans to Russia's participation in the work  of the Coordination Committee for the Control of Arms Exports  (COCOM). This organization in its time was created basically for  the purpose of blocking the Soviet Union's access to Western  technology. Kozyrev was also "completely satisfied" with the  United States position on the transformation of the "Big Seven"  into the "Big Eight" leading states through the inclusion of  Russia. In short, Christopher and Kozyrev agreed that there are  no serious threats to the health of the patient, and after  Vladivostok he will recover completely. "Mature partnership"  does not exclude disagreements, but there is no need to draw  far-reaching conclusions from them.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Move on train fares defeated AN ATTEMPT to put tight obligations on private rail operators to continue concessionary fare schemes was defeated by the government last night. The Lords voted by 81 to 51 during the Railways Bill's committee stage to reject an opposition amendment which would have made the secretary of state for transport, before appointing the railway franchising director, publish rules detailing a full range of concessionary fares. Lord Clinton-Davis, for Labour, said ministers had argued that innovatory marketing operations such as the issuing of railcards would continue after privatisation because operators would find it in their commercial interests. But one operator would be unlikely to accept another's railcard, he warned. The Earl of Caithness, transport minister, said a new clause, foreshadowed during the Commons report stage, would deal with the concerns. He said fears that existing network benefits would disappear were 'misplaced'.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Dow Chemical deeper in the red DOW CHEMICAL, the second-biggest US chemicals group, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 250m, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 94m in the corresponding period of 1991. The deficit, which was expected, occurred because of a Dollars 433m charge for plant shutdowns and staff reductions. Mr Frank Popoff, chairman, described the company's results as 'disappointing', although he stressed that progress had been made in restoring US margins. The US improvement, however, was more than offset by deteriorating business conditions in Europe, a problem faced by several big US chemicals groups. Revenues in the fourth quarter of last year were Dollars 4.72bn, up slightly from Dollars 4.56bn last time. Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 18.97bn, against Dollars 18.81bn in 1991. Dow said its operating income declined by 23 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 1.3bn, mainly because of a drop in prices. For the year to end-December 1992, Dow suffered a net loss of Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1.83, against a net profit of Dollars 935m in 1991. The loss, however, was due to a Dollars 765m non-cash charge related to changes in accountancy standards. The chemicals and performance products division had Dollars 279m of operating income in 1992, unchanged on 1991, including the impact of special charges. Plastics saw an 80 per cent decline in 1992 operating income, but the figure was not disclosed. The energy business suffered a Dollars 179m loss in 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 230m in 1991. The consumer specialties business had 13 per cent better operating income of Dollars 1.1bn, representing 84 per cent of the entire group's 1992 operating profit. Dow's share price was Dollars  3/4 lower to close at Dollars 52 5/8 .</p>

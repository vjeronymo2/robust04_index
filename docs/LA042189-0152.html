			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WALESA SEEKS INVESTMENTS, NOT AID  </P> <P> Lech Walesa, leader of Solidarity and champion of Poland's new political  course, told Italian political leaders today that his country needs investment,  rather than aid.  </P> <P> "Poland has all the figures to be part of of Europe, but it needs investments,  more than aid -- investments to create companies and a market," the Polish  labor leader told Premier Ciriaco De Mita.  </P> <P> In a 35-minute meeting with the premier, Walesa said Solidarity intends to  fight economic centralism and work for political, economic and social  pluralism. Foreign investment would play a key role in helping Poles reach  those goals, he said.  </P> <P> Walesa also drummed home his plea for investments in talks today with President  Francesco Cossiga, Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, Socialist Party leader  Bettino Craxi and Rome Mayor Pietro Giubilo.  </P></p>

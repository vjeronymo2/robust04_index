			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Clinton cold on USAir stake for BA GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate in the US, has come out against British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) investment in USAir, arguing US airlines would get no reciprocal access to the UK market if the deal were allowed. This comes at a critical time for BA's controversial deal, now awaiting approval by the US transportation department. The transaction - opposed by American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the three biggest US carriers - hinges on the outcome of US-UK talks on a new liberal aviation agreement between the two countries. Signs yesterday indicated the UK was unlikely to agree to US demands for immediate greater access for US carriers at London's Heathrow airport, in exchange for US approval of the BA deal. If the talks stay deadlocked, the BA-USAir deal is expected to collapse. Supporters of the BA transaction in the US and UK yesterday warned this risked severe consequences for the future of 'open skies', for jobs at USAir, and for other foreign investments in financially-pressed US carriers. The issue has been raised repeatedly in the last week, during the US presidential campaign, coinciding with a new round of UK-US negotiations in Washington to try to liberate air transport between the two countries. In a TV debate with Mr Clinton and President George Bush last week, Mr Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate, fiercely criticised the proposed BA acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir as 'terribly destructive to the US airline industry'. At the time, Mr Clinton avoided taking an outright position on the deal. Later, though, he said he would not agree to it. Mr Bush has said he cannot prejudge the issue until Mr Andrew Card, transportation secretary, has made his decision. 'USAir workers are picketing me out here in the field when I land, wherever there's any USAir. Standing next to them are the American Airline pickets, all concerned about their jobs,' the president said earlier this week. The big three US airlines remain highly critical of the package put forward by British negotiators, arguing that the benefits to BA are immediate, while those for the US carriers are promises that would come to fruition much later. The UK has proposed granting US carriers immediate open access to British regional airports, but greater access at Heathrow would be phased in as long as the US eased its current foreign ownership rules for US airlines. The big three US airlines are opposed to any phasing-in of liberalisation. They want immediate access at Heathrow and the necessary runway landing and take-off slots to operate new services to and from London. In addition, UK proposals for an elaborate disputes resolution mechanism are viewed by the US airlines as a way to reimpose heavy government regulation. US campaign officials thought it highly unlikely the Bush administration would try to rush through a decision on such a sensitive deal before the presidential election on Tuesday. If Mr Bush wins, he could press ahead; if Mr Clinton wins, it is thought unlikely a lame-duck administration would try to push the deal through before he took over on January 20. The latter result would probably end the proposed BA-USAir transaction, since BA is unlikely to extend the deadline for completion beyond December 24.</p>

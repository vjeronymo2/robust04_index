			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Companies lobby for industrial growth AN ALLIANCE of 21 big British companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, Marks and Spencer and Rolls-Royce, has emerged as a force within Whitehall trying to ensure that UK policies encourage manufacturing growth. Senior managers from the group hold unpublicised quarterly meetings at 10 Downing Street with Mr Gus O'Donnell, Mr John Major's press secretary, at which they pass on views about economic trends and the action they would like from the government. The group, the British Management Data Foundation, is the brainchild of Mr Anthony Cowgill, a 77-year-old former brigadier, who founded it in 1980. Other members include Shell UK, Wellcome, Allied-Lyons, ICL, British Gas, National Power, TI Group and Lucas. British Petroleum, Unilever and British Aerospace, while not part of the foundation, sometimes send people to meetings. News of its activities comes as industry steps up its efforts to win a bigger voice in Whitehall after years of complaining that government policies do not value manufacturing highly enough. In a meeting with Mr O'Donnell in November, the foundation pressed for long-term efforts to make the civil service more sympathetic towards manufacturing, as well as for cuts in interest rates. Mr O'Donnell said the Downing Street gatherings were a 'useful exercise'. Notes from the meetings were passed to Mr Major. The group met Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last year to discuss how to promote industrial innovation. It has recently started a discussion with Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, in an effort to build on the Treasury's initiative to foster better links with industry.

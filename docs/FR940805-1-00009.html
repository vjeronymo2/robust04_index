Among the factors to be considered in reviewing the borrower's projected capitalization are the economic strength of the borrower's service territory, the inherent cost of providing service to the territory, the disparity in rates between the borrower and neighboring utilities, the intensity of competition faced by the borrower from neighboring utilities and other power sources, and the relative amount of new capital investment required to serve existing or new loads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 1710.115 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.115 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Final maturity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Loans made or guaranteed by REA for facilities owned by the borrower generally must be repaid with interest within a period, up to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The expected useful life shall be based on the weighted average of the useful lives that the borrower proposes for the facilities financed by the loan, provided that the proposed useful lives are deemed appropriate by REA. The proposed useful lives proposed by the borrower for the facilities financed must be consistent with the borrower's proposed depreciation rates for these facilities. In states where the borrower must obtain state regulatory authority approval of depreciation rates for rate making purposes, the depreciation rates used for the purposes of this paragraph shall be the rates currently approved by the state authority or rates for which the borrower plans to seek state authority approval, provided that these rates are deemed appropriate by REA. In other states, if the rates proposed by the borrower are not deemed appropriate by REA, REA will base expected useful life on the depreciation rates listed in Bulletin 183&hyph;1, or its successor, revising such rates as necessary to reflect current industry practice. Final maturities for loans for the implementation of programs for demand side management and energy resource conservation and on and off grid renewable energy sources not owned by the borrower will be determined by REA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.116 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  [Removed and Reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

Any REA financing provided for the facilities will be limited to a 4-year loan period.

The construction period covered by a CWP in support of a loan application shall not be shorter than the loan period requested for financing of the facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

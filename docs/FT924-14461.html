			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rise in Nikkei ahead of October options close INDEX-LINKED buying related to the options market lifted share prices in the late afternoon, and the Nikkei index closed higher in an otherwise uneventful trading session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed up 223.77 at the day's high of 17,335.51, following arbitrage unwinding which depressed prices in the morning and pushed it down to a low of 17,049.75. Volume fell to 200m shares from 253m. Trading remained thin, yesterday because market participants were reluctant to trade ahead of Friday's settlement for October stock index option contracts. Advances led declines by 471 to 444 with 168 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.60 to 1,304.69 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.02 to 1042.94. Share prices moved in a tight range before their sharp rise at the end of the session. Activity centred around short-term trading of speculative stocks by dealers and individual investors. The fall in the yen against the dollar also helped some export oriented issues. Shinagawa Fuel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y966. The fuel dealer gained popularity as an environmental theme stock due to reports on its research to change plastics into petroleum. Hitachi Zosen, the shipping company, rose Y17 to Y547 on speculation of increased orders of its garbage incinerators. Kubota, the farm equipment maker, which was previously higher on the environmental theme, lost Y6 to Y591 on profit-taking. The yen weakened to the Y120 level against the dollar, helping electronics and car companies. Sony gained Y40 to Y3,930 and Toyota Motor advanced Y20 to Y1,420. NEC, however, fell Y10 to Y681 on continuing concern over its earnings. Investors are also currently discouraged by the planned sales of low-cost personal computers by Compaq, the US computer maker. Chiyoda, the plant engineering company, rose Y70 to Y1,930 on a report of its involvement in a major natural gas pipeline project in the Middle East. Lion, the toiletries maker, rose Y39 to Y611. Investors have started to target companies which have started to restructure their operations, including cost-cutting measures in the process. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 40.61 to 18,908.36 in volume of 12.2m shares. The lack of fresh news prompted small-lot selling. Roundup THE region's markets put in mixed performances yesterday. HONG KONG recovered after falling sharply at the opening, following negative Chinese reaction to Governor Chris Patten's speech on Wednesday. The Hang Seng index closed down 33.50 at 5,555.53, after an intraday low of 5,526.37. Turnover was HKDollars 1.63bn after Wednesday's HKDollars 1.48bn. HSBC Holdings lost HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 54.50 and Cheung Kong was 20 cents lower at HKDollars 20.30. TAIWAN ended 2.7 per cent higher following the resignation of the finance minister over a property tax proposal. The weighted index, which advanced more than 100 points in early trading, closed 96.09 higher at 3,688.21. Turnover rose to TDollars 21.2bn from TDollars 13.1bn. BANGKOK advanced on bank, finance and securities issues and the SET index gained 11.36 or 1.3 per cent to 883.36 in turnover of Bt16.6bn. SEOUL fell on profit-taking with investors remaining nervous about the political situation. The composite index lost 5.95 to 518.43 as turnover rose to Won239bn from Won173bn. MANILA was lower with activity concentrated on secondary commercial stocks and some profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index shed 3.98 to 1,403.82 in combined turnover of 299m pesos. AUSTRALIA rose on bargain-hunting, with BHP one of the day's biggest gainers, up 14 cents to ADollars 11.64. The All Ordinaries Index closed 10.2 higher at 1,465.6 in turnover of ADollars 293m. NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by an 8 cent fall in Telecom to NZDollars 2.23 on rumours that a competitor, Clear Communications, had increased its market share .

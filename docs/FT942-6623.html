			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: A theatrical windfall - A look at the drama of a legacy Peggy Ramsay was the leading theatrical agent of her generation. Most major playwrights of the past 30 years - Ayckbourn, Hare, Willie Russell, Brenton, Orton - were her clients. Like many people who pretend to despise money she left a fortune, well over Pounds 1m, when she died in 1991. And since the theatre was her life, she has ensured that her legacy is being poured back posthumously into drama. 'Celestial re-distribution' was how David Hare described it. He is one of the trustees of the Peggy Ramsay Foundation and on Monday will announce the winner of the biggest annual prize in British theatre, Pounds 50,000, to help give a decent production to a promising new play. Thanks to a deal with Ramsay's successor company, Cassarotto-Ramsay, the foundation will also receive half the royalties from the plays that Ramsay helped to create, which will be available as hand outs to indigent writers, but the bulk of her money will go towards the Peggy Ramsay Play Award. Six theatres, from London fringe to the National Theatre, from provincial studio to the Royal Exchange, Manchester, will be asked to apply each year for the money by submitting the script of a new play they are planning to produce. The most exciting project will get the Pounds 50,000. It could be written by Ayckbourn or Hare, though that is unlikely. The aim is to encourage playwrights where it matters: in the quality of the production. The following year six different theatres will be asked to tender and so it goes on. Introducing the prize, David Hare was droll about Ramsay; about the chaos of her office, about her even handed toughness towards her writers. The reputation of the playwright did not weigh with her at all; the play was everything. Hare said that finishing a play had a special excitement then that can never be recaptured: the knowledge that Peggy would now see it. Her impartial judgment was unquestionable. Hare told of Peggy Ramsay's reaction when, for the first time, one of his plays was to be presented in New York. She reckoned this to be the highlight of any writer's career and insisted that he should go over to see it, and enjoy the experience. She hunted around her desk for some money, and came up with a wallet which, on later examination, contained Dollars 2,000, enough, she said, to buy a girl as partner for the first night party. 'If I'd taken her advice I might have written Pretty Woman', said Hare, ruefully. The unusual thing about this new prize is that the trustees seem anxious that the winners should have some fun. If a fringe theatre (where new productions rarely cost more than Pounds 20,000) wins, then it can spend the rest of the money on other ventures. There are few restraints; few provisos. This is spare cash, a windfall from the dead, that will help to fructify the theatre of the future.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Troops move into Natal: Fear of more violence overshadows fragile truce South African troop reinforcements moved into Natal province yesterday to enforce a state of emergency, while rival parties in the province seemed to have declared an informal Good Friday truce. Troop numbers were small, with only 150 soldiers arriving by yesterday and about 300 more due by tomorrow. But security force chiefs made clear that the South African Defence Force would take charge in the province, under the emergency declared on Thursday, and that the KwaZulu police, headed by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi as police minister, would take orders from the SADF. This effectively deprives the chief of the police ministry and could be a first step towards deposing him as chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland. So far, he has reacted with restraint, indicating he is prepared to co-operate with the military, no doubt calculating he cannot gain by outright defiance. Chief Buthelezi yesterday signalled his willingness to go ahead with a peace summit despite the Natal clampdown. He said he expected the summit would be held next week. It is due to bring together for the first time Chief Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and South African President F W de Klerk. Much will depend on the outcome of a meeting last night of the heads of the SADF, the South African Police and the KwaZulu police in Natal. The future role of the KwaZulu force was to be decided at the meeting. Mr Mandela said on Thursday the force would be confined to barracks, but there was no provision for this in the emergency regulations published yesterday. These gave security forces powers to detain people without charge for up to 30 days, to use 'necessary force' to keep order and to search people and premises without a warrant. The rules bar unauthorised military training, prohibit display of weapons or potentially dangerous objects (including traditional Zulu spears and fighting sticks) and set strict conditions for rallies. On the first day of the emergency, police said only five people were killed. This is not an unusual number in a province where at least 300 were killed last month. This Easter, South Africa's roads are more dangerous than its townships; nearly 50 people have already died in traffic accidents. In Durban yesterday, however, few people seemed to believe the truce would last, or that the emergency would bring peace. Many fear instead a rise in violence.

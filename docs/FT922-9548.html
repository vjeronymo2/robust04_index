			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Erisa might be a welcome transatlantic hurricane - Was Maxwell uniquely crooked, or are all funds vulnerable to criminal damage?  The possible legislation WHEN THE scale of Mr Robert Maxwell's plundering of his companies' pension funds became clear, the entire UK pensions industry caught its breath. Not unnaturally, thousands of individual pension scheme members began asking whether their own investments were safe from a similar theft. A previously quiet backwater of pensions management was swamped by a wave of interest. Suddenly, a parliamentary committee was probing the arcane world of pension fund security and asset administration. It produced a report which highlighted the gaps in pension fund security. Pensioners and scheme members alike began to question the ultimate ownership of pension fund assets. Who controls funds, and what limits are there on the investment and transfer of assets? It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that pension funds are at the centre of a passionate debate among rival groups of financial intermediaries. The question is whether Maxwell was uniquely crooked, or whether all funds are vulnerable to criminal damage. One school of thought believes that a few simple changes in rules governing fund trustees should suffice to make the Maxwell affair unrepeatable. Another school thinks changes need to be widespread. In particular, the aftermath of the Maxwell affair has been a tense time for fund trustees and fund managers. It is too early to predict whether legislation will follow the rush of interest, but it seems likely the pressure for reform will not disappear. Legislation could be modelled on US laws passed in 1974. The Employee Retirement Investment Security Act (Erisa) demanded the separation of fund management from the custody of the assets, and completely redrafted US pension fund law. If anything like it were adopted in the UK, it would overturn decades of self-administration and regulation by London's fund management community. It would also blow like a hurricane through the arcane world of the fund trustee. Erisa made it compulsory for fund trustees (known in the US as plan sponsors) to demonstrate in an annual report that they had managed their fund prudently. In addition, it meant that funds would have to appoint a so-called master custodian or trustee, to oversee the fulfilment of its requirements, by providing appropriate records and adequate security against prohibited transactions. Indirectly, the prudent investment principle enshrined in Erisa led to diversification outside the US by its massive pension plans. And the plan sponsors' need for better information led to huge investment by their banks in the administrative and reporting systems which became the core of the global custody product. Although UK fund managers are often at one remove from administration of the assets they invest, some of the UK's largest houses do their own safe custody and are substantial players in the custody business in their own right. Erisa-style legislation would require them to pass that function to external specialists. That might sound undramatic, but it would have far-reaching implications, not least for costs. The fund managers might not have the option of setting up their own subsidiaries to take over the custodial function - Erisa specifies that the custodian must be an entirely independent entity. Thus, the recent creation by SG Warburg, for example, of a custody division separated from its Mercury Asset Management subsidiary, would be made redundant - it would still have to be sold or closed. Fees would inevitably rise. Small wonder that the commercial banks, particularly the large US banks which specialise in custody and trustee services, have been aggressively marketing their products to nervous trustee boards of UK pension funds. For the custodians at least, Maxwell has provided a welcome marketing opportunity. A notable example was a seminar on pension fund security held by Chase Manhattan in February, at which Mr Colin Grimsey, managing director, said: 'I have no doubt that changes in legislation will present significant challenges and opportunities for custodian banks.' Mr Grimsey, one of the pioneers of global custody, also made a prediction: 'Whatever the outcome of anticipated legislative changes, there is little doubt that the role of the independent professional trustee will be expanded.' The fund management community is not so sure. It has produced a series of defensive measures, notably a letter published in the Financial Times from the chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association. He argued that the IFMA would broadly welcome any strengthening of restrictions on self-investment, as well greater powers for trustees. But the letter went on to point out that wholesale changes along the lines described above would be expensively aimed at the wrong target. The UK pension industry as a whole has functioned safely for decades without over-elaborate restrictions. That is a view shared by Michael Robarts, a director of Robert Fleming Investment Management. He points out to the example of local authority pension funds. Only when the notorious Hammersmith &amp; Fulham swaps case focused attention on local authority funds did it emerge that the rules governing them were so narrowly written as to make questionable even the appointment of external fund managers. Local authorities have largely withdrawn from stock-lending markets, because some legal opinion suggests such transactions are disallowed.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> APPIER'S FIRST VICTORY LEADS KANSAS CITY, 5-3  </P> <P> Kevin Appier could not wait to call home after winning his first major league  game, as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5-3, Tuesday  night at Kansas City.  </P> <P> A first-round draft pick in 1987, Appier (1-1) went five innings and gave up  two runs on seven hits.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to call my family in Lancaster," Appier said. "They'll all be  there waiting to hear all about it. My mom, my wife, everybody.  </P> <P> "It feels great. I wasn't really too nervous. I was just trying to concentrate  on making the right pitches."  </P> <P> The Royals' sixth consecutive victory moved Kansas City to within 1 1/2 games  of the first-place Athletics in the West.  </P> <P> "Appier threw a great game," Kansas City Manager John Wathan said. "Especially  considering it was such a big game. To come out and throw the way he did  against the top team in the league was impressive."  </P> <P> Bob Boone's three-run double in the second inning gave Appier a lead. The  Royals were aided by Oakland's two errors.  </P> <P> Steve Farr, the fourth Kansas City pitcher, pitched the ninth for his 14th  save. Curt Young dropped to 2-6 with the loss.  </P> <P> Boston 8, Detroit 7 -- Danny Heep had three singles and drove in three runs as  the Red Sox used 16 hits and two Tiger errors to win at Boston.  </P> <P> The Red Sox overcame a dismal pitching performance by starter John Dopson, who  tied a league record by committing four balks. Dopson, whose 11 balks lead the  majors, gave up five runs on six hits and five walks in 3 2/3 innings. One run  scored on a balk and another on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Heep, who had only 11 RBIs in 95 games with the Dodgers last year, drove in a  run in the first and two more in the second. His third single in the fourth set  up a run that scored on third baseman Rick Schu's fielding error, putting  Boston ahead to stay, 6-5.  </P> <P> Minnesota 4, Seattle 3 -- Al Newman singled home the winning run with one out  in the 11th inning to lead the Twins at Minnesota.  </P> <P> The Twins, who tied the score with a run in the ninth, won it against Jerry  Reed (3-4). Gary Gaetti led off the 11th with a single and took third on a  single by Randy Bush.  </P> <P> One out later, Reed intentionally walked Gene Larkin to load the bases. Newman  followed with a single over right fielder Jay Buhner.  </P> <P> Gary Wayne won his first career decision. Wayne pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings  and struck out three.  </P> <P> Baltimore 5, New York 2 -- Joe Orsulak singled home the go-ahead run in the  sixth inning to lead the East-leading Orioles at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Randy Milligan and Bob Melvin singled with one out and Orsulak followed with a  hit-and-run single that gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead in the sixth.  </P> <P> Dave Schmidt (6-5), gave up one run on five hits in six innings. Mark  Williamson relieved in the seventh and the Yankees scored on singles by Ken  Phelps, Mike Pagliarulo and Don Slaught. Gregg Olson pitched the final inning  for his seventh save.  </P> <P> Orsulak hit an RBI double in the eighth that finished Dave LaPoint (6-5) and  scored on a groundout by Worthington. LaPoint gave up 13 hits in 7 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Cleveland 9, Chicago 6 -- Dave Clark ended a 2-for-30 slump with four hits,  including a two-run single during a five-run third inning, leading Greg  Swindell and the Indians at Chicago.  </P> <P> Swindell (8-1), had a five-hit shutout until Carlton Fisk hit his third home  run of the season in the seventh. Swindell was chased during a five-run eighth  and Doug Jones worked the ninth for his 14th save.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Pinch-hitter Kelly Gruber's solo home run in the  ninth inning lifted the Blue Jays at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Ernie Whitt singled with one out in the ninth, but pinch-runner Kevin Batiste  was picked off. Gruber, scratched from the starting lineup because of a sore  throat, hit Dan Plesac's next pitch for his sixth home run.  </P></p>

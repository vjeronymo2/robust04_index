			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 May -- The level of cooperation in  Russian- British relations is now higher than in Russia's  relations with many other countries. "The sides not only do not  have any differences on any serious issues, there are not even  any significant divergences of positions," this was the  evaluation of the present state of relations between Russia and  the United Kingdom by a close advisor to the Russian foreign  minister on the results of talks between Andrey Kozyrev and  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The visit of the head  of British diplomacy, which began in Murmansk on 22 May, was  noted for a symbolic event today. D. Hurd became the first  foreign minister of a western country to visit the strategic  base of the Russian fleet at Severomorsk.    "This is our latest true gesture of partnership with NATO,"  the Russian diplomat said, commenting on the British minister's  visit to the Admiral Nakhimov, a Northern Fleet heavy cruiser.  Although we still await the signing of agreements--a framework  document and a special protocol on mutual relations between  Russia and the North Atlantic alliance, reflecting its special  nature as a nuclear power --partnership between the Russian  Federation and NATO is already in fact being implemented. The  same day, the diplomat reported, the high-ranking representative  of NATO's military command is awaited in Severomorsk.    According to the Russian diplomat, among western partners  "the British probably understand us most of all," and here the  personal position of the Foreign Office head plays a part. For  example, on the question of Russia's participation from the  outset in a political conference between G-7 countries with  equal rights, Great Britain "was one of the first to stretch out  its hand to us," and the summit in Naples this summer will be  the premiere of the political "eight."    In relation to an agreement between the Russian Federation  and the European Union, London is in favor of this accord being  reached as soon as possible. Until recently, the Foreign Office  representative explained, two unsolved questions had largely  remained in the way to a triumphant ceremony. The first, where  the "ball was in the Russian court," concerned the lifting of  restrictions on the activities of foreign banks in Russia. A  solution was found--for some banks conditions will be improved  as of now, and for others--in the foreseeable future. The  second matter is linked with the position of the partners, first  and foremost the French, and their commercial interests. Russia  was offered lower quotas than at present in trade in materials  of the nuclear fuel cycle, to which Moscow could not agree.  Experts from the two sides are working on the problem, and  according to information just received, they are close to a  compromise. As far as London is concerned, it favors an  agreement being signed in June.    Close interaction is also to be seen in efforts to settle  the  situation in Bosnia. It is being implemented by the sides in  the spirit of the communique of the ministerial meeting between  Russia, the United States, and the five countries of the  European Union on Bosnia, held in Geneva on 13 May.    As far as the Russian Federation's relations with the Baltic  countries are concerned, in the opinion of the British partners,  the package of agreements with Latvia on the withdrawal of  Russian troops, which also contains guarantees of the rights of  military pensioners, could also extend to the Estonian side.  According to the Russian diplomat, London will try to convince  Tallinn of this.    Speaking about Douglas Hurd's trip to the Ukraine next  Tuesday, the Russian diplomat said that the British side strives  to prevent any worsening of relations between Moscow and Kiev,  and therefore follows the principle of "no harm." In fact other  Western countries have also adopted a similar position. As for  the declarations by Ukrainian representatives about their  intention to appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the  situation in Crimea, Moscow has told the British side it favored  this major international body taking an interest in this  problem, calling for a settlement through peaceful, political  means. This would cool down some hotheads on various sides.    It is not a coincidence that the meeting between the Russian  and British foreign ministers took place in Murmansk. This  region has a vast potential, where bilateral cooperation has  great prospects, and generates serious interest in Great  Britain. Douglas Hurd expressed hope that plans will go ahead  to twin Murmansk and Aberdeen, a large British port and center  of oil and gas industry.    The head of the British diplomacy remembered the war time  camaraderie and expressed his conviction that in peaceful times  the cooperation between the two countries must be equally close.  The United Kingdom, he said, is planning to send official  representatives to Murmansk to mark Victory Day, which had been  achieved with some help from the marines of the military and  merchant fleet of Great Britain, who had taken part of Arctic  convoys delivering aid from the allies to the town during the  war.</p>

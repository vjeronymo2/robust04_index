			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Cambridge votes for status quo Cambridgeshire residents prefer the existing two-tier system of districts and counties, according to the results of a referendum announced yesterday. Keeping the status quo was the most popular option in the 'advisory referendum' carried out by the Local Government Commission - even though this was not among the structures proposed by the commission. It was favoured by 38 per cent of those who responded. The commission's own preference for abolishing the two-tier structure and replacing it with three all-purpose unitary councils was favoured by 23 per cent, while alternative proposals for two and four unitary authorities were both favoured by only 14 per cent of respondents. Almost 10 per cent of the county's 293,816 households responded to the questionnaire from the commission - a much higher turn-out than in Leicestershire, where only 2.3 per cent of residents partici-pated. However in Huntingdonshire, which stands to regain administrative independence lost in the reorganisation of 1974, 47 per cent favoured the commission's proposal. This repeats the pattern for Leicestershire, where residents of Rutland, another county which ceased to exist in 1974, strongly supported a return to the old boundaries. There were overall majorities in favour of the two-tier system in both East Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire districts, while a majority in the Fenland district favoured creating four unitaries.</p>

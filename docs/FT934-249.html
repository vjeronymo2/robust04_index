			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Colony to ease rules on TV ownership Hong Kong plans to turn the colony into a regional broadcasting hub by scrapping some restrictions on foreign ownership of television stations, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. But the government will press ahead with controversial legislation limiting cross-media ownership, Mr James So, secretary for recreation and culture, said yesterday. 'What we will do basically is to encourage more people to come to Hong Kong to set up television, either through cable or satellite or other forms, through the relaxation of the rule,' Mr So said. Foreign ownership is currently restricted to 49 per cent of non-franchised television stations. The proposed relaxation, to be included in a media law now being drafted, would not cover Hong Kong's two conventional television stations, Television Broadcasts (TVB) and Asia Television (ATV), where tighter rules apply. Apart from the two franchise broadcasters, pan-Asian satellite station Star TV and cable station Wharf Cable, are based in Hong Kong. Mr Rupert Murdoch, who controls Star TV through his News Corp, skirted the foreign ownership rule last July by buying 63.6 per cent of HutchVision, which in turn owns less than half of the licensee, HutchVision Hong Kong. Mr Murdoch fell foul of the rules earlier in the year and was forced to withdraw a bid for a stake in TVB.</p>

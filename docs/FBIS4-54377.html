			<p>BFN     [Text] The government's Tax Commission (an advisory panel  to the prime minister) has decided to make an emergency proposal  for five-point administrative reform on the assumption that  drastic tax reform will be implemented. The proposal points out  the need to work out "a five-year administrative reform plan,"  among other things calling for integration or abolition of  special status corporations; to set goals for correcting the  price gap between domestic and foreign products; and to revise  the current system of setting public service charges.    Commission Chairman Kan Kato will submit a report to Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata in early June. The commission thinks that  as it will have to come up with a recommendation on drastic tax  reform by the end of June, the government must present to the  public its stand on administrative and financial reform to  obtain public understanding on tax system reform, which will  include a consumption tax hike. The commission is also expected  to refer to specific ways of achieving administrative reform led  by politicians and free of meddling by bureaucrats; it is  extremely rare for the commission to make such a recommendation.    The five points in the proposal comprise: 1) Formulation of  the "five-year administrative reform plan"; 2) formulation of  the "five- year local administrative reform plan"; 3) revision  of the current system on setting public service charges; 4)  setting of goals for narrowing the price gap between domestic  and foreign products; and 5) making public how spending in  welfare programs is calculated.    The commission has held informal consultations on the matter  with the Economic Council (an advisory panel to the prime  minister; chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa) and the Fiscal System  Council (an advisory panel to the finance minister; chaired by  Eiji Suzuji) to take concerted action on tax reform. If the  three parties reach agreement, the report is expected to be  submitted in their joint names. Then, how Prime Minister Hata  uses his political leadership will become a new focal point of  issue in the goal for achieving tax reform.    The commission intends to ask the government to indicate  specific areas of and plans for reform in formulating "the  five-year administrative reform plan" including integration  and/or abolition of government projects and government-invested  special corporations.    The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform (the third  administrative reform council chaired by Eiji Suzuki) once tried  to promote the plan to integrate and/or abolish special  corporations. But, since the council tried to apply the reform  to all special corporations, it incited opposition from the  entire bureaucracy. As a result, the council could not  incorporate the plan into its final report. Taking this failure  into consideration, the Tax Commission has reached a decision to  promote this plan by taking a different approach.    As far as the "five-year local administrative reform" is  concerned, since the role of local governments in promoting the  welfare vision programs is expected to grow, the commission will  call for tough administrative reform in local governments, for  instance, by proposing to set up a system to restrict the number  of local public service personnel.    Regarding the issue of public service charge hikes which  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has decided to freeze, the  commission intends to ask the government to revise the current  system of setting charges as a way of promoting industrial  rationalization. It is thinking about asking the government to  replace the current system with the "price cap system" [as  published] which sets ceiling and allows decisions on charges  more flexibility.    As for the welfare vision programs, the commission will ask  the Finance Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry to make  public how they came up with estimates on future welfare  spending.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Stockbroker dismantled by Banque Indosuez BANQUE Indosuez yesterday confirmed changes that will dismantle Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, a firm bearing some of the oldest names in British stockbroking, writes Peter John. The firm, part of the French bank's WI Carr Group, will be renamed Indosuez Capital Securities with most of the broker's UK institutional client operations being abandoned, along with all of its research operation. As a result of the changes 40 staff, mainly UK institutional sales people and analysts, will lose their jobs. The new organisation will carry out its institutional business in five broad areas - Europe, natural resources and South Africa, the Far East, Latin America and gilts. It will also offer a 'limited service' in UK equities to institutions. Meanwhile, Banque Indosuez will concentrate its private client business through Carr Sheppards in London and Le Masurier James and Chinn in Jersey. Yesterday's changes were announced to coincide with Banque Indosuez's half-year results statement. However, rumours of the change had circulated among London marketmakers for the past fortnight.

This is a man who came to the position of deputy  prime minister from the post of special advisor to Slobodan  Milosevic. According to Belgrade assessments, Simic was one of  the main strategists for all of Milosevic's moves; he is a man  who Milosevic trusts very much, and who is expected to soon  become chief of Yugoslav diplomacy. He is a sociologist,  educated in England and France.    [Nedeljkov] What are your expectations of the trip to  Zagreb?    [Simic] I believe in tolerant talks and equal negotiations,  and I believe that it is possible to resolve many disputed and  difficult political issues through talks, so I see no good  reason for the Croat-Serb issues not to be resolved on these  methodological principles! I am going to Zagreb with a certain  amount of realist optimism, because I think that we and the  highest Croatian officials have found a good political method  for resolving all the disputed issues.    The mere fact that I will come to Zagreb on 12 February, and  that I am coming without any prejudices, shows that tolerance is  a dominant trait of Yugoslav politics.    [Nedeljkov] You therefore believe in the normalization of  relations?    [Simic] I have no illusions about one trip to Zagreb, or one  declaration, being able to solve all the issues that are now a  stumbling block in relations between Zagreb and Belgrade. My  wish is to show by this visit, which I hope will not only be  governed by protocol, that there is a willingness in my country  to normalize relations, that a realistic and rational politics  is being conducted in the FRY, and that its aim is to solve all  the problems in a primarily peaceful way and on equal bases. I  believe that both we in Belgrade and the most prominent  political figures in Zagreb are aware of the existence of great  problems, and of the fact that they cannot be solved during one  visit, but this visit, as well as all the visits that will  follow, can mark the start of solving the problems that are at  present in the way of a general normalization of relations  between Croatia and the FRY.    [Nedeljkov] What precisely do you expect will happen in  Zagreb?    [Simic] I hope that there is good will on both sides, and  during the talks that I have had with the Croatian officials so  far I received the impression that there is. Moreover, although  this may sound immodest, all the participants in the recent  efforts to establish more stable relations between Zagreb and  Belgrade were given a kind of international acknowledgment,  primarily that of the International Red Cross, and Mr. K.  Somaruga saw in our agreement a symbolic, but also pragmatic act  that, in the foreseeable future, could yield mutually beneficial  political results.    We have simply turned to the specific, existential issues.  It is more than evident that solving these vital problems can  have a favorable effect on solving those that are eminently in  the political sphere. Solving extremely ambitious political  issues can sometimes slow down the normalization of total  relations, although I do not deny the possibility of achieving  such a situation in the near future. To summarize, I would say  that this "political inversion," so to speak, could be extremely  fruitful for both sides and for improvedr future relations.    [Nedeljkov] Could you be more specific about those "vital  issues" from which the start would be made?    [Simic] For instance, it would include the resolving of the  issue of missing persons, and all issues regarding the area of  human rights. Once these issues are resolved, then favorable  preconditions will be created for resolving the bigger political  issues, which everyone is familiar with.    [Nedeljkov] Does the deputy prime minister of the Federal  Government know if there are Croatian prisoners in the FRY?    [Simic] I can claim that, to my knowledge, and according to  the knowledge of all the members of the Federal Government,  there is not a single Croatian citizen in any of the prisons on  the territory of Yugoslavia. However, I allow that some people  may be imprisoned on some other basis, perhaps, and if there are  such cases, we will investigate them and give the Croatian  authorities the real information. All our prisons are open to  international institutions, and if there are any indications,  anyone from Croatia can also visit those prisons, because there  are no camps or anything of the kind in Yugoslavia. Therefore,  anyone can come and see for themselves that what I have said is  true.    [Nedeljkov] What follows after solving these cases?    [Simic] All the efforts in the normalization of relations  between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY are aimed at  avoiding any possibilities and thoughts, let alone a specific  act, that would lead to war. I believe that the aim is mutual:  establishing permanent peace on the entire territory of the  former Yugoslavia, while any other solution would be  unacceptable both for Croatia and Yugoslavia.    [Nedeljkov] The opposition in Croatia and that in Serbia do  not accept the present agreements on the normalization of  relations.    [Simic] I believe that this criticism is exclusively  connected to internal political effects, and this is how it  should be viewed, because the arguments used to dispute our  efforts make no political sense. If what we are doing and what  we are resorting to is so fiercely criticized, the alternative  is aggravating relations and departing from peace. What could  be the alternative to peace if not war?!    [Nedeljkov] How do you see Knin in this context?    [Simic] There is a corps of issues, of vital as well as  political importance, that can be solved directly between Zagreb  and Belgrade. In my opinion, we can thus pave the way for a  further normalization of relations, and then, naturally, toward  the resolving of the most difficult political and other issues.  However, it is certainly not possible to solve the most vital  problems without considering all the disputable issues between  the Serb Krajina and Croatia. The political reality is that  these disputable issues can only be resolved by the legitimate  representatives of the Serb people in the Krajina and the  legitimate Croatian representatives.    [Nedeljkov] Is this possible if Milan Martic [president of  the republic of Serb Krajina] states in VECERNJE NOVOSTI that,  in the course of this year, all the Serb lands will unite  (including the Knin Krajina), and that he will then immediately  hand over his "presidential staff" to Milosevic, who will be the  president of all Serbs, and the capital will be Belgrade?    [Simic] There are many individual statements that, taken out  of the context, can serve as an alibi for giving up the peace  efforts. For instance, we could view, rather suspiciously, the  statement of Mr. G. Susak, the defense minister of Croatia, who  recently spoke about the relations between Zagreb and Belgrade  in a rather militant tone. He was speaking an intolerant  language that anticipated war rather than peace.    [Nedeljkov] Let us go back to Mr. Martic's statement.    [Simic] I can not speak on behalf of the legitimate  representatives of the Serb Krajina, nor do I wish to interpret  their statements, because it is quite natural to ask them about  something like this. I think that the task of all the prudent  political forces that bear a certain political weight both in  the FRY and in Croatia is to find the solution for the  establishment of democratic forms of political communication,  and not for the encouragement of the forms that will make the  relations between the Serb and Croat peoples, which are strained  as it is, even more difficult. In short, no general conclusions  should be made on the basis of the statements of any individual  political figure, but the problems should instead be viewed as a  whole. Fear and mistrust should be thrown out of these strained  Croat-Serb relations, which were, until recently, dominated by  intolerance, and it should be displayed, through specific acts,  that it is possible to have no conflicts in the relations  between the two peoples and that such relations are both  possible and desirable.    [Nedeljkov] What is happening with the opening of the  Croatian Office in Belgrade?    [Simic] We have completed all the details, the location has  been determined, there are no technical obstacles, and I think  that 15 February is a realistic date for the beginning of the  activities of the offices both in Belgrade and in Zagreb.  Naturally, if it is postponed for a day or two it will mean  nothing significant in the political sense.    [Nedeljkov] There is much talk about the Serbs, but almost  no one mentions the Serbs in Zagreb, Rijeka, Split, Pula....    [Simic] We did not talk about that specifically. However,  if I go to Zagreb, and I see no reason not to go, I will try to  get the answer to that question too. However, all this must be  done in a tolerant tone, and the political forces that support a  peaceful solution to the Serb-Croat problems should be  encouraged, both here and there. There are such forces here,  and I believe they also exist in Croatia.    [Nedeljkov] Do the "AVNOJ" [Anti-Fascist Council of National  Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders stand any chance?    [Simic] In my opinion, these borders need not be a stumbling  block, but a subject of negotiations instead. They are  extremely ambivalent when it comes to reality. We have come to  realize that if we talk about the right to self-determination,  it is the people who create these borders by their own will, and  not some political power-wielders. However, I believe that this  issue is so delicate that it should be left for later  negotiations and talks, and now everything should be done to  establish relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia on the basis  of mutual trust, and to mark them with maximum tolerance on both  sides. It would perhaps be fatal if we were to raise these  issues, which are the most delicate, first. However, if we start  from smaller, but vital ones, and if both sides realize that  there is mutual good will, these most delicate issues could soon  be on the agenda too.    [Nedeljkov] Will this year be the crucial one in Croat-Serb  relations?    [Simic] Yes, though it could perhaps sooner be said to be a  turning point, but only in the sense that real negotiations and  agreements should start. It would be illusory to expect the  issues that partly concern the past to be solved overnight. The  most important thing is that the opinions and forces see a way  to solve relations between the two countries only through  negotiations prevail on both sides.    [Nedeljkov] Are you saying that you are going to Zagreb with  a peace offer?    [Simic] Yes, that is the way to say it. We are prepared for  dialogue, and we see tolerant communication as the only possible  way to resolve the problem. I speak on behalf of those  political forces in Serbia and the FRY that are dominant. The  wounds are heavy on both sides, and I am not saying it is easy  to forget everything, but we have to start going the peaceful  way.    [Nedeljkov] Were the problems of the Croats in Vojvodina  mentioned in the talks with the Croatian delegation?    [Simic] Not at all, but that does not mean there will be no  discussion of that.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / City cleans up after IRA bomb THE IRA claimed responsibility yesterday for the latest bomb attack in London's financial centre, Bethan Hutton writes. The bomb - left under a car in Coleman Street, near the Guildhall, on Thursday evening - caused minimal disruption to businesses in the City yesterday. No one was injured in the blast, but the bomb left a crater in the street, and glass was shattered in surrounding buildings. At Slaughter and May, the solicitors whose offices were worst hit, work was continuing as usual. The company - which had already taken precautions against terrorist attack - said damage was restricted to glass in two meeting rooms and five offices, and a clean-up would make them usable by Monday.</p>

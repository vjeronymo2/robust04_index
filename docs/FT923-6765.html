			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: G30 names head of study group THE Group of Thirty has appointed Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, to head its new study group on the risks associated with derivative financial products. Mr Weatherstone is a founding member of the group, a Washington-based think-tank chaired by Mr Paul Volcker. 'The economic benefits of cost reduction and risk transfer that derivatives generate need to be weighed against their actual and potential costs,' according to the Group of Thirty. The study group has three aims: to contribute to a broader understanding of the nature of derivatives; to develop a guide to principles of management practice for market participants; and to provide input to discussions among supervisors and regulators. A number of regulatory and supervisory authorities, including the Basle Committee, are currently reviewing the level of risk created by derivatives business. Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve, and Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, are among senior figures to have expressed concern over the issue.</p>

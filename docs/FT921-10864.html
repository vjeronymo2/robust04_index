			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Freer car market in Peru backfires for Nissan, Toyota TRADE liberalisation measures have done what Maoist terrorists, sabotage, hyper-inflation and death threats failed to do: forced Nissan to close its 21-year-old Peruvian assembly operation. Nissan Motors, Japan's second largest car maker, indefinitely suspended work at its Lima plant on November 4. 'The government clearly considers Peruvian industry is in no position to produce cars,' Mr Carlos Chiappori, president of Peru's Nissan works, said. Vehicle assembly in Peru has fallen since the early 1980s when Nissan's output reached 9,500 units a year, mainly cars and pick-up trucks. Then, as successive governments opened the country to imports, cutting protective tariffs, the slide began. In its last full year of operation, Nissan assembled a mere 560 vehicles. Toyota started assembling locally in 1967. Peak Peruvian output came in the late 1970s when Toyota produced 7,000 cars a year. In 1985, in a shrinking local market, it diversified into assembling the Hi Lux minibus, popular as cheap transport in Lima. 'From 1985 we were neck-and-neck with Nissan here in a dying market,' a Toyota representative in Lima said. 'But after a brief upswing in 1986-87, it's been downhill ever since.' The last Peruvian-assembled Toyotas rolled off the production lines last July. The motor manufacturers blame labour costs and an obligation to buy certain local components for their inability to produce locally-assembled cars at a reasonable price. Security, too, is an expensive extra in Peru: 10 per cent of costs, Toyota estimates. A 1987 attack by Sendero Luminoso guerrillas damaged Nissan's plant. It has been made 'terrorist-proof', but Sendero slogans threaten 'Japanese imperialists'. The coup de grace for the Peruvian assembly industry came when economy minister Carlos Bolona slashed import tariffs last March. Overnight, effective protection for Peru's car-assembly industry fell from 65 per cent to 15. With finished vehicles and parts coming in at the same tariff, the assembly business was doomed. 'Government policy may be correct, strictly speaking,' says Mr Chiappori, 'but Peru needs one thing above all: work'. He limped on until November while parts in stock lasted, then cut his workforce of 660 to 100. Installation maintenance continues, but Nissan sees little prospect of re-opening. Toyota has reduced its 320 Peruvian employees to 146, most working in spares and service. But a tenth of the company's installed capacity has been turned over to making truck superstructures and high-tech 'jigs'. These test initial chassis assembly. Peruvian technicians have been trained in Japan, and finished jigs are exported to Toyota assembly plants in Colombia and Venezuela. 'It's company policy to maintain a minimum activity here,' a Toyota spokesman in Lima said. 'While external conditions can still change, especially with regard to import tariffs, there's always a chance of re-opening.' That chance hinges mainly on the Andean Pact. Negotiations over a common external tariff bogged down late last year, with Colombia and Venezuela pushing for a protectionist 40 per cent tariff on finished vehicle imports and 5 per cent for CKD (complete knocked down). Peru, now the pact's main devotee of economic liberalism, is certain to refuse to apply such a high tariff, although a 25 per cent differential rate is an outside possibility, Toyota says. Talks should be complete by late February and the fate of Nissan and Toyota local production sealed. Beneficiaries of Peru's liberalisation are Mexico and Japan. Toyota expects to import 5,000-6,000 light vehicles this year, all from Toyota Motors Japan (which together with Mitsui owns 98 per cent of the Peru operation). Nissan will import a similar quantity, mostly from Mexico. Mr Chiappori says: 'We started assembling here about the same time as Nissan Mexico. Now they have capacity to make 300,000 units a year, and we're closed.' Nissan closes Australian plant, Page 23</p>

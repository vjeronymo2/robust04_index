			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / BR deal settles slander action THE former chairman of Permaquip, the railway track maintenance equipment maker, has accepted Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 171,550 in legal costs from the British Railways Board in settlement of a slander action over statements by transport police that he had been arrested for corruption. The High Court heard yesterday that in September 1988 British Transport Police, investigating allegations that corrupt payments had been made to BR personnel by contractors, raided Permaquip's offices and Mr Peter Martyn's home in Nottinghamshire. Personal and business documents were removed. Mr Martyn, who was at his Ravenshead home during the raid, later learnt that one of the officers involved in the office raid had stated that he had been arrested and was to be charged with corruption. No accusation had been put to him by the police who raided his home and he had no inkling that he was under suspicion. It was later reported to Mr Martyn that on three subsequent occasions BTP officers had made similar allegations to different people. His slander action would have come for trial long ago but for BRB applying repeatedly for the case to be stayed because it said police investigations were continuing and it was likely that he would be prosecuted. BRB finally served its defence a year ago, denying any slander had been published and pleading qualified privilege and justification. Last month it paid a very substantial sum of money into court to settle the case. Mr Martyn accepted that the payment did not amount to an admission of liability and that the officers concerned still maintained their words were not accurately reported to him.</p>

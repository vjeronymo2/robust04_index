			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> The Times reported on Jan. 19 that the City Council passed a new law which will  violate every citizen's right to recall an elected official.  </P> <P> The new "ethics reform measure," introduced by Councilman Hal Bernson, requires  all five sponsors of recall petitions to individually submit full financial  disclosure statements before they are allowed to begin a recall movement.  </P> <P> The same disclosure rules will apply to all sponsors of city initiative drives,  such as the two-term limit initiative now being circulated.  </P> <P> This outrageous new law will force anyone wishing to file for a recall to  disclose all of his assets and income, which is a deliberate intimidation of  voters and a blatant invasion of privacy. It is designed to eliminate citizen  participation in city initiative drives and recalls against elected officials.  </P> <P> WALTER N. PRINCE  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

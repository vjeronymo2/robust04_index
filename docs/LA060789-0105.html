			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR NOW, CHANG BECOMES INTERNATIONAL HEADLINER  </P> <P> The morning after, Michael Chang slept late, got a massage, hit tennis balls  for about 20 minutes at a private club, then watched it rain.  </P> <P> While a dejected Ivan Lendl left for London on a rainy Tuesday morning, Chang  awoke as the toast of Paris.  </P> <P> A color photo of him falling to the ground on match point filled the front page  of the newspaper L'Equipe. At the top of the page, this headline greeted him:  Chang l'incroyable!  </P> <P>  Chang the incredible, all right. His five-set upset victory over Ivan Lendl in  the French Open Monday was reported worldwide by the hundreds of journalists  who are covering the tournament.  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of what was written.  </P> <P> Klaus-Peter Witt, Bild, Munich -- "His legs were cramping. He had tears in his  eyes. And he prayed. The kid, Michael Chang, 17, looked like he would rather  die than lose."  </P> <P> Malcolm Folley, Daily Express, London -- "Ivan Lendl fled from center court in  tears here last night, humiliated by a cramp-crippled teen-ager serving  under-arm."  </P> <P> E. Trier Hansen, Politiken, Copenhagen -- "The youngest one ate bananas and  poured water into himself while he crushed the biggest one. Afterward, Paris  went totally bananas."  </P> <P> Murray Hedgcock, the Australian, Melbourne -- "No matter whatever else Michael  Chang achieves in his career, he shall forever have this brilliant moment that  will go down in tennis history."  </P> <P> Perhaps no newspaper was more impressed by Chang's victory over Lendl and  painful leg cramps than L'Equipe, the French daily newspaper covering sports:  </P> <P> "The small mosquito Chang stung the man who frightens children, Lendl. . . .  Chang was near death, but then he took his heart in both hands, said a prayer  and his prayer was answered."  </P> <P> Chang played the entire fifth set with muscle cramps in both thighs. That he  not only continued to play, but also went on to beat Lendl, the No. 1 player in  the world, seems to have struck an emotional chord in France and other  countries.  </P> <P> Jeff Austin, Chang's agent at Advantage International, decided that his client  needed rest rather than more exposure. Austin turned down requests from "Good  Morning America" and "CBS Morning News" for live interviews with Chang.  </P> <P> Austin had all the calls to Chang's room switched to his own. "The phone  stopped ringing about 1 a.m. and began again about 6," Austin said. "I'm just  going to sit back and enjoy this tournament. I think Michael's got a real good  chance at getting to the finals.  </P> <P> "In fact, I think he's going to win it."  </P> <P> That would really be incroyable. THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Management: Old-timers who slow the pace of corporate change Managing change is rightly identified as one of the key competitive issues for manufacturing industry in the 1990s, but are UK companies getting it right? A survey by Ingersoll Engineers, the UK consultancy, suggests that manufacturers understand the importance of the issue, and know the key ingredients for success - but are not yet using all of them as effectively as they might. Ingersoll's fourth annual survey, Commitment: Implementing the Vision*, comes a year after it accused operating managers of approaching change too timidly, perhaps for external reasons such as uncertainty over company ownership. This year, Ingersoll looks at the internal workings of manufacturing industry and its approach to change, with the help of 200 managing directors or chief executives, operating directors, manufacturing directors or general managers. The survey found broad agreement on the five success factors for managing change: vision, strategy, implementation, communications and behavioural issues. But it discovered that managers do not give the five factors equal importance. While vision and strategy were seen as 'very important' by managing directors, their commitment wanes as the process moves towards planning, measurement and implementation. This lack of commitment has two important effects. First, responsibility for implementing change is delegated to people 'learning on the job' - skilled line managers rather than 'change managers'. Only 55 per cent of change programmes use task forces or specialist resources, and then only in part, the survey finds. Second, and worse still, implementing the programme is delegated typically to those groups perceived as most resistant to change - among middle managers, administrators and supervisors in particular. Among these groups, says Brian Small, Ingersoll's managing director, will be found people who see themselves as 'guardians' of the company, employees of long standing, who know the importance of the company to their family and their town, and do not want to see a new MD ruining everything - and then being promoted after three years. But the 'guardians' are not negative, says Small. They are simply cautious. The trouble is, they are not informed early enough about the change programme - in some 40 per cent of cases supervisors are not told until the start of implementation. Winning the commitment seen as key to the five success factors, therefore, depends on better organisation to manage change. 'Detailed planning and implementation is not yet a high enough priority nor a sufficiently developed skill while communication still leaves much to be desired,' says Ingersoll. And the evidence for that comes from the MDs themselves. The four most difficult problems in change programmes are seen as changing people's behaviour, keeping to schedule, dedicating adequate resources and motivating people. So Ingersoll has 'six pointers' for MDs facing a change programme. Your help will be needed by the team throughout, not just with vision and strategy. Recognise that you will need to build sophisticated new project management skills. Communicate as a priority - as early as you can. Everybody will absorb the changes at their own rate. Everybody must 'buy in' and become involved; encourage the dialogue that makes this happen. Before starting, be sure your implementers are fully committed. To win commitment, ensure you have a meticulous plan. *Ingersoll Engineers, Bourton Hall, Rugby, Warwickshire, CV23 9SD.</p>

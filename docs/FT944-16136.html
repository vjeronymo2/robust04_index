			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw writes down stake in Attwoods Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services and transportation operator, has taken a USDollars 27.5m write-down on its 35 per cent stake in Attwoods, the UK-based group which is fighting a hostile takeover bid. The write-down comes on the heels of Laidlaw's recent commitment to sell its interest to Attwoods' predator, Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston. A Laidlaw official said the write-down was based on BFI's offer price of Pounds 1.09 a share. Laidlaw has been seeking a buyer for its Attwoods stake for more than a year, but BFI has been the only taker to date. The Attwoods charge, which follows a Dollars 102m write-down last year, dented what the company otherwise described as a 'particularly strong' fourth quarter. Operating income more than doubled to Dollars 40.3m in the three months to August 31 from Dollars 17.5m a year earlier. But a net loss was posted of Dollars 3.1m, or one cent per share, including one-time charges, compared with a Dollars 334.9m loss, or Dollars 1.21 a share. Excluding special charges, earnings rose to 5 cents a share from one cent a year ago. Laidlaw no longer includes equity contributions from its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the international security services and vehicle auction group, since issuing a series of convertible debentures last December which can be repaid in ADT shares. Revenues rose to Dollars 482.6m from Dollars 467.5m. Laidlaw's recent move into the US ambulance market contributed to a recovery in income from passenger services to Dollars 3.8m, from a Dollars 3.6m loss. Income from Solid-waste operations climbed to Dollars 23.7m from Dollars 12.7m. Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, forecast a further improvement in the coming year, based on an increasing pace of acquisitions and rising earnings from existing businesses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said today that China and Russia should consider and  handle their relations from the commanding strategic height of  eyeing the 21st century.    Jiang made the statement at a meeting with visiting Russian  Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin.    The bilateral relations between China and Russia had entered  a new phase since President Yeltsin's China visit in late 1992,  featured by the "healthy and stable" development of the  mutually-beneficial cooperation in various fields, the Chinese  president noted.    Jiang described the current visit of the prime minister as  another important event in Sino-Russian relations. The visit,  he said, would help push the development of relations between  the two countries.    Jiang stressed that in Yeltsin's letter to him at the  beginning of the year, Yeltsin suggested that the bilateral ties  should be improved to the level of a "constructive partnership"  looking towards the 21st century.    This idea, Jiang noted, was identical with China's view of  establishing long-term cooperative ties which should be  mutually-beneficial, and enjoy stable development, he said.    "I also hold that Sino-Russian ties should be considered and  handled strategically with an eye on the 21st century," Jiang  said.    The postwar history had fully proved that the development of  the bilateral relations between China and Russia always produced  great impact on the international situation, he said, adding  that living in harmony and conducting mutually-beneficial  cooperation between the two countries was itself a great  contribution to the peace and development of mankind.    China attached great importance to the long-term,  good-neighborly and mutually-beneficial ties with Russia, and  would like to further bilateral relations on the basis of the  principles set out in the Sino-Russian communique, Jiang said.    Chernomyrdin said that he had held good talks with Chinese  Premier Li Peng, and his current visit would be of great  significance to the Russian economy.    The agreements reached during the visit would improve the  economic and trade links between the two countries, he said.    The two countries should also reinforce their cooperation on  international issues, since the good-neighborly friendship  between the two sides would not only serve the interests of the  two peoples, but also benefit peace and stability in the world,  he said.    The two leaders also briefed each other on their domestic  situations.    Chernomyrdin brought Yeltsin's regards to Jiang, saying that  the Russian president was looking forward to the official  Russian visit by Jiang this September.    Jiang, expressing thanks, said that he also looked forward  to  the visit and the meeting with Yeltsin.    Among those at the meeting were Qian Qichen , Chinese  vice-premier and foreign minister, and Russian ministers  accompanying Chernomyrdin.</p>

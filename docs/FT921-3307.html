			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Switch from poodles to politicians FOR ROSETTE makers Tony and Jenny Curgenven the Tory choice of an April general election could not be better - timed as it is before the start of the dog show season, Chris Tighe writes. Turning their attentions from chihuahuas and Great Danes to politicians, the couple and their six staff will produce tens of thousands of rosettes over the next few weeks, to be worn from Wales to Durham. Dalsetter Designs, based in a former school in East Ardsley, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, is one of more than a dozen rosette makers likely to be burning the midnight oil to fulfil election orders. 'It will help us out tremendously, it'll pay off a few bills,' said Mr Curgenven yesterday. He has already had a taste of election fever. His company's decision earlier this year not to quote for a Conservative party order of 1m rosettes has been wrongly interpreted by the media, says Mr Curgenven, as an indication of his political affiliations. Such an order was just too big for a small business like his to handle. No way was Mr Curgenven, who prefers to keep his political views private, going to risk letting down his pigeon-fancying, dog-owning regulars. The company is producing rosettes for both Labour and the Tories. After April 9 Mr Curgenven will be back to rosettes for dog shows and gymkhanas. But he would not object to a hung parliament.</p>

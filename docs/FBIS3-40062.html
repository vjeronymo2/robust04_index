The Chinese Government's conception of Hong Kong's political  system after 1997 was to maintain the British Hong Kong  Administration's status quo essentially unchanged, being  depicted in Liao Chengzhi's [1675 2110 1807] terms as "a change  of national flag," with "the Hong Kong governor becoming a  Hongkonger appointed by China."    But the Sino-British Joint Declaration's Appendix 1 on the  SAR's political-system clause differed substantively from the  Chinese Government's original conception.    In the drafting of the Basic Law, the sharpest controversies  were mainly in two areas: 1) On "the Hong Kong SAR's enjoyment  of executive, legislative, independent judicial, and final  judgment authority." 2) On "the Hong Kong SAR's legislature  being elected, with the executive having to observe the laws  and being responsible to the legislature." The crux of the  controversy was: Would the SAR's political system be one of a  tripartite balance of powers, with mutual checks and balances?  Would the "executive" or "legislature" dominate?    As I did not take part in the Sino-British talks (as Li  Jusheng [2621 5468 3932] had blocked me from the early-stage  talks), the only records that I could see were mostly  "verdicts," making it very hard for me to see the crux of the  controversy. But by the time of the drafting of the Basic Law,  the controversy came to light. I guessed at the time that the  Chinese consideration for after 1997 was that: As the former  colonial government was not democratic, it would need to be  changed somewhat; and these Chinese democratic plans had induced  the British to promote a representative system. Or possibly it  was the British who had proposed the representative-system idea  in the talks. But regardless of which side was responsible for  it, it was certain that the Chinese had never reckoned during  the negotiations with Britain's "surreptiousness" before the two  sides had even reached agreement, in that it would "rush" to  promote the representative system during the last 12 years of  its jurisdiction, to change its promise in the Sino-British  Joint Declaration to "return administration to China" into  "returning administration to the people." (While the  Sino-British Joint Declaration had stated that "the two kingdoms  jointly declare that the governments of the two kingdoms will  return Hong Kong to the PRC on 1 July 1997," the British had  still set forth in a "white paper" the "need to gradually  establish at the Administration's central level a representative  system that is more directly responsible to the people and  firmly rooted in Hong Kong.")    Li Hou [2621 0683] [deputy director of the State Council's  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO)] did not at first  seem to understand Britain's plot. At a meeting in Macao of the  Basic Law Political System Group that he chaired, he had  proposed that the future SAR Administration would practice a  "separation of powers" program, with executive, legislative, and  judicial authority being separate and having mutual checks and  balances. This not only was out of line with the understanding  of the Central Government's views by the Hong Kong and Macao  Working Committee of the time, but also before long was  disagreed with by Deng Xiaoping as expected.    As to the executive being "responsible" to the legislature,  Lu Ping [7627 1627] [deputy secretary general of the Basic Law  Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong SAR and deputy director of  the HKMAO] explained this to Hong Kong reporters as being  legislative consultation, just as the then relationship between  the British Hong Kong Administration and the Legislative Council  (LEGCO). And the response to public calls for the British  Government to explain this was also very vague. I doubted at  the time whether the "senior advisor" of the Chinese Planning  Committee would clarify the issue in the Sino-British talks.  This was because in a discussion of the "decade of great  changes remaining in effect for 50 years" by the Hong Kong and  Macao Working Committee, its "chairman," Ji Pengfei [1213 7720  7378] [chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong  Kong SAR and director of the HKMAO] had sighed to me about the  provision on "the legislature being elected," that "he had not  added consultation' at the time, as he had not fully reckoned  with Britain's (intentions)." (The Sino-British Joint  Declaration provided that the SAR Chief Executive would be  produced through either election or consultation.)    The British Hong Kong Administration's "surreptitous rush"  to  promote a representative system touched off a wave of democracy  unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. This was the British  Hong Kong Administration's brilliant "public opinion card"  stroke, which intensified Hong Kong's social division and  unrest. Outstanding mid-level and grassroots figures, who had  no confidence in China and were dissatisfied with the public  status quo and their own plight, came out with calls for rushing  to democracy, some of whom were dependent on British Hong Kong  largesse while considering it inadequate. Of course, many were  also trying to exploit the struggle between China and Britain to  win democracy from both sides. While this led to a surge toward  democracy by various types, the "silent types" were probably  still in the majority.    It should be pointed out that while Hong Kong had never  questioned the social climate of its politics, this [wave of  democracy] began a fundamental change that has gradually evolved  to turn Hong Kong into one of the world's regions with a rare  and maximum political sensitivity.    As to this wave of democracy, most of the upper levels of  society were laden with anxiety. Most Hong Kong Chinese big  bourgeoisie had been economically dependent on the British at  first. And while some later had vanquished British capital in  market competition, even supplanting it in some areas, they had  not yet completely overcome this dependence, at least not  financially. As they lacked political independence, their  major aspiration was to maintain the status quo. Confronted  with the ever-surging wave of democracy, they started out with  no ideological preparation, and with even less preparation for  playing the democracy game, which turned into concern that  middle and lower class participation in and control over  political affairs would change the status quo, bringing great  calls for a "free lunch" and sharply higher taxes that would  lose them their advantage in Hong Kong's moneymaking paradise.  But while democracy was a wave that could not be opposed  "rationally" or stopped with "force," leaving them for some time  in a state of depression and vacillation, the process of  drafting the Basic Law made some of them dependent on China, in  order to cope with the Hong Kong democracy wave's ideas and  actions.    The big capitalists had the same position among both the  British financial groups and the Chinese. Chia Tao-li [0857  6670 3810] endorsed and supported my "statement-storm" speech,  as well as telling me directly after the 4 June incident that he  supported the middle-of-the-road plan proposed by business world  figures, such as Luo K'ang-jui [5012 1660 3843]. And Simon  Kaise told me twice that he was dissatisfied with the position  of Hong Kong's democratic radicals.    They held that as Hong Kong was founded on stability,  instituting democracy too quickly might cause unrest that would  produce an investor-confidence problem.</p>

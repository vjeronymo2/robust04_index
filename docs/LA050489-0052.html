			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT DECLINES TO CLARIFY STAND ON PLO CHARTER  </P> <P> In the face of sharp criticism from rival Palestinian leaders, Palestine  Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat refused Wednesday to clarify his  use of an ambiguous French word that has stirred hopes of progress toward peace  in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "I did not come here to give a course on language and law," Arafat snapped at  reporters at a press conference at the Institute of the Arab World. "You can  find the translation in the dictionary.  </P> <P> "It is enough that some people, including President Mitterrand, understand the  word."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, after meetings with French President Francois Mitterrand and  Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, Arafat employed the French word caduc, which is  variously defined by dictionaries as "outdated," "lapsed," "decrepit,"  "old-fashioned" or "null and void" -- to describe the status of the  controversial 1964 PLO charter calling for the elimination of the Israeli  state.  </P> <P> Later he said he intended the word in a "specific, legal, technical" sense. The  French radio network, RF1, reported that Arafat has translated the word into  English as "superseded."  </P> <P> In the extremely delicate peace process the PLO hopes will lead to an  independent Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territory on the West Bank,  shades of meaning are important and ambiguities are sometimes preferred.  </P> <P> The PLO charter, which speaks of the "liberation of Palestine" as a national  duty and calls for the elimination "of the Zionist presence from Palestine,"  has been cited by Israelis as one proof that Arafat's acknowledgment of  Israel's right to exist and his renunciation of terrorism last year did not  represent a true policy change.  </P> <P> The use of the French term by Arafat, who does not speak French, has put the  word caduc at the center of speculation about the achievements of the  unprecedented "official" visit to France, a step many feel will eventually lead  Arafat to the United States.  </P> <P> The daily tabloid Liberation published an enlarged dictionary definition of the  word on its front page Wednesday. That august protector of the French language,  the Academie Francaise, jumped into the fray, pointing out that the word dates  to the 14th Century in France but has been used for legal matters since the  16th Century.  </P> <P> By the end of the day, politicians and journalists had created an apparently  new noun -- caducite or "the state of being caduc" to describe the affair. An  anchor on the evening broadcast said: "It all revolves around one word -- a  word that shocks, a word that grates, a word that surprises. . . . "  </P> <P> In short, for the verbal French, it could not have been a more satisfying  official visit, despite -- or possibly because of -- the uncertainty of what  was actually said.  </P> <P> For his part, Mitterrand -- who has received serious criticism from France's  large Jewish population for inviting Arafat -- was pleased. According to aides,  Mitterrand had hoped to win some concessions from the PLO before visiting  President Bush later this month.  </P> <P> In an effort to push the slow-moving peace process along, he had pressed Arafat  on Tuesday to clarify the status of the charter. "This was the first sign of  clarification," Mitterrand said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the State Department in Washington said: "We see this as a  reinforcement of his prior statement acknowledging Israel's right to exist." A  decision by the Palestine National Council, the organization's legislative  body, "formally amending or abrogating the charter would be the kind of action  we would certainly applaud," spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler added.  </P> <P> Both Israeli leaders and Arafat's political rivals in the PLO reacted  negatively to his statement.  </P> <P> George Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a  Marxist hard-line faction, said he was "horrified."  </P> <P> "We shall show Arafat and the world that the PLO charter remains very well  alive," Habash told the Associated Press. "Arafat has no right to take such  decisions."  </P> <P> An Israeli spokesman, meanwhile, dismissed Arafat's statement as "rhetorical  juggling."  </P> <P> Reacting to Habash's strong criticism, Arafat said: "That's an expression of  the Palestine democracy. Everyone has the right to state his point of view."  </P></p>

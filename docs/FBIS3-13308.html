			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H3>  Opinions of Supporting and Opposing Deputies Concerning the  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill </H3>   Economic Division. The discussions and examination of  the first round of discussions on the 79,686-billion-rial[R]  budget bill began this morning in the Majles.    According to a report by the economic correspondent of  RESALAT, based on the ratification of the Majles, the  examination of the 1973 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  bill will go through two rounds of discussion. In the first  round of discussions, which began today, after the discussion on  the general points of the budget and their ratification, a  decision will be made concerning oil revenues, taxes, and  special and other revenues.    According to this report, 10 hours, including three and a  half hours for opponents, three and a half hours for supporters,  one hour for the spokesman of the committee, and two hours for  the government representative, have been set aside for  discussions about the general points of the budget, and every  speaker can speak for 15 minutes and make use of all or part of  another person's time.    The national budget, according to the government proposal  for  next year, has been projected at R79,686 billion, of which  R36,011 billion is comprised of general revenues, including oil,  taxes, and special and other revenues.    Oil revenues in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] were  R5,133 billion in actuality. According to the law, the budget in  1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] was set at R15,597 billion.  This figure has increased to R23,096 billion in 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995]. In the proposed bill, the government had  set the share of the oil revenues in the total revenues at 65.8  percent. After examinations in the related committees of the  Majles, this figure was reduced to 58.4 percent.    In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], R3,773 billion were  collected in taxes. This amount this year was projected at  R5,409 billion, which did not materialize. In 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995], about R6,400 billion in taxes have been  projected by the government.    The special Majles committee, after several hours of  discussion, increased the tax revenues to R7,880.    In the open session of the Majles this morning, Hojjat  ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the Majles, offered his  congratulations on the blessed birthday of the Guardian of the  Age and said: It is hoped that God will grant us all the  privilege of awaiting his holiness and obeying his true deputy,  the grand leader, so that under the wise leadership of Ayatollah  Khamene'i, we will prepare the grounds for the coming of the  Imam of the Age.    Then Mr. Mirvalad, the spokesman of the Joint Planning and  Budget and Economic Affairs and Finance Committee, continued a  report on the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill.    He said: The annual budget in fact is a representation of  the  revenues and expenditures of the country and regulation of the  expenditures on the basis of revenues. It is not proper to  expect the annual budget to anticipate and solve all the  problems of the country. Another issue regarding the budget is  attention to our maneuverability in the budget offered by the  government, in other words, to what extent we can create  changes. In regards to the revenue subheadings of the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, Mr. Mirvalad said: In next  year's budget, we set up three revenue headings, that is, oil,  taxes, and miscellaneous revenues, and as the honorable  president said in his Friday prayer sermons, we cannot survive  dependence on oil. We took into consideration this important  point in the budget and tried to reduce the dependence of the  budget on oil revenues and move towards nonoil revenues.    He added: More than 65 percent of the budget presented by  the  government to the Majles was dependent on oil, which we reduced  to 58.4 percent, taking into consideration that we must act  within the OPEC ceiling. For next year, we anticipated the  likelihood of Iraq's entry into the world market.    The spokesman of the Joint Planning and Budget and Economic  Affairs and Finance Committee of the Majles emphasized  preventing the decrease in the price of oil and said: In an  effort to reduce the decrease in the price of oil, we reduced a  percentage of our exports and projected $10.5 billion in oil  revenues for next year.    He said: Last year, we were allowed to export 190,000  barrels  of oil per day to import oil products. In the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] bill, the government set it at about 340,000  barrels, which was not accepted by the Joint Committee.    He pointed out: Countries that do not have oil revenues  essentially gain their revenues through taxes. But in recent  years, due to the lack of strong and coherent tax systems, we  have been unable to collect taxes fully. Hence, in the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, we increased the tax revenues.    He said: The government had set the share of taxes in the  total national budget at 19.6 percent, which we increased to  26.1 percent. We also increased the other revenues from 15.1  percent to 15.5 percent.    Mirvalad pointed out: In Note 25, the government discusses  three issues. The first one is the increase in the price of  energy, including kerosene, gasoline, electricity, and diesel  fuel, so that from the funds gained by this increase, it can  implement some of the projects.    He said: Of the total national revenues, which were set at  R79,700 billion, R3,317 thousand billion [as published] were  general revenues, which the committee reduced to R30,000 billion.    The spokesman of the Planning and Budget Committee referred  to the economic effects of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] budget on the society as reducing economic pressures  through controlling the volume of cash flow and controlling the  loans granted by banks. For next year, we approved about a  15-percent cash flow growth, of which the inflationary effects  will naturally be about the same.    He pointed out: For the first time, we limited the ceiling  of  the funds that the private and government sectors are to receive.    He added: In Note 25, in regards to electricity, we set  taxes  on use in excess of 500 kwhr [kilowatt-hour]. Mirvalad pointed  out: The issue of the price of energy was one of our most heated  discussions in the budget. The cost to the government for  gasoline or kerosene is about 27 tomans per liter and reaches  the people nearly free of charge. Mirvalad pointed out: One of  our efforts in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  will be to increase subsidies for essential goods, which the  government had projected at $690 billion and the committee  increased to $800 million. [sentence as published] Also, the  government had set $300 million in subsidies for drugs, which we  increased to $400 million.    He said: With consideration for the statements of the grand  leader concerning decreasing foreign obligations, we projected  that next year our debts would be reduced to $1.6 billion.    He also cited the increase in commercial taxes on imports to  support domestic producers and making revenues realistic among  the other characteristics of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] budget.    This report indicates that Mr. Astaneh was the first  opponent  of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, who declared  the "planning and budget writing problems" and the "growth of  cash flow" as the most important reasons for his opposition.    He termed the 15-month delay of the government in presenting  the Second Plan bill a violation of Note 36 of the First Plan  law and said: The decision to postpone the implementation of the  Second Plan requires a law.    Concerning the problem of planning, he said: This problem  concerns lack of change in the traditional planning and budget  writing method and failure to look into the future by the Plan  and Budget Organization. It is not clear what picture the Plan  and Budget Organization has of the next three decades, despite  all its organization and experts. What will the situation of the  country be if the oil is finished and is exports cannot be  justified? What amount of the $100 billion foreign currency  revenues of the plan has been spent on fundamental investments?  Can the sale of oil and factories (national capital) be  considered revenue? I am interested in the director of the Plan  and Budget Organization offering a picture of Iran without oil.    In regards to foreign currency obligations, Astaneh said:  According to Part 6 of Paragraph A of Note 29, the level of  foreign currency obligations at the end of 1372 [20 March 1994]  should be 15 percent less than at the beginning of this year,  whereas in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], $10 billion in  late debts were created in the worst form (that is, several  thousand items of minor debts to several countries, which  indicates failure to think on the part of the economic experts  of the country), and in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] we  will have another $6 billion in debt. According to Note 29, any  violation of the decrease of 15 percent of the obligations is  regarded as use of government property. My colleagues have noted  how the Central Bank has acted.    He emphasized: Repayment of the foreign debts as soon as  possible, no matter how little, must be given priority. I thank  the Joint Committee for reducing the $4.5 billion in new  government obligations in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995].    Concerning the growth of cash flow, Astaneh said: While next  year the price of oil exports will decrease, the government has  increased the total national budget to R79,686 billion and the  Joint Committee to R71,240 billion. In the First Plan, it was  determined that the cash flow should increase to R22,000 billion  by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], whereas by the end of this  year the growth of cash flow will be increased up to R45,000  billion.    He did not consider the change in the banking funds at the  level of R5,547 billion in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] in  the interests of the country and pointed out: This issue will  cause the cash flow and inflation to grow by 30 percent.    In regards to Note 25, he emphasized: Until a mechanism is  devised for the increase in the income of the salary earners and  those with fixed incomes, the pressure of Note 25 will weigh  heavily on the shoulders of the people, and the poor will become  poorer and the capitalists will gain more capital.    Mr. Zadsar, the deputy from Jiroft, spoke as the first  supporter and said: One of the best corrections of the honorable  committee in the budget bill is the control of the growth of  cash flow, to which attention has been paid for the first time  in the budget bill, because the above-mentioned committee has  specified the growth of the cash flow in Note 2 and allowed it  at a maximum of 15 percent, whereas the government has projected  it up to 23 percent. It has allocated nearly 55 percent of the  growth of the cash flow to the private sector to enable banks  and banking funds to take effective steps in starting domestic  production.    In regards to the control of subsidies, and in some cases  their elimination, he said: In Note 25, the government has  projected about R2,970 billion in revenues secured by raising  the price of various fuels and obliged itself to spend it on  starting important, vital, and fundamental projects. The Joint  Committee has looked at this realistically and reduced it to  R1,900 billion.    He then continued: Upon the suggestion of the government,  gasoline was R120; diesel fuel, R20; heating oil, R10; kerosene,  R20; and natural gas, R12.4 per cubic meter. With the agreement  of the committee, gasoline was R80; diesel fuel, R15; kerosene,  R20; heating oil, R10; and natural gas, R12.4 per cubic meter.    Then, stating that we know that the actual price of the  above-mentioned items is several times the sale price, he said:  We know that every liter of gasoline costs about R270 for the  government. Indeed, do the R220 in subsidies paid from the  Treasury of the country on every liter of gasoline go to the  poor or the rich?    He said: I believe that the well-to-do [people] use cheap  electricity, and this is not just.    He then said: It is noteworthy that electricity for  agricultural use has not become more expensive at all, and the  cost of electricity used by the people has only increased when  it is in excess of 500 kwhr, which in fact has not changed.    Mohammad Baqer Bahrami, the deputy of Asadabad, spoke in  opposition to the budget bill and said: In my opinion, and  according to the studies that have been carried out, the  projections must be logical and more realistic. My question to  the Joint Committee and the honorable government is, on the  basis of what formula have they projected the price of oil to be  closer to reality? In our opinion, the projections of the  government and the committee are not based on logic.    He then said: There is a great deal of waste in government  companies. We receive many reports and much criticism. There is  a vast difference between the salaries paid in the companies and  government organizations. Why has the Joint Committee not  stopped this waste in the budget bill? Is it not true that when  they are exempt from taxes, they must make investments? Has this  been done? Have we controlled foreign purchases?    He added: In connection with Note 25, there is no one in the  country and the Majles who opposes prices becoming more  realistic. But at what price? The share of energy per family in  our country is 10,070 tomans in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March  1994]. The indirect effect of this is 16,000 tomans.    If we want to collect the actual prices from the consumer,  do  we have a mechanism in place to receive more money from those  people who use more energy, services, and government goods and  to separate them from the vulnerable strata of the society? I  believe this mechanism does not exist. We only have a special  mechanism for collecting taxes from employees, which is deducted  from salaries, whether they want it or not. But we do not have a  special method for collecting taxes from strata with large  incomes.    The next supporter was Mr. Nowbakht, who described the  special climate governing the budget as follows: 1) Inclusion of  the policies of the Second Plan in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] budget; 2) the budget inherits the policies and  economic development planning of the First Plan; 3) the speed of  economic reconstruction in the First Plan; and 4) the decrease  in the price of oil.    He said: It is impossible to turn away from the economic  modification policies.    He said: Considering that the Joint Committee decreased the  ceiling of exports and the price per barrel of oil, the level of  revenues was set at 4,000 billion, or less than what the  government proposed, which seems more realistic.    The details of the opinions of supporters and opponents will  be published in tomorrow's issue.</p>

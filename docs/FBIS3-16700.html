Our  correspondent reports from the congress.    [Correspondent] The representatives of the various youth  organizations, in particular, the organizations of the higher  schools, plants, enterprises, oblast youth amalgamations, and  representatives of all the regions of the republic are taking  part in the congress. [passage omitted]    Emomali Rakhmonov, the head of state and chairman of the  Supreme Council of the Republic of Tajikistan spoke at the  congress. In particular, he said the following:    [Begin Rakhmonov recording] Dear brothers and sisters, it is  pleasant that this meeting and the youth congress are taking  place on the eve of Navruz [Tajik New Year Day, 21 March]. I  can see the representatives of the youth of all parts of our  Republic in this hall and I am encouraged by the fact that the  unity and integrity of the independent Republic of Tajikistan is  being further strengthened. I am happy that the representatives  of all nationalities living in our beloved country who are  working for the prosperity and development of our country are  sitting in this hall.    It is a pleasant thing that the youths have gathered here  after the completion of the severe examinations of life with the  hope of planning for a good future. Life itself is a real  master [words indistinct] and opens the real image of the  politicians and those people who are fighting for positions.  Those people who argued about democracy until recently [words  indistinct] and considered themselves as patriots and leaders of  the nation have exerted pressure on the legitimate government  and committed murder, robbery, and persecution of the  representatives of certain rayons and regions of Tajikistan.  Instead of honest labor during the sowing season they  [politicians] involved the people in long-term rallies, they did  not spare the lives of youths who were deluded, they began the  distribution of positions and properties, and violated the law  and political behavior. They insulted, murdered, and robbed  representatives of other nationalities who had worked and lived  with us Tajiks for a long time. Reminding you of this, I want  to warn the youths. Youth has to learn from past mistakes.    They have to be united in the future and should follow the  [way of] unity and solidarity because the youths are the future  political figures, leaders of parties and movements, ministries  and departments, and so on. Now that we are pursuing the road  to a democratic society, we have to get used to tolerating  multiparty and political pluralism and recognize it. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] Following the afternoon break, the congress  continued its work and its participants discussed a number of  issues that are included on the congress agenda. The first  congress of the Union of Youths of Tajikistan will continue its  work tomorrow.</p>

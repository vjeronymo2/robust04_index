			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "REPUBLIKA on the Carpet; Deputy Prime </F> Minister Roman Kovac's Meeting With TA SR Director General"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac  met with TA SR Director General Dusan Kleiman in Bratislava  yesterday. The meeting took place on the basis of a decision of  the Coalition Council, which asked that certain facts be  clarified regarding property matters of the daily REPUBLIKA and  the transfer of its registration to a different entity. Dusan  Kleiman stated that the TA SR did not violate any legal norms  and did not use any funds from the state budget to publish the  daily. He considers it intolerable for a news agency to publish  an opinion-forming [mienkotvorny] daily, but the entire process  of the daily REPUBLIKA's becoming independent has been slowed  down by the fact that Republika Ltd., which is ready to assume  all liabilities of the daily and to take the burden off the TA  SR, has not yet been registered.    "It is an absurd situation when a state agency publishes a  daily that is full of invectives against the crucial state  bodies -- the National Council, the president, and the  government," Roman Kovac told reporters after his meeting with  Dusan Kleiman. According to his words, the TA SR operates with  a deficit, caused by the daily REPUBLIKA. Last year, the loss  amounted to more than 18 million Slovak korunas [Sk]. He said  that Sk30-35 million had been appropriated from the 1993 state  budget for the TA SR and this year the subsidy even went up to  Sk42 million. Apart from this, the news agency has some income  from its entrepreneurial activity (last year it supposedly  amounted to Sk95 million). Roman Kovac noted that the TA SR  operates with a single fund, into which all its financial  resources flow. It is therefore difficult to say whether the  loss caused by REPUBLIKA has been offset by korunas from the  state budget or by profit from the agency's commercial  activities.    The argument that the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA  should be the TA SR's commercial venture does not hold water,  according to Roman Kovac, because, under a Slovak Ministry of  Finance decree, organizations of this type can only engage in  commercial activities that do not cause losses. This provision  has not been observed, "which amounts to a violation of a  legislative norm," Roman Kovac stressed.    Asked by reporters whether a change in the post of TA SR  director general was to be expected, Roman Kovac replied that  this matter will still have to be considered. He noted that,  probably today, Dusan Kleiman would submit to him proposals on  how to deal with the situation that has arisen. According to  Roman Kovac, the TA SR director general realizes his share of  responsibility, be it responsibility of economic nature or  responsibility for the violation of legal regulations.  "Although it is true that he did not violate them himself, the  head of an organization must bear the consequences for his deeds  and is also accountable for his subordinates," Roman Kovac said.    Roman Kovac is convinced that the TA SR should operate as an  independent agency and said that it was unthinkable for it to  publish an opposition daily. He considers the privatization of  the daily REPUBLIKA to the full extent, that is, including the  debts it has run up, to be the most suitable solution to the  problems surrounding the newspaper.    As he went on to say, the orders placed by the government  with the daily REPUBLIKA in the form of various supplements,  which needlessly siphoned off resources from the budgets of  individual ministries, are being abolished and the ministry will  have to find a new form of maintaining contact with the public,  for example by means of bulletins and the like.</p>

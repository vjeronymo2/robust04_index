			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz held a meeting  with Ibrahim Gambari, the Security Council's president and  Nigeria's UN representative, at the United Nations headquarters  today, Thursday, morning.    Following the 40-minute meeting, 'Aziz told reporters that  he  discussed with the Security Council's president issues related  to the council's resolutions in light of Iraq's fulfillment of  its commitments stipulated in these resolutions.    'Aziz added: The meeting was fruitful. I explained to the  council's president Iraq's position, which strongly demands that  the council acknowledge the facts showing that Iraq has  implemented a great deal of the council's resolutions, and that  concerned UN circles have confirmed these facts in their reports.    The deputy prime minister said the tendency of some Security  Council members to fail to acknowledge this reality is the wrong  approach and that the council should rectify this matter. 'Aziz  said the refusal by one member to acknowledge this reality will  harm the Security Council's credibility and the legitimacy of  its resolutions.    Asked about the U.S. and British positions on Iraq, 'Aziz  said: When the dispute began, they told the council and the  whole world that they did not have bilateral differences with  Iraq, that they behaved according to the bases of international  law, and that they prepared Security Council resolutions to  address the issue on this basis. However, if they change their  position four years later and say that the issue is not within  the United Nations' terms of reference, and that it only has to  do with their policy, then this is something different, which  means the entire issue has changed. They should determine  whether they are abiding by the resolutions, which they wrote  themselves, or whether they used these resolutions to achieve a  political purpose of their own.</p>

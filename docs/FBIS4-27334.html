			<p>BFN     [Text] Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], gave a speech in Niigata City on 29 May, in which  he said, "What can (Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's) minority  government promise when it goes to the meeting of leaders of the  advanced nations (the Naples Summit)? If something is agreed  upon at the summit, will it be able to implement it? We have to  think about whom we should send out as a responsible  representative to the international community." He indicated  that the Hata cabinet should resign before the summit is held on  8 July.</p>

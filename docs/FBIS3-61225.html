			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas has dismissed his  national security adviser, Alvydas Sadeckas, in the face of a  rising crime rate in Lithuania.    Mr. Brazauskas' chief aid, Raimundas Rajeckas, claims the  discharge is a considerable loss. Mr. Rajeckas, who is also the  chief of the president's staff, said Mr. Brazauskas did not  consult him before making the decision.    Mr. Sadeckas himself declined to comment on the president's  move. He only remarked he felt responsible for the events and  processes going on in Lithuania. He also asked reporters not to  interpret his dismissal as a sensational news.    Mr. Sadeckas held various posts at the Interior Ministry  until last year. He was relieved of his duties on allegedly  direct instructions of the then Prime Minister Gediminas  Vagnorius.</p>

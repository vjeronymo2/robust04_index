			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Policy of Pressure"] </F>   [Text] India should not react immediately to the statement  by U.S. Ambassador-designate to India Frank Wisner about  missiles and especially the Prithvi missile program. This is  because his statement means that the United States has been  interfering in the program and that it does not favor the  development of Prithvi by India within the Indian army. The  question here is whether the Indian defense program is dependent  on the mercy, grace, or whims of the United States or has the  Indian Government given the United States the right to interfere  directly in the Indian defense program. It is definitely not  justified for an individual who has been nominated as the U.S.  envoy to India to comment about Prithvi missiles. Frank Wisner  may not have even reached Delhi but his interference has already  begun. When this gentleman arrives, God only knows what he will  do. Of course, this can be gauged easily. It should not be  forgotten here that the United States has been sending many such  officials to India whose main objective has been to interfere in  its internal affairs. India should not tolerate this at any  cost.    It is unfortunate that the designated U.S. envoy to India,  Frank Wisner, commented on the Indian missile program at a time  when it looked as if Indo-U.S. ties were swiftly improving  again. Such a statement by a senior U.S. diplomat immediately  after Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's successful U.S. tour is  astonishing. On the one hand, U.S. President Bill Clinton has  openly declared that he did not want to interfere in any way in  the defense affairs of India and that it is for the Indian  Government to decide what was good or bad for its own defense.  On the other hand, the way the man designated to become the  U.S. envoy to India has been making comments about India's  defense program smacks of a threat. Definitely, Wisner's  comments have been made under a "policy of pressure," and the  Indian Government must protest against this "policy of pressure."    As far as the missile program is concerned, Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao has already given his assurances to Parliament.  He also reiterated this when he was in the U.S., that there was  no U.S. interference in the defense programs of India and that  the United States has not adopted any policy of pressure. But  the way Frank Wisner has decided to follow the path of the  "policy of pressure," even before coming to India, is  distressing. After all, both men cannot be right. Either the  prime minister is right -- that there is no pressure from U.S.  regarding the defense programs, especially in regard to Prithvi  missiles, or Frank Wisner is, who plainly wants to put pressure  on India that it should not deliver the Prithvi, developed by  Indian scientists for the Indian army. At the moment, the only  the question concerns Prithvi missiles being handed to the army.  Yet, the United States has already started displaying a  threatening posture. When Agni missiles are deployed, what  would the attitude be then? The Agni missiles are  unquestionably much more devastating and important than the  Prithvi. Only the United States knows what its intentions are,  but on the basis of what has appeared after Frank Wisner's  remarks, one can safely say that the U.S. has not completely  given up its policy of pressuring India.    The criticism of the main opposition parties cannot be  termed  as unjust in the least. CPIM's [Communist Party of India --  Marxist] reaction is quite right, that the United States wants  to continue its policy of pressure. Like the CPIM, the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] has also criticized Frank Wisner's  statement. Therefore, it would be justified for India to  express its views on Wisner's comments and declare that the  Prithvi and Agni missile programs would continue and the  decision taken to deploy Prithvi with the Indian army would not  be changed in any way.</p>

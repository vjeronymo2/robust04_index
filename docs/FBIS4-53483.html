			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 18 (YONHAP) -- The government, as part of  its campaign to boost the country's competitiveness, has decided  to increase overseas training opportunities for public officials  and widen the training scope of government agencies,  international organizations and research institutes.    Two hundred public officials will be trained abroad next  year, up 30 percent from 150, according to the 1995 state-funded  training program for civil servants released by the Government  Administration Ministry Tuesday.    Noting overseas training so far was limited to academic  studies and getting degrees, public officials will also be sent  to foreign government agencies, international organizations, and  think tanks for field studies with a view to raising their  practical abilities to handle external negotiations.    Training will no longer be restricted to advanced countries.  Eighty officials will be trained at English-speaking countries;  35 in non-English speaking countries like Japan, Germany, and  France; 35 in other areas, and 50 in international organizations  and research institutes.    Public officials in good standing and recommended by their  agencies will be chosen by the end of October after testing  their language ability, a Ministry official said.    On returning from their overseas training, officials have to  serve two to three years in related posts, he said.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Anonymity for lottery winners thrown into uncertainty Yesterday's High Court ruling that the Pounds 17.9m winner of the National Lottery can be named has cast a cloud over the ability of Camelot, the National Lottery operator, to protect the identity of jackpot winners who wish to remain anonymous. The ruling, by Sir John Wood, came just 24 hours after another High Court judge imposed the gagging order on the press. It confounded some media lawyers who had been predicting earlier in the day that the temporary injunction was likely to be made permanent next week. At a brief private hearing on Tuesday evening, at which the newspapers were not present, Camelot is believed to have argued that publication of the winner's name against his wishes would have amounted to a breach of confidence. Under the rules set by the National Lottery regulator, the identity of a lottery winner is treated as confidential information. Camelot is prevented from revealing any personal details about a winner unless it has that person's prior written consent. Courts have shown in the past that they are prepared to stop newspapers from disclosing confidential information where it has been obtained in circumstances such that the press knew it was confidential or private. Lawyers said both the Sun and Daily Mirror knew the winner had requested anonymity and therefore that his identity was confidential information between him and Camelot. In deciding whether to grant the injunction the judge had to weigh the public interest in upholding the right to protect private information against the public interest in knowing his identity. The judge on Tuesday was persuaded that Camelot at least had an arguable case and should be granted the ban. But at a two-hour private hearing yesterday, Sir John Wood decided there was no legal basis for granting an injunction. Publication of details about the winner's job, family and the fact that he lived in the north of England meant his identity was already 'substantially in the public domain', the judge said. There was therefore no point in continuing the ban. Had the injunction been upheld the newspapers would have faced heavy fines and the possible imprisonment of their editors for contempt of court if they had decided to go ahead and publish the winner's name. Now that the injunction has been lifted they are free to identify him. But in view of the fact that they had already indicated before Camelot obtained the gagging order that they would respect the winner's request for anonymity, the judge ordered the National Lottery operator to pay the newspapers' costs of challenging the ban. These are estimated at Pounds 5,000. Camelot has indicated that it will not appeal. Lawyers said last night that if the court ruling was allowed to stand it must cast doubt on the lottery operator's ability to protect the privacy of winners who request anonymity as it is required to do under the terms of its licence. The court's decision also appeared to be a slap in the face for the lottery regulator, Mr Peter Davis, who last night acknowledged he had no powers to prevent members of the public or the media revealing a winner's identity. He said he had no evidence that Camelot had breached the terms of its licence but in view of allegations made against the company, he would be carrying out an investigation of its handling of the affair.</p>

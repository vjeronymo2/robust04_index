			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Syndicated Loans: Sweden jumbo Dollars 5bn deal gets good response The response to the jumbo loan for Sweden, which is now in general syndication via Citibank and J. P. Morgan, is said to be 'very encouraging'. Underwriting for the Dollars 5bn loan was finalised last week and syndication is likely to be finalised before Christmas, with signing in early January. A Pounds 520m loan to build a 750MW power station on Humberside has been oversubscribed almost 100 per cent. This is the first large financing for a UK power project for 2 1/2 years, since power stations at Barking in London, Medway in Kent, Keadby in Yorkshire, and Derwent in the Midlands were announced. Some 40 banks offered a total of more than Pounds 1bn for the Humber Power loan, arranged by NatWest Markets and UBS. They are mainly European, with strong support from Japan, with underwriting by ABN Amro, CIBC, NatWest Markets and UBS. Syndication closed last week for the loan, which runs for 17 1/2 years, and is priced at 125 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) during construction. After construction, pricing changes to 115 basis points over Libor, rising to 135 basis points over. Citibank and Toronto-Dominion Bank are arranging and underwriting a Pounds 400m revolving facility for BSkyB, the satellite television group which is to float this week. Trading in the shares is due to start on Thursday, the day the loan is to be launched into general syndication. The loan price varies between 37 1/2 basis points over Libor and 87 1/2 over, depending on the company's financial performance. Proceeds from the share issue and the loan will be used to repay shareholder loans. This will leave BSkyB with Pounds 900m of bank debt, and equity with a market capitalisation exceeding Pounds 4bn. Syndication closed last week on a Dollars 900m loan for Instituto de Credito Oficial, a Spanish public law institution which carries out credit transactions for the Spanish government, and is rated Aa2. The four-year loan, arranged by Argentaria, Deutsche Bank and NatWest Markets, has a facility fee of 6 1/2 basis points and a margin of 6 basis points. Banks offered Dollars 1.5bn and allocation has not yet taken place. Carrefour, the French supermarket group, has asked J. P. Morgan with co-arranger UBS to syndicate a FFr3bn (Dollars 600m), five-year multi-currency loan through a group of banks, most of which already have a relationship with the company. The drawn cost will be between 20 and 25 basis points over Libor. Midland and NatWest Markets have launched into syndication a Pounds 300m multicurrency loan with a swing-line facility for Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group, with a price of 20 basis points over Libor. NatWest Markets is arranging a seven-year, Pounds 140m loan for SHV Macro, the Dutch wholesale and retail foods group. The loan is priced at 22 1/2 basis points over Libor for first five years then 25 over Libor for the last two.</p>

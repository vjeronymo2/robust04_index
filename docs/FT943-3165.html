			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK tops EU league of 48-hour weeks Nearly half of the 7m male employees in the European Union working a 48-hour week or more are employed in the UK, according to the annual Employment in Europe published by the European Commission. The report helps to explain the UK's strong resistance to the European working time directive, passed earlier this year, which places strict controls on working more than 48 hours per week. Between 1983 and 1992, average hours usually worked per week declined by just under 4 per cent. The largest reduction was in the Netherlands, where average hours fell by 13 per cent. By contrast, in Italy and the UK the fall was only 1 per cent or less. But the UK is the only EU country which has non-wage labour costs which bear less heavily on low-paid workers. The report also implicitly backs the UK government's arguments against a minimum wage by stating that 'low pay is a relatively minor source of poverty levels of income'. Overall, poverty is associated with low pay, but in Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK, being out of work is the main cause of poverty. The report also found that: More people in the EU are now employed in construction than in agriculture. And almost as many people are employed in business services - the biggest growth sector between 1985 and 1992 - as in agriculture. In Germany and Spain, 90 per cent of the unemployed find jobs through public employment services. In the UK and Portugal, it is less than 30 per cent and in Greece, less than 10 per cent. In Belgium, 63 per cent of any increase in labour costs goes to the state. In other words, the total cost of raising an employee's pay is nearly three times the addition to their net pay. In general, exchange rate movements rather than differentials in productivity or wage rises have been the most important determinant of the cost competitiveness of European producers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Boris Zenkov, Russian ambassador to Cyprus, </F> by Rena Koulermou-Larkou at the Russian Embassy in Nicosia on 25  February]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Koulermou-Larkou] Mr.  Zenkov, my first question concerns Russia's new initiative for  more active involvement in the Cyprus issue, a topic to which  the foreign minister referred when he was asked about Robert  Lamb's [U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus]  visit to Moscow.    [Zenkov] There is no Russian initiative, but moves within  the framework of cooperation among UN Security Council members.  For two years now, the country-members of the Security Council  have decided to coordinate their moves for common action and  greater involvement of the Security Council in the efforts to  solve the Cyprus issue. These deliberations take place in order  to exchange views and evaluations so that the Security Council  can have a more correct picture of what happens.    [Koulermou-Larkou] Does this mean that we should not expect  a dynamic intervention by Russia as in the case of  Bosnia-Herzegovina? Lamb's visit to Moscow gave the impression  that something new is being done, that there is more movement.    [Zenkov] Lamb's visit is part of routine deliberations. See  it through this lens: We both see this glass on the table, it  is the same glass. But due to your position, you see it from a  different angle than I see it. Therefore, we as a member of the  Security Council we have our own contacts with the two sides in  Cyprus, not necessarily with the same people that the Americans,  French and British meet. That is why it is necessary to brief  each other. Nelson Ledsky [former U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus] went to Moscow too, just as we went to  Washington for the same purpose. The Security Council aims at  creating movement so that the UN secretary general's efforts  bring results.    [Koulermou-Larkou] Are you optimistic that the efforts will  bring results?    [Zenkov] In diplomacy, there is no room for someone who does  not believe in justice and good. There are always hopes,  otherwise why try?    [Koulermou-Larkou] The fact that you try became evident a  few days ago during a television interview. I would like you to  tell me how you respond to criticism against you for the  metaphor you used. You said, the Cyprus issue is like a patient  suffering from gangrene and that the advised therapy is to cut  off the infected leg. [United Democratic Union of Cyprus  Chairman Vasos] Lissaridhis said that if this is the treatment  you propose, then you are not a good doctor. [Lissaridhis is a  doctor by profession]    [Zenkov] Mr. Lissaridhis is a friend and I respect him. We  always speak honestly and amiably in our meetings. But I should  tell you that I do not aspire to get a doctor's diploma in  Cyprus. The evaluation I made was not one of a doctor, but one  of a diplomat. As I said at the beginning, I speak as a person  who has lived in Cyprus for many years, loves this place and  hopes that peace and stability will come. I did not analyze or  write a doctoral thesis during that interview. I simply said  what I feel and continue to believe that today we are living the  last effort to keep what is called the Cyprus issue alive.  Twenty years have passed without progress. The generations who  remember cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots  are disappearing. The friendly feelings that existed at some  point are being forgotten. Unfortunately, and this is a 20th  century phenomenon, an explosion of chauvinism is coming to the  surface. Pseudo-feelings and hates are created and the new  generations perhaps will not have the desire to live in a  unified Cyprus. This was the reason for my interview, and if  some politicians or people did not like it, that does not mean I  was unfair. As I say, I am not a ten-pound note that should be  desirable to all.    [Koulermou-Larkou] Do you think that there is a  possibility of results in this last effort on the Cyprus issue,  of which you are a part?    [Zenkov] There is a possibility, but very little. What is  left is the last one. Two or three more years and there will be  no possibilities. At least, that is the way I see it.    [Koulermou-Larkou] You said before that there is always  hope. However, we are only at the beginning of this effort for  the confidence-building measures and there are already such  problems, which give the impression that we are close to an  impasse.    [Zenkov] No, we can not accept that there is no way out. If  we find difficulties on the left, we will turn to the right.  Again, if we find difficulties in our way, we will turn  elsewhere. Of course there are problems. If they did not  exist, there would not have been a need for us to be here and  try to solve them. However, it is very early to expect  something right now. Do not forget that the process of the  confidence-building measures has just begun.    [Koulermou-Larkou] Is it perhaps the waiting that causes  anxiety?    [Zenkov] We are also anxious. The Russians especially are  very sensitive to someone else's pain. And me, personally.  However, this anxiety reminds me of a Russian anecdote. In  Russia's northern regions, where there is winter for 11 months  and spring for one month, a farmer plants potatoes as soon as  spring comes. The next day, he digs out the potatoes he planted  and begins eating them. A friend asks him: What are you doing?  The farmer says: I can not wait for them to grow. I am hungry  now....    So in Cyprus too, some people are anxious to reach  conclusions or expect results before anything begins.</p>

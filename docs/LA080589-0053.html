			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENTIAL PANEL TO STUDY AIR TERRORISM  </P> <P> President Bush announced Friday he is forming a seven-member commission to  investigate air terrorism, with particular emphasis on the bombing last  December of Pan Am Flight 103.  </P> <P> Bush, in an executive order, said the Commission on Aviation Security and  Terrorism will study the adequacy of security procedures.  </P> <P> "The commission also shall review options for handling terrorist acts involving  aviation," Bush's order said.  </P> <P> The commission will be composed of seven members appointed by the President --  including two senators and two members of the House. The chairman of the group  is to be picked by the President from among the members.  </P> <P> The panel also will study the issue of public notification of bomb threats, the  order said.  </P> <P> Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement that  "ongoing, intensive investigations into all aspects of the destruction of Pan  Am Flight 103 will not be affected by the commission's work. Rather, the  commission will focus on the need for additional measures to improve aviation  security."  </P> <P> The move was applauded by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and  Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) who had worked with Bush in forming the  panel.  </P> <P> "Every American has grieved for the victims of Flight 103 and shared the grief  of their families. Although the headlines of the tragedy have faded, questions  still linger," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> "They involve basic factual questions such as what kind of aviation security  measures may be necessary under what conditions? What kind of warnings should  be given to the traveling public? Where, exactly, responsibility should lie  between airports, airlines, the federal government and foreign governments in  seeking to protect the security of Americans traveling abroad," Mitchell's  statement said.  </P> <P> Dole called Bush's move "a good initiative."  </P> <P> Flight 103, a Boeing 747, exploded above Lockerbie, Scotland, when a bomb went  off on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.  </P></p>

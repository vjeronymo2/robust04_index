			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Perrier shares rise on hope of counter-offer to Nestle PERRIER, the French mineral water company embroiled in a battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy, yesterday saw 2 per cent of its capital - 158,000 shares - change hands on speculative hopes of a counter-offer to Nestle's FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid. Speculators began buying Perrier as soon as the Paris stock market opened. The shares, which had been suspended since mid-December, following the Agnellis' FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, Perrier's controlling shareholder, closed at FFr1,501 against a suspension price of FFr1,396. This left Perrier's shares trading slightly above the FFr1,475 offered by Nestle and Indosuez, the French bank with which it is mounting its bid. Exor, mooted as the likeliest contender for a Perrier counter-bid, also saw its shares shoot up after suspension. The Exor share price rose by 8.9 per cent to FFr1,438 yesterday, well above the FFr1,320 a share offered by the Agnellis. At present Exor would be able to block Nestle's bid, or a third party bid, since it controls 49 per cent of Perrier's voting shares - through its own 35 per cent stake and the 13.8 per cent holding recently bought by Saint Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis. However, it is not certain that Saint Louis will be able to hold on to its shares. Nestle has filed two legal cases in France to try to nullify the stake on the grounds that Perrier, which is chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent, president of Exor, sold the shares to Saint Louis specifically to block the Swiss group's imminent bid. The first court case comes to an end next week and the second on February 25. If the courts rule in Saint Louis' favour, it will be able to keep its shares. The French stock market authorities would then force Exor to make a full bid. Exor, however, would be allowed to make a token bid below the Nestle price, since it already controls enough stock to block Nestle's offer. But if the judgment goes against Saint Louis, Exor's blocking stake will disappear. Exor will then have to decide whether to fend off Nestle with a fully fledged counter-bid.</p>

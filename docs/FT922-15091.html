			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / German inflation up GERMANY yesterday reported a further rise in inflation last month to an annual rate of 4.7 per cent at a time when pay talks have begun in the engineering industry in the face of employers' determination to keep wage rises low. However, there was encouraging news on trade performance. The improvement in February's trade surplus to DM2.2bn (Pounds 760m) from only DM45m in January reflected a 1.1 per cent rise in exports, to nearly DM55bn. Imports eased by 2.9 per cent from January's level, to DM52.7bn. Since unification, the surplus has come down sharply.</p>

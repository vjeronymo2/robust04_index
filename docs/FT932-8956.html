			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Summer Festivals: Jazz from London to Montreux EVEN AS you read this, sound checks are taking place all across North London. The festival season kicks off today with the launch of the London Jazz Festival (May 14-23). A successor to the Camden fest, the event has been expanded by the involvement of the north London boroughs of Islington and Hackney and this year involves nearly 100 concerts at 13 metropolitan venues. Eclectic programming has produced main attractions to suit all tastes and features Abdullah Ibrahim at the Hackney Empire, Tania Maria at the Forum (May 16), Anthony Braxton at the Bloomsbury Theatre (May 22) and, appropriately, the gospel according to the Five Blind Boys of Alabama at the Union Chapel (May 23). A Festival Nomad ticket which allows free entry to some concerts and concessions on the door at others costs Pounds 30. (London Jazz Festival Information Hotline 071 911 1652) For concentrated enjoyment in a more pastoral setting Brecon Jazz (Tel: 0874 625557), this year celebrating its 10th anniversary, is hard to beat. Between Aug 13-15 the market hall will feature concerts by Lionel Hampton, Wynton Marsalis and Stephane Grappelli while the rest of the town will be jumping (and sometimes lurching) to the varied outdoor gigs held across the Welsh market town. Weekend 'stroller' tickets let you wander from hotel bar to outdoor bandstand although individual concert tickets for the main events are also available. North of the border, Glasgow (July 1-11) and Edinburgh (Aug 7-14) continue to vie with one another - this year to produce the most in mainstream jazz. The Glasgow International Jazz Festival (Tel: 041 227 5511) balances Oscar Peterson, Nina Simone, BB King and Tony Bennett with the more exotic sounds of Don Pullen's Afro-Brazilian Connection, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Hermeto Pascoal. The Edinburgh International Jazz Festival has clarinettist Bob Wilber leading a tribute to Benny Goodman, Acker Bilk teaming up with Humphrey Lyttleton and Leon Redbone lying back with a five piece band. For its 27th outing, the Montreux Jazz Festival (Tel: 41 21 963 8282) has moved from the foreshore of Lake Geneva and the crumbling confines of the town's Casino to the shiny new Stravinsky Auditorium. The move could render the festival (July 2-17) more anodyne than usual with its glittering parade of the great and good but the fringe sessions at the New Q's club and the likes of Ray Brown Trio plus James Morrison, Elvin Jones and Michel Petrucciani look good. In the main hall this year animateur Quincy Jones oversees a fortnight of showcasing from the Tribute to Duke Ellington, Vive la France to The Atlantic Living Legends. Montreux' rival show, the JVC Grande Parade du Jazz (July 13-24), also uses the biggest names to draw and this year's parade is intoxicating. Lionel Hampton, Pat Metheny, Joe Henderson, Illinois Jacquet and George Benson feature among crossover types such as Manhattan Transfer and Manu Dibango. (Tel: from June 14, 33 93 71 89 60) It might sound greyer than Nice (and is probably less clement) but the Hague's North Sea Jazz Festival (July 9-11) is as spectacular in its programming, possibly better for its fringe events and is under cover. Its 'trumpets for Dizzy' features Roy Hargrove and Jon Faddis with an all-star band; the 'saxophonists series' has Joe Henderson, Stanley Turrentine and Jackie Maclean alongside the younger Joe Lovano and Kenny Garrett, for example; pianists include Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Horace Silver, Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea. The programme even has a 'Gigs for Kids' section. (Tel: 31 70 354 2958). Big is not always best and the greatest little jazz festival is the Festival de Jazz Django Reinhardt (Tel: 33 1 64 24 60 01). Held on an island in the Seine four kilometres from Fontainebleau on the weekend of 25 June, the gathering of Romany clans this year features the gypsy guitars of Bireli Lagrene and Babik Reinhardt alongside the virtuoso skills of Grappelli sideman Martin Taylor and American Jim Hall.</p>

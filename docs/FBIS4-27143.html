			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 29 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Saturday prospects for further talks between North Korea  and the United States were unclear due to Pyongyang's unilateral  discharge of nuclear fuel rods and that the matter could now be  referred to the UN Security Council [UNSC], leading to sanctions  against the communist country.    In talks with the opposition Democratic Party (DP) leader Yi  Ki- taek, Kim said of 8,000 existing fuel rods, North Korea  changed 4,000 and their whereabouts were unknown and that the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections had hit a  deadlock.    "Therefore prospects for the North Korea-U.S. high-level  talks, slated for June, are unclear and after IAEA report, the  nuclear issue is expected to be referred to the UNSC," Yi quoted  Kim as saying.    Kim also told Yi that when referred to UNSC, both military  and economic sanctions could be imposed together and that China,  under these circumstances, could no longer oppose.    Yi said the president will endeavour to kill the North  Korea-  Russia military treaty, which obliges Russia to side with North  Korea in case of a war on the Korean peninsula.    Kim also said the government had several scenarios preparing  for the unpredictable North Korean situation, Yi said.</p>

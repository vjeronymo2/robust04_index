			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wan Li, honorary  president of the China Youth Development Foundation, emphasized  recently that it is essential to give high priority to the  development of education and that governments at all levels  should attach importance to education and make great efforts to  go a good job in education, particularly basic education.    Wan Li had a discussion at Zhongnanhai with comrades from  the  China Youth Development Foundation. On the implementation of  the Hope Project, he said: At present, some localities cannot  guarantee even the issuance of teachers' wages. They spend  money on sedan cars and wining and dining instead of building  schools and developing education. They should not have done so.  Other localities fail to pay teachers because of financial  difficulties. However, in my view, teachers' wages must not be  in arrears no matter how poor we are or how difficult our  situation. Wan Li said: In the final analysis, the trial of  national strength is a competition of talented people. To keep  pace with the world's development, we are emphasizing meeting  the needs of the next century. In other words, we should train  a cross-century generation of new people, and the key to  training is education.    Wan Li said: At persent, poor regions have two problems in  education. One is they have no schools, and the other is, even  if they have schools, school-age children there cannot afford to  attend them. There is a vicious circle of illiteracy causing  backwardness in the economy and stupidity creating poverty. So,  we should redouble our efforts to build more schools, and all  the people should be concerned about education and the future of  our country. I approve of a slogan: let us basically wipe out  the phenomenon of some poor children being deprived of schooling  and ensure schooling for all school-age children by the end of  the century.    On the orientation of running rural schools, Wan Li said:  Rural education should develop in the direction of promoting  vocational education. I suggest that we should take the road of  integrating agriculture, science, and education in running rural  schools. In pastoral areas, for instance, we should teach  children animal husbandry and the skills to develop the  grassland economy, in addition to reading. Wealth is created by  man. With scientific and technological personnel, the rural  areas will become prosperous and the country will become rich  and strong.    Wan Li emphasized: Developed regions should also attach  importance to the development of education, and the success and  failure of education should be regarded as one of the criteria  for appraising leading cadres' job performance. I have been  told that some children in developed regions are engaged in  business operations instead of attending school. Such a  practice is absolutely impermissible. We should use legal means  in ensuring schooling for children. Without schooling, nothing  can be achieved. Now, parents in urban areas spoil their only  child and want the child to seek high marks with the sole  purpose of advancing to a higher-level school. They pay no  attention to cultivating their child's ability to be independent  nor do they consider the child's overall development. In this  way, how can the child meet the needs of a modern society? In  conclusion, Wan Li said: The Hope Project is a nice thing. If  everyone puts in efforts, it is certain that education will be  successful.</p>

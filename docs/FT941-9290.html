			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (4): Turning Point for Winter Games - Introduction / Norway has seized the opportunity to show that the Olympics can be run by small communities representing a whole nation Lillehammer represents a genuine turning point for the Winter Games and possibly the Olympic movement as a whole. A change in timetable means that Winter and Summer Olympics will now alternate every two years, rather than being crowded into the same 12 months. 'The Winter events will now come into their own,' predicts IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 'They used to be seen as the Small Games before the Big Games but now they will be seen as Olympics in their own right. Lillehammer is the event of 1994.' Norway has imaginatively seized the opportunity to show that the Olympics can be run by small communities representing a whole nation. Lillehammer embodies a 'small is beautiful' philosophy. It says everything about the scale of this event that more than half the population of Lillehammer could be accommodated in the Hakon Hall, where the ice hockey finals will be played. 'Let us be proud of a small city and a small country's ability to take on such a huge task as the Olympic Games,' said the community's mayor, Mr Audun Tron, when he opened the Hakon hall. Furthermore, Lillehammer has resolutely striven to stage the Games on its own terms. Much of the luxury, excess and Byzantine protocol that has come to surround the Olympics and its hierarchy simply has no place in Norwegian culture - nor will it have. 'Some of the IOC members coming here will not be very happy,' predicted Gerhard Heiberg, chief of the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee (LOOC). 'There are no five-star hotels in Lillehammer and we won't be building any. 'I said to Mr Samaranch at the beginning that the Games will be in Norway and we want to do things in a Norwegian way - with modesty and nothing especially luxurious.' This focus on inherent qualities rather than external glitz has characterised Lillehammer's programme, from the architecture through to the hugely successful licensed goods programme. Here again, Norwegian values set the tone in a sector that is notorious for ephemeral trash mass produced in the Far East and peddled for a fast profit. 'I just told everyone No Junk. Your product must be unique in its way and reflect our nation,' says Mr Heiberg. But it is in the field of environmental development of the Olympics that Lillehammer has set the pace. The LOOC agenda is described in detail later in this magazine. The committee has used the Olympics to improve the environment rather than accepting it as an ugly polluting monster, too powerful to be turned aside. This has set the pattern for future Games. Sydney based much of its detailed bid on the philosophies being put into practice in Norway. Mr Samaranch and his team have advised any aspirant Games city to learn from what is being done in Lillehammer. The numbers of competitors and spectators will be higher than ever - not least because of the passion with which the Norwegian public has taken the Games to its heart. Advances in television technology will ensure the best coverage is available for Lillehammer's worldwide audience. Improved cameras and sound equipment - and faster results systems - will enhance broadcasts.</p>

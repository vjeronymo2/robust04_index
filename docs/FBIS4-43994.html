			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade in Corfu, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister John Major arrived at the Corfu  Summit tonight refusing to back down in the growing battle over  who replaces Commission President Jacques Delors.    And he hinted that he would be prepared to postpone a  decision if it avoided putting a candidate unacceptable to  Britain into the Brussels driving seat.    "I think it is important to get the right result -- whether  that will be here or not I am not sure. Everyone would hope  so," said the Prime Minister, after flying in for dinner with  the other EU [European Union] leaders, Russian president Boris  Yeltsin and the government leaders of Austria, Norway, Finland  and Sweden, whose countries are due to join the Union next year.    Mr. Major gave little away about the hand he will play at  the  negotiating table in Corfu tomorrow night. That is when the  real argument begins over the choice of the new Commission  president.    Mr. Major was asked what was so wrong with Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose candidacy has upset Tory Euro  sceptics.    "I think we had better wait and see what happens in the  discussion. I have nothing to say about that until we have had  it."    The Prime Minister may even veto Mr. Dehaene's chances in  what must be a unanimous decision by the 12 leaders. If he did  so, he would be embroiled in a major row with France and Germany  who have championed the Belgian's cause.    His chief rival for the job, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers, has refused to withdraw despite the fact that Mr.  Dehaene already has the support of about half a dozen member  states.</p>

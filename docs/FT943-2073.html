			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Great parody - but no swastika Sir, In your 'Guide to the week' (September 12) you mention the auction of Charles Chaplin's costume that he wore in the film The Great Dictator. As Adenoid Hynkel he was a great parody of a similarly ridiculous dictator with the same initials. But you are mistaken in saying Chaplin's uniform incorporated swastikas - the motif was a parody of the original and at no point was a swastika shown. Indeed it seems strange that, years before, these two men of small stature both adopted the toothbrush moustache and a most individual manner of walking (or marching) as their prime visual features. If only today we could have such a brilliant satire of, say, Mr Zhirinovsky . . . now there's a thought to rescue the British film industry. John Siddons-Downe 3 Vine Place, London W5 3JF.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milivoje Mihajlovic] </F>   [Text] The Pristina-based newspaper ZERI writes that they  have learned from sources close to Ibrahim Rugova that the first  session of the republic of Kosovo's parliament will be held -- I  quote -- somewhere in Pristina next week. ZERI also reports  that the mandates of deputies, elected two years ago in the  Albanian elections in Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija], will be  verified at the session.    In a statement for this paper, the Albanian politician Adem  Demaci commented on this information and said that the Serbs  have held 12 multiparty elections in the past 12 years [figures  as received], while the Albanians went to the polls only once.  Rexhep Qosja, the most influential Albanian intellectual, said  that if Serbia allowed the session of the republic of Kosovo  parliament to take place, this would confirm his earlier  assessment that the organizers of the elections and the Albanian  parliament were actually Quislings. Let me remind you that the  first attempt to hold a session of the phantom republic of  Kosovo's parliament in the Pristina-based Alaudin school  [medresa Alaudin] was prevented by the police because there was  a chance of this event provoking a rebellion of the Albanian  separatists in Kosovo and Metohija.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 24 November, NEC Corporation announced that it  had succeeded in developing new, advanced technology for  processing waste water that contains fluorine, in which the  amount of sludge generated during the processing will be reduced  to 1/30th that of existing coagulation methods. NEC will build a  pilot plant soon, and will try to achieve practical application  in 1 to 2 years at semiconductor plants, etc. This is expected  to contribute greatly to reducing the rapidly increasing cost of  sludge processing.    The recently developed technology entails repeated use of  aluminum hydroxide in gel form as an adsorbent to process  fluorine waste water. This makes it possible to drastically  reduce the concentration of the fluorine waste water without  generating coagulating sedimentation sludge. The technology uses  the solubility of aluminum hydroxide in gel form, which causes  transformation, and fluorine adsorptivity PH (an index that  shows concentration of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution; PH7  is neutral, with smaller values indicating stronger acidity and  higher values indicating stronger alkalinity).    The fluorine waste water processing method generally used at  this time is a coagulation method in which calcium chloride is  added to the fluorine waste water to fix most of the fluorine  into refractory fluoro-calcium, then as advanced processing, a  large quantity of sulfate band or other coagulant is added to  form a coagulating sediment, with which the remaining fluorine  is incorporated and coprecipitated.    NEC, observed that although aluminum hydroxide in gel form  had high fluorine adsorptivity when close to neutral, this  dropped abruptly when it became alkaline. Thus it proceeded with  research based on the assumption that low-cost, advanced  processing of fluorine waste water without creating coagulating  sedimentation sludge was possible if adsorbed fluorine could be  desorbed and recovered efficiently. As a result, NEC succeeded  in developing technology to desorb adsorbed fluorine through PH  manipulation, as follows: ``Aluminum hydroxide in gel form at  the stable level of PH7 caused fluorine adsorption. At PH9,  calcium chloride was added to desorb the adsorbed fluorine into  fluoro-calcium. Then at PH11, when the aluminum hydroxide was  dissolved completely, the fluoro-calcium was filtered out and  the filtrate was returned to PH7 to regenerate aluminum  hydroxide in gel form.''    The conclusions from the above are as follows:    (1) Aluminum hydroxide in gel form used as a fluorine  adsorbent is not discharged outside the element, so the amount  of sludge is about 1/30th the amount created by the coagulation  method;    (2) the processing efficiency of aluminum hydroxide is over  10 times that of other fluorine adsorbents because its adsorbing  area is large;    (3) aluminum hydroxide in gel form can be formed by  neutralizing inexpensive aluminum chloride, so the cost is low,  under 1/10;    (4) no special adsorption preprocessing is required, so  equipment cost is low because about 20% addition to  existing  equipment will be sufficient.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / People: McKinlay dives out of the Pool Margaret McKinlay, the chief executive of the Electricity Pool, surprised the power industry yesterday by announcing that she is leaving to take up the new post of head of compliance at British Gas. The move will stir considerable interest in energy circles since the Pool and British Gas are both in the public eye these days. But the 43-year-old McKinlay felt it was time for a change, both from her point of view and that of the Pool. 'When I took on this job five years ago I wanted to make sure the Pool was capable of working, and I think I've done that,' she said. 'It can always be improved, but it would be better for another person to do that.' A graduate of Edinburgh University, McKinlay joined the Department of Energy in 1977, and worked on electricity and oil licensing before becoming private secretary to the minister of state. After a spell in administration, she moved to the coal division during the miners' strike before returning to electricity to oversee privatisation. In December 1988 she helped create the Pool, the new wholesale market for electricity which formed the heart of the privatised industry, becoming chief executive in 1990. Although the Pool has evolved as the focal point of the electricity market, it has been criticised for containing imperfections, and a number of reforms are being introduced under McKinlay's guidance. At British Gas, McKinlay will play a key role in introducing a regulatory compliance regime in the wake of last year's monopoly report. In particular, she will be responsible for ensuring the effective separation of British Gas's transportation business from its trading operations - the key feature of the new structure which will have to pass muster with the gas regulator and the company's customers. McKinlay will be based at British Gas's corporate centre and report to a main board director. She admits that she has had only limited contact with the gas industry - still very much a man's world - though she has met Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, with whom most of her dealings will be. No moves have yet been made to find a successor at the Pool. One member said yesterday: 'She will be very hard to replace. She is extraordinarily conscientious, and would never leave a job half done.'</p>

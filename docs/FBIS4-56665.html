			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Radio Antilles International will soon be back on  the air, station director Jacques Sampeur said on Signal FM on  14 May. The financial reserves of the station, however, are not  sufficient to cover the repair fees, he added, so a lottery has  been organized to help the administration with its undertakings.    Sampeur notes that at one time, the UN Development Program  [PNUD] had drawn up a list [not further identified] to help the  station, but this was destroyed in the crush of the 30 September  1991 events. He nevertheless pointed out that this help will  need to be extended. [passage omitted]</p>

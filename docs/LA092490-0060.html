			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 PREP GIRLS' TENNIS PREVIEW  </P> <P> Top teams: (Listed alphabetically) Capistrano Valley, Corona del Mar, Dana  Hills, El Dorado, Estancia, Fountain Valley, Katella.  </P> <P> Top individuals: Page Bartelt (junior, Capistrano Valley), Jamie Fouret  (senior, Dana Hills), Jeannette Fylpaa (junior, University), Anne Mall (junior,  Dana Hills), Jackie O'Leary (senior, Corona del Mar), Keri Phebus (junior,  Corona del Mar), Kristen Pollock (senior, Corona del Mar), Renee Urricariet  (senior, Fountain Valley).  </P> <P> Important dates: Nov. 17, individual sectionals; Nov. 20, 29, 30, Southern  Section finals.  </P> <P> Notes: Corona del Mar Coach Gary Salazar rates his Sea Kings as the team to  beat in the Sea View League, and the returning talent he has supports his case.  A third consecutive Southern Section 4-A team title seems an attainable goal.  Phebus, O'Leary, Pollock and senior Courtney Strauss lead the team. Last  season's Southern Section 3-A champion, Dana Hills, has moved up to the 4-A  division and should be a good test for Corona del Mar during the playoffs,  especially if Mall is healthy. Mall, arguably one of the top three singles  players in the county, has been bothered by a rotator cuff strain in her right  shoulder. Also contending in the 4-A class will be Capistrano Valley and its  ace, Bartelt.  </P></p>

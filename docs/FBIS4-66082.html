			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maurizio Ricci: "Berlusconi's Anger: `No </F> Danger'"]    [Text] Rome -- An angry and impassioned response followed a  little over an hour of feverish consultations after ANSA and AGI  press agencies relayed the AFP and Reuters reports of the  interview French President Mitterrand granted to LA REPUBBLICA  and four other major European newspapers. This time the subject  of the controversy is not a confused vote by what is little more  than an honorary body -- namely, the European Parliament; or a  remark by a former prime minister, who is now merely a party  leader -- namely, Michel Rocard. In the case of an incumbent  chief of state, who is also one of the most authoritative  political figures of the European Union -- namely, Francois  Mitterrand -- the Berlusconi government decided to treat it as a  diplomatic incident.  <H5>  Spiteful Reference </H5>   "Nothing frightening has happened in Italy," the Palazzo  Chigi [prime minister's office] replied tersely. "The majority  and the government that the Italian people have chosen in no way  represent anything suspicious. Our country's media and the  institutions operate in a context of freedom and observance of  the law." But this time the note was not confined to a defense  of the recent election result, and proceeds from an attack,  using language more appropriate to a newspaper editorial than to  a diplomatic document. "Nobody in our country would ever dream  of passing judgment on the conditions of legitimacy in which  public powers are exercised in the allied democracies -- even  less for the purposes of a domestic political struggle." This  latter was a spiteful reference -- the insinuation that the  French chief of state spoke mainly as the leader of a Socialist  Party defeated in the elections, divided, and in difficulties;  and that his aim was to hit the victorious French Right of  Edouard Balladur, much more than Berlusconi. The conclusion is  very terse, too: "Self-control and respect for others, however,  are virtues that demand reciprocity."    This was enough to make it clear that the wound inflicted by  the interview to the traditionally cordial relations between  Rome and Paris will be difficult to heal -- if not for French  diplomacy, then certainly for the Elysee Palace [French  president's office], at least until its incumbent changes next  year. Italian diplomatic circles yesterday evening were  wondering, entirely informally, whether the incident would have  repercussions in the coming weeks --which will bring some  important decisions for the future of the EC (starting with the  appointment of Delors' successor) -- on the two countries'  choice of alignment. Traditionally, it is Mitterrand who has  both formulated and represented France's European policy. And  in recent weeks the Berlusconi government has made it known that  Italy's traditional alliance with Paris and Bonn on the policy  of European federalism can no longer be taken for granted and  that Rome is paying increasing attention to London and to  Britain's ideas about the development of the European Union.    But this scenario has nothing to do with yesterday's  response  from the Palazzo Chigi. When the ANSA and AGI bulletins,  relaying the international agency reports, reached the Palazzo  Chigi at about 1900 hours yesterday, the ill feeling which  emerged did not concern European policy but probably related to  the much older issue of Berlusconi's and Fininvest's  unsuccessful attempts to extend their presence in French  television, frustrated (as in Britain) not only by rigid  antitrust laws but also by the explicit mistrust of the French  political world. Indeed, it was the thrust of Mitterrand's  accusations and anxieties that stung.    Indeed, the French president shifted the focus of the  polemics against the new Italian Government over the anxieties  repeatedly expressed on several sides in recent weeks concerning  the presence in it of Fascist ministers. On this point the  French president, while standing by his earlier statements,  seemed very prudent, ruled our any immediate threats, and  "placed his confidence in the Italian people."  <H5>  Unsure Ground </H5>   But Mitterrand sank his knife into a political area in which  the Berlusconi government feels much less secure and more  exposed. Italian legislation on television is already much more  accommodating to conglomerates, and Fininvest's hegemony has  already been the subject of criticisms. Mitterrand's anxieties  about his transfer to politics and then the government are  rekindling the most dangerous controversies in Italy which,  unlike those over the presence of National Alliance ministers,  involve even the majority forces -- more openly the League, less  explicitly the National Alliance.</p>

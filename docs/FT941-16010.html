			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Observer: Consumer Zen Hands up all those who thought 1993 was just as nasty, brutish and short as 1992. You were wrong, at least according to Dentsu, the Japanese advertising giant. It says the 'keyword' for 1993 was actually 'taking care' - though surely that's two words? Anyway, Dentsu's gurus reckon that last year Japanese getting and spending was dominated by 'being satisfied with yourself and your world, not being self-centred'. The taking care meant greater concern for 'nurturing your body', 'unwinding', 'cultivating bonds' (personal as opposed to financial), 'discovering connections' and going for 'quality at home' and 'convenience close at hand'. Dentsu's reasoning in this instance is based upon the list of 42 types of 'hit product' which went down well in Japan in 1993. But don't hold your breath; the list is a rather disappointing collection, including mineral water, dental mouthwash, carrot drinks, fashion sportswear, beer, deodorants, aerosol foot sprays and anything to do with Jurassic Park. Given that two of the other hits were 'power stones' and leather bracelets - both worn as lucky charms - consumers seem to have spent at least some of their time, as usual, in taking care to get ripped off.</p>

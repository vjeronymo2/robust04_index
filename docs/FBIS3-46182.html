The law, called "Joint Venture Act," contains several  amendments to a 1984 law on foreign investment bearing the same  title, and was adopted by the DPRK Parliament on January 20.    The law said that the DPRK Government is "especially"  interested in establishing joint ventures with foreign companies  or individuals with modern technology, highly competitive  products, infrastructure construction projects and scientific  and technological research programs.    The runner of the joint venture will be its owner and can  decide the company's policy independently.    The law also called on ethnic Koreans living outside DPRK to  invest in the country and said that preferential treatment will  be given to them in regard to taxes and land use.    There are now some 150 DPRK-foreign joint ventures in the  country and dozens of others abroad.</p>

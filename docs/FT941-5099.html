			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: ANA posts first loss for 22 years and cuts payout All Nippon Airways (ANA) yesterday said it would post a loss for the year ending this month - its first loss for 22 years - and cut its dividend. The Japanese carrier, hit by the continuing weak demand, expects a pre-tax loss of Y3bn (Dollars 28m), compared with a previously forecast pre-tax profit of Y6bn. Operating profits are revised down to Y769bn from an earlier forecast of Y782bn. The dividend is to be reduced to Y3 a share from the Y4 paid for 1992-93 when pre-tax profits totalled Y13.3bn. The airline said international and domestic businesses were down nearly 3 per cent, but it had been hurt most by the slump in the domestic market. Greater deregulation had enabled rival JAL to eat into the domestic market, ANA's stronghold, while the airline faced growing competition from other forms of transportation, such as fast-speed rail. Competition on international routes, where ANA has been building its presence since 1986, was fierce in the face of the spreading popularity of discount air fares. ANA's gloomy outlook reflects the pressures on Japanese airlines, which have been struggling to maintain profitability after a slowdown in air travel and increased competition from lower cost foreign airlines on international routes. In particular, the high costs of financing airports and airport development have been a large burden on Japanese airlines, which face some of the highest personnel costs in the world. ANA faces paying a high price for its ambitious expansion plans in the late 1980s, when Japan's economic prosperity seemed everlasting. In a reversal of those years, ANA, in common with other airlines, has been restructuring to achieve profits with lower growth. Japanese employment practice makes it difficult to make large cuts in costs through wide-scale redundancies. Instead, it is scaling back unprofitable routes and reducing maintenance costs. Capital investment in hotels and airport facilities is being cut back. The company was forced to sell aircraft in order to raise cash last year and may have to repeat that exercise this year.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : ALABAMA ALL SHOOK UP BUT NUMBINGLY DULL  </P> <P> It didn't seem a very fair trade: The Southland treated the members of Alabama  to what singer Randy Owen said was their first earthquake, and Alabama gave  Southern Californians just another numbingly dull show Friday evening at the  Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Despite recent new-traditionalist pretensions, the quartet continued to leech  the life and immediacy out of country music, leaving a treacly effluvium that  has more in common with disco than country. How close to country frankness and  raw roots could they come when they're performing amid flashing strobes and  pulsing synthesizers on a stage with a futuristic strip-mall-yogurt-shop look?  </P> <P> At its best -- as on "Love in the First Degree" and "Lady Down on Love" -- the  group turned in some well-crafted vocal harmonies, but the songs still sounded  like commercials for a very weak beer. At its worst, it offered "The  Borderline," a miniseries vision of a cowboy trail ballad devoid of grit and  feeling. Nowhere was the mediocrity of the band more evident than on the  encore, which included versions of "Land of 1,000 Dances" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's  "Sweet Home Alabama." Countless bar bands have played these songs, and most  could churn them out with more color and passion than Alabama. JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

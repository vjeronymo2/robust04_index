			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME, THE SPOTLIGHT IS UNCOMFORTABLY HOT;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: AHMAD N. BAYAA WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THE SEC SUIT FILED AGAINST HIM.  ALTHOUGH HIS COMPANY IS IN TROUBLE, BAYAA IS CONSIDERED A SHREWD BUSINESSMAN.  </P> <P> In August, 1988, Ahmad N. Bayaa was relishing the spotlight.  </P> <P> In a high-profile ceremony at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, the  then-35-year-old Palestinian businessman was wed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson to a  Jewish woman from Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Before 400 guests, Jackson praised the couple for transcending ethnic  prejudice, saying, "This marriage is America at its best" because it  "represents joy in Laguna, hope in the world."  </P> <P> The ceremony, a $50,000 affair that Bayaa said was something special he wanted  to do for his fiancee, was a living tribute to the Rainbow Coalition theme of  Jackson's presidential campaign.  </P> <P> Bayaa, a Long Beach resident and the president of Southland Communications Inc.  in Santa Ana, is in the media spotlight again. But this time, the ceremony of  the day isn't drawing any praises.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit against  Bayaa and securities broker Shaw Tehrani of Atlanta. The suit accuses the men  of conspiring, along with several of Bayaa's friends, to manipulate the stock  price of Southland Communications, also known as National Paging.  </P> <P> Through his attorney, Bayaa declined to comment on the action.  </P> <P> The lawsuit comes a little more than a month after the SEC stopped trading of  the firm's stock. That action came after the company's stock doubled in price  within a short period -- March 13 to April 3 -- despite the company's warning  in its first-quarter report that it might not be able continue much longer as a  going concern.  </P> <P> Bayaa, whose broad smile and thin mustache make him resemble the rock-star  Prince, is described by associates as a shrewd businessman. Despite a modest  $40,000 salary, he had expensive habits: he wore flashy $2,000 suits and drove  a Bentley.  </P> <P> When co-workers asked about the suits and fancy car, Bayaa would respond that  they were part of the trappings necessary to making sales to big companies and  courting rich Middle Eastern investors.  </P> <P> By Bayaa's account, he came to the United States penniless. His family was  originally from the city of Acre, near Haifa in Israel, but its members fled to  Jordan in 1948 after Israel became independent. The family later moved to Syria  and then to a refugee camp near Tripoli, Lebanon, before immigrating to the  United States.  </P> <P> Bayaa says he was graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a major in business  in 1975 and that in 1981 he launched Southland Communications, a family-run  company that employed two other brothers. The firm was taken public in 1987 by  K.A. Knapp &amp; Co., a firm later shut down for securities fraud and then  purchased in bankruptcy court by John Pehrson.  </P> <P> In mid-March, Bayaa said, he was seeking capital for his struggling paging firm  through a $5-million private placement of Southland stock with unnamed  investors. James J. Carroll III, Bayaa's attorney, said the discussions are  still continuing.  </P> <P> "He boasted a lot about contacts with oil money, but it was all show," said one  source, who asked not to be identified. "He was courteous and diplomatic,  though his English was a little broken. He drives a Bentley even though he  can't afford to be in a Volkswagen."  </P> <P> As a top executive, Bayaa has been described as the quintessential salesman, a  hard worker who frequently traveled abroad on business.  </P> <P> In a company newsletter in April, Bayaa wrote, perhaps prophetically: "Positive  motivation results in positive actions, and to me, that is the difference  between looking at something as a challenge instead of a problem. Problems  breed anxiety and fear becomes the motivator, inviting us to be more creative,  assertive and self-assured."  </P> <P> Despite the troubled status of Southland, Bayaa appeared comfortable with  keeping the company publicly held under family management.  </P> <P> Bayaa acknowledged in a recent interview that he and his older brother, Ziad  Bayaa, chief financial officer, sold more than $700,00 worth of stock before  February for personal reasons, but he said they have retained the bulk of their  holdings.  </P> <P> "We believe in this company for the long term," Ahmad Bayaa said.  </P> <P> In early April, after the SEC suspended trading of Southland's stock and  launched an investigation, Bayaa said he hoped the investigation would be quick  so he would be able to speak more freely about the performance of his  financially troubled company.  </P> <P> Asked whether he knew of any attempt to manipulate Southland's stock, Bayaa  grimaced and shook his head. Then, flashing a bright smile and recovering his  polite demeanor, he said: "Traders make markets. I sell pagers. I don't know  anything more than what I read in the newspapers."  </P> <P> Bayaa added that he was not aware of any company development that could have  prompted the trading frenzy in March and April that led to the trading  suspension.  </P> <P> He said that as far as he could tell, most of the trading apparently was  prompted by a short sale recommendation issued on March 2, but he said he did  not know who had written the report. Traders say the report was issued by  Pehrson.  </P> <P> The SEC charges in its suit that Bayaa, Tehrani and other friends of Bayaa  bought up large amounts of the thinly traded stock to thwart "short sellers"  who were attempting to profit from an expected drop in its price and that they  hoped to keep the stock price up long enough so that a private placement of  additional stock and an acquisition of another paging company could be  completed.  </P></p>

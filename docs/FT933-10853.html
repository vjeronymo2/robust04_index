			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Newspaper price war spreads to The Times THE TIMES yesterday threatened to extend a newspaper price-cutting war to the broadsheet end of the market by dropping its price by 15p to 30p from today in one English county. The experiment, restricted to the part of Kent outside the M25 London orbital road, is designed to test the conventional wisdom that price is not a significant factor in the sales of broadsheet newspapers. The price of the Saturday edition will also fall, from 50p to 35p. Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, yesterday said that if the experiment is successful 'we will either continue it or we will extend it'. The limited Times price cut is likely to be reviewed in September. It comes three weeks after The Sun - which, like The Times, is owned by News International - cut its price nationally by 5p to 20p. The Sun move, which will be reviewed at the end of the summer, has been a modest success with sales rising about 7 per cent. In a very different broadsheet market, Mr Stothard says he has a hunch that 'price may be more important than people conventionally think it is'. Mr Stothard, who emphasised that he was planning his experiment before The Sun's price cut, said: 'I think it is important to look occasionally at what is going on in the market and ask fundamental questions. This is one of those questions.' The move comes at a time of circulation decline for all the general broadsheets. In January The Daily Telegraph sold 1.035m a day, The Guardian 424,028, The Times 370,877 and The Independent 353,198. By June all had fallen, with The Daily Telegraph on 1.012m although it was pursuing an aggressive price policy at 48p, The Guardian at 406,627; The Times 362,428 and The Independent 338,828. The Independent, The Times and The Guardian all cost 45p. Mr Stothard, who says his readers write to complain about the price of the paper, hopes that readers in Kent who do not buy the paper every day will be encouraged to move to six days a week by the price cut. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, whose paper could be most seriously affected by any national cut in The Times's price, declined to comment last night other than to say: 'We will have to think about it.'</p>

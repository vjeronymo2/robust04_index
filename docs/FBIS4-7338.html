			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting  chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society,  in a telephone message today to Kang Yong-hun, president of  South Korean Red Cross, urged the South side to take a  humanitarian measure for Kim Chi-hyon and her brothers to  receive medical treatment and have their livelihood protected in  the North.    Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, a  soldier of the Korean People's Army who was arrested while  active in the Jirisan guerrilla force during the Fatherland  Liberation War and died after being released from prison where  he had spent long years, refusing to be converted.    She had her ribs cut off in an operation, attacked with  costal tuberculosis, but the inflammation has spread to the  region of the vertebra. So she is in a critical condition.    The telephone message said Kim Chi-hyon has no family and  relatives who can look after her at sickbed and no patrons who  can take care of her younger brothers in the South. The only  way of saving her is to bring her to the northern half of the  country where free medical care is in force, the message noted,  and continued:    We notify your Red Cross that if there is a problem of  hospital fees and money for medicine and medical treatment which  she has not paid yet, we are willing to pay them in her place.    The North and the South are in relations of confrontation  which are abnormal politically and militarily. But  humanitarianism of Red Cross is a most noble universal idea  transcending the concept of confronting parties and of friend  and foe. So we believe your side will accept our proposal with  good will.    We hope your Red Cross will take an appropriate measure so  that our proposal based on human and compatriotic love may be  realised at an early date.</p>

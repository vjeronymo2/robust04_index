			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVEL RUNOFF FEE SOUGHT TO CLEAN SANTA MONICA BAY  </P> <P> A new financing plan, charging fees to homeowners and businesses for their  pollution, was proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday to clean up one of the  worst sources of Santa Monica Bay contamination -- runoff from streets,  sidewalks, parking lots and other paved and built-over areas.  </P> <P> The proposal was announced at a City Hall press conference by Bradley and other  Los Angeles city officials. The plan was developed by city public works  officials and aides to the mayor and Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> Runoff of rain and other water polluted by street, motor vehicle and animal  waste and other urban grime is one of the two biggest polluters of Santa Monica  Bay, a body of water that provides recreation to hundreds of thousand of people  each year. The other is sewage treated at the city's Hyperion plant. The  quality of that plant's treatment, under a court order from the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, has improved sharply recently.  </P> <P> Under the runoff treatment financing plan, special taxing districts would be  created by the City Council, in which property owners would be assessed to  finance new facilities to clean up the filthy water before it hits the bay.  </P> <P> Officials said that if the City Council approved a $20-million-a-year runoff  cleanup program the average fee per single-family home would be about $9 a  year, with significantly higher rates for commercial and industrial landowners.  </P> <P> That would be on top of an average residential sewage service charge of $125 a  year financing a huge reconstruction and modernization of the city sewer  system. By 1994, that charge will rise to $277 annually.  </P> <P> Robert S. Horii, who heads the city Bureau of Engineering, said such facilities  could cost "hundreds of millions" of dollars.  </P> <P> Bradley said design work will begin immediately on two pilot projects aimed at  determining the cost and effectiveness of various cleanup methods. One will be  at Ballona Creek in Marina del Rey, the city's worst source of runoff  pollution. The other will control runoff at Venice's Brooks Avenue drain, a big  source of pollution at Venice Beach.  </P> <P> The special taxing areas, called benefit assessment districts, have been used  for years to put up street lighting and make other civic improvements. They do  not require votes by affected property owners.  </P> <P> What is unique about this plan, city officials said, is that the taxes would be  levied according to the amount of asphalt or concrete, or buildings, on a  property. Such covering prevents storm water from percolating into the soil.  </P> <P> Thus owners of a building surrounded by a huge parking lot would pay more than  one encompassed by lawn.  </P> <P> And fees would be lowered if property owners found ways to reduce their runoff  by such methods as planting patches of grass and shrubs in paved areas. These  rewards would apply to homeowners as well as to owners of commercial property.  </P> <P> "It is feasible to establish a fee structure that would provide incentive for  property owners to design methods of water harvesting (collection and storage  of rainwater for irrigation), greenbelts, detention basins, intensified surface  cleaning or other techniques to inhibit flow and reduce pollution," city  officials said in a summary of the plan presented to reporters.  </P> <P> Announcement of the plan followed a decision by the EPA several months ago that  local governments would have to clean up runoff pollution. But while the EPA  found such pollution a threat, and promised to finance research, the federal  agency made it clear that Washington could not supply the massive amounts of  money needed to control runoff.  </P> <P> Environmentalists, who have clashed with Bradley over bay pollution in the  past, said they are pleased by the plan.  </P> <P> "I am very proud to be part of the city now," said Dorothy Green of Save the  Bay, an organization that has led the fight to force government to clean up the  bay.  </P> <P> Catherine Tyrell, director of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, said  "it's up to us to finance" the cleanup efforts and "this seems like one  innovative way to do it. It really seems like it would work."  </P> <P> John Stodder, Bradley's top environmental aide, said the benefit assessment  districts have financed similar cleanup projects in Bellevue, Wash., and small  cities in Florida. But he said this is the first time such an approach has been  proposed for a big city.  </P> <P> Two members of the City Council supported the plan. They were Zev Yaroslavsky  and Ruth Galanter, who represent Westside areas near the bay.  </P> <P> But Bradley will have to muster his political skills to push the measure  through the 15-member council. Increasing the sewer service charged passed the  council on a bare 8-7 vote in May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooperation Needed  </P> <P> In addition, Stodder said, cooperation will be needed from county and state  officials for a successful runoff cleanup campaign.  </P> <P> Many streets and highways, for example, are under county and state jurisdiction  and would have to share in the cleanup costs.  </P> <P> One of the pilot projects announced by the mayor would involve installation of  an inflatable rubber dam across Ballona Creek. Water would be screened to  remove waste and then the water would be disinfected. Officials said the  cleansed water could be used to irrigate the nearby Ballona Wetlands.  </P> <P> The other proposal would shift water from the Brooks Avenue drain in Venice,  where it now flows directly onto the beach, into the Thornton Avenue drain,  where it would be cleaned.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS BILL TO PUT TEETH INTO RESTRAINING ORDERS  </P> <P> An Assembly committee on Tuesday approved legislation intended to prevent  domestic violence by requiring police to respond quickly to threats against  people who have restraining orders protecting them from harassment.  </P> <P> The bill, approved by the Public Safety Committee, was prompted by the killings  of Maria Navarro and three other women in East Los Angeles last year. The women  were slain minutes after Navarro called the 911 emergency line to request  police protection because she had been warned that her estranged husband was on  his way to her home and had threatened to kill her.  </P> <P> The sheriff's dispatcher told Navarro that there was nothing police could do  until the man arrived at her house. The next call from the home was from  someone reporting that four women, including Navarro, had been fatally shot.  </P> <P> The intent of the bill is to give teeth to the court-approved restraining  orders that women such as Navarro obtain to protect themselves from others,  usually husbands or boyfriends, who have threatened them, Assemblyman Patrick  Nolan (R-Glendale) said.  </P> <P> "Women receive these orders thinking they are receiving protection, but they're  only worth the paper they're printed on," said Nolan, author of the Assembly  bill.  </P> <P> There are 40,000 restraining orders outstanding in Los Angeles County alone,  said CarolAnn Peterson, a consultant to the California Assn. of Business and  Professional Women. But Peterson said police in Los Angeles and elsewhere do  not do enough to enforce those orders.  </P> <P> "Victims of violence have been abandoned by the legal system that was designed  to protect them," Peterson said.  </P> <P> Under Nolan's bill, police and sheriff's departments would have to prioritize  the kind of calls received and rank among the most important domestic-violence  calls from women who have protective orders. "This is not just someone calling  and saying, 'Gee, I think I'm in danger,' " Nolan said. "This is someone who  already has convinced a court that they are in danger."  </P> <P> Nolan originally proposed requiring departments to give domestic violence calls  priority "over other requests for assistance where violence has occurred." But  on Tuesday he amended the bill to allow police to delay their response if other  calls they are handling are more important.  </P> <P> The amendments were aimed at winning support from the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department, which has defended its action in the Navarro case and  opposed Nolan's bill. The department has said it would be overwhelmed if it  responded to every call it gets from people who feel threatened.  </P> <P> Deputy Sheriff John T. Cleary said the department may support the amended bill.  "We just felt that (the original bill) took a lot of discretion away from us,"  Cleary said.  </P></p>

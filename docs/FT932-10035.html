			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink for USM with Pounds 40m tag FINDING THE metaphorical needle in a haystack must often seem easier than retrieving information from an on-line database. The search techniques used by most commercial operators leave a lot to be desired. This suggests that PhoneLink, a three-year old computing services company based on Merseyside, should warrant the gratitude of information users when it floats on the Unlisted Securities Market. PhoneLink has developed a novel method of finding stored information which promises hitherto unheard of speed and simplicity. It is already finding support in the database industry. Among the suppliers who have agreed to provide electronic information to run on PhoneLink's computers are the Automobile Association, British Rail, Ordnance Survey and the Royal Mail. British Telecom will market its method of extracting telephone numbers from its database as a service called BT Teledirectory, at present on trial with some of BT's large users. IBM, the market leader in personal computers, has reached agreement in principle to build special terminals and to incorporate PhoneLink's software into its personal computers. Some 25 per cent of the company is expected to be floated through a placing sponsored by Allied Provincial Securities. The aim is to raise about Pounds 12m to continue the development and marketing of key technologies. At the placing price, the company is expected to be capitalised at about Pounds 40m. PhoneLink is the creation of Mr Trevor Burke and his wife Heather. Their previous companies, Technique, which marketed computer-aided design software for kitchen manufacturers and Profile UK, which supplied building industries with planning application details, were sold to help launch the new company. Its business case lies in its claim to be able to do simply and cheaply what is at present difficult and expensive. PhoneLink's method is called Tel-Me; it makes use of a swathe of technologies including artificial intelligence and parallel computing. Among its advantages, according to Mr Burke, is that costs per inquiry will be lower than other UK on-line information services. Typically, a complete enquiry, including connection time, should be processed within 15 seconds. The use of software predictive techniques may mean that the right answer is on the computer screen before the customer has finished typing in the enquiry. The Burkes envisage customers using Tel-Me to retrieve information from a parcel of databases. A salesperson, for example, might investigate the most effective routes between calls, check on hotels in the area and look at news stories on prospective clients.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The inter-Korean working contact held in Panmunjom  today ruptured in about 50 minutes from the start of the talks.    The inter-Korean working contact for the exchange of special  envoys ruptured at 1055 [0155 GMT], less than one hour after the  contact began. The two sides did not even set the date for the  next contact.    The eighth working contact for the inter-Korean exchange of  special envoys began with acute conflict of positions between  the two sides. Our side, in a keynote statement, urged the  North side to come to the working contact for envoy exchange and  to agree on the written agreement for envoy exchange at an early  date, and warned that the South side cannot be held responsible  for the development of the situation henceforth due to the North  side's rejection of nuclear inspections. Our side also strongly  demanded that the North side immediately stop the slander and  vilification against the person in our highest authority and  cease antigovernment agitations.    At this, the North side attributed the failure to realize  the  envoy exchange to the South side's attitude and claimed that the  four demands the North side has put forward are completely  justified in view of the prevailing situation. The North side  said that it cannot but gravely regard the South side's leading  the inter-Korean relations to a phase of confrontation, and  threatened that conflict arising therefrom will lead to war.    The North side said that it will respond to dialogue with  dialogue and to war with war and that it is prepared to take all  necessary steps, and declared that if the South side wishes to  part from the North, the South side should clearly say so.

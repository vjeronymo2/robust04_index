Guidelines are described in the ``Invitation for Original Concept Papers'' section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all cases, applicants should demonstrate an understanding of and commitment to the Corporation's mission and goals, a need that relates to that mission and goals, a sound plan for accomplishing the activity, and a fulfillment of the selection criteria listed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public agencies (including federal, state, and local agencies and other units of government), non-profit organizations (including youth-serving groups, community-based organizations, service organizations, etc.), institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and for-profit companies are eligible to apply.

Pursuant to the National and Community Service Trust act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, the administration of these grants transferred to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation for National and Community Service. Existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical assistance grantees interested in the continuation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding or undertaking new technical assistance activities may submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive applications in accordance with the applicable due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates and activities described in this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives of the Training and Technical Assistance Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of training and technical assistance is to improve the ability of AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and participants to ``get things done'' by achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct and demonstrable results in communities, fostering civic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility, and strengthening the ties that bind communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together. To best support programs, the Corporation will fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical assistance that strengthens program performance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness in the short term and builds leadership and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent resources in the long term. Technical assistance must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be relevant to program needs, responsive to changing needs, and easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessed by states and grantees. Training and technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance providers will build a strong infrastructure by_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Increasing the effectiveness and capacity of programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Increasing the resources available to support high quality work; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Developing leaders at all levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training and technical assistance providers will also foster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a national identity and common understanding of the goals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mission of national service among AmeriCorps participants, programs, and states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Corporation is committed to strengthening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service nationwide. Although technical assistance providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should show preference to AmeriCorps program grantees (except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where activities pertain to Learn and Serve grantees), T/TA providers may be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to serve those who wish to become grantees as well. (For more on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this, see ``Requirements'' section below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These principles guide the Corporation's technical assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Treat technical assistance as a full partnership among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, states, and programs, with roles for all in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designing and delivering technical assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Encourage collaboration among partners, especially efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that team service programs and those experienced in working in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _``Train the trainers''_focus on developing resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity in local areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Instead of repeating the excellent work of others, build  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on existing training, materials, and expertise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Focus on the most pressing needs to have the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Invest sufficiently to provide adequate technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance support in the first years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Application Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications can be of two kinds as specified: full proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and concept papers. While many of the same elements will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in these two types of applications, proposals ask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants to give a much more comprehensive and detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overview of planned activities, organizational capacity, budget,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and workplan than do concept papers. After reviewing concept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> papers, the Corporation may ask for full proposals from a select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of applicants based on program need, availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, and the strength of concept paper ideas received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where specified, a full proposal should be submitted for each activity, unless the proposal thoughtfully combines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities into a single coordinated initiative. A full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal must include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A cover page listing: the title of the organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying; the amount of funds requested; a brief summary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed T/TA program or activity; the name, address, phone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number, and fax number of the organization; and the name and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title of a contact person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A narrative of no more than 10 double-spaced typed pages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 12-point font, describing_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The scope of activity being proposed, e.g., number of trainers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hired and programs served by them, relative to the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant requested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

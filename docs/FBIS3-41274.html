			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["(hop)"-signed report: "Drugs Are Mainly Smuggled Across </F> the Czech Republic"]    [Text] Prague -- "The Czech Republic is far behind  advanced Western countries in drug use," declared Interior  Minister Jan Ruml. "Nevertheless, we rank among the countries  across which narcotic substances are smuggled. At the same  time, I do not deny that, to a certain extent, we are also one  of the target and production countries but certainly not to the  same extent as Western European states. It is our duty to  prevent a drug environment being created in our country."    This was the interior minister's reaction to the recent  statement by Council of Europe Secretary General Catherine  Lalumiere that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  provide a suitable setting for the activities of various  narcotics mafias.    According to our information, 18.5 kilograms of heroin, just  under 5.0 kilograms of cocaine, 3.0 kilograms of morphine, 7.0  kilograms of hashish, and 7.0 kilograms of amphetamines were  seized in our country last year. Some 149 Czech citizens and 21  foreign nationals were arrested for producing, smuggling, and  distributing narcotic and psychotropic substances. Operation  Bumerang, directed against pervitin producers in the capital and  in the Kladno region, was one of the most successful police  interventions in 1993.    Some 31 Czech citizens were investigated abroad last year  for  drug smuggling. The largest haul--47 kilograms of heroin--was  found on a Czech citizen in Amsterdam in May. Two Czech drug  traffickers, who tried to smuggle high-quality Asian heroin from  Turkey to Western Europe last year, are now awaiting trial in a  Bulgarian prison. The payment for such a risky journey is  between $10,000 and $20,000.</p>

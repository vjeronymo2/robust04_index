Final  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES;  </P> <P> U.S. WORLD CUP TEAM CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Franz Beckenbauer today criticized U.S. preparations for this year's World Cup  and dismissed as "pure speculation" suggestions that he might take a job with  the U.S. Soccer Federation after the tournament ends.  </P> <P> Beckenbauer, who played for the New York Cosmos in the late 1970s, will quit as  West German team chief at the end of the World Cup after six years in charge.  </P> <P> Beckenbauer had scathing words about the organization of the current U.S. team,  trounced 5-1 Sunday by Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> "They'll have to start reorganizing and building up or they will experience the  same debacle in four years as here."  </P></p>

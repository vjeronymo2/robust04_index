			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Call for more local councils in Wales THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Welsh district councils to increase the number of unitary authorities for Wales under its plans for local government reorganisation. The Welsh Office has set out in a white paper its intention to have 21 new authorities in place by April 1995, replacing the current two-tier structure of eight county and 37 district councils. But the Council of Welsh Districts argues in its interim response to the white paper that the number should be increased to 27 to improve the community basis of the new authorities. In particular, the council points out that the single unitary authority proposed for Powys would cover a quarter of the land mass of Wales and be twice the area of any other authority. Overall, the CWD supports the white paper. It believes a single tier of authorities 'will dramatically increase the understanding of local government'. It says there has been a full and open process of consultation 'which compares favourably with the parallel process of the Local Government Commission in England'. The CWD estimates that fewer than 1,000 council workers' posts will disappear under the reorganisation, out of the 150,000 in Welsh local government. It believes the transitional costs of the reform will be paid back in less than five years.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Railtrack to clarify pay package Railtrack is to clarify and may revise its productivity pay package for signalling staff, the company said yesterday as it claimed that nearly 20 per cent of Britain's 10,000-mile rail network was open on the fourth one-day signallers' strike. It said the move was in response to suggestions from staff who have responded to the company's 'hearts and minds' campaign launched last weekend. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said the support for the strike yesterday indicated that the men had 'given Railtrack's latest offer the thumbs-down'. Support for yesterday's strike - the fourth on consecutive Wednesdays - appeared to be solid. Further one-day strikes are scheduled for the next two Wednesdays, with the threat of two-day a week strikes after July 24. The company seems to believe that it can go over the heads of the RMT and convince staff that the tentative offer on the bargaining table can meet their grievances. A Railtrack official said: 'If we cannot negotiate with their union, at least we can negotiate direct with the signalling staff.' The company is keen, in particular, to reassure signalling staff who face cuts in pre-tax pay as a result of efficiency savings that they will receive substantial compensation payments. In response to public pressure from MPs on the cross-party Commons employment committee, Railtrack's chairman Mr Robert Horton met Mr Knapp yesterday. In a joint statement after their two-hour meeting in London the two men said they had 'exchanged views and agreed to reflect on what was said'. British Rail yesterday ran a more comprehensive service than on any of the previous strike days, with between 1,700 and 1,750 trains in operation. Private companies ran significant freight services for the first time with trains moving aggregates between the Mendips and London. Passenger services operated for the first time from London Victoria and Waterloo stations. Traffic into London and other large cities was light, as motorists staggered journeys to avoid congestion. West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority is likely to withhold Pounds 2m from Regional Railways Central - 40 per cent of the subsidy to the train operating company for running services during the quarter to June. Centro, the authority's operating arm, said that since the break-up of the industry on April 1 'only 60.5 per cent of Centro subsidised services on seven local lines ran to within three minutes of timetable'.</p>

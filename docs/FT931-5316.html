			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: A day for the Dunkirk spirit Sir, The FT calls it Black Wednesday, Sir Denys Henderson insists that it was Sunny Wednesday, and others describe it as Golden, White or Wise. It was a retreat from an ill-prepared venture into Europe. It caused much financial bloodshed among those directly involved and those who gave support from Britain. It was technically a defeat, but was soon celebrated as a triumph. It enabled this country to recover, and, we hope, go on to win the economic war. It has, of course, to be Dunkirk Wednesday.

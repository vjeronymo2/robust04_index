			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Sport: Marathon which drove to the limit - Rallying IN THE END, the London to Sydney rally was a marathon fully deserving of the name. It evolved, over 30 days and 11,500 miles of some of the world's roughest and most remote roads and dirt tracks, from a tough but conventional rally into a sometimes harrowing test not just of driving skills but of endurance and the will to succeed, or even survive. En route, most notably in its 1,200 miles traverse of the bedlam which envelops even the most rural of India's roads, it descended occasionally into the stuff of nightmare. The 'sting in the tail', 3,700 miles across Australia where hazards covered the spectrum from choking dust to blinding blizzards, confirmed that it is an event deserving a place in motor sport history. That 86 cars out of the 106 which set out from London on April 17 on the Lombard Marathon made it across the finishing line at Sydney Opera House on Sunday might give the appearance that it was easy - at least in comparison with the original 1968 event, whose 25th anniversary this marathon commemorated. In 1968, only half the starters managed to stagger into Sydney. But in reality, the 1993 event 'has been 100 times more competitive than the 1968 version,' according to the 1993 director, Nick Brittan who competed on the original marathon. In 1968 the marathon was mainly a test of stamina. It took just 11 days to complete. This year it took 30. In 1968 a competitor who developed a problem could not stay up with the event and simply fell by the wayside. The 1993 marathon stopped each night to avoid having a bunch of fatigued and semi-comatose rally drivers hurtling across continents for days and nights on end. That in turn has allowed a benevolent rally rule that, provided a competing car can roll across the start line each day, it can be deemed a finisher. A close look at the results reveals the full story: Francis Tuthill and Anthony Showell, the deserving British winners in their Porsche 911, incurred time penalties of 13 hours, 36 minutes and 11 seconds during this odyssey. Second-placed Ian Vaughan, a vice-president of Ford Australia, and co-driver Barry Lake were 14 minutes and 20 seconds behind in their Ford Falcon. Even Daily Mail photographer Neville Marriner and I only incurred a total of five hours' more penalties in bringing home our Unipart-backed Lotus Cortina 36th. By 50th place, penalties were measured not in hours but in days. The last classified finishers, Australians Les and Roselee Johnson in their Ford Mustang, incurred penalties of more than three days and nine hours. For these, and many others, the closing stages were not a fight to the finish against other drivers but a fight merely to finish, trying to hold together cars deranged by the constant batterings of rough special stages, often taken at 100 mph-plus, or damaging off-track excursions into rocks or trees. Lawrie Beach and Jim Rosenow had become Australian heroes by the time the marathon had carved its way across the Nullarbor Plain and the worst of the outback. Purely privateers and with no significant sponsorship, they had carved their way to third place overall in their Ford Falcon. On the penultimate day, their rear axle broke. They repaired it. on the final stage of the final day the differential broke. They finished in 55th place - on a towrope. Not once did their composure or the good humour falter. In contrast, we became almost embarrased by the reliability of the Unipart car. We had started out calling it derisorily the Pompidou centre because of its roof-mounted exhaust and other external pipework - and finished up fondly calling it the 'old girl'. Over all 11,500 miles, despite crashing once into rocks and once into the trees, plus several other minor excursions, damage was confined to four exploded tyres. Otherwise we merely changed oil, filters and other mundane items. The casualties were not only mechanical. There was a disclaimer attached to every competitor's dog tags reminding us that 'motor sport is dangerous'. For Jenny Brittan, wife of the organiser, and herself a respected former racing driver, the caution became reality in an accident on a stage between Port Augusta and Broken Hill, when the Escort she was driving with David Thomas hit a tree and rolled itself into a ball. Jenny broke five ribs. By the time we reached Sydney four lives had been lost. Australian co-driver Brian Ginger died in a road accident in Turkey. Basil Wadman, co-driver to Tony King in their Hillman Hunter, suffered badly from severe food poisoning as the marathon wound its way through the 50` heat of the Rajasthan desert. He reached Udaipur in a state of collapse and died after 12 hours in a Delhi hospital. Basil did not have my good fortune in being detected, in similar state, by nurse Jill Diamond, also competing, as our cars stopped together at petrol pumps. She wrapped me in rags for an 800 km drive to Bombay in scorching heat, and had Neville keep drenching me in water as he drove. Drifting in and out of consciousness by the time we reached Bombay, and barely aware of being lifted out of the car, where I was doubly fortunate to fall straight into the hands of Dr Rosemary Nixon, another competitor. It was in India, too, that two young spectators lost their lives. Had this happened in eastern Europe or Turkey, the scene of some earlier irresponsible driving, the marathon could well have been plunged into crisis. I hope, as do many of the other drivers, that it will be a long time indeed before I drive again in a country where, even Indian officials acknowledge, there is a fatality every 70 kilometres of the Udaipur to Bombay road - on every single day. In all other respects, this marathon has proved to be an event unique in its format and extraordinary in the variety of images and experiences thrust before its competitors' eyes. The 50th anniversary Marathon would be in 2018. Mr Brittan, my entry cheque is in the post.</p>

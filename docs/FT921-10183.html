			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / SFO chief Barbara Mills to become new DPP MRS BARBARA MILLS QC, director of the Serious Fraud Office, is to be the new director of public prosecutions. Mrs Mills, 51, the first woman to hold the office, replaces Sir Allan Green QC, who resigned in October after he was stopped by police for alleged kerb crawling in the red-light district of King's Cross, London. Announcing the appointment three months after Sir Patrick Mayhew QC, the attorney general, decided to advertise the Pounds 77,000-a-year post for the first time, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that Mrs Mills would take up her job after her successor at the SFO had been appointed. In a brief statement issued by her office, Mrs Mills said: 'I am honoured to have been appointed as DPP. I have a very high regard for the work of the CPS and am proud to have been chosen to head it.' Mrs Mills said that she was sorry to be leaving the SFO, which had proved itself to be a valuable part of England's prosecution structure. She leaves the SFO after only 18 months, at a time when it is facing mounting criticism for its handling of the alleged conspiracy arising out of the 1987 failed Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights issue. Her successor, who will be the SFO's third head in its 3 1/2 -year history, will inherit three of the biggest fraud investigations undertaken: the collapse of the Polly Peck fruit and electronics empire; the Bank of Credit and Commerce International; and the Maxwell empire. Her move also comes at a difficult time for the CPS, which is under scrutiny by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice which was set up after the release of the Birmingham Six last year. The commission is expected to recommend an enhanced role for the CPS in overseeing police investigations. Her appointment was welcomed by solicitors and barristers. The Bar Council said that she was the right person to carry on the task begun by Sir Allan of enhancing the morale and standing of the CPS.

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / New opposition leader for Japan THE Social Democratic party, Japan's largest opposition party, yesterday chose Mr Sadao Yamahana as its new chairman, prompting criticism from the party's younger members who think him incapable of introducing much-needed reforms. Mr Yamahana, 56, vowed to change 'my party and the political system', but similar promises were made by his ineffective predecessor, Mr Makoto Tanabe, who resigned after criticism that he did not attack the failings of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Younger party members had hoped for a more radical appointment, and some left-wing officials had wanted Ms Takako Doi to return to the post she vacated for Mr Tanabe after admitting that she, too, had failed to make the party a genuine alternative to the LDP. The SDPJ, formerly the Japan Socialist party, has been unable to capitalise on the scandals afflicting the LDP, even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has a popularity rating of only 14 per cent. Mr Yamahana is said to be from the party's 'soft left' and agrees with plans to reform unpopular policies, such as denying the existence of the defence forces and supporting the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung. He is also in favour of developing a coherent economic policy in the hope of reassuring voters that the party could lead the country out of recession. However, for the past year Mr Yamahana has been secretary general, the party's number two post, and there was little sign that he was spearheading a reform programme deferred for more than a decade. On hearing of Mr Yama-hana's elevation, Mr Miyazawa noted his opponent's oratorical skills and suggested that he had taken on a heavy responsibility. Other opposition party leaders said the new chairman must work with them against the LDP.</p>

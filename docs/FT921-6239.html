			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fishermen face stringent curbs THE BRITISH government is to introduce a scheme to decommission surplus fishing boats at the cost of Pounds 25m and to cut Britain's fishing effort to preserve stocks, writes James Buxton. The scheme is a significant U-turn for the government, which has repeatedly argued that decommissioning would be difficult to administer and open to abuse. The government will pay to remove fishing boats from the fleet over two years, with the European Community contributing 50 to 70 per cent of the cost. Fish producers' organisations, which are made up of fishermen, will be allowed to buy and sell fishing quotas and buy out members who want to leave the industry. Under new licensing arrangements, a reduction in capacity will be achieved when licenses change hands, and licensing is to be extended to boats of under 10 metres in length. There will be further reductions in the number of days boats can spend at sea beginning in 1993. Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said yesterday: 'You need something of this toughness if you really are going to tackle the problem of depleted stocks'.</p>

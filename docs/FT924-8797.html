			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (6): Bid to tackle the jobless crisis - Unemployment THE maintenance of full employment is no longer the first priority of Sweden's economic policymakers. Few may be ready to admit it in public but, ever since October 1990 when the then ruling Social Democrats introduced a crisis package to reverse a dramatic outflow of capital from the country, it has become increasingly apparent that the conquest of inflation and defence of the krona's fixed exchange rate are regarded as more urgent objectives, writes Robert Taylor. But this does not mean that Swedes are willing to sit passively and watch an inexorable rise in their registered unemployment total to the current European Community average of just under 10 per cent. On the contrary; even during the marathon all-party negotiations in September on the bipartisan crisis package, all the country's party leaders (even the conservative Mr Bildt) recognised further financial resources were needed to counter the threat of soaring joblessness this winter. Indeed, in the current financial year which ends next July Sweden's labour market board (Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen or AMS) - the public body responsible for the employment services - has been allocated SKr30bn to spend, nearly double the SKr19bn it received in 1991-1992. 'We are getting all the financial resources we need. In fact I'm really worried about whether we will be able to make good use of all the money,' admits Mr Gote Berhardsson, AMS's general director. He takes a gloomy, if realistic, view of what will happen to Sweden's labour market over the next few years. 'The 1993-94 financial year will be worse than this year,' he says. AMS estimates that the registered unemployment total will have reached 9 per cent by next autumn. The number of long-term jobless (defined as those registered without work for more than six months) will climb to 100,000 next year from 62,000 at the moment. AMS reckons that nearly 500,000 jobs will have vanished from the Swedish labour market between the start of 1991 and the end of 1993. It estimates 50,000 jobs will be lost in manufacturing next year, which is a further 6 per cent fall, cutting the labour force in that sector to 850,000. On top of this, AMS forecasts that 35 per cent of Sweden's construction workers will be jobless by next winter. In the past the country's service sector has provided a way out by increasing job opportunities, but not any more. Even Sweden's huge public services will be shedding labour over the coming months with around 45,000 jobs expected to go next year while job losses in the private services sector look set to accelerate to 60,000. Mr Berhardsson stresses that AMS alone is incapable of solving the growing unemployment crisis. 'We can't take on the responsibility for bringing back full employment.' He argues that it is up to the government to pursue a growth strategy that will create more jobs. He believes his organisation can deal with up to 3.5 per cent of the entire workforce but next year AMS is being asked to cater for as many as 0.25m people, which is 5 per cent. AMS was established as a public agency in the early 1950s. It had been seen as an instrument to lubricate the tight labour market by providing training and education programmes that give workers new skills so they can adapt to technological change. As such, it has won an international reputation, though few other countries have really copied the AMS system. Now, however, AMS must deal with a growing jobless crisis, of a magnitude which Sweden has not experienced for more than 60 years. But AMS is no part of the country's social services. It remains a commercially driven organisation, not a relief agency which has been given the thankless task of containing the rise in the country's unemployment. At present AMS is spending about 30 per cent of its budget in paying unemployment benefit to the registered jobless, a proportion of its allocation that Mr Berhardsson for one believes is much too high. Traditionally AMS has concentrated its resources on active, not passive, labour market activities or on the placement and counselling services for those either without work seeking a new job or wishing to change their employment. Lutheran Sweden takes a traditionally harsh view of the work-shy and it applies stiff work availability tests for those who find themselves without a job. Indeed, AMS is prepared to use coercive methods if necessary to encourage shirkers to go on a training course or take a place on a work experience scheme. At the moment it is estimated that 97,000 Swedes are on training courses, which last for six months. A further 46,500 Swedes aged between 18 and 24 are taking advantage of a new AMS scheme that began this September which provides them with work experience for six months mainly with small private sector companies. The number of places on the scheme will rise to 72,000 in 1993. Participants are paid an allowance equal to the benefit they would receive if unemployed but Mr Berhardsson insists it is not a form of job substitution. On top of this, AMS has a further 40,000 Swedes carrying out relief work mainly for local authorities. Already AMS's emergency action has had an impact on the aggregate numbers out of work. In September those recorded as unemployed (who were seeking work actively) fell to 5.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent in August. But it is estimated that as many as 11 per cent of workers now lie outside Sweden's normal labour market, either unemployed or being covered by AMS schemes, and that figure looks set to rise to 15 per cent during 1993. The financial support being given to Sweden's labour market services by the government indicates that politicians are keen to minimise the social and economic damage caused by unemployment. Nonetheless, the overall statistics suggest Sweden can no longer claim to be an exception to other western European economies. Like them, it is also having to deal with a jobless crisis that no amount of training and education alone can disguise for long.</p>

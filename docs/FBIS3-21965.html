			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kassel/Friedberg -- The police in Hesse reported  two successes in the fight against drug-related crime today. In  Kassel, criminal officers seized over 8 kg of heroin with a  street value of between 10 and 20 million German marks and  arrested three suspects. In Friedberg in Hesse and in Arhus in  Denmark, a six-member drug ring was smashed that smuggled about  one-half tonne of hashish to Denmark.    As the police announced in Kassel, the heroin was discovered  after the arrest of a Belgian drug courier in a tire that had  been thrown away. In the man's car, the police first found 1.1  kg of drugs. It is believed that an accomplice of the Belgian  wanted to take the tire, but threw it away while trying to  escape.    The arrest of the German-Danish drug gang, which took place  as early as on 9 March, was preceded by month-long  investigations. Those detained included a 50-year-old Danish  woman who traveled to her home country from Friedberg every two  weeks since the middle of 1993, smuggling 25 kg of hashish  during every trip, the police announced. The recipients were  serious criminals in the rocker scene.</p>

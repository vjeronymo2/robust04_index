			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Rabin rejects PLO's terms for talks: Hebron violence worsens as Israeli troops shoot dead two Palestinians Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday rejected demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for resuming peace talks as violence flared again in the occupied territories in protest at last Friday's massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. Israeli troops shot dead at least two Palestinians and wounded some 60 others in confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Palestinians said the violence in Hebron, where one Arab youth was killed, was more serious than the unrest that broke out after the massacre in the town. In Washington, President Clinton urged Palestinians not to abandon the peace talks, saying to reject negotiations would 'hand a victory to the extremists'. Diplomatic attempts to close the gap between the PLO and Israel intensified yesterday. Mr Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister who is leading an EU effort to revive the peace negotiations, held talks in Tunis with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, before heading for Israel with what diplomats described only as 'some ideas'. Mr Igor Ivanov, deputy Russian foreign minister, also headed separately for talks in Israel after meeting the Palestinian leader. Despite Israeli and US opposition, international support appeared to be growing yesterday for the deployment of an international force in the territories to protect Palestinians. Mr Rabin stressed that the tragedy should not be used by the PLO as an excuse for trying to put the issue of settlements on the negotiating agenda. Instead, he said, the violence of the past six days should refocus both sides on the necessity for finalising an agreement on Palestinian self-rule. Mr Arafat yesterday restated PLO demands for returning to peace talks: the deployment of an international force in the territories to safeguard Palestinian lives, the dismantling of some extremist settlements and the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin, however, said his government would not discuss settlements and settlers because the Declaration of Principles signed last September had specifically left these matters to later talks. On the issue of the deployment of an international force Mr Rabin said he had agreed to an 'international presence' but not an 'international force presence'. Officials said the prime minister had in mind a small group of observers for Gaza-Jericho only, and not for the rest of the West Bank. Talks meanwhile continued at the UN on the text of a proposed resolution which diplomats said had been sent to Tunis for consideration by Mr Arafat. Russian backing for an international force would present difficulties for Mr Rabin. Russia remains a co-sponsor with the US of the Middle East peace process. Mr Rabin said yesterday disagreement between the two co-sponsors could be exploited by the enemies of peace.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW INTERACTIVE VIDEO DISC LETS VIEWERS RUN THE SHOW  </P> <P> The future is here. It's called interactive video, and it's an innovative  application of laser-disc technology that allows viewers to get inside films,  art and news events as never before.  </P> <P> According to the current issue of Video Magazine, this video innovation may  mean an end to people passively absorbing programming.  </P> <P> Interactivity means that viewers have choices -- they can continue watching  what passes before them or they can leave the narration and delve into material  that interests them. This is possible on laser discs because they offer access  to each frame of video, which makes it easy to move to any point on the disc.  </P> <P> For example, a disc that catalogues the works of a famous painter presents the  works one by one. But at the touch of a button, the viewer can call up  additional information about the painting, the artist's life or his work.  </P> <P> Many of the laserdiscs from Voyager Co., a Santa Monica firm, feature  commentary from filmmakers and film historians on one of the extra audio  channels and multimedia essays that blend still pictures and text with  full-motion video.  </P> <P> Voyager has many titles in its collection, from "Lawrence of Arabia" to "Blade  Runner," and is planning upcoming releases such as "Raging Bull" and "The Last  Picture Show." Other discs explore news events, such as last year's San  Francisco earthquake, and academic subjects, including biology.  </P> <P> The company also blends education and entertainment in its new compact disc  Companion series, which run on Macintosh computers. The first of these was the  "Beethoven Symphony No. 9 CD Companion," a five-part exploration of the  composer's masterpiece. It includes insights into the composer's world, a  tutorial on the building blocks of music and commentary on the symphony.  </P> <P> Other companies, such as Warner News Media and ABC News Interactive, are  contributing to the field of interactive video.  </P></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broker bids to gag the greenback Money has always talked loudest on Wall Street, where salaries are often measured in the millions of dollars, but yesterday the securities firm PaineWebber sought to place a gag order on the greenback. It is suing two rival firms to stop them from luring away its best staff with offers of huge pay increases. The saga started 10 days ago when PaineWebber bought the investment bank Kidder Peabody, and its army of highly profitable stockbrokers, from General Electric. Yet, before PaineWebber could welcome Kidder's employees to their new home, several rival firms had poached some of Kidder's best brokers, many of whom generate millions of dollars annually in commissions, from under PaineWebber's nose. This tactic - enticing staff away from one firm to another with offers of hefty pay packets - is nothing new on Wall Street, but PaineWebber felt it had to take drastic action to protect its investment in Kidder. So yesterday, PaineWebber filed lawsuits against Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Dean Witter Reynolds, two of the biggest names on Wall Street, charging them with trying to undermine its acquisition of Kidder Peabody by offering Kidder brokers 'exorbitant' financial incentives to leave the firm. The lawsuits followed reports that several top-producing Kidder brokers in New York and around the country had left the firm to join DLJ or Dean Witter. Merrill Lynch, another broking firm, was also said to have lured away a team of brokers from Kidder. Although there is nothing in US securities law that forbids the poaching of employees, firms are not allowed to deliberately interfere with a transaction such as the takeover of one firm by another. So, PaineWebber is asking the courts to ban DLJ and Dean Witter from raiding Kidder's staff. The irony of the situation is that Kidder's top brokers are being offered big pay increases to join other firms at a time when almost everyone on Wall Street is having to accept a pay cut or, even worse, redundancy, as firms endure a sharp slowdown in activity on financial markets. The cost-cutting has dug so deep that the biggest names on Wall Street are not immune to the axe. On Wednesday, Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the prominent analyst who became famous after warning clients to sell stocks before the stock market crash of 1987, was released by her long-time employer Lehman Brothers because the securities firm could no longer afford her million-dollar salary. Fortunately for Ms Garzarelli, she is regarded highly enough within the business that she should have no shortage of offers of employment from other firms. PaineWebber, in fact, was one name linked this week to the former Lehman star, but the firm may miss its chance to hire her if it does not move fast. Rivals such as DLJ and Dean Witter may already have their cheque books out, judging by their rapid raids on Kidder Peabody. One firm which will almost certainly not bid for Ms Garzarelli's service, or attempt to hire any Kidder brokers for that matter, is Salomon Brothers, the big bond trading firm which has racked up huge losses this year. On Thursday, Salomon announced it was cutting the pay of its top investment bankers and traders by two-thirds. Although the bankers and traders were told they could make a lot of money in bonuses if they performed well, they were also warned that if they lost money for the firm, they could expect to see their pay cheques shrink accordingly.</p>

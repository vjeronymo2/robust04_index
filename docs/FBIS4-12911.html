			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, Eytan Rabin, 'Amira Hess, and Yosi </F> Torpstein]    [Excerpts] The Palestinian delegation has notified the  Israeli delegates in Cairo that the PLO will not send policemen  to Gaza and Jericho before the withdrawal agreement is concluded  and signed.    Israel has agreed that 300 Palestinian policemen, mainly on  the command level, immediately enter the region to overlap with  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers while the Palestinians  study the region and receive the buildings and equipment. The  PLO had asked that 1,000 policemen be immediately given full  powers on the ground. When Israel refused, the PLO decided that  the Palestinian police force enter Gaza and Jericho only after  the agreement is signed. [passage omitted]    Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not intend to visit the  Middle East next month and will not visit 'Arafat in his new  Jericho headquarters, contrary to reports which appeared in Arab  newspapers and were quoted in Israel. This transpires from  messages which have arrived from Moscow over the last few days.  According to these messages Yeltsin is extremely occupied by  internal Russian issues, and will not be able to tour the Middle  East in the near future.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday called on the  Middle  East countries to cooperate in the economic sphere in order to  raise their citizens' standard of living. Visiting Istanbul,  Peres said: "We must develop regional economy in order to  equalize the standards of living."    Peres said Israel is willing to vacate territories it  conquered from Arab countries despite strong opposition to this  move in Israel. "Israel must return territories to Syria,  Jordan, and the Palestinians. We want to help our neighbors  achieve prosperity. Israel cannot remain an island of prosperity  in a poverty-ridden area," Peres said.</p>

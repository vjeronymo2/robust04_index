			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> For the first time since World War II, Poland's Communist Party is not in  control of the nation's broadcast media, as Solidarity journalist Andrzej  Drawicz was named to run the state-owned television and radio networks.  Drawicz, 57, a specialist in Soviet affairs and a former political prisoner,  was named by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The choice to head the  broadcast media was the major remaining question mark in Mazowiecki's  government. The post will not retain its Cabinet rank, reflecting the new  government's view that there should be nothing like an information minister  trying to shape public opinion.  </P></p>

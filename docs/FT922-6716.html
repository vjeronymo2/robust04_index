			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Retailing chief quits due to ill health: Storehouse results more than double to Pounds 15.8m MR Michael Julien is to step down as chief executive of the Storehouse retailing conglomerate on his doctors' advice after being unable to shake off a viral infection he contracted last year. He will be succeeded by Mr David Dworkin, currently chairman and chief executive of the BhS subsidiary, after the company's annual meeting in July. The announcement came as Storehouse, which also embraces Mothercare, Habitat, Richards, and Blazer, reported an encouraging turnround in its trading fortunes after four consecutive years of declining profits. In the year to March 28, Storehouse more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 15.8m on sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 1.18bn. The improvement was rewarded by a 3p rise in its share price to 140p. Last year's figures were, however, flattered by the absence of any exceptional costs. In the previous year, Storehouse took a Pounds 14.8m exceptional rationalisation charge and a Pounds 24.3m extraordinary loss on disposals. Profits from retail operations were Pounds 10m last year compared with Pounds 19.2m the year before. However, Mr David Simons, finance director, said the group had experienced a significant trading improvement in the second half of the year and was showing clear signs of recovery. The trend had continued over the first few weeks of the current year, he added, with group sales running at 7 per cent higher than a year ago. Mr Simons attributed the pick-up in sales to internal improvements made at Storehouse rather than to a general strengthening of consumer sales. BhS was the biggest contributor turning a first-half deficit into a Pounds 500,000 advance to Pounds 22.1m by the year end. But Mothercare saw a reversal in its fortunes falling from a Pounds 6.8m profits into a Pounds 3.9m loss. Habitat reduced losses from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 8.8m. Earnings per share rose from 1p to 2.6p. The final dividend was held at 2.5p maintaining the yearly payout at 5p. Storehouse said this reflected its financial strength and optimism for the future. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, yesterday paid tribute to Mr Julien's achievement in strengthening the company's finances and refocusing the group's operations.

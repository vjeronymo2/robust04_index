			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Give AIM a chance Sir, Lex queried ('Growing companies', November 16) whether there is a need for the Alternative Investment Market and for the planned pan-European market, Easdaq. Without further information on the latter, it is difficult to judge whether Easdaq might be necessary; but I think that, for the most part, the stock exchange's proposals for the AIM are well-balanced, and that there is a need for this particular market. Might I suggest that critics of the AIM keep a low profile and give the new market a fair chance? Julia Hydon, 38 Austenwood Close, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire 5L9 9DE</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is extremely tense in Bujumbura, the  capital of Burundi. The Burundian Government has demanded that  the people should lay down their arms. For two days several  districts of the town have been affected by shooting and  fighting, especially the district of Kamenge, in the north of  Bujumbura. Several Hutu took refuge in this district after the  massacres of last autumn. Francois Rijkmans reports:    [Rijkmans] The Burundian Government is unanimous in wanting  an end to violence in the town. The armed resistance has got  itself organized these last few days. The Burundian army, which  is mainly Tutsi, has clashed with Hutu militias. It seems that  a military committee has put pressure on the government. The  government wants to restore peace and to disband the illegal  militias. The decision has been taken: Everyone must hand in  their weapons this evening at 1800. But there are questions as  to how, and some people are fearing a new explosion of violence  in the powder keg of Bujumbura.    The Burundian army has surrounded the Kamenge district with  an impressive number of troops. The people of this district,  and of other northern districts of the town, had already agreed  to be disarmed, but on condition that their safety is  guaranteed, on condition that the troops stop the slaughter.    The Brussels representatives of Frodebu, the Burundi  Democratic Front, are afraid lest the army, dominated by Tutsis,  should enter Kamenge in force to carry out ethnic cleansing.</p>

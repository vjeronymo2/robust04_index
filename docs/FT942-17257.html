			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Big increase in company start-ups More than 12,000 companies were formed in Great Britain in March, the highest monthly total since 1990. Figures from Jordans, the Bristol-based information company, show that 12,638 companies were formed last month, a 6.4 per cent increase on March 1993. March is traditionally a strong month for creation of companies because it coincides with the end of the tax year. However, Jordans' figures show a consistent growth trend. Company formations in the six months to March were 59,705 compared with 56,669 in the same period a year earlier, a 5.4 per cent increase.</p>

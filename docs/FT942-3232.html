			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (5): Wind blows both ways - Andrew Adonis highlights the debate of the merits of 'outsourcing' Will or will not large organisations - particularly multinational companies  -be enticed into contracting out their telecommunications requirements to a single telecoms group? Put differently, do they regard their telecoms as essentially strategic or non-core? Upon the answer to those questions depends the realisation of the grandiose visions animating telecom operators worldwide. Alliances, investments and strategies are being predicated on the emergence of a burgeoning market for 'outsourcing.' The jury will probably be out for a few years. But while the issue is decided, opportunities galore will present themselves to large organisations - in the public as much as the private sector - seeking new services and a better deal for their existing telecoms. Most national operators now boast an outsourcing capacity, but the cross-border business is set to be most competitive. Predictably, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and British Telecommunications, the two most ambitious international operators, are at the forefront. Last summer AT&amp;T launched its 'World Partners' venture with several Far Eastern operators, while BT forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second-largest US operator and bitter foe of AT&amp;T in the US long-distance market. Both are aimed at exploiting the market for international outsourcing - variously estimated at between 1,000 and 5,000 companies worth between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn a year. The French and German state operators are also lining up, with an Ecu1bn alliance to provide advanced services to multinationals. However, smaller operators are just as fixated. In Europe, three of the smaller national telecoms companies - those of the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden - have clubbed together to establish their own outsourcing joint venture, Unisource. Telefonica of Spain is in talks about joining. Separately, Cable &amp; Wireless, the former imperial UK operator with operations in 56 companies - is trumpeting itself as the ideal 'outsourcing federation', and has established a special division for the purpose. At present, the straws in the wind are blowing both ways. Surveys show companies highly reluctant to outsource. Yet contracts are being sought and awarded, and the regulatory regime in Europe is set to give a significant boost to outsourcing. A UK industry survey, carried out among 439 large companies last year by the Telecommunications Managers' Association, last year, showed that more than 90 per cent had rejected the idea of contracting out their telecommunications. It found that only 6 per cent had decided to outsource the management of their telecoms. Fewer than half had considered outsourcing; of those that had considered it, 45 per cent said they had rejected it because telecommunications were strategic to their business, while 44 per cent could see no cost benefit. Nearly one in four feared 'entrapment' by the outsourcer. Mr Graham Marriner, chairman of the association, said: 'Most large companies still see telecoms as a core activity, and are very reluctant to describe their requirements in detail to a third party.' Despite that, outsourcing is a rapidly growing business in the US, and a number of large contracts have been awarded in the EU. To take but three large European developments of the past year: the UK government has outsourced its long-distance inter-departmental network - covering 250,000 civil servants in 550 offices - to Mercury. the Financial Network Association, a joint venture company between 12 national public telecommunications operators, six of them European (Mercury, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Belgacom, Telefonica and Italcable), has been cleared by the European Commission on condition that its services were not cross-subsidised by revenue from monopoly operations. Other members include MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier, KDD of Japan and Telstra of Australia. The company plans to offer specialised international network services to the financial sector, in particular high-capacity networks for the conveyance of data and image. It will compete strongly with Swift, the body jointly owned by international banks to manage their main network functions. In April a ground-breaking contract, worth up to Ecu500m a year, was awarded by 30 of Europe's leading multinationals to British Telecommunications and an alliance of AT&amp;T and Unisource to build a pan-European telecoms network linking the facilities of the 30 companies. The 30, which include Rank Xerox, ICI, Philips, ABN Amro and ABB, have formed a European telecoms association aiming to gain tariff reductions and upgraded services by acting jointly to provide for their telecoms requirements. The prospect of savings of up to 40 per cent on the companies' existing bills for cross-border European traffic was a key stimulus to the association. Those savings, in turn, depend upon a vital aspect of the existing EU telecoms regime, which permits competition between carriers for private networks, although monopolies for voice traffic will continue until at least 1998 on public networks. The association's network qualifies as private because companies will not be allowed to communicate with each other across it. The distinction is an uneasy attempt by the European Commission to encourage the development of pan-European networks without undermining national telecoms monopolies before state companies have time to adjust to competition. The effect, however, will be to give a significant boost to outsourcing via the franchising of private networks. Significantly, the European association draws on US experience, where a group of large companies - some of them members of the European group - operates a pan-US private network to provide enhanced telecoms facilities at special rates. The scope for savings is considerable. A telecoms 'benchmarking' report carried out this year by the UK's Trade and Industry Department found that while public network charges were broadly comparable in the US and larger European states, the price of high-capacity leased private circuits was vastly more expensive in Europe. Reuters, which has the largest private telecoms network in the world, claims that it would save 90 per cent of its outgoings for leased lines in Europe if the equivalent network were in the US. As the DTI noted: 'Such high costs not only increase the costs for business, they also suppress business activity by making it uneconomic to offer certain types of service or to carry out some business activities.' At the end of the day, cost savings are likely to 'drive' outsourcing. The potential for them is considerable - for the proactive customer.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Abkhazia looks to ties with Moscow Only the 'closest ties' to Russia would ensure the successful development of Abkhazia, the breakaway region of Georgia, according to Mr Vladislav Ardzimba, the region's leader. Speaking to the first world congress of ethnic Abkhazians in the capital of Sukhumi, Mr Ardzimba said that Abkhazia was a 'de facto sovereign state'. He said that none of the documents he had signed with the United Nations or Russia - which has provided a peacekeeping presence of some 3,000 troops with UN agreement - linked the region with Georgia. Georgian troops were driven out of Abkhazia last year after bitter fighting, especially for control of Sukhumi. Since then, the region, to Georgia's north-west, has been sealed off from the rest of the country and the Georgian refugees denied re-entry. Mr Ardzimba's comments are in line with the long-term aim of the Abkhazian leadership to break links with the Georgian government in Tbilisi and bring Abkhazia into a union - formal or informal - with Russia. The Georgian population, which before the civil war had made up the majority in Abkhazia, has largely fled to Georgia, where its presence is greatly exacerbating the economic collapse of the country and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis this winter. Figures published by the Russian statistical office Goskomstat show that Georgian industrial output has halved over the past year - the sharpest fall of any of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Turkmenistan the main supplier of gas to Georgia, is threatening to cut supplies because of unpaid bills amounting to Dollars 300m. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign minister, is under increasing pressure from opposition politicians who accuse him of capitulating to Russian pressure and of having given up the fight to retake Abkhazia. He has warned of food and energy shortages this winter and faces a collapse of civil order as the currency is rendered increasingly worthless by inflation.</p>

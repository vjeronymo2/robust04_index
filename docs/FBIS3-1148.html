			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Joseph Kokou Koffigoh has resigned from his prime  ministerial post but a controversy has begun between the Action  Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy  [UTD] over the arrangements expected to lead to the choice of  the new prime minister. Yesterday, the CAR sent us a statement  relating to the situation. It was read by Afan Houenoumadje:    [Begin Houenoumadje recording] The CAR steering committee  met  on 21 March in the presence of its 36 members elected to the  National Assembly and expressed grave concern over the reasons  for the present controversy over the choice of the prime  minister expected to form the first government of the Fourth  Republic.    The CAR recalls that, according to a democratic principle in  tune with the expression of the people's will and the spirit of  our Constitution, the choice of a prime minister from a  parliamentary majority is, first and foremost, left to the party  that obtained the highest number of seats in the elections, and  it is up to that party to look within its ranks for the person  who can occupy that function.    Furthermore, the CAR makes it a point to stress that before  the first round of the legislative polls, the CAR chairman and  his UTD counterpart agreed, in the presence of a witness, upon  the way the prime minister would be chosen. Under this  agreement, it was understood that should the opposition win the  legislative elections, the party that would obtain the highest  number of seats would choose candidates for the post of prime  minister, speaker of the National Assembly, and president of the  Constitutional Court. The CAR remains convinced that everything  will be done to ensure that the new institutions that are put in  place are in line with the will expressed by our citizens during  the 6 and 20 February legislative elections.    Issued in Lome on 21 March 1994 by Yaovi Agboyibor, CAR  chairman [end recording]    After this statement by the CAR, the UTD reacted  immediately.  Edem Kodjo, the UTD leader who we contacted by telephone, said  he had not signed any such agreement with the CAR and demanded  proof of such an agreement. Let us listen to what he said:    [Begin Kodjo recording] I find all this a bit deplorable.  What I can tell you is that I have never signed any agreement  with the CAR chairman on this issue. If there exists a signed  agreement this should be produced. [end recording]</p>

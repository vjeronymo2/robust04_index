			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Segni, the quiet Sardinian on a collision course - The leaders of the Yes and No campaigns MR Mario Segni, the 'quiet Sardinian' who is the figurehead of the referendum movement, is an unlikely candidate for the limelight. Though he is the son of a former president of Italy, early exposure to the world of politics has done nothing to alter the character of a profoundly shy man. He is the champion of using referendums to promote political change, but Mr Segni conforms closely to the popular image of the reticent Sardinian: saying little, thinking hard, and taking years to get to know properly. His rise began two years ago, when he organised a referendum on abolishing the multiple preference ballot system in some elections, which was widely believed to be subject to abuse. Popular support for the initiative, in spite of the indifference or hostility of many established politicians, created a bandwagon effect in which Mr Segni helped to convince Italians they could change an ossified political system. The referendum movement he created has attracted reform-minded politicians calling for more honest and transparent government. But Mr Segni's belief in the need for radical reform in Italian politics, and his growing lack of faith in the willingness of the main governing parties to promote it, has taken him on an accelerating collision course with much of the political establishment. Matters reached a head last month when Mr Segni announced he was leaving the Christian Democrat party, which he has represented as a Sardinia MP for 17 years. His move reflected frustration with the party's apparent inability to appreciate the new mood sweeping Italy and get to grips with reform. Having at first tried to promote change from within Italy's biggest political grouping, after months of friction with the party nomenklatura, he broke free. The move could trigger a deep split in the Catholic vote and further weaken a party which has traditionally represented a broad spread of views. By leaving just as investigations into prominent politicians have switched from allegations of graft and financial irregularities to links with organised crime, Mr Segni dealt a crushing blow to the image of the Christian Democrats at a time when they are struggling to show a new, reform-minded face. Still only 53, Mr Segni has often been tipped as a man who could lead a new, cross-party government after the referendums, or, more likely, the elections that could follow this year. How much support he could gain, given his ructions with the rump of his party, remains unclear. Though he is widely seen as one of Italy's men of the future, his immediate prospects are likely to be coloured by his strained relations with those of the past.</p>

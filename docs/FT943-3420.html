			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Company cash levels highest for 10 years Large British companies have become increasingly cash rich as a result of rising profits and a series of bond and share issues. In large non-manufacturing companies, liquid assets reached their highest level for over 15 years in June, according to official figures released yesterday. For large companies overall, liquidity was at a 10-year high. The findings are likely to boost City hopes that investment, which has lagged well behind the rest of the economic recovery, may pick up later this year. However, the Confederation of British Industry warned that concerns about demand may still be depressing investment, in spite of the increasing availability of internal company finance. The Central Statistical Office said the liquidity ratio (current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of liabilities that must be repaid in less than a year)of large non-manufacturing companies at the end of June rose to a seasonally adjusted 178 per cent, sharply up from the 134 per cent of the previous June. In manufacturing, the level was slightly lower, at 127 per cent. This was fractionally down on three months before but well above the 97 per cent recorded at the end of June 1993. Overall, the liquidity ratio of the UK's largest companies was 147 per cent, unchanged on the previous quarter and the highest recorded in the series' 10-year history. The survey covers about three quarters of the total net assets of the industrial and commercial sector. The CSO said yesterday that the key reason for the rise in liquidity was that companies had made a series of bond and share issues in recent months against a background of rising profits and repayments of their bank debts. Mr Leo Doyle, economist with brokers Kleinwort Benson, said: 'These figures show a strong build up in liquid assets - it shows that companies can invest now without going into debt.' However, Ms Kate Barker, economist at the CBI, said that although investment was expected to pick up later this year, recent CBI surveys had indicated that many large companies remained cautious about investment and employment intentions. 'It is not just whether companies have the money but whether they believe the demand will be there that drives investment,' she said. Productivity still rising, Page 8</p>

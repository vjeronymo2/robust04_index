			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / People: End of an era for insolvency name Roger Cork is severing the last remaining family links between the famous insolvency firm Cork Gully and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, with which it merged in 1980. Cork, below, who is the son of insolvency doyen Sir Kenneth Cork and grandson of W H Cork, founder of Cork Gully, is leaving his position as a senior partner with Coopers to join Moore Stephens. In a statement recently circulated to Coopers' partners, his departure is explained as the result of 'differences of opinion' with the firm over the future of Cork Gully. Coopers has been gradually playing down the status of Cork Gully. In the last few months it has been dropping the firm's name from many of its activities. Cork Gully is now used primarily in liquidations. In other insolvency work, Coopers believes the name has a destructive connotation, when much of its work is connected to companies which can be salvaged. Cork, who has worked at Cork Gully for 24 years, will join Moore Stephens in January to lead its small corporate recovery practice. He trained with the firm in 1965-69. His grandfather and the founder of Moore Stephens were friends and simultaneously founded their respective firms. 'Although Moore Stephens is an international firm of some standing, it has a very small insolvency division,' he said. 'I am very sad to be going but I was at loggerheads with the management.' Four generations of the Cork family have been involved in insolvency work. One of Roger Cork's cousins is a partner with Booth White, whose son has in turn just qualified as an insolvency practitioner. Moore Stephens is the UK's 14th largest firm with total fee income of Pounds 42m. Coopers is the largest firm in the country, with fee income last year of Pounds 553m and insolvency income alone of Pounds 73m.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three more departures in Merck shake-up Three more senior executives of Merck are to depart in the coming months as part of a move by Mr Raymond Gilmartin, the US drugs company's new head, to shape his own senior management team. The New Jersey-based company also hinted at a broader reorganisation under Mr Gilmartin. Its new 10-person management committee, announced yesterday, is intended to serve as 'an example for the company of a leaner, flatter organisation,' Merck said. A shake-up has been expected since Mr Gilmartin was brought in to run what is widely regarded as an in-bred and bureaucratic company. The latest departures include two of the four executive vice-presidents who had formed the core of the management group under Mr Ray Vagelos, who retires as chairman in November. They are Mr Jerry Jackson, responsible for non-US operations and at one stage a candidate for the top job, and Mr Frank Spiegel, head of strategic planning. Mr Jackson will retire at the end of the year and Mr Spiegel at the end of October, though both will give up day-to-day responsibilities and serve as consultants until then. Merck also said Mr Richard Lane, head of its US human health marketing operations, is to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. The reorganised management committee replaces the small group of executives who formed Mr Vagelos' chairman's staff. Its 10 members include the heads of Merck's business areas, who will report to Mr Gilmartin. The only members of the former senior management group to remain are Mr Edward Scolnick, head of research and manufacturing, Ms Judy Lewent, chief financial officer, and Ms Mary McDonald, general counsel.</p>

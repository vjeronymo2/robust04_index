			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Management: Manning the hot lines - A look at today's launch of Charterline, a state-of-the-art service to keep UK customers satisfied Businesses dealing with the consumer know that losing customers through poor-quality service can be expensive. It is not only customers suffering the bad service that are lost: they in turn pass on their dissatisfaction to family and friends, multiplying the cost of failure. Inviting disgruntled consumers to make contact by telephone can therefore make good business sense. Not only does it provide an opportunity to remedy the fault, it also helps identify the causes of complaint. That is the philosophy behind the increasing use of the telephone as part of the customer care arsenal. Computer hardware and software companies, mail-order retailers and utilities such as BT, the telecoms group, are among the businesses which provide cheap or free telephone helplines to keep in contact with their customers. Prime Minister John Major's Citizen's Charter, which aims to raise the standard of public services, has spread the practice into the public sector. Many government departments and agencies, health authorities and local councils are now providing helplines to provide information to customers. Later this morning, the use of helplines in the public sector will take another step forward with the launch of Charterline by William Waldegrave, the public services minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter. Initially to be piloted in the East Midlands, Charterline will provide callers all over the UK with information on what standards of service they can expect from dozens of public services and utilities and how to complain when they fall below standard. Even in the three pilot counties of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire, the demand is estimated to be enormous. About 30,000 calls a month are expected by consultants Price Waterhouse who are managing the project for the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit. Answering their questions means having details - names, addresses, responsibilities, service standards, complaints procedures - of more than 200 public service organisations, including government bodies, quangos, public transport operators, local councils, police forces and fire services. Charterline also takes in privatised public utilities - water, gas, electricity and telecommunications, their regulators and consumer bodies. As the service spreads beyond the pilot area, it will add more organisations to its database, and will finally have details of 1,400 public-sector bodies. It will also include some basic information on 'out-of-scope' organisations such as banks, building societies and airlines. Charterline's aim is to provide the ordinary citizen with more information about the Citizen's Charter and to encourage them to take up gripes with the organisations concerned. But it will also provide essential management information for the Citizen's Charter Unit in its efforts to improve the public services. For the first time, the unit will have a tool for identifying which services are creating most complaints - and which have the best procedures for dealing with them. The Charterline service will be run from IBM's National Call Management Centre at Havant, Hampshire. The centre was established last year to handle requests for computer maintenance from IBM's customers. Its 100 operators already handle 24,000 calls a week, 24 hours a day. But Charterline could mean a huge large growth in call handling at the centre, with 18 new 'call agents' required to handle calls from the pilot area alone. The IBM centre meets its staffing needs through an innovative relationship with Manpower, the recruitment specialists. Manpower is responsible for recruiting the call agents, using a profile agreed with IBM, and remains their employer. 'It gives me the flexibility I need to experiment with new approaches and change things around,' says Mike Coleman, the centre's manager. 'It helps me keep costs to the minimum and I don't have to hire and fire people.' However, quality of service is the key to running a successful helpline, says Coleman. Each agent receives five weeks' training which includes customer care, telephone technique, stress training and learning how the public services operate (there are plans for an NVQ vocational qualification in call handling). Team working is encouraged by grouping five call agents and a team leader in a work station in which they all face each other. A much-coveted monthly 'Golden Telephone' award is presented to the best team and team members are encouraged to nominate each other for 'Golden Eagle' awards for customer care - these come with a Pounds 5 voucher. Price Waterhouse has set challenging performance targets for the contract: 90 per cent of calls must be answered within 10 seconds, 98 per cent in less than 20. Better response rates are possible, says PW's Robert Browning, but the cost could only be justified in a commercial environment where additional sales might result. The success of Charterline will, however, also depend on whether it can supply callers with the information they need. Each call agent watches a computer screen on to which details of calls are entered. The system identifies the organisation the caller needs to know more about and provides details of service standards and complaints procedures. If the caller wants to receive details of the Citizen's Charter, the agent can enter the request for despatch the same day. The system has been extensively tested by confronting agents with difficult queries. One fiendish tester rang in to ask how he could arrange a meeting with John Major for a man claiming to be a Martian. It is unlikely that many of Charterline's inquiries will be quite so difficult to answer. However, no one can really know if the system will take the strain until the calls start flooding in later today. One thing is certain: Charterline cannot be allowed to flop. If there is one thing worse than neglecting the customer, it is to invite them to call in and then mishandle their complaint.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Republican tussle over policy THE Republican party's platform committee began a final round of meetings in Houston yesterday designed to resolve two controversies over the policies on which President George Bush will campaign for re-election. On the economy, a group of prominent conservative activists including Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, is pushing for adoption of more radical tax-cutting measures in a second Bush term. A second pressure group, mostly moderate Republicans but backed by former Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the old conservative warhorse, wants to modify the provisional platform's unequivocal opposition to abortion. The seven-member Kemp group, which includes Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia and four Republican senators, issued a memorandum over the weekend claiming that growth could be tripled by cutting the present 15 per cent minimum rate of tax to 12 per cent and by reducing capital gains taxes to a maximum of 15 per cent and to zero for long-term investments. Their proposals also run to a government spending freeze, broader privatisation, and cuts in entitlement programmes, not excluding social security. Mr Gingrich said the chances were high that Mr Bush would embrace the principles, if not all the details, of the proposals in his acceptance speech to the party's convention next week. Mr Clayton Yeutter, the domestic policy adviser, said yesterday that radical tax cutting might have to wait on progress towards reducing the federal deficit. However, in an attack on the economic policies of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, he accepted the importance of tax policy in the presidential campaign by again claiming that the Clinton blueprint, if enacted, would constitute the biggest tax increase in US history. The pressure group's political concerns have long been apparent, as the memorandum makes clear. If the president 'just resorts to old Republican exhortations about the balanced budget amendment or the line item veto, the American people will quickly lose interest.' In practice, the platform will almost certainly contain both recommendations. There is little chance the platform will change the 1988 commitment to outlawing abortion, except in a handful of cases. But in an attempt to show the party tolerates differences of opinion, Ms Lynn Martin, labour secretary, will give a nominating address next week. She disagrees with Mr Bush over abortion.</p>

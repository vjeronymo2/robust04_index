			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleh Makhno: "Why Is Meshkov Violating the Laws </F> of Ukraine?"]    [Text] One of the characteristic features of  our life is that the more our "power wielders" talk of a civil  society, the more they are apt to violate the law. Now we have  the president of the Republic of Crimea engaging in the same  conduct -- his preelection promises notwithstanding, he is  disregarding the Ukrainian Constitution. Thus, following a rainy  Thursday, having set his Komandirskiye wristwatch by the tolling  of the Kremlin bells, he issued another of his directives to the  Crimean [military] commissariats regarding the next call-up of  young Crimeans to military service with the instruction that  they should serve only on the Crimean peninsula. Not a foot,  booted or bare, is to step beyond the isthmus!    "This directive is illegal. There is no foundation for it  whatsoever," said Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan, Ukraine's deputy  minister of defense, at a press conference held upon his return  from Crimea at the end of last week. "The military leadership (I  have in mind the military commissar of Crimea, Major-General  Volkov, and the commander of the army corps, Major-General  Kuzmuk) also know this and will carry out the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry's orders to act in accordance with acting legislation.  In other words, the conscription of youths will be conducted  according to the extraterritorial principle."    To be sure, this does not mean that all Crimeans will serve  exclusively outside the territory of the Crimean Republic, added  Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan. There are a number of preferences [pilhy]  under which a certain category of conscripts will be allowed, as  before, to undergo their military training not far from home.  These preferences are well-known, and they are taken into  account by every military commissariat in Ukraine. But the total  number of such youths will not exceed 20 percent.    If only matters were confined to this attempt by Meshkov to  place the Crimean commissariat system under his jurisdiction.  But the "campaign" is much broader in scale. Meshkov's cabinet  has issued several other "military" directives that clearly  exceed this body's authority. For example, the directive to  submit full information on the deployment of the units and  subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on their structure,  military objectives, etc. That is how the authorities in Crimea  want to let us know that they would like to form their own armed  forces...    It is unlikely that the Crimean president and his military  advisors expect to receive this information. Nor do they have  any need of it at present. In I. Bizhan's view, the main  objective is to raise a political outcry and create tension  surrounding these issues (and that of conscription, in  particular).    In all likelihood, Meshkov's team has not yet gotten over  its  recent presidential election campaign and is confusing it with  the realities of the present. And this is no longer funny. It is  one thing to make the Crimeans sit down an hour earlier to their  dinner tables and quite another to put young conscripts in the  dock for failing to carry out the Law on Military Duty and  Military Service (and this outcome is not out of the question  should the conscripts and their relatives heed the calls to  unlawful actions). That is why Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan asked the  members of the mass media to report this event accurately and  explain to the public the position of the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine. Certain advisors to the president of the Crimean  Republic are very active. We have in mind the specialists on  military affairs who until recently wore military uniforms and  still cannot reconcile themselves to their new status of  reservists. Thus, one of them suddenly decides to "correct the  actions" of the military subunits and units of the Armed Forces  of Ukraine, while another decides to conduct "authorized"  inspections. One cannot help but be reminded of old circus nags  that start to dance out of habit as soon as they hear any kind  of music. It should be noted that, as a rule, these reservists'  nostalgic charges are seen as poor jokes -- the kind that one is  embarrased to laugh at and ashamed to tolerate. But if the  supporters of the Crimean president want to question the  competence of the military leadership of the army corps, they  have absolutely no grounds for this.    "I myself head the certification commission," said Col-Gen  Ivan Bizhan, "and I have complete confidence in the professional  qualifications of the officers and generals serving in the units  stationed on the Crimean peninsula."    During his visit to Crimea, Maj-Gen Ivan Bizhan also met  with  Admiral Selivanov, the chief of the Main Staff of the Navy of  the Russian Federation. Their talks centered on a number of  fundamental issues regarding the Black Sea Fleet. Among them --  the fact that the Russian side exceeds its authority in the  command of the Fleet, the Russians' desire to unilaterally  dispose of the Fleet's material assets, and their resistance to  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's demand for an immediate  inventory of the Fleet's property as stipulated by the  government agreements reached in Massandra and Yalta.  Unfortunately, the Russian side has once again attempted to pass  over these questions and has failed to answer why only citizens  of the Russian Federation are being recruited to the elite unit  of naval infantry contrary to the "50-50" provision called for  by the agreement.</p>

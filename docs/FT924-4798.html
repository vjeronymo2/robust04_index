			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Big farm protest planned - Mitterrand links French veto to final Gatt agreement FRENCH agriculture unions are expecting up to 50,000 farmers at a multinational demonstration in Strasbourg today in protest at cuts in subsidised exports of European farm produce proposed in the Gatt accord with the US. As farmers headed for Strasbourg, President Francois Mitterrand of France said Paris would decide to accept or veto the farm trade agreement only after a global world trade deal had been achieved. During a state dinner with King Baudoin of Belgium last night, Mr Mitterrand said France would not base a decision to reject a Gatt agreement on the agricultural issue alone. The FNSEA, France's main farm group, said 8,000 German farmers would join today's demonstration, in defiance of a warning to the DBV German farmers' federation by Mr Ignaz Kiechle, German agriculture minister, not to support France's threat to veto the deal. There have been farm demonstrations against the farm trade deal in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany in recent weeks. But the French government has attracted only moderate official support from its EC partners, despite a diplomatic campaign to pull its allies into line. Today's demonstration will provide a clearer measure of international solidarity for French farmers, around 30,000 of whom are expected to be there. The presence of German farmers is unlikely to deflect Chancellor Helmut Kohl's discreet attempts to encourage France, his main EC ally, to compromise on Gatt. This is likely to be discussed at Friday's Franco-German summit in Bonn. Before EC-US negotiators worked out their proposed farm deal, the US had threatened to impose sanctions against some European farm exports by next Saturday. Delegations are expected from all EC member states and from farm unions outside the Community, to make a general protest against the Gatt and US trade policies. They include Canadians, Swiss, Scandinavians and a delegation from a Japanese farm co-operative, angered at US rice growers' efforts to gain access to their protected market. Local authorities in Strasbourg have removed street signs to stop farmers finding the European parliament and have ensured their route avoids the US consulate and other US buildings.</p>

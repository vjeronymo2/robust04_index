			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAFFITTE SCORES 47 AS USIU ROMPS  </P> <P> The score of U.S. International University's 127-114 victory over Point Loma  Nazarene at Golden Hall Thursday was the least significant number of the game.  </P> <P> More important for the Gulls were a third consecutive victory, fourth in the  past five games, and an 11-14 record. The 11 victories equal the most in a  season since Gary Zarecky became coach four years ago and are only two short of  the school record of 13 set in the 1980-81 season, when USIU was 13-12.  </P> <P> Forward Demetrius Laffitte added some significant numbers of his own in the  Gulls' final appearance in Golden Hall this season. Laffitte scored a  career-high 47 points and had a season-high 18 rebounds. He was 19 of 31 from  the field and 9 of 10 from the line and had 14 offensive rebounds.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Crusaders, an NAIA team, their most significant numbers  were 6-feet-4, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0, 6-2. That's the height of their starting lineup,  and it doesn't get much taller with 6-5 reserve Mark Dirksen.  </P> <P> The Gulls took advantage of the height discrepancy at will, outrebounding the  Crusaders, 40-24, on their way to a 65-49 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The outcome was never really in doubt, although USIU suffered enough mental  lapses to keep the Crusaders in the game. USIU had its biggest lead, 100-71,  with 12 minutes remaining, but PLNC outscored the Gulls, 16-3, over the next 3  minutes to pull within 103-87.  </P> <P> USIU increased the lead to 117-97 with 4 minutes remaining before the Crusaders  went on a 9-2 run.  </P> <P> Lack of height has hurt PLNC (7-20) all season. The Crusaders lost Mike Flores,  a 6-10 center from Mt. Miguel High School, to reconstructive knee surgery  before the season, and Steve Riddle, a 6-6 All-Golden State Athletic Conference  center last season, was out for the year when it was discovered that he had  detached knee ligaments during preseason.  </P> <P> Since the Crusaders couldn't play with Gulls, they were forced to run with  them.  </P> <P> "We didn't play that bad when we were running, it's just that they're better at  it," said Ted Anderson, PLNC's coach. "It's tough. We didn't exactly slow them  down."  </P> <P> Zarecky ran 11 players onto the court and all scored, including four in double  figures. Steve Smith and Gary Williams had 18 points apiece, and Smith added  eight assists. Ron Hubbard led PLNC with 27 points, and Mark Ryan added 26.  </P> <P> Although the recent numbers are providing optimism for USIU, its most important  ones may be ahead.  </P> <P> The Gulls travel to play South Dakota, an NCAA Division II team, Monday before  returning to San Diego to play San Diego State (Feb. 25) and the University of  San Diego (Feb. 28) in their final games of the season.  </P></p>

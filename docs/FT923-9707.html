			<p>920804 FT  04 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The longest day German gymnast Andreas Wecker, 22, took nearly five hours to complete a drug test because he was unable to give a sample. Wecker, who won a silver and two bronzes in the apparatus finals, went to drugs control just after midnight on Monday. 'I emptied a tray of drinks but nothing came,' Wecker said. The gymnastics hall was closed at 3am and Wecker was accompanied to the clinic in the athletes' village. Success finally came at around 5am. 'I have never had such problems before,' he said.</p>

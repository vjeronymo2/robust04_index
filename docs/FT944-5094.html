			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / SPD to boost presence in east Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday unveiled a programme aimed at re-building the party in east Germany and eroding the support of the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, said the grassroots would be strengthened through creating local offices, co-operation with the trade unions, more travel by the federal leadership to the east and a training programme for local politicians. In October's federal elections, the SPD polled 31.9 per cent of the vote in the east, compared with 37.7 per cent in the west.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FIRE, SMOKE BLAMED ON POWER FAILURE  </P> <P> A power failure Friday morning at the Fletcher Oil refinery in Carson produced  large flames and a billowing cloud of black smoke that was visible for miles.  </P> <P> Company Vice President Richard D. Erdman said the power outage knocked out  controls on a refinery unit and excess gases were burned off through a flare,  sending flames soaring 80 to 90 feet into the air. "It was rather spectacular  because it went straight up," Erdman said.  </P> <P> The 10-minute outage was caused by a battery failure in "a very critical piece  of equipment" designed to supply uninterrupted power, he said.  </P> <P> A South Coast Air Quality Management District spokesman said the refinery will  not be cited for violating air pollution laws because the smoke was the result  of "a legitimate breakdown."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Varnsdorf, North Bohemia, June 23 (CTK) -- Czech  Premier and Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Vaclav  Klaus said today he considered the newly-constituted Democratic  Union (DEU) a "party of fundamental anti-Bolsheviks with no  positive programme."    Addressing a public rally, Klaus said that the way of  thinking of DEU members was close to what they themselves called  "anti." "The DEU looks into the past and believes that this way  leads somewhere," Klaus said. "The rear mirror of a car cannot  be bigger than its front wind screen. I am afraid that  Mrs.Hromadkova and people in her vicinity have not understood  this at all," he said.    "We live in a democratic society where freedom of assembly  and forming organizations is guaranteed and the appearance of  such a party is thus natural," Klaus said.    The DEU, constituted on June 18, calls in its manifesto for  barring former higher communist party officials, agents of the  secret police (StB) and members of extremist parties and  movements from civil service. The manifesto says that the DEU  will seek the enactment of the non-proscription of the crimes of  communism.    Alena Hromadkova, DEU chairwoman, is a sociologist and  economist by education. She had never been a member of any  party. She signed the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and was  one of its spokeswomen in 1991.    At a press conference on June 23 Hromadkova said that the  DEU  wanted to attract to its ranks those Czechs who feel deceived or  disappointed by political developments.</p>

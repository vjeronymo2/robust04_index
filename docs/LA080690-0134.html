			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RUNNER WHO REFUSED HITLER DIES  </P> <P> Robert Rodenkirchen, a world-class sprinter who refused Hitler's request to  represent Nazi Germany in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, has died of a heart  attack at age 74.  </P> <P> Born in Cologne, Germany, Rodenkirchen came to the United States with his  family as a child.  </P> <P> After qualifying for the 1936 U.S. Olympic team in the trials, Rodenkirchen was  denied a spot when someone discovered his father had never obtained U.S.  citizenship for himself and his family.  </P> <P> While Rodenkirchen was on the rubbing table for a race at Princeton University  in 1936, the German ambassador to the United States hand-delivered a letter  from Adolf Hitler. The letter invited the 19-year-old athlete to represent  Germany in the Olympics that year as a representative of the Aryan race.  </P> <P> Rodenkirchen refused, according to press reports at the time. "I never finished  the letter," he was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Rodenkirchen, who died Friday, competed for North Texas State and Cornell  universities and set a world record at the 1936 Olympic trial semifinals by  running the 200-meter dash in 21.2 seconds.  </P></p>

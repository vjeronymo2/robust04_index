			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (5): Maintaining independence / A look at the degree of autonomy the Bank of Spain enjoys Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor for the past two years, is cautious when he talks about the autonomy statute that was legislated for the institution by parliament last month. 'In theory we are now as independent as the Bundesbank,' he says. Modelled on similar legislative initiatives in France, Ireland and other European Union member states, Spain's autonomy law gives Mr Rojo and the bank the responsibility for setting a monetary policy that is compatible with reducing inflation . In line with the Maastricht Treaty's provisions on central bank independence, the new law also prohibits the institution from financing the Treasury or any other public entity. However, the Spanish government, as elsewhere in the EU, has reserved for itself the responsibility for exchange rate policy. Theoretically, as Mr Rojo would have it, the goal posts have now been changed on Spain's economic playing field. What remains to be seen is how the game alters. The consensus view is that is will not change a great deal, at least not in the mid term. The Bank of Spain's governor knows that a set of legal provisions does not automatically create a code of public conduct. Whether the bank becomes a recognisable Buba clone will depend on the firmness displayed by Mr Rojo and the bank over time and on the backing that such independently-minded decisiveness might receive from parliament and the public. Mr Rojo argues that a certain amount of education is in order: 'The Germans understand that price stability is important, the Spaniards understand this less.' He also belives that at some future date there could be disagreements with his ministerial masters because price stability 'is an objective that hardly anyone in politics is interested in'. So far the governor has been fortunate with his political overlords. Former economy minister Carlos Solchaga, who appointed Mr Rojo governor, echoed Mr Rojo's sentiments when he confessed in a bitter-sweet valedictory speech to parliament that a real domestic problem was the fact that Spaniards had never been sufficiently worried about high inflation. Pedro Solbes, who replaced Mr Solchaga a year ago as economy and finance minister, has put budgetary restraint at the top of his agenda. Such political support has made Mr Rojo's job a lot easier. Having steered the peseta through three devaluations in less than a year, following Europe's monetary turmoil in the autumn of 1992, Mr Rojo asserts that he has already been acting with the sort of independence which the autonomy statute has now formally granted the bank. Over the past few months Mr Rojo has almost halved the Bank of Spain's benchmark intervention rate and brought it down to 7.5 per cent and he claims that over the period he has not received a single instruction from the economy and finance ministry on interest rates cuts. In the same vein, the government has anticipated the new restrictions on monetary financing by unilaterally relinquishing this instrument at the begining of 1993. It did so shortly after the cabinet approved the draft Bank of Spain autonomy law in December 1992, although legally it could have continued to borrow from the institution right up until last month when the law was finally enacted by parliament. Treasury officials say they wanted to 'get into training' ahead of the ban on monetary financing. In the event the government went to the markets last year and obtained more debt than it required; Spain's PSBR of some Pta15,000bn was overfunded by Pta3,000bn and not a peseta of this total came from the Bank of Spain. In addition, the Madrid Treasury negotiated last year a syndicated loan facility with the UK's National Westminster bank, which led the syndicate, that provides a multi-currency Pta750bn standby credit line over a three-year period at Libor plus 0.075BP. A year later the government has still not made use of this facility, one of the largest available to an EU member, although there are suggestions that some of the foreign banks in the syndicate are urging it to do so. Should the going get tough the government has several options with which to overcome the ban on monetary financing. It can start to take up the Nat West's facility and it can, in addition, negotiate a similar credit line with the domestic banks. It can also return to short-term three- and six-month debt issues, a strategy which Madrid's treasury, like its counterparts around the world, would prefer to avoid. Arguably, the best option open to the treasury, particularly because there are still expectations of further interest rate cuts, is debt stripping, a strategy that originated in the US and which consists of the division and separate marketing of a debt asset into its principal and its interest. Debt stripping, which prompts a wider and more liquid secondary market, has been developed elsewhere in the EU but has still to make an impact in Spain in part because of the lack of specialised knowledge and in part because of double taxation impediments that have still to be ironed out. A main attraction for non-residents holding the interest part of a stripped debt is that they are exempt from withholding tax. Mr Rojo is therefore in the enviable position of working with 'hands-off' politicians and with a resourceful treasury that has already come to terms with non-monetary financing. He can therefore concentrate on his pet project of raising domestic awareness of inflation. The governor plans to have the bank issue monthly reports on inflation and he himself wants to address parliament's finance committee frequently on price stability. He also wants to follow the example of Bank of England governor Eddie George and have regular meetings over monetary policy with the economy minister, the minutes of which are subsequently made public. Looking ahead, however, Mr Rojo's independence could be tested to the full. Should the domestic economy begin the recover quickly - which it could do - will Mr Rojo be tempted to push up interest rates in the manner of the Fed's Alan Greenspan? And should Mr Rojo want to do so, what will be the reaction of government?</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY BANS HOURLY MOTEL-ROOM RENTAL  </P> <P> Seeking to battle male and female prostitutes in the city, the City Council  Monday night approved a ban on the hourly rental of motel rooms.  </P> <P> The council voted 5 to 0 for the ordinance, which also requires motel operators  to keep an accurate, permanent register of all customers. It takes effect in 30  days.  </P> <P> "The purpose of this is to cut down on prostitution, and that's what we want to  do," said Councilman J. Tilman Williams.  </P> <P> Monday's action makes permanent an emergency ordinance first enacted on May 15  at the urging of Police Chief John L. Robertson. He argued that some areas of  the city, particularly Garden Grove Boulevard between Magnolia Street and Beach  Boulevard, have a proliferation of prostitutes, adult bookstores, peep shows  and inexpensive motels.  </P> <P> As part of city efforts to clean up Garden Grove Boulevard, the City Council  denied operating permits to four peep shows on that street. Court action is now  pending against those firms.  </P></p>

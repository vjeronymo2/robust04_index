			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Conservative Bill Parcells got daring at the wrong time Monday night at San  Francisco. . . .  </P> <P> At least, the New York coach's decisions to go for a touchdown instead of a  field goal and to call four consecutive passes from the nine-yard line gave  people something to talk about after an otherwise forgettable game. . . . I  hadn't seen so many kicks since the World Cup. . . .  </P> <P> Exactly how comfortable the Lakers have become with Mike Dunleavy's system will  be determined tonight when they play Detroit at the Forum, where they have lost  four consecutive games to the Pistons. . . .  </P> <P> General Manager Al Bianchi's firing of New York Knick Coach Stu Jackson was  scapegoating at its worst. . . .  </P> <P> Better that Bianchi had made some personnel moves to build a contender around  Patrick Ewing. And it was Bianchi who let free-agent Bernard King go to  Washington for nothing when he refused to match the Bullets' offer. . . .  </P> <P> Eleven of Portland's next 16 games are on the road. . . .  </P> <P> The Sacramento Union is conducting a poll as to whether the Sacramento Kings  should fire Coach Dick Motta. . . .  </P> <P> Paul Westhead won't be long for Denver if, as he says, "in this system, you  need the entire team to play full blast every minute of every game." . . .  </P> <P> Michael Cooper was named most valuable player in the Italian League all-star  game although he scored only six points. Must have been his defense in the  South's 182-176 victory. . . .  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Bucks should try to make the disgruntled Alvin Robertson happy.  He's one-third of the best trio of guards in the NBA. . . .  </P> <P> You knew Ray Perkins was on his way out of Tampa Bay the minute Buccaneer owner  Hugh Culverhouse gave him a vote of confidence. . . .  </P> <P> Nancy Travis deserves an award for her brilliant performance as the field  hockey player in the play "My Children! My Africa!" . . .  </P> <P> Sebastian Coe, the 800-meter world record-holder and two-time 1,500-meter  Olympic champion, is running for Parliament in England on the conservative  party ticket. . . .  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's return is attracting attention to track and field usually  reserved for the Olympics. Promoters of the Sunkist Invitational Jan. 18 at the  Sports Arena and a meet in Hamilton, Canada, the week before have received  press credential requests from as far away as Europe. . . .  </P> <P> This is the most unselfish UCLA basketball team in years. . . .  </P> <P> Saturday will be doubleheader day in Westwood, where the Bruins play Notre Dame  in men's basketball at 4:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion and the final of the NCAA  women's volleyball regional is held at 7:30 at the Wooden Center. . . .  </P> <P> Don't ask me to get excited about Kevin Gross. . . .  </P> <P> Devon White's Angel career wasn't much different than Gary Pettis'. . . .  </P> <P> Imagine how much money Dennis Martinez -- who signed a three-year,  $9.25-million contract -- would have gotten from the Montreal Expos if he'd had  a winning record last season. . . .  </P> <P> Sometimes you get what you pay for. Baltimore had the lowest payroll in the  American League last season. Oakland had the highest in the West Division and  Boston the highest in the East. . . .  </P> <P> If the New York Mets had traded for Luis Sojo, they would have had Hojo and  Sojo. . . .  </P> <P> San Francisco could have a battery of Black and Decker -- veteran pitcher Bud  Black and young catcher Steve Decker. . . .  </P> <P> Former Raider safety Vann McElroy is giving the Seattle Seahawks' secondary the  toughness it has lacked since the retirement of Kenny Easley. . . .  </P> <P> So much for the science of scouting. Leading running backs Marion Butts of San  Diego and Johnny Johnson of Phoenix were seventh-round draft picks. . . .  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that the Kansas City Chiefs are the second-highest scoring  team in the AFC. . . .  </P> <P> Some backup NFL quarterbacks, among them Andre Ware, may be given permission to  play in the World League of American Football. . . .  </P> <P> The New England Patriots ought to bring Babe Parilli out of retirement. . . .  </P> <P> NFL justice: Sam Wyche's fine for closing his locker room to women reporters  was bigger than the combined fines of the three players involved in the Lisa  Olson incident. . . .  </P> <P> David Klingler is the leading candidate for college football player of the year  in Japan. . . .  </P> <P> Instead of a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez, Meldrick Taylor will box Aaron  Davis Jan. 19 at Las Vegas. . . .  </P> <P> The NCAA soccer championships made the World Cup seem like a scoring orgy. UCLA  won two games on penalty kicks after failing to score a goal, or allow one, in  270 minutes of regulation play and overtime. . . .  </P> <P> There's got to be a better way for the NHL to figure out its standings. . . .  </P> <P> The Kings' loss to Toronto Saturday at the Forum shouldn't have come as such a  shock. Los Angeles teams coming off long trips usually don't play well in their  first home game. . . .  </P> <P> The World Chess Championships need a 24-minute clock.  </P></p>

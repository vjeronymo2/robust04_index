			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACTEL, CELLULAR AGREE TO MERGER OF SOME INTERESTS  </P> <P> Pacific Telesis Group and Cellular Communications Inc. said Wednesday that they  would merge their cellular telephone interests in Ohio and Michigan in a move  that ultimately will further consolidate the growing industry.  </P> <P> The deal calls for San Francisco-based PacTel to invest at least $87 million  for an immediate 5% stake in Cellular Communications. Within the next six  years, PacTel could take over Cellular Communications entirely for another $600  million or more.  </P> <P> The merger is the latest in a series of recent moves by telecommunications  companies to strengthen their cellular operations throughout the world. They  are seeking to take advantage of huge projected growth in radio wave telephone  services fueled by new technology, improved transmission devices and declining  equipment prices.  </P></p>

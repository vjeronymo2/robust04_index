			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (6): 'No hassle if you hire' - How operators are financing acquisitions A RECENT survey of asset acquisition trends by Lombard Business Finance reveals that businesses hard-hit by the recession are still retrenching and plan to make fewer asset purchases in 1993. What the 'Sourcing of Finance by British Business' survey also shows is that of those companies that do intend making acquisitions, the current trend on financing methods is towards a cautious approach, with a high proportion of companies favouring self-financing where possible - except in vehicles. Here, there is a marked decline in the use of instalment credit (hire purchase/lease purchase) and a corresponding increase in the use of leasing and contract hire. The reasons are not hard to find. Not only does contract hire free capital within a business, but it also reduces a company's administrative burdens and allows it to concentrate on the core business - more important than ever in difficult trading times. That is why, a year ago, Gulf Oil put its fleet of 160 cars into the hands of PHH Allstar. During a review of internal costs it became apparent that company car administration was taking up too much management time. Mr Paul Henshaw, Gulf Oil's contracts manager, says: 'PHH Allstar put forward a proposal to take over responsibility for managing all aspects of the fleet. 'The arrangement is self-financing and after six months it is already clear that the operation is extremely cost-efficient. The cost of the fleet management fee is covered by the reduction in maintenance costs.' Mr Roderick Simpson, assistant managing director of Gardner Merchant, the contract catering organisation, which runs a 1,200-strong fleet, tells a similar story. 'Gardner Merchant offers expertise, economies of scale and experience. It was logical to hand over the running of our fleet to a company which provides a specialist fleet management service in order to reap similar benefits. 'Administering the fleet internally was taking up an increasing amount of time and staff could only react to problems that arose with the fleet, rather than plan and ensure that these problems didn't happen. We decided we were better off concentrating on the business we knew best - catering - and handing over the management of the fleet to a specialist. We are making a net saving, even taking into account the service fee.' Reducing internal administrative burdens is one good reason for switching to contract hire or fleet management, but it is by no means the only one; and during a recession many companies have found it makes sense to release the capital tied up in the fleet through some form of sale and lease-back deal. That was the main reason prompting retail group Aquascutum recently to change from owning and running its own 100-car fleet to opting for full contract hire with Fleet Management Services. 'They saw the advantages of releasing the considerable capital employed in the cars and they wanted a professional company to run the fleet both to save on management time and to ensure it was being operated in the most efficient possible way,' says Mr Pete McAree, sales director of FMS. But as more companies switch to contract hire or fleet management, it is not only the national and multinational fleet and leasing specialists which are picking up this extra business. Many individual dealers, supported either by their manufacturer-importer, or by one of the larger companies such as Dial Contracts which has launched a franchise system allowing dealers to take advantage of the economies of scale Dial can offer in terms of funding and vehicle acquisition, are also making local inroads into the contract hire market. 'It is definitely a growing area of the market for us', says Mr Stephen Cliff, business manager at BMW dealers Coombs of Guildford. 'Many businessmen and women are sick to death of owning cars and now simply want them provided with no hassle and funded with someone else's money. Three years ago we had five vehicles on contract hire, last year we added 40 and this year we will add another 60 to the portfolio.' Those are not big numbers in comparison to the contract hire specialists with up to 60,000 cars on their books but the growth potential for dealers is clear - and the customers seem to like what they get from a local firm. One of Coombs' contract hire customers is Roskel Contracts, which runs around 50 cars on its fleet. Mr Roger Harris, a director, says they changed from purchasing cars to contract hire for simplicity's sake: 'I'm told there are tax advantages, but that wasn't the reason. Contract hire is so much easier. If we get a rogue car, it's not our problem but the contract hire company's. 'We know exactly what each car will cost so it takes all the hassle out of running a fleet. All the niggles are passed on to the contract hire company.'</p>

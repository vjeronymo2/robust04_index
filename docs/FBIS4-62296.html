			<p>BFN     [Text] Uladzimir Zamyatalin, Belarusian prime minister's  press secretary, stated that "... implementing an agreement on  economic and monetary union between Belarus and Russia is  already under way." The implementation mechanism of the  agreement's first nine items, signed by Deputy Prime Minister  Oleg Saskavets on 30 April has, as a matter of fact, come into  force. It provides, the press secretary underlined, for removal  of customs duties on all types of Belarusian-Russian goods that  represent more than 30 percent of their costs. Uladzimir  Zamyatalin noted that Belarusian products will become  competitive on the Russian and CIS markets if their costs are  reduced by one-third. As early as May and June, orders received  by enterprises and sale of products that jammed warehouses will  tangibly influence the Belarusian economy. "According to  commitments stemming from the agreement," the press secretary  said, "the Republic will soon receive from the Russian side 200  billion rubles in credits to stabilize the Belarusian financial  system, as well as to level out prices and the average salary.  With the first part of the signed agreement taking effect, the  Belarusian Government can start improving a program designed to  stabilize the national economy in 1994-95, and undertake a range  of social protection measures. In particular, the decision  allowing pensioners to ride suburban trains free of charge is a  part of those measures."</p>

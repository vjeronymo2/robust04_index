			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Oceana back in the black THE OCEANA Consolidated Company, which has interests in stockbroking and finance, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 877,000 for the half year to end-September. The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 158,000 last time and was struck on turnover up from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 6.29m. A maiden interim dividend of 0.5p is declared, payable from earnings of 7.28p per share (2.43p losses). The directors said the improvement in profits reflected a continuing strong contribution from Charles Stanley, the stockbroker, its principal subsidiary. Trading in the second half had opened on a firm note, the directors added, although it was too early to predict the outcome for the full year.</p>

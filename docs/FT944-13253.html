			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: Linking up with schools Employers wanting to build links with education now have a growing body of experience to tap for ideas. Companies based in rural areas, in particular, can use a close link with a school to improve the skills of children who will later form their main pool of recruits, as well as to advertise themselves as good employers. UCB Films, the Belgian-owned packaging manufacturer, has set up a link with the local secondary school in Wigton, Cumbria, where it is the largest employer with a workforce of 800. Its three aims are to improve the attractiveness of careers with the company, to aid understanding of industry among teachers and, unusually, to share resources and experience. That means that the school's teachers provide foreign language tuition to company personnel, and assist with outdoor activities intended to help with management training and development for graduates, senior managers and supervisors. The services UCB provides to the school are tailored to run throughout the curriculum. It provides work experience, with two weeks guaranteed for every child in year 10 (14- and 15-year-olds. Staff also help with Young Enterprise companies - offering children management experience - and with the Young Engineer of Britain awards - which allowed pupils to help design a vehicle warning device for use at UCB's site. More imaginatively, it provides help with the history curriculum for 13-year-olds, with pupils visiting the site to help visualise the impact of the Industrial Revolution, and with GCSE geography, where pupils are allowed a perception of the production process, and of the importance of wealth creation. The link won this year's Gardner-Merchant/CBI Award for Excellence in Education Business Partnership, and is now recommended as an example for other companies to follow.</p>

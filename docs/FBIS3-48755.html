Macaspac] </F>   [Text] The European Parliament has withdrawn its support  to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Chairman Jose  Maria Sison, an official of the European Union told President  Ramos yesterday.    The official, Ben Visser, first vice chairman of the  parliamentary delegation visiting the country, said Sison, who  is based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, "no longer enjoys  substantial support in Western Europe."    "Sison and his followers are now considered an isolated  group  where before he had received sympathy and support from some  quarters," he said.    Visser, who belongs to the Party of European Socialists in  the Netherlands, explained that the change in attitude towards  Sison was on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist  ideology which now belongs to the past and has almost no future.    On the other hand, Gunther Rinshe, chairman of the  delegation, said that President Ramos' approach to the peace  process "is really impressive."    "It makes such a good impression that you are almost  considered as a model for all of us in our part of the world,"  Rinshe, a member of the European People's Party of Germany, said.    The president said that the Philippines is now enjoying a  period of relative peace which is people-based.    The peace process, the chief executive explained, was  arrived  at through a very thorough consultative process at the local  level.    The president, however, admitted having difficulties  negotiating with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the  National Democratic Front (NDF) which, he said, "may be  fragmented right now."    "But just the same, in spite of these difficulties, we have  offered the hand of peace to them so that we can finally come to  a just, honorable and lasting peace," the president said.    Meanwhile, President Ramos urged the members of the  delegation to consider possible cooperation in the field of  technology transfer and environmental protection between the  Philippines and European countries.    During their meeting, the president outlines several  policies  his administration is undertaking on the social and economic  upliftment of the Filipino people.    The president said the Philippines is also giving priority  to  power and energy development and upgrading of the  telecommunications and transportation systems.    He also cited the growing network of cooperation among the  countries in the Asia-Pacific which he said has developed to be  a cohesive union of countries.    "We are seeing enhanced stability because of economic  progress. The countries in our region are really becoming more  and more stable," he said.</p>

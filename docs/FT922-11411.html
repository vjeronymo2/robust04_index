			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: An EZ life ends LONDON'S Docklands moves into uncharted territory this weekend. From tomorrow, the area loses the enterprise zone status it won on April 26 1992. This does not necessarily harm the opportunities for investors to take advantage of tax concessions - measures announced before Christmas and likely to be enacted in the new Finance Act allow investors to profit from EZ tax concessions for up to two years after a building first comes into use. But life will be more hectic for the tenants of Docklands buildings (or at least, those who pay the rents) because rates will now be payable - even if, like many Docklands buildings, there is no occupant. According to John Harrison, of Investment and Tax Publishing Services, an expert on enterprise zone taxation, the precise level at which rates are levied could be controversial, because there is no clear base of comparison. Rates may not be as high as they are in the City of London, for example, and there might also be a case for keeping rateable values low until the public transport infrastructure is fully in place. Times are hard for Docklands developers in any case, as the much-publicised difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, responsible for the Canary Wharf development, make clear. A number of Docklands EZTs have problems. Last week PET 8, launched in 1989 and the biggest EZT of all, asked to defer its rent payments to investors. Globe Trust, the private property company which guaranteed the rental income, blamed the downturn in commercial rents and values for its difficulties. The trust owns Two Exchange Tower, at present only 40 per cent let. Investors who borrowed to finance their EZT investment could be seriously affected by delays in rent collection - they could lose the tax relief available if rental income is used to pay off the loan. The advent of rates will not make it any easier for Globe to meet its obligations. Confusion also reigns over CET 7, sponsored by IPS, who also sponsored Olympia &amp; York's Cabot Square Trust. CET7 was launched at the end of the last tax year to buy part of One Exchange Tower. It needed Pounds 26.3m, but according to Property Enterprise Managers, which handled the administration, only Pounds 12m was raised. The trust was not formally underwritten, which means that investors' money may need to be refunded. Negotiations are continuing to complete the deal. However, at present, according to PEM, 'the trust has been formed so that investors have units effectively allocated.' But it is a matter of getting the deal in the form the prospectus led them to expect, PEM adds. 'And if it doesn't work like that, allowing them to withdraw.' An injection of cash for One Exchange Tower might help meet the rent on Two Exchange Tower, but the situation should become more clearer in the coming weeks. The outlook, now Docklands is no longer an enterprise zone, could be gloomy. As Harrison says: 'If they can find tenants and let the buildings then the developers are off the hook. If they can't then they are stuck with paying the rent and from next week a potential charge for rates as well. That could be the last straw for some people. 'Against that, interest rates could be coming down and the banks might allow some leeway. That's the balancing act.'</p>

He did so  because he learned his lesson, and realized that swimming  against the tide of the Jewish lobby in the U.S. Congress could  put a spoke through his wheels and relegate him to the fate  suffered by Admiral Inman, who paid a price for not allowing  Israel to have access to Washington's military secrets 13 years  ago. Because of this, Inman was compelled to ask that his  nomination for the U.S. defense secretary position be withdrawn.  Similarly, acting against the wishes of the Jewish lobby could  also relegate Talbott to the fate of nominated Attorney General  Janet Reno, who, all of a sudden, turned in the eyes of the U.S.  press from a clever, trustworthy, and capable lady into a weak,  vain, careless, and indifferent woman because she failed to  recommend that Jewish spy Pollard be released or show a measure  of mercy toward him.    Talbott has chosen to disavow a host of ideas he upheld in  press articles published 13 years ago. In these articles, he  condemned the forcible seizure of territories, and deemed  necessary halting the domination of the Israeli civilian  establishment by the Israeli military establishment. His  rationale was that this would not only influence the future of  Israel, but also turn it into a liability overburdening U.S.  strategic interests in the Middle East and the world at large.    While being grilled by the Zionist lobby in the Congress  during his confirmation hearings, Talbott showed wisdom. He  made a turnabout, contending that most of the articles critical  of Israel that he has written were published a long time ago,  and that age has rendered him "wiser" than he was then. He  added: I have always believed that U.S.-Israeli ties are  unshakable. That my feelings regarding the strategic importance  of Israel have changed is a certainty. He was not contented  with disavowing his old ideas. He went further by saying that  he has always believed that a strong Israel serves the interests  of the United States, and that the latter should not apply any  form of pressure on a country to which it is bound by special  ties. He did not forget to pledge to refrain from any  activities related to Israel once his nomination is confirmed.    It should be recalled that the campaign against Talbott was  not designed to prevent him from taking the post. Otherwise, he  would not have taken it in the first place. It was only a slap  on the wrist, reminding him that he will remain under close  watch throughout his tenure at the U.S. State Department.    Given all this, one would say that the executive director of  AIPAC [the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] put it  right when he said that the Clinton administration was in his  pocket, "even before it was formed." In light of all this, do  we have the right to wonder as to the reasons for the  procrastination over the passage of a UN Security Council  resolution on the Hebron massacre, although there is a strong  international consensus condemning this heinous massacre?</p>

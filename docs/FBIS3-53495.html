			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, A'ina Al-Nar [January] 16, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY -- A source at the Secretariat of the General People's  Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation  welcomed the stance of China towards changing the U.N Security  Council [UNSC] as declared by the spokesman of the Chinese  Foreign Ministry asserting China's refusal of any change in the  Security Council before submitting the matter to all U.N member  states for debate and that the restructuring of the Security  Council to include Germany and Japan would not fulfil the desire  of some countries.    In a statement to JANA, the source said "while we welcome  the  Chinese stance and support it, we would like to stress that this  stance coincides with continuous call of the Great Jamahiriyah  for the [word indistinct] reconstruct the U.N granting all  peoples a role on the basis of justice and equality in  accordance with its charter to which those peoples responded to  the invitation to join this international organisation  especially as the smaller nations began to fear for their future  before the current state of the U.N which became the voice of  only the major countries hence the international organisation is  being harnessed to serve the interests and objectives of most  powerful countries. [no closing quotation marks as received]    The source pointed out that the Great Jamahiriyah, being at  the forefront of the peoples harmed by the current situation and  control of the Security Council by the major powers, sees in the  stance of China a major support for the position of the smaller  nations who are fearing for their future in the light of the  change of international organisation into an instrument of  threats against peoples and plots against their future and  spreading war amongst them instead of being a secure refuge for  peoples seeking to safeguard their future, an instrument for the  protection of their rights and maintenance of a genuine peace in  the world.    The leader of the revolution pointed out, on many occasions,  that the time has come for the restructuring of the U.N and  changing the Security Council as an organ of all nations and  that this change is the right of all member states and peoples  to whom it should be referred and discussed and express an  opinion about it and that the move towards opening the door of  granting permanent membership and veto in the Security Council  only to the industrial major powers is an orientation to crush  the smaller nations who suffered a great deal from the monopoly  of veto by the major powers for which these nations continue to  pay the price.    Thus the revision of the veto power is required so that the  decision making power should lie in the hands of the General  Assembly or the in the hands of all member peoples of this  organisation.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Top Finnish banks on credit watch Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Union Bank - have been placed on credit watch with 'negative implications' by the international rating company Standard and Poor's. This follows the announcement of a FM1.7bn (Dollars 383m) net loss by KOP last year and a deficit in 1991 of FM128m by Union Bank due mainly to high credit losses. Standard and Poor's said that its decision to place both banks on credit watch stemmed from their poor short-term prospects. It added that KOP seemed unlikely to issue equity in the short term because of the overall weakness of domestic share prices combined with the suspension of the 1991 dividend and there was likely to be a deterioration in KOP's core capital position. Union Bank's results were reported last Friday as a FM128m profit. This should should have read as a loss.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Hooked on motion - Alexander Calder's Moving Parts The Alexander Calder retrospective, now in the Sackler Galleries at the Royal Academy, comes to London from the Whitney in New York. Not over-large, it celebrates - perhaps a shade too earnestly - a talent itself stretched a shade too far. Such tends to be the American view of its own artists and their masterpieces. Yet the decorative charm and engaging physical nature of the works are undeniable, qualities reflected in the evident popularity of the show. Calder remains after all that comparatively rare bird, a modern and abstract artist of genuinely wide appeal. His reputation rests on a single technical innovation, which is now the commonplace of every nursery school, play-group and children's bedroom, the suspended and counterbalanced mobile, swinging and twisting prettily to every puff of air. Once established, however, the device proved to be one he would work only in terms of elegant and colourful variation, rather than actual formal development. Not for the last time, in American art especially, did such formal limitation provide the key to the critical pantheon. Such was Calder's 'breakthrough into style', and nothing exposes its creative inadequacies more cruelly than his attempts late in his career to move back to a more conventional method and sculptural statement, static and monumental. His reversion to what he called the 'Stabile' was a master-stroke of self-presentation, capitalising wonderfully in a mere syllable on what was by then his deeply ingrained success. Yet here again is the same formula, only writ large and without benefit of diversionary movement, the same amorphic silhouettes slotted and bolted together to arch and stride across the floor. The truth is that Calder was from the very first a derivative and essentially graphic - which is to say two-dimensional - artist, albeit blessed for the most part with an admirably light touch and graphic wit. The determining influences are manifest, Cocteau, Arp, Gabo and Miro in particular. They mark Calder as the eternal and unrepentant surrealist, for all the abstract nature of his mature work. Born in 1898, he had been in Paris in the late 1920s, living and working within the ambit of the School of Paris, and forming several lasting friendships. Though he was never resident for long, he was the one American artist whose reputation survived the Great War who was openly and closely associated with European modernism of the 1930s. The earliest work indeed is as intriguing as any for the way in which it toys with the sculptural possibilities of the graphic image. A portrait head, a pair of acrobats, a prancing horse, for example, are all drawn in wire very much in the manner of Cocteau's nervous sophistication. With the head of Varese in particular, made in 1931, the face comes forward, moving across and against the back of the head in hypnotic parallax, a movement the more active for being implicit and induced. Who knows where such playful openness may have led him, the more so when combined with such figurative imagery? In the event it was to be the actual physical movement that claimed him, for his first mobile dates from 1932, and abstraction with it. The pattern was set. Of what does the characteristic Calder mobile consist? A simple plane and brightly coloured shape, occasionally geometric but usually vaguely organic, leaf-like perhaps, is attached to a wire or rod and counterbalanced by another, or instead fastened to another similarly encumbered at the point of balance, and so by progression, the whole cranky and captivating structure is built up. Room must be allowed for each arm to sway past its neighbour-partner, the urge to test the possibility irresistible. The elements thus shift constantly in their relation to each other, the whole re-forming itself each instant. Nothing could be more charming or diverting, like watching a tree wave in the wind, or gulls wheeling and diving against the cliffs. But here is the problem which Calder never resolved, and which faces all artists who choose to introduce movement as an element and character of the work. For in the end, the artist may be forced to accept that what engages the viewer is not so much the work itself, but the movement alone, just as the snake is transfixed by the sway of the pipe. The test is quite simple: how dull these things are in their refinement when finally at rest - as too often they are at the Academy, where the visitor is not allowed to set them off again with a gentle touch. What is left is but a demonstration of elegant and repetitive ingenuity. We follow the scheme and principle of balance through the work like a map, wonder at the articulation and contrived asymmetry, and relish at last the oddities and improbabilities of gravity: but we hardly notice the work. Calder's influence is clear enough, and movement in sculpture once introduced is here to stay. But it works only when the artist accepts that the movement itself is the formal point, something not incidental but essential. It might be William Pye experimenting with water in motion, but turn off the tap and there is no sculpture; or George Rickey with his tall, precarious monuments to the wind. Most spectacular of all were the works of Peter Logan that were recently in London, occupying the Economist Plaza off St James's in the months either side of last Christmas. Whirling and turning in the gusting and eddying wind with a furious and dangerous precision, these beautiful objects, in fact no more than posts with mobile arms, held the imagination in endless fascination. The movement was all. At The Royal Academy, Piccadilly, until June 17 Sponsored by Guinness Peat Aviation, with help from the Henry Moore Foundation</p>

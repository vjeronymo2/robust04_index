			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Growing signs of vertigo as market reaches summit: Fund managers divided as US bonds soar Last week, more than two years into one of the strongest rallies in the history of US bond markets, long-term interest rates dropped below 6 per cent. By the close of trading on Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond stood at 5.94 per cent, three quarters of a percentage point lower than it was just six weeks ago, and the lowest in its 16-year life. But the rally in bonds has been so strong that some analysts are beginning to fear the market is riding for a fall. Just over a week ago, when bond yields were hovering slightly above 6 per cent, several brokerage houses cautioned that the bond market was close to overheating. They argued that investors were underestimating the strength of the US economy and warned that bond prices could tumble at the first sign of more robust economic growth. One firm, Bear Stearns, said the long end of the bond market was 'severely overbought', and predicted yields would jump back to more than 6.5 per cent within a few weeks. Another firm, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, also foresaw a correction, believing that economic growth in the second half of this year would be stronger than expected. The starkest warning has come from Nikko Securities' chief economist in New York, Mr Robert Brusca. He says inflationary pressures are building up in the economy more quickly than anyone realises. He also contends that market expectations are dangerously optimistic about the effectiveness of President Bill Clinton's first budget in reducing the deficit - a key factor in this year's rally. He sees bonds as ticking bombs, ready to go off in investors' faces. But most US institutional fund managers seem unconcerned about a correction. There are few signs that they are ready to shift billions of dollars out of bonds and into stocks, cash or overseas fixed-income assets. Mr Spike Thorne, who is in charge of fixed-income policy at the investment group Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark - responsible for about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39.7bn) of bond funds, is not worried about being caught off guard by a sharp correction. 'When the bond market makes an important top, it doesn't do so in a spike formation, but in a table top formation - in other words, you have a lot of time to see the market changing its direction.' While Mr Thorne admits that the bond market is not the good value it was last year, he does not see it peaking just yet. 'The market is focusing on a lousy business picture for 1994, not just in the US, but in Europe and Japan as well. There is a worldwide breeze blowing for lower interest rates.' Mr Gary Coburn, head of fixed-income at the Putnam group which manages Dollars 57bn of bond funds, says inflationary expectations are the key factor. 'It is hard to find any evidence of sustained upward price moves. In fact, you can argue the other way: that we are in a disinflationary environment. We don't anticipate any imminent changes. There is no need to run to cash or become very defensive.' Mr Wayne Lyski, portfolio manager at Alliance Capital, expects US interest rates to remain stable for the foreseeable future. 'The long-term call is for rates to remain pretty low.' His confidence is based on the worldwide economic outlook. 'Almost every country you look at has a goal of reducing its fiscal deficit, which implies constant pressure from the fiscal side to keep economic growth lower than it otherwise would be. And there is a long way to go before this fiscal cycle plays itself out.' But Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at the securities house Dean Witter, is keeping a close eye on the market for any danger signs. 'I'd be mindful of a correction in a market that has become obviously overheated.' This is reflected in Dean Witter's asset allocation recommendations to clients. It suggests the average investor should hold 60 per cent of a balanced portfolio in stocks and 15 per cent in cash or short-term instruments. This would leave only 25 per cent in bonds - well below the 35 per cent exposure level that the firm recommends in normal times. Other investment houses, while still liking bonds, see a better future in stocks. Goldman, Sachs recently recommended that clients should reduce their bond holdings from 40 to 30 per cent, and increase their equities exposure from 55 to 65 per cent. If there is one factor that might sustain the bond market's rally, it is liquidity. Billions of dollars continue to pour in, particularly from mutual funds and banks. Flows of investors' cash into bond funds jumped 22 per cent in July to a record Dollars 13bn, while banks, facing weak demand for loans and eager to improve the quality of their balance sheets, are greatly increasing their bond holdings. In the year to the end of June, banks upped their holdings of government securities by 14 per cent to Dollars 704bn. With so much money flowing in, with the economy fragile and inflation low, fund managers have few reasons for anxiety about bonds. As for what might trigger a sudden setback in the market, Mr Thorne muses: 'A significant improvement in the economy, maybe, or bad inflation news, or a shift to easier fiscal policy. Yet none of these are on the cards at the moment.'</p>

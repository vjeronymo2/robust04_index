			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Silvio Berlusconi has just finished a meeting  with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, to whom he submitted his  cabinet list.

[end recording]    [Colavolpe] Everything has been confirmed. The show of  strength over the appointment of Maroni to the Interior Ministry  has ended with victory for Umberto Bossi, as you just heard.  [passage omitted]    There were few surprises; most of the names had been the  subject of speculation for many days. Furthermore, as  Berlusconi left, he defended the amount of time that was  necessary in order to form the government which he stressed  would be a political one. He said that its first task will be to  re-launch the economy, although the unemployment problem will  not be forgotten. [passage omitted]    Berlusconi will return here tomorrow morning at 1100 in  order  to be sworn in along with his ministers.    That is all from the Quirinale Palace.</p>

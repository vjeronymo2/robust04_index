			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Burmese generals still jittery after all these years: With all opposition crushed, the junta is in no mood to ease up To sentence four men to death in a summary trial, to jail 1,000 innocent people for up to seven years after court hearings lasting as little as a minute, and to sack the police chief of the capital along with several junior officers might seem an exagerrated response to the death of a single student in a brawl. In Burma - where these actions were taken this month by the military junta, according to the official media and diplomats in Rangoon - such harshness and disregard for the due process of law barely raised a few eyebrows. The generals who have ruled Burma for three decades are believed to have acted with particular speed and severity to appease the dead man's fellow-students because a similar incident involving the stabbing of a student at a tea-shop sparked the pro-democracy uprising of 1988. Five years after crushing that uprising by killing thousands of Burmese civilians, the junta, now known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), looks more powerful than ever. The rebel armies of ethnic groups along the borders, such as the Karen and the Kachin, have reluctantly agreed to negotiate ceasefires with the government after years of guerrilla warfare. Foreign businessmen, especially from Singapore and Thailand, are providing Burma's generals with much-needed foreign currency by investing in hotels and other projects. Border trade with China is helping the Burmese economy to grow by as much as 6 per cent a year; Japan and the European Union are considering the resumption of humanitarian aid hitherto suspended in protest at the regime's human rights abuses. Organised domestic opposition to the Slorc has been crushed. Some of the 700 delegates to the national convention, a gathering appointed to rubber-stamp a new constitution entrenching the power of the armed forces, almost whimper with fear when spoken to by foreign journalists. It is easy to understand why. Mr Aung Khin Sint was jailed for 20 years last year because he had the temerity to remind his fellow-delegates that they had a duty to the Burmese people, a cryptic message taken to mean that they should stand up for their democratic beliefs at the convention. Buddhist monks, another group regarded as potentially dangerous by the Slorc, have either been imprisoned or bought off with gifts of televisions and endowments for their monasteries. No-one expected the Slorc suddenly to hand over power to civilians and take a back seat, but foreign diplomats are surprised that the increase of the junta's economic and political power over the past two years has not given the generals a greater sense of security or encouraged them to prepare a more liberal constitution. The outline of the new constitution now being drafted not only gives the military a role in the executive, the legislative and the judiciary, and in all levels of government from the national to the local, but also gives the armed forces complete autonomy in all military matters (including the defence budget) and the right to declare an emergency and take power whenever they please. 'Really, they are in such a strong position that they can give away a lot more than they have,' said one diplomat. Members of the Slorc, in an attempt to whip up popular support and justify the continued house arrest of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader, trumpet the army's nationalist credentials and repeatedly condemn supposed 'neo-colonialist' and 'imperialist' plots. Government officials criticise Ms Suu Kyi for having married a foreigner (a Briton) and the draft constitution bars those with foreign spouses from becoming president. The junta's latest political creation, a successor to failed pro-military political parties of the past, is the Union Solidarity and Development Association (Usda), a mass movement with civilian leaders whose activities - usually ending with 'rousing cheers' and 'tumultuous chanting of slogans' - have been reported in the state media every day since its foundation last September. Most of those attending Usda rallies are civil servants or schoolchildren given the day off work; before one such rally in Rangoon recently, pupils were told they would fail their exams if they did not go. Burma and Usda are often compared with Indonesia and its ruling party Golkar. Burma's generals have acknowledged they aspire to the influential if relatively discreet role of the army in Indonesia. The main difference - which may explain why the Burmese junta remains so insecure - is that the army in Burma is much more unpopular than its Indonesian counterpart.</p>

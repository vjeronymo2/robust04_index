He added that Cuba does not wish to  hasten the formalization of such ties.    Robaina made these statements and answered questions posed  by  reporters at an improvised news conference last night. He had  just ended a tour of the central provinces, where he was  accompanied by the diplomatic corps accredited in Havana.    We are not in a hurry or insisting on actions that are  beyond  what life itself imposes on all the countries, he said.    Regarding Chile and any other country with which we are  furthering talks to renew diplomatic relations, I would rather  maintain the same attitude we had with Colombia, Robaina stated.    The appropriate time appeared when life itself advised that  the renewal of relations was desirable, Robaina said in  reference to the recent renewal of ambassadorial-level relations  between Colombian and the island.    Cuban-Chilean relations were interrupted on 11 September  1973, when a bloody military coup, headed by General Augusto  Pinochet, toppled constitutional President Salvador Allende.    Currently, bilateral ties are at a consular level.</p>

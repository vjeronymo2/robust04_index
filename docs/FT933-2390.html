			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (9): Guard now against future governments' tax policies - Tax-efficient investments 1, Personal Equity Plans / Peps offer a useful shelter for capital gains, explains Philip Coggan, which is why some of their biggest users appear to be people with large portfolios AT FIRST sight, it might seem that the annual Pounds 6,000 limit on a personal equity plan would make little dent on a millionaire's portfolio - making Peps of only marginal interest to the wealthy investor. But since the first Peps were sold in 1987, a husband and wife could have accumulated over Pounds 92,000 if they had put in the maximum allowance each year (if you include the additional Pounds 3,000 single-company Peps, which started in 1992). Throw in a modest amount for growth and you have a six-figure portfolio. All income and gains made within a Pep are free from tax. Depending on the plan you choose, you may find that much of the income tax benefit is eaten up by management charges, at least in the early years. However, the benefits of a Pep are much more clear-cut for a 40 per cent taxpayer. A wealthy investor will also be able to use a Pep as a shelter against capital gains tax. Anyone with more than Pounds 100,000 in investments might find it quite easy to make gains greater than the annual CGT threshold - Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the biggest users of Peps to date have been investors with large portfolios, who have gradually switched their holdings into a tax-free form. The snag is that there are only relatively limited circumstances in which shares can be transferred directly into a Pep. Instead, the shares must be sold and then bought again via the Pep manager. That incurs dealing costs; but, even more important, it creates a liability to capital gains tax at the time of sale. So there needs to be careful planning when existing shares are placed in a Pep. One route might be to take the opportunity to sell some unprofitable holdings, realising a CGT loss which will offset the gain on the shares you want to place inside the Pep. Brian Tora, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton, says he uses a Pep as a chance to take a critical look at a client's portfolio. 'Are there any investments which can be sold to raise cash? That cash can then be used to invest in the latest ideas, and put those investments in a Pep.' Once inside a Pep, the investor can switch between shares without any fear of the tax consequences. The only real restrictions are the need to be in shares, not gilts or cash. Cash can only be held as a short-term measure while funds are 'awaiting investment', which may restrict the manoeuvrability of an investor who wants to pull out of shares at the top of the market. Finding the right Pep manager is, of course, an important part of the process. Most private client stockbrokers will provide their own Pep, but charges can vary enormously between firms. Chase de Vere publishes an annual Pep guide* which gives details of managers and their charging structures. If you already use a stockbroker, you may find that the convenience of keeping all your investments in one place may be more important than the saving you will make by moving to a lower-charging broker. Alternatively, you could concentrate your Pep portfolio on unit and investment trusts (although you cannot use the Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep allowance for collective funds). Some unit trust Pep groups, such as Fidelity, have a low front-end charge, with an exit fee for those who sell during the early years; provided you are prepared to invest for the long term, this might be an attractive charging structure. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge for Peps; nevertheless, the overall charges of an investment trust will usually be lower. Split-capital investment trust shares can also form part of an overall investment strategy; for example, someone who is bullish on the market, but who regularly faces a CGT bill, might place capital shares within a Pep to get the maximum tax-free capital gain. Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds show how a Pep really can pay off over the long term. Someone who invested Pounds 1,000 in the median UK equity income unit trust would have seen his investment grow to Pounds 1,436 over the five years to July 1. Had the money been in the same fund, but in a Pep, the money would have grown to Pounds 1,549. Over 10 years, the difference is slightly greater: Pounds 4,298, compared with Pounds 5,028 within a Pep. But over 25 years, the difference is startling; Pounds 21,945 in a taxed environment, against Pounds 38,073 for a Pep. Those are powerful statistics for any 40-year-old thinking of additional ways of saving for his or her retirement. But perhaps the best argument for a Pep is that no one knows what future tax policy will be. With the government running a Pounds 50bn budget deficit, the wealthy may well face an increase in their tax burden. For them, the more money that can be tucked away in a tax-free environment, the better. * Available for Pounds 9.95 from: Chase de Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JX.</p>

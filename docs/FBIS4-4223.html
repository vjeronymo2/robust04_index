			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Chinese Central Authorities Wait Patiently for Talks With Dalai  Lama"]    [Text] XINHUA yesterday dispatched a report about the  comment by a spokesman for the CPC Central United Front Work  Department, who described the situation of economic construction  in Tibet Autonomous Region and also expounded on the Central  Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama. The spokesman  revealed, for the first time, the details of the contacts  between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's personal  representatives in order to pave the way for the talks between  the two sides.    The Chinese Government's willingness to hold talks with the  Dalai Lama because it hopes that he and his followers will  return to the motherland, terminate their lives of exile, and do  something beneficial to the motherland's unification and the  well-being of the Tibetan people. For the past more than 40  years, substantial progress has been made in the economic  development of Tibet Autonomous Region, which has not be  obstructed by the Dalai Lama's fleeing and the separatist  activities he has plotted abroad. Tibet previously pursued the  backward feudal serf-owning system but great social and economic  changes have already occurred. The Tibetan population has  increased from some 1 million in the 1950's to over 2 million  today. The fine cultural tradition of the Tibetan Nationality  has been maintained and developed.    In the past, Beijing has not revealed anything about  contacts  with the Dalai Lama's personal representatives because there was  a mutual promise to keep such things confidential and not  publicize the contacts. However, the Dalai Lama's side has  violated the promise many times, not only making public such  contacts but also distorting the contents of the talks. Thus,  Beijing could not but come out and make a clarification.    According to the spokesman for the CPC Central United Front  Work Department, since 1979, the departments concerned in the  central government agreed to allow the Dalai Lama's personal  representatives to return to China and have also received them  many times, seriously listening to the Dalai Lama's opinions  conveyed by his envoys. The central leaders also attended the  meetings personally. Deng Xiaoping was present at one such  meeting in 1979. The contacts were suspended for a certain  period for reasons concerning the Dalai Lama's side. In 1992  and 1993, the central departments concerned again received the  Dalai Lama's personal representatives on two occasions.    Although contacts were made many times, they did not  successfully lead to holding talks. The crux of the problem was  obvious: The Dalai Lama refused to acknowledge that Tibet is an  inalienable part of China. The central government insisted that  the principle was the foundation for the talks and the guarantee  for achieving results but the Dalai Lama denounced this as  setting "a precondition and obstacle" to the talks.    When receiving the Dalai Lama's personal envoy in 1979, Deng  Xiaoping said: "The fundamental issue is that Tibet is part of  China. The rights and wrongs should be judged according to this  criterion." This is a major issue of principle. All Chinese  people, no matter what political position they may hold and no  matter whether they are Hans or Tibetans or other national  minorities, they all share the same sacred responsibility to  safeguard the country's unification and territorial integrity.    The Dalai Lama must acknowledge that Tibet is an inalienable  part of China. If he is willing to do this, the talks on  anything else will be easy. If he refuses to acknowledge this,  how can talks be possible? However, the Dalai Lama was only  keen to advocate "Tibetan independence" and even described Tibet  as an "occupied country." Even so, the central government is  still waiting patiently for the Dalai Lama to come around.    The international community generally acknowledges that  Tibet  is China's territory but some people in the West, such as some  of the British mass media, are still unwilling to "lose" Tibet  and continue to assert the "Chinese people's occupation of  Tibet" in their news reports. Some other people in the West  have tried to seek mental comfort, taking it as chic to discuss  Tibet's Lama religion and to worship the Dalai Lama. The Dalai  Lama is not a purely religious figure. Over a long period of  time, he has been a political exile engaged in the activities of  splitting the motherland. Therefore, the Chinese Government and  the Chinese people resolutely oppose audiences granted to the  Dalai Lama by any officials of foreign governments.</p>

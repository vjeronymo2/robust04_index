			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Turnround takes ERF to Pounds 0.8m Correction (published 17th December 1994) appended to this article. Recovery in the UK truck market and some non-European export markets helped produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 801,000 at ERF (Holdings) in the six months to October 1, against a Pounds 613,000 loss in the comparable period. The turnround follows accumulated losses of more than Pounds 9m in the previous four years, when ERF and all other truck makers suffered from the most severe European market slump on record. In the second half of last year ERF made Pounds 453,000 - not enough to prevent a loss of Pounds 26,000 for the year as a whole. In the current half-year gearing fell to 41.9 per cent, against 63.5 per cent at the end of the previous year. Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 91.8m (Pounds 66.9m). An interim dividend of 2p (nil) is payable from earnings per share of 4.6p (7.53p loss). UK sales were 25 per cent higher, but those to export markets, particularly South Africa, jumped by 95 per cent. ERF's 43.9 per cent stake in ERF South Africa earned it Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 78,000). Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said he regarded South Africa as a major potential growth area. CORRECTION The stake held by ERF Holdings, the UK truck maker, in ERF South Africa is 56.1 per cent and not 43.9 per cent as incorrectly stated yesterday. Production is currently running at 15 to 16 trucks a day and not a week as stated in the world commercial vehicles survey.</p>

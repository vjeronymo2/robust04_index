			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] General Dogan Gures, chief of the General  Staff, has proposed that the ground forces serving in  Bosnia-Herzegovina under the United Nations be placed under  NATO's command.    The NATO Military Committee meetings, where the developments  in Bosnia-Herzegovina were mainly discussed, have ended in  Brussels. Gen. Dogan Gures, who attended the meetings, held a  news conference in Brussels this morning. He pointed out that  NATO is troubled about Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that the debates  at the Military Committee focused on the respectability and  prestige of the alliance.    ANATOLIA reports that at his news conference, Gen. Gures  pointed out that NATO is decisive about Bosnia-Herzegovina but  that the political decision must be made by the United Nations.  He also said that to establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  air force and navy are not enough, and that the ground forces in  that country must be placed under NATO's command even if they  remain under UN control. [passage omitted]    Gen. Gures then left Brussels for Paris as the guest of his  French counterpart.</p>

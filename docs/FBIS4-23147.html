			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama by </F> unidentified correspondents "shortly before departure" to the  United States; place not given]    [Text] [Announcer] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  leader Afonso Dhlakama has left for the United States. Afonso  Dhlakama's visit to the United States is primarily aimed at  briefing the American people on the progress of the peace  process and reaffirming Renamo's acceptance of the UN Security  Council Resolution on Mozambique.    In an interview with journalists shortly before departure,  Dhlakama said that if the United States today recognizes that  there is peace and freedom in Mozambique, this is due to  Renamo's struggle. He was answering a question on existing  misunderstandings between the U.S. Administration and Renamo.    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am fully convinced that the  situation is different now. We all know that historically the  United States played a very bad role in Mozambique. It  supported the Communist regime of the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo] Party. They never tried to pressure Frelimo to  accept peace talks. This made the war last longer, causing more  deaths. I think, however, that with the end of war the United  States recognizes that there is now peace, democracy, and  freedom due to Renamo's struggle. I am fully convinced that  changes exist there.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] at a time when we are  preparing for the beginning of voter registration? What is  [words indistinct] Renamo areas have not yet been opened?    [Dhlakama] Well, the areas have been opened. They have been  opened. I have said on several occasions that it is the Frelimo  government which is sabotaging the process. Mechanisms have  been created to reunite the two administrations. Renamo  advisers were appointed to carry out work jointly with the  provincial governors. What is happening now? These advisers are  not doing their work because the Frelimo government is  sabotaging it. It does not provide them transportation and thus  they cannot move about.    I believe, however, that a solution is being found now. The  territorial commission, established during the General Peace  Accord to deal with these issues, held a meeting last week and  it was agreed that the Mozambican Government would immediately  appoint administrators in areas under Renamo control. The  meeting also agreed that the government would establish police  stations in Renamo-controlled districts and posts, under the  supervision of the United Nations and the National Commission  for Police Affairs [Compol].    This means that we are moving forward. Evidently, Frelimo  tried to sabotage this process which should have begun months  back.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] voter registration  process  will [words indistinct]?    [Dhlakama] Absolutely. There are no problems. This will  depend on the work of the voter registration teams. The teams  are made up of elements close to the Frelimo Party. According  to the law, it is the public service [words indistinct] the  Frelimo Party doing this. Opposition parties have their  elements in each team, however, in order to monitor the voter  registration process. If we observe that there are  irregularities [words indistinct]. We want all the Mozambican  people, without discrimination, to take part in voter  registration. [end recording]    [Announcer] Referring to the national conference unarmed  opposition parties and Renamo held in Xai-Xai, Afonso Dhlakama  said the meeting was positive, pointing out that it made  positive steps forward toward defeating Frelimo in the October  elections.</p>

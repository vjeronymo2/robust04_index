			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antoine Constantine in Beirut] </F>   [Text] Following the assassination of Talib al-Suhayl, an  Iraqi Opposition figure residing in Beirut, reports in the  Lebanese capital speak of a crisis in the Iraqi-Lebanese  relations. Some went so far as to say that the Lebanese  Government intends to close down the Iraqi Embassy and deport  the Iraqi diplomats.    Pending the political results of the assassination, we  review  the security information connected with the murder. Al-Suhayl  was killed in his house the day before yesterday. The  investigation judge in Beirut issued arrest warrants against  Khalid Khalaf, the commercial counsellor, and Muhammad Kazim,  the cultural counsellor. Another arrest warrant was also issued  against a third individual who reportedly participated in  carrying out the murder and subsequently took refuge in the  embassy.    After learning of the the involvement of two Iraqi diplomats  in the operation, the security forces laid an invisible siege  around the embassy and arrested Khalaf and Kazim and found  weapons, pistols, and silencers in their possession.    'Awad Fakhri, the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon, who  was  summoned to the Foreign Ministry, said: The foreign minister  informed me of the incident. We support the Lebanese  authorities and we respect the Lebanese judiciary.    Fakhri denied that he had known that the dead man was an  Iraqi national.    Talib al-Suhayl was one of the chiefs of the Iraqi shiite  tribe of Tamim. He left Iraq after the 1958 revolution and  sought refuge in Jordan and then in Saudi Arabia. This explains  why he carries Jordanian and Saudi passports. His name was  mentioned in a number of papers a few weeks ago as having been  involved in an attempt to assassinate President Saddam Husayn.    The Foreign Ministry is considering ways to deal with this  issue from the diplomatic viewpoint because the arrested  diplomats enjoy diplomatic immunity. It has been learned that,  as a precautionary measure, the Lebanese Embassy's charge  d'affaires in Baghdad has been summoned to Beirut and has  already left the Iraqi capital.</p>

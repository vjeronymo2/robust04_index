			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> BOATS LOOK FOR ALBACORE TO KEEP GETTING CUSTOMERS  </P> <P> The albacore aren't going to come to the fleet, so the fleet is going after the  albacore.  </P> <P> The Predator, out of H&amp;M Landing in San Diego, returned Tuesday from a 1  1/2-day exploratory run, which proved fruitless, according to Bill Dowling at  the landing.  </P> <P> Dowling said skipper Mark Hall did encounter a school of bluefin tuna but added  there were no hookups. Hall did not say where he was fishing.  </P> <P> "Nobody has spotted any (albacore)," Dowling said. "We've been looking at all  the other long-range boats that are coming in (from the other landings), and  none of them have brought any albacore back."  </P> <P> The Seabisquit, out of Islandia Sportfishing, will embark on a two-day  exploratory run late Saturday night. Asked why, owner Bob Hodgden replied:  "Economics, I guess. We need the fish."  </P> <P> Hodgden said he will work an area not fished by the long-range boats returning  up the Baja California coastline. "I'm going to try it farther outside, more to  the west of those people," he said. "Hopefully . . . who knows?"  </P> <P> With yellowtail fishing having slowed substantially in recent days, such runs  are going to be necessary if the fleet is going to find the popular tuna and  maintain an adequate flow of customers.  </P> <P> "You've got to look for them to find them," biologist Michael Laurs said of the  albacore. Laurs, a migratory species expert with the National Marine Fisheries  Service, said he has had few reports of albacore from San Diego skippers,  mostly because there has been little effort by the fleet, which has been  content fishing the offshore kelp paddies for yellowtail.  </P> <P> Laurs did offer a bit of optimism, however, claiming that the body of albacore  that made a brief showing in early May could show again any time.  </P> <P> "That body of fish will eventually show up in the Southern California Bight  again," he said. "Based on all the tagging studies, once the fish get into the  bight, they remain for the remainder of the season."  </P> <P> Laurs said a few albacore are starting to show several hundred miles off the  coast near Mendocino, adding that they are heading toward the coast off the  Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> While sport fishermen on the coast have for the most part stopped fishing for  white sea bass off Santa Catalina Island, anglers living on the island have  found the fish are still there. The bite continues to be strong, but it's in  the middle of the night.  </P> <P> "There's fish in there and they're big ones," said John Cadman, 36, a resident  of Avalon. Cadman said he and friends have been battling fish regularly after  midnight in an area near the rock quarry, just outside the harbor.  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't realize that these things will bite in the middle of the  night," he said, adding that the biggest so far is a 50-pounder caught by Larry  Mebust, a commercial fisherman who normally targets swordfish.  </P> <P> "He heard there were a lot of sea bass, and the swordfish bite has completely  shut off, so he decided to take a little break," Cadman said. "He came in here  and got a 50-pounder."  </P> <P> A similar bite is reportedly occurring on the backside of the island near the  isthmus, Catalina and Shark harbors.  </P> <P> "They've been catching some pretty big ones themselves, 30- to 40-pounders,"  Cadman said.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The Pasadena Casting Club will have its annual auction -- with fly fishing  trips and various items -- Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the Masonic Temple in San  Marino.

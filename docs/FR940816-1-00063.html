			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This reintroduced population of gray wolves is proposed to be designated as a nonessential experimental population according to the provisions of section 10(j) of the Act. As previously stated, the experimental population of wolves would be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This enables the Service to propose a special rule that can be less restrictive than the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. In the case of the Yellowstone reintroduction, the biological status of the species, and the need for management flexibility in reintroducing the gray wolf has resulted in the Service proposing to designate the reintroduced wolves as ``nonessential''. The Service has found that the nonessential designation, in concert with protective measures, is necessary to conserve and recover the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that wolves will come in contact with the human population and domestic animals inside and outside of the Park. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected local, State, and Federal government officials have indicated that wolves can not be reintroduced without assurances that current uses of public and private lands would not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental taking of wolves by the public if incidental to otherwise lawful activities, and taking in defense of human life would not be prohibited_provided such takings are reported to the Service or to an authorized agency within 24 hours. Certain Federal, State, and/or Tribal employees would be authorized by the Service to take wolves needing special care or posing a threat to livestock or property. Livestock owners with grazing allotments on public land and private land owners or their immediate designates would be permitted to harass adult wolves in an opportunistic non-injurious manner on their allotments or private property at any time, provided that such harassment would have to be reported within 7 days to a Service-designated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed status, livestock owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments, but only after 6 or more breeding pairs were established in the Park or experimental area. Such take, moreover, would only be permitted after due notification to Service designated agencies, unsuccessful efforts to capture the offending wolf by such agencies, and documentation of additional livestock losses. Private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or dead livestock) that such an attack occurred at the time of the taking would have to be clearly evident in such instances. Such take would be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or agencies authorized by the Service for investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves that repeatedly (2 times in a calendar year) attack domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine, goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private property would be designated as problem wolves and would be moved from the area by the Service or a designated agency. Wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being relocated once after such previous conflicts would be designated chronic problem wolves and be removed from the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations will be the primary cause for failure of States or Tribes to meet their specific big game management objectives outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Nor is such predation likely to inhibit wolf population increases. However, if the Service deemed it necessary, wolves from the responsible packs could be translocated to other sites in the experimental area to resolve such predation problems. Wolves could not be deliberately killed to resolve wolf predation conflicts with big game while the experimental population of wolves were listed. However, such take is expected to be rare and is unlikely to significantly affect the overall rate of wolf recovery. The States and Tribes would define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before such actions could be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves would be moved on a case-by-case basis to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental population area. Generally there would not be attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing in this area, although this may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UPSETS REAGAN ORDER ON CITIZENSHIP  </P> <P> In a ruling blocking citizenship for possibly hundreds of Filipinos serving in  the U. S. Navy, a federal judge Thursday invalidated an executive order --  signed by President Reagan -- extending citizenship to foreign members of the  military who participated in the 1983 U. S. invasion of Grenada.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam ruled in a case involving a Filipino  sailor that Reagan overstepped his authority by imposing a geographical  limitation in the directive.  </P> <P> Gilliam's ruling also means that an undetermined number of permanent resident  aliens of any nationality who were in the military and were naturalized solely  because of their participation in the Grenada invasion could be stripped of  citizenship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Citizenship Rules  </P> <P> Except for Filipino sailors who enlist in the Navy in the Philippines, U. S.  law allows permanent resident aliens who serve honorably in the armed forces  for at least three years to be naturalized. Filipino nationals, 400 of whom are  allowed under a little-known agreement between the U. S. and Filipino  governments to enlist in the Navy each year without first obtaining permanent  U. S. residency, can qualify for citizenship only if they serve on active duty  during war.  </P> <P> It is not known how many permanent resident aliens are affected by Gilliam's  ruling. However, immigration experts noted that the Grenada invasion occurred  more than five years ago, giving those aliens enough time to petition for  citizenship under the provision that they served honorably for three years.  </P> <P> Instead, Gilliam's ruling has a direct affect on an unknown number of Filipino  nationals who participated as sailors in the Grenada invasion.  </P> <P> If Gilliam had struck down the geographical limitation in Reagan's order of  Feb. 4, 1987, as requested by Arthur Reyes, a San Diego-based Navy enlisted man  who sued the Immigration and Naturalization Service for citizenship, an  estimated 1,700 Filipino sailors could have qualified for U. S. citizenship,  according to the Navy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Obscure Statute  </P> <P> Reyes, an eight-year veteran, had sued on grounds that the "legislative  history" of an obscure immigration statute prohibits the President from  imposing a geographical limitation when he declares a period of hostilities.  Reagan declared the time between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2, 1983 -- the time of the  invasion -- to be a period of military hostilities.  </P> <P> Gilliam agreed with Reyes' argument, but he ruled that it was not Reagan's  intent that every alien serving anywhere during the nine days of the invasion  become eligible for citizenship.  </P> <P> Reyes, a petty officer first class, is on sea duty and was unavailable for  comment Thursday. His attorney, Robert Mautino, said he will probably appeal  Gilliam's ruling. Attorneys for the INS could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In a seven-page ruling mailed to attorneys in the case, Gilliam wrote that "the  order is struck down in its entirety" because it was illegal for Reagan to  limit it only to those servicemen who participated in the Grenada invasion.  </P> <P> Reyes, 30, and a law school graduate, sued the INS in June after the agency  rejected his petition for citizenship. Reyes argued, and Gilliam agreed, that  since World War I, and through all subsequent wars, Congress has refused to  attach a geographical limitation to the immigration statute.  </P> <P> "The President's order goes against the intent of Congress," Gilliam said in  the written ruling. "As such, he is attempting to contravene the will of  Congress." However, Gilliam noted that the statute gives the President the  authority to designate a period of hostilities.  </P> <P> Ben Patron, a chief petty officer and nine-year Navy veteran, said that  "everybody is frustrated by the judge's ruling. How can he undeclare a declared  period? I don't understand it." Patron is president of the American Servicemen  Citizenship Assn., a group of Filipino sailors organized to lobby for  citizenship rights.  </P> <P> Reyes was serving in San Diego at the time of the invasion, but argued that he  deserved to be naturalized under the statute because the law had never included  a geographical limitation. Gilliam agreed, and further noted that any U. S.  serviceman could be sent to a war zone at any time.  </P> <P> As an example, Reyes referred to Navy corpsman Godofredo Romanillos Quirante,  who enlisted in the Philippines and was among the more than 240 U. S.  servicemen who died when Muslim terrorists bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut  two days before the Grenada invasion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precedent Cited  </P> <P> Judge Gilliam said that precedent allowed for immediate naturalization under  the statute "regardless of where the person served" during a period of war.  </P> <P> But Gilliam rejected Reyes' request to strike down only the geographical  limitation included in Reagan's order. To do this would permit all aliens in  the armed forces to become naturalized, regardless of where they were  stationed, Gilliam said.  </P> <P> To strike down the geographical limitation would cause Reagan's order to lose  "its intended meaning," Gilliam said.  </P> <P> "It was not the President's intent that every alien serving anywhere during the  nine days of the invasion become eligible for citizenship," he said.  </P></p>

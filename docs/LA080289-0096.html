			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAI HIKES BID FOR PRIME UNIT TO $525 MILLION  </P> <P> MAI Basic Four, hoping to keep alive its chances of acquiring Prime Computer's  minicomputer business, on Tuesday revised its offer for the operation to $525  million in cash.  </P> <P> Previously, MAI offered $450 million in cash and notes with a face value of  $150 million for the unit. Analysts said the new all-cash offer probably will  be more attractive to Prime's lenders, however, because of the uncertain market  value of the securities that MAI had offered.  </P> <P> MAI, a Tustin computer maker controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow,  recently dropped its nine-month effort to buy all of Prime. Instead, it is  seeking to purchase only Prime's minicomputer business, which accounts for  one-third of the Natick, Mass., computer company's sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whitney Offer Snagged  </P> <P> Prime has rebuffed all of MAI's previous overtures, and on June 23 it agreed to  be acquired by J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York venture capital firm, in a  deal valued at $1.4 billion. The Whitney buyout hit a snag last week, however,  when Chemical Bank in New York and First National Bank of Boston asked Whitney  to raise more financing because of Prime's deteriorating financial condition.  </P> <P> The bank's request came one day before Prime reported a $19-million loss for  the quarter ended June 30.  </P> <P> Whitney has said it is negotiating with potential lenders to try to raise the  additional financing. Donald Ackerman, a Whitney general partner, declined to  comment Tuesday on efforts to secure that financing.  </P> <P> Some analysts have said that Whitney's financing difficulties could help MAI's  chances of buying the minicomputer business.  </P> <P> MAI said in a prepared statement that it amended its offer, which expires Aug.  9, "with a view to simplifying the choices available" to Prime's directors and  shareholders. A company spokeswoman declined further comment,  </P> <P> Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the company's board would meet to review  MAI's new offer.  </P></p>

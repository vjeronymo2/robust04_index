			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: An integrated approach / A look at a consultancy firm's ambitious plans Change management has been around a while - yet judging by a Price Waterhouse announcement this week the idea looks to have plenty of life left in it yet. In a move designed to consolidate the fastest growing part of the firm's business, the international management consultancy practice unveiled details of a plan bringing together its previously separate strategic, operational and information technology consulting services. The aim of the exercise - which has cost more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) to implement over the last year - is to respond better to what PW perceives to be a growing demand for large-scale change programmes across organisations and across national borders. This type of activity already accounts for about 20 per cent of the firm's fee income - from a standing start in mid 1990 - and is said to have pulled in more than Dollars 250m of worldwide business in the last year alone. PW's message - that companies too often opt for piecemeal solutions and that what they really need is a unified approach - is not exactly leading edge stuff; it has also been promoted by KPMG and Andersen Consulting among others. PW's reorganisation is nevertheless an indication that chief executives are increasingly confused by the myriad of different gospels currently being preached by the consultancy industry. PW's approach has three main strands: * The integration of the six 'main levers' of change - people and culture; processes and systems; structure; technology; markets; and products and services. * A strong focus on securing the commitment of interested groups. * New software to assist in identifying best practices and performing process analysis. Backing up its ideas PW has simultaneously published a book called 'Better Change', claimed to be a practical guide for everyone initiating, leading, or affected by large-scale change programmes. It sets out 15 'key principles' which PW has gleaned from its collective experience. * Confront reality. 'We are all highly vested in the seductive notion that what we have built will continue to flourish.' * Focus on strategic contexts. Knowing where to invest in change - where to seek improved performance - will separate the victors from the vanquished. * Summon a strong mandate. This is generally provided by top management, but it should be amplified by the voice of the customer. * Set scope intelligently. Focus on measurably improving performance in areas most important to the organisation and its key stakeholders. * Build a powerful case. You cannot assume others are prepared for change. * Let the customer drive change. Serving customers is a powerful common denominator in an organisation. * Know your stakeholders. Powerful individuals and groups have stakes in changes being contemplated. * Communicate continuously. Clear, succinct messages will be understood. Honest messages will be believed. * Reshape your measures. Take the time to re-evaluate and, if necessary, dismantle old measures. * Use all of the levers of change. (markets and customers, product and service offerings, the organisational structure). * Think Big. Small thinking dominates many projects, with predictable results. *Leverage diversity. Women and minorities 'help to shake the old paradigms and where necessary replace them'. * Build skills. Over-invest in human capital. * Plan. 'To drive change you must develop a documented and detailed action plan for change.' * Integrate your initiatives. 'Savvy executives strive to balance the entrepreneurship of high-initiative managers with the need to adhere to a focused strategy.'</p>

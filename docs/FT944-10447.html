			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Seet Shares of Seet dropped 7p to 44p yesterday after the textiles group reported sharply increased annual losses. The group also announced that Homemaker Shops, its 47.7 per cent-owned lossmaking associate, had sold its trading assets to Florida-based Linen Supermarket; the directors estimate that Seet will receive between Dollars 1.71m and Dollars 1.96m (Pounds 1.19m) but under Stock Exchange rules will have to seek shareholder approval to remit the proceeds as capital. On turnover of Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 6.5m including Pounds 1.69m from discontinued activities), pre-tax losses for the 12 months to April 30 widened from Pounds 60,840 to Pounds 321,160. The outcome took in losses of Pounds 41,383 (profits of Pounds 75,336) at Homemaker and an exceptional write down against the US operation of Pounds 130,957. Nevertheless, Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, remained upbeat. There had been a 'significant improvement' since the year end, he said, with turnover at Peter MacArthur, the group's leading tartan manufacturer, 'well ahead' on a year-on-year basis. The Homemaker disposal eliminated bank borrowings - interest charges dropped from Pounds 148,853 to Pounds 26,672. Losses per share were 8.88p (1.8p).</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUBERT BEUVE-MERY; FOUNDER OF FRENCH NEWSPAPER LE MONDE  </P> <P> Hubert Beuve-Mery, who founded the independent Le Monde in 1944 at a time when  other Parisian newspapers stood accused of Nazi sympathies and then  meticulously nursed it into France's most influential daily, has died at the  age of 87, the newspaper announced Monday.  </P> <P> Beuve-Mery died Sunday night in Fontainebleau, where he had been hospitalized  for the last week after a fall, Le Monde said.  </P> <P> "He was a great leader," Jacques Fauvet, Beuve-Mery's successor as  editor-in-chief and publisher of Le Monde, said on French radio. "He had great  independence of spirit and moral authority at the same time."  </P> <P> The austere tabloid, its gray expanses only recently disturbed by photographs,  became known for its authoritative and thorough coverage of foreign and  domestic affairs, complete with footnotes in tiny print.  </P> <P> "Only a constant emulation between those who read a newspaper and those who  edit it can permit the pursuit, with some chance of success, of this quest for  truth, which is our principal reason for being," Beuve-Mery wrote on his  retirement in 1969.  </P> <P> Le Monde has always been left-of-center, but marked by an independence from  political parties that was unusual in French journalism.  </P> <P> Under a complicated distribution of stock, the Le Monde staff has control of  the newspaper. The staff members also elect the newspaper's director, who  serves as editor-in-chief and publisher.  </P> <P> Beuve-Mery was born Jan. 5, 1902, in Paris, where his father was a jeweler and  watchmaker. He was correspondent for the Paris daily Le Temps in Prague from  1934-38, when he resigned in protest over the paper's approval of the German  invasion of Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> When France was liberated in 1944, Le Temps and other prewar newspapers tainted  by the occupation were not allowed to resume publication. Beuve-Mery and a  small group of liberal journalists and intellectuals were asked to start a new  newspaper in the old Le Temps building on the Boulevard des Italiens near the  Paris Opera in an effort to rebuild French prestige.  </P> <P> They were encouraged by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, but De Gaulle later had his  problems with the paper's left-leaning approach to international affairs.  </P> <P> Beuve-Mery guided Le Monde's fortunes for the next quarter of a century,  writing occasional editorials under the pseudonym "Sirius."  </P> <P> Still required reading for the influential throughout the French-speaking  world, Le Monde's influence in recent years has waned some as Frenchmen opted  for more modern, brassier publications.  </P> <P> It survived a financial crisis in 1985 by selling about a 12% share in the  newspaper to its readers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS AND ETHICS  </P> <P> Both political parties have established "opposition research" teams to "collect  potentially damaging information" on opponents in the next election (Part I,  June 3). If the voters permit this perversion of the electoral process, they  deserve the calamities that will ensue.  </P> <P> It is little wonder that the U.S. has slipped in the ranks of world leadership  when our candidates for high office are more concerned with lining their own  pockets and besmirching their enemies than with confronting the important  issues of the day, such as homelessness, injustice, hunger, nuclear  proliferation, arms control, and economic dislocation.  </P> <P> Our failure to solve these problems on terms favorable to our interests will  lead to further erosion of our international standing, while the head of  communications for the Republican Party smugly asserts that a mud-filled  dossier on the opposition is "frankly the single best resource we can put in  the hands of Republican candidates at all levels."  </P> <P> Rather than starting their hand-wringing lamentations after the election, the  American people (led perhaps by their self-appointed representatives of the  press?) should demand that politicians quit acting like spoiled schoolchildren  and begin debating the issues of global life and death. Registered voters  should notify their respective party leaders that they will refuse to  contribute to any candidate who spends more time and effort on mudslinging than  on presenting positive answers to difficult issues.  </P> <P> "None of the above" should become a viable alternative when faced with  candidates who know more about each other's boudoirs than about the European  Economic Community.  </P> <P> Only by restoring some sense of what government is supposed to do will we  regain the respect and admiration of the world. If congressmen would lift the  public-opinion standing of their own institution, they could start by assuming  the mantle of leadership they have been trampling in the dust.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. SHERER  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

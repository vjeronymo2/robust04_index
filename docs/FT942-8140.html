			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Motoring: When looks count - Stuart Marshall road tests BMW's new 7-Series Apart from their V8 engines, the latest BMW 730i and 740i are completely new cars. But they look so little different from the old ones that, at a glance, only a BMW aficionado might notice. Does this matter? BMW thinks not. It says people who buy cars in this price class - and the new 7-Series will cost between Pounds 39,800 and Pounds 46,700 when they arrive in British dealerships next month - are not looking for anything revolutionary. According to a senior BMW executive when the new models were launched in Germany last week: 'We have not designed these cars to do the competition in the eye but to please our customers. We know they appreciate our kind of timeless elegance. They like understatement and they certainly do not want a heavy, Teutonic look.' The new 7-Series takes over from the models launched in 1986. Then, they were powered by a five-litre, V12 engine and in-line sixes of three and 3.5 litres, replaced two years ago by V8s of three and four litres. Longer wheelbase 7-Series saloons, with enlarged 5.4-litre V12 or four-litre V8 engines, are due to appear for the 1995 model year, priced at Pounds 65,900 and Pounds 52,900 respectively . BMW knows the flagship 750iL will be chosen by a small minority because even luxury car owners or users do not relish being suspected of consuming excessive amounts of petrol. (For that matter, one is tempted to ask: who needs a 5.4-litre V12 putting out well over 300 horsepower, anyway?) In fact, by the standards of a few years ago, the new 7-Series V8s are remarkably economical, with a combined cycle consumption of 25.7mpg (11 l/100 km). This is based on a car spending half its time in traffic with the other half split equally between driving at constant speeds of 56mph (90kph) and 75mph (120kph). The 210 horsepower 740i I drove for a morning accelerated agreeably swiftly through its five automatic gears and streaked along the autobahn like some earthbound executive aircraft. At close to its electronically governed maximum of 155mph (250kmh), I thought it as quiet as any obvious rival such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8 and Lexus LS400. Off the autobahn, it handled as nimbly as a smaller car. The ride, as one would expect, is excellent. Even on an uncharacteristically rough German minor road, the suspension simply soaked up the potholes and bumps and tyre noise remained muted. All the new 7-Series cars coming to Britain will have five-speed automatic transmission. If anyone insists, the 730i can be supplied with a five-speed manual gearbox and the 740i with a six-speed, although I cannot imagine any British buyer being unwise enough to want one. BMW dealers are likely to warn inquirers that manual versions would have a lower retained value than automatics. When I tried a five-speed manual 730i after the two-pedal 740i, it was quite an anti-climax. Both clutch and gear-shift had a long throw and - most unusually for BMW - smooth changes between first, second and third required concentration. The manual three-litre accelerated less urgently than the 740i although it felt just as relaxed as an autobahn cruiser. Inside, the new 730i and 740i have the wood veneer trim now obligatory for posh cars, to go with leather seats, twin air-bags, 10-speaker sound system, air-conditioning and computer. This produced a clear central display of range, fuel consumption, temperature, time and so on. But while modern cars such as the BMW 7-Series are wonderfully easy to drive, one really needs a short course to learn how to work all their electronic wonders. In the 1980s, luxury car sales grew in Europe by 90 per cent to around 240,000 units each year. The recession cooled things down considerably, but forecasters say it will be up to 260,000 in a year or two. BMW expects its new 7-Series to take a 20 per cent share.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The low turnout in a recent  parliamentary by-election in The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia (FYROM) prompted a team of journalists from the Skopje  daily VECER to conduct a survey on the public's attitude toward  voting in the general elections scheduled for November. The  results of the poll were published in the 31 March issue of  VECER on pages 4 and 5. The journalists interviewed 200 people,  half of them Skopje residents and the remainder residents of 10  other towns in Macedonia, asking two questions:    -- Will you vote in the November elections (with the  predetermined responses: yes, no, and do not know);    -- Why (with a few answers mentioned but no overall results  given). The interviews were conducted partly by telephone and  partly face-to-face. VECER claims that it followed "appropriate  methods" to assure that the respondents were chosen  "accidentally" and remained anonymous. The responses to the  first question are broken down by ethnic group: Macedonian,  Albanian, and other (Turks, Serbs, Romanies, and so forth), and  by gender. VECER provided no further information on methodology,  nor was the margin of error supplied.  <H5>  Anticipating Turnout </H5>   According to VECER, voter turnout in Macedonia's first  multiparty elections in 1990 was about 84 percent. Noting that  voter turnout can change dramatically and that it is thus too  early to predict voter turnout in November, VECER recalls that  in the first round of the by-election, which was held on 20  March, 46 percent of those eligible voted, but that in a  subsequent survey 54 percent indicated they would vote in a 3  April runoff round. VECER promised to sample the mood of the  electorate periodically.    With respect to the November elections, VECER found that 73  percent of those surveyed planned to vote, with only 13.5  percent saying they would not vote and an equal percentage  uncertain. People between 35 and 45 years of age were the most  inclined to vote, as were those with a secondary or higher  education, 77 percent of whom intended to vote--compared to only  36 percent of those with a primary school education. Gender was  also salient: 81 percent of the men surveyed intended to vote,  compared to 59 percent of the women. The breakdown by ethnic  groups is shown in the table below:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Will Vote         |Will Not Vote     |Undecided         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Macedonians       |75                |9                 |16                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Albanians         |72                |23                |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others            |63                |23                |14                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

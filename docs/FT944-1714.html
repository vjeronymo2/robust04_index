			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Motorway toll rationale Sir, I agree that motorway tolls present a huge political problem for a government (Personal View, December 14), but comparisons with motorway tolls in France are invalid. Distances between French cities are such that switching to non-toll roads could lengthen journey times by many hours, if not days: in contrast, the use of motorways in principal French conurbations is free of tolls: on that same model, use of the M25 would remain free. The French do have a viable alternative to motorways: the TGV, which is ideally suited to the long inter-city distances in France. If the UK government were serious about the environment, it would use the money raised in motorway tolls, fuel taxes, etc, to invest directly in an advanced, non-car transport infrastructure designed to meet Britain's travel needs of the 21st century. Any other rationale for introducing motorway tolls would simply be another tax on people who need to get from A to B. Andrew J Walker, Mas de Massier, 38200 Vienne, France</p>

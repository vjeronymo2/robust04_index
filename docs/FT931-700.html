			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: A waste of energy Sir, In the FT of March 25 you carried an advertisement for British Gas entitled 'If you need to complain it won't be a waste of energy'. The list of 90 general managers established in local offices last year is entirely male (with the possible exception of Laurie and/or Robin). I would like to complain about this - but I feel it would be a waste of energy.

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> BACH: The Well-Tempered Clavier. Joao Carlos Martins, piano. Tomato 2699132.  Martins focuses the listener's attention not on Bach's music, but on his own  manner of playing it.  </P> <P> He uses a whole range of rhetorical devices for expressive purposes, everything  from unwritten rubatos and accents to gratuitous colorings and fussy  articulations. Though occasionally he offers a straightforward reading by way  of contrast, he often backs off even further, draining the music of all  inflection and emotion and turning innocent counterpoint into stark  mathematical formula. In giving many of these pieces a strongly pianistic and  melodic cast, he obscures their multiple-voiced complexities. Martins's  noodling may rarely bore, but it does seem arbitrary, and what Bach wrote is  vastly more interesting. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

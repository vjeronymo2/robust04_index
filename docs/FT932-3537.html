			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: Employee attitude survey checklist Gain commitment of senior management, clarify objectives and define areas where company prepared to take action. Decide between census of employees - probably paper-based - and random sample - maybe face-to-face interviews. Conduct pilot. Design questionnaire - needs experienced help. Tell employees what is being done: the more internal publicity, the greater the chances of success. Guarantee confidentiality. Consider measures to improve response rate, for example, by holding supervised completion sessions in company time. If the survey involves face-to-face interviews, conduct with one or two employees at a time. Avoid group discussions - difficult to maintain confidentiality in groups and to enable everyone to have a say. Produce final report. Distil evidence, reach conclusions and put forward recommendations. Present to top management. Report back to employees with summary of main findings. Individual or group should be made responsible for action following survey findings; monitor progress. Source: Institute of Personnel Management</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris weakens on devaluation of peseta FURTHER consideration of the Spanish devaluation moved Paris as a whole, and individual sectors in Madrid, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS weakened in realisation that the devaluation of the peseta will have a serious impact on exports, given that Spain is one its largest trading partners. The CAC-40 index lost 28.19 or 1.5 per cent to 1,851.74, for a decline of 1.4 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr2.8bn. There was also a weakening of the franc yesterday, making it less likely that the government will be able to make additional rate cuts independently of Germany. Further evidence that the economy is sliding deeper into recession, and a fresh batch of weak first quarter corporate sales figures left most analyst believing that the outlook for equities is bleak. Hoare Govett, in its latest strategy paper, comments that the market is looking vulnerable for a number of reasons: these include the likely rise in demand for investment funds as a result of forthcoming privatisations, the rising budget deficit and potential rights issues. Carrefour and Promodes, both exposed to Spain, lost FFr14 and FFr16 respectively to FFr2,615 and FFr740. MADRID extended Thursday's devaluation gains, Repsol putting on another Pta145, or 4.6 per cent to Pta3,285 as the general index closed 2.08 higher at 253.09, up 4.9 per cent on the week. Turnover eased from Thursday's record Pta65bn, but stayed very high at Pta42.3bn. Profit-taking appeared late in the day and, in a mixed banking sector, Argentaria, Santander and Popular dropped Pta80 to Pta4,430, Pta50 to Pta5,620 and Pta550 to Pta14,600 respectively. However, there was general strength in utilities where, said Mr Peter Stevens of BZW in Madrid, investors who worried on Thursday about the effect of devaluation on the sector's foreign debt consoled themselves yesterday with the thought that interest rates will be a lot lower in a year's time. Sevillana rose Pta40 to Pta450, and Iberdrola Pta30 to Pta717. FRANKFURT's DAX index bounced off a low of 1,629.57 after news of the compromise agreement which has ended the east German metalworkers' strike, but still closed 5.28 lower at 1,634.51, up 1.4 per cent on the week. Turnover eased from DM6.6bn to DM6.3bn. Conflict in the car sector saw BMW, ex a DM12.50 dividend, fall a net DM6 to DM456.50 and Volkswagen lose another DM3.50 to DM318.50, but Daimler rise DM6.10 to DM564.40. There was talk of a sell recommendation for VW from one broker while, in Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck noted that the company still topped the DAX performance list with a gain of 31.5 per cent this year. Daimler had a presentation in Zurich on Thursday night and, apparently, is sticking to earlier forecasts of profits down by a third this year; Mr Bob Barber of James Capel, frankly surprised that the shares went up, said that Capel expects Daimler's earnings to be down by two-thirds in 1993. ZURICH ended a shade higher on strength in chemicals, the SMI index rising 3.3 to 2,186.0, up 1.0 per cent on the week, as Ciba registered led active stocks with a gain of SFr9 to SFr626. Brown Boveri produced the main results of the day. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich said that they were at the lower end of expectations. The bearers fell only SFr2 to SFr808, but this followed the drop from a high of SFr837 earlier this week. AMSTERDAM was disappointed at Unilever which came in with first quarter figures below expectations. The shares weakened Fl 6.20 to Fl 196.30. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.6 to 107.5, barely changed on the week. Sentiment was also unsettled by a report from the ING bank forecasting that manufacturing, transport and building companies, whose export potential has been weakening recently because of the strength of the guilder, could show an average 10 per cent fall in 1993 profits. MILAN saw some profit-taking on the last day of the account although Stet managed a solid rise, fixing up L105 or 3.7 per cent higher at L2,939, for a rise on the week of nearly 12 per cent. The telecommunications group has been supported by overseas interest, a positive profits forecast and renewed talk about a strategic alliance with an international operator. The Comit index slipped 1.45 to 538.99, slightly lower on the week. STOCKHOLM rallied in the afternoon on interest rate hopes, the Affarsvarlden general index finishing 9.40 higher at 1,081.50, 1.2 per cent up on the week. Ericsson B finished unchanged at SKr300 after an early fall to SKr293, the late recovery following a forecast of 'substantially' higher 1993 net profits. ISTANBUL fell back following recent strong gains with a decline in the 75-share index of 73.3 to 8,276.01. Among the losers Eregli slipped TL50 to TL1,350.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices May 14 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.43  1149.13   1148.37  1148.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1212.06  1212.64   1212.32  1212.89                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1149.48  1148.39   1148.99  1148.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1212.50  1212.51   1213.62  1212.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 13    May 12    May 11    May 10     May 7 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1155.16   1148.06   1140.44   1142.74   1142.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.59   1215.04   1206.03   1203.54   1200.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1149.63; 200 - 1213.68 Low/day: 100 - 1147.37  200 - 1211.26.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

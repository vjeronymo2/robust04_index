			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Ringing the changes for the millennium - Resource-based accrual accounting in all government departments is Clarke's aim Accountants are rarely afforded the opportunity to make history. The chancellor of the exchequer held out such a possibility earlier this year. 'People will find other ways of celebrating the millennium,' said Kenneth Clarke: 'But few will be more important. This is one of those highly significant events.' Mr Clarke was referring to the government's determination, repeated by the paymaster general last week, to introduce resource-based accrual accounting in all its departments by 1998. If these reforms are fully implemented, with the attendant reform of the management culture, the results will most certainly be revolutionary. The annual public expenditure survey, which sets government spending targets, will be carried out on the new basis from 2000 onwards. The process of change will undoubtedly generate business for accountants. The large accountancy firms are watching developments - and the likely consultancy needs which may arise - with keen interest. The cost of transition alone has been estimated at Pounds 3m per government department. At the moment the government's green paper: Better Accounting for the Taxpayers Money: Resource Accounting and Budgeting in Government, is out for public consultation. Privately it is described as a 'white-green paper', as there is no doubting the government's determination to go ahead with the introduction of accrual accounting - or, as it is more commonly called - 'resource accounting.'. The present system for government accounting is based on cash, in terms of receipts and payments, and has been officially designated, by the chancellor, as both 'archaic' and 'silly'. It records when money is spent on an asset and then loses track of the asset itself: its future use, depreciation, sale, or disposal. In contrast accrual accounting is based on the recording of transactions when they occur - rather than when the money is either received or paid out. If this system sounds both sensible and familiar it is because it is the foundation of UK company accounting - and has been introduced in local government, the national health service, the universities, and privatised industries. Under such a scheme we could expect a government department to produce: A set of consolidated accounts for itself and its executive agencies A distinction between revenue and capital expenditure. An operating cost statement, highlighting resources consumed during the year net of department income from customers. A balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, provisions and an analysis of capital employed. A cashflow statement, analysing capital and current cash outflows and sources of finance. An output and performance analysis, comparing actual outputs with targets. A description of non-cash items such as depreciation of assets, superannuation and insurance. The New Zealand government has already introduced the system. In Australia, it has been introduced at federal level and for the state governments of New South Wales and Victoria. The need for such a change must be seen in a broad context of government reform. From compulsory competitive tendering, through the development of the internal market in the National Health Service, to the setting up of executive agencies to deliver services, the need for commercial accounting is crucial in order to improve financial accountability and to ensure proper comparisons of costs. The great danger is that the new system will be enacted in form not substance. For beyond accural accounting lies resource budgeting: a system of management targets within a framework of measurable inputs and outputs. In New Zealand, where such a revolution has been attempted, the accounting switch was presented as the means to achieve a fundamental transformation of the culture: a shift to business management. Martin Evans, technical and research director of Cipfa - the public sector accounting body - told a conference last week on the green paper: 'The benefit of accrual accounting is that it confronts service managers with the real cost of holding and using assets.' 'Quiet apart from highlighting the extent to which we are running down or investing in public assets it may encourage more rational decisions about the appropriate level of public borrowing.' But then comes the warning. 'Resource accounting is not a magic wand that will lead automatically to better management of government assets.' A revolution is also needed in management if the next step, to resource budgeting, is to be achieved. Some accountants watching the process fear that there is a 'whitewash' option: that resource accounting will be confined to the back of an envelope while the managment culture will remain unchanged. Francis Plowden, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, told the Cipfa conference that success depended on a change in management culture which was already under way: 'But the pace of change will need to be much greater if the benefits of the changes in technique which we have been discussing are to rise above the criticism that we are simply playing at shops.' All this will not mean an end to cash controls. The paymaster general, David Heathcote Amery MP, told the conference: 'Cash control within departments should be as rigourous as ever. But it might be appropriate for the treasury to exercise cash control for departments as a whole at a higher level of aggregation - allowing more flexible use of resources whilst continuing to keep a firm grip on the PSBR.' This illustrates just how far reaching the shift to accrual accounting can be. The Cipfa conference touched on some others: for example, if a department's accounts are consolidated why should the financial affairs of a quango not be included on the balance sheet ? While so-called executive quangos do produce accounts, why should hundreds of others escape? Regulation of the accounts is a live issue because under resource accounting judgement will have to be used - particularly in respect to the valuation of assets and their depreciation. How do you depreciate the value of a nuclear bomb? As one accountant suggested: rather quickly after it goes off. How do you apply historic cost accounting of a 14th century castle? Or a battleship? Under cash based accounting assets were effectively written off after purchase. Under resource accounting the asset will suddenly reappear. How could a government institution, housed in a fine building on a lucrative piece of property, justify continuing to finance its asset? If it sold up, who would get the money? The indications are that the Treasury would get some, at least. Should the government attempt the seemingly horrendous task of consolidating the accounts of the entire public sector? While the problems seem huge Martin Evans, at least, is sure that they are tractable. Furthermore there is widespread acknowledgement that the benefits are huge. The glittering prize is that in the future a minister will be able to ask his accountants to cost a series of options for providing a public service. When the dust settles the chancellor may well prove to have been right in his uncharacteristically grand evaluation of the effects of applying simple, old-fashioned, accrual accounting to the process of modern government.</p>

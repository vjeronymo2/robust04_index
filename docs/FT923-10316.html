			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Observer: Highest bid When it comes to bitter corporate rivalries, it is hard to beat Sotheby's and Christie's battle for dominance of the world's art market. For the last 30 years Sotheby's has made all the running. But now Christie's is fighting back and claims to have 49 per cent of the global market - its highest share since the 1950s. This has provoked Sotheby's to apoplexy and the claim that Christie's has inflated its figures by the inclusion of private sales. Sotheby's reckons it is still number one and is confident of stretching its lead next season by selling off the art treasures of Germany's Thurn und Taxis family. The trouble with such backbiting is that reputations as well as margins are suffering.</p>

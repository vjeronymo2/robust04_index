			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Asbestos/cement (A/C) pipe installation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Asbestos/cement (A/C) sheet installation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Floor products installation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Plumbing repairs in commercial/residential buildings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Floor repairs in commercial/residential buildings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Gasket removal and installation in general industry; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pipe insulation repairs in general industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the remaining activities, respiratory protection was necessary in order to reach the current PEL of 0.2  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> f/cc. OSHA assumed that employers would choose the most cost-effective approach and supply their workers with half-mask supplied-air respirators (or full-facepiece supplied-air respirators for asbestos removal projects) in order to eliminate the need for exposure monitoring [OSHA, 1986]. Thus, in the 1986 RIA, OSHA assumed that workers in many higher-risk construction activities would be provided supplied-air respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA now believes that the prior analytical assumption of widespread use of supplied-air respirators may not be consistent with field experience. OSHA believes that supplied-air respirators are used in many construction activities_particularly removal and demolition, where exposures tend to be highest. For other construction activities where peak exposures are generally lower and episodic, many abatement and maintenance personnel appear to be complying with the current standard using a combination of engineering controls, work practices and lighter respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction employers also appear to meet the requirements for daily monitoring (1926.58(f)(3) in the current standard) by compiling historical exposure data documenting compliance with the current OSHA PEL during representative projects. OSHA anticipates that some construction employers will meet the requirements of revised Paragraph (f) Exposure assessments and monitoring, through the use of selective initial monitoring to establish an historical exposure data record, which can form the basis for achieving all necessary requirements of the standard. Where exposures may exceed levels documented by objective data, additional respiratory protection may be necessary, and is judged by OSHA to be technologically feasible based on field experience and information in the rulemaking record [Corn, 1992; HEI&hyph;AR, 1992].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the standard for general industry, OSHA is proposing the prohibition of high-speed sanding and the use of highly abrasive pads during asbestos floor tile work. In CONSAD's 1985 study [CONSAD 1985] and in OSHA's 1986 RIA [OSHA, 1986], exposures during floor tile installation, removal, and sanding were reported to be generally below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.2 f/cc when the recommendations of the Resilient Floor Covering Institute were followed. These recommended practices included wet sweeping and handling, and the prohibition of power sanding and blowing asbestos dust. OSHA estimated current exposures in floor repair at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.024 f/cc under the assumption that the Institute's recommended practices have been adopted by a majority of establishments. Therefore, the prohibition of high-speed sanding in the current proposal is not expected to significantly affect floor repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the final PEL of 0.1 f/cc, additional respiratory protection may be necessary. Specifically, some projects involving A/C pipe installation, A/C sheet installation, floor removal, floor repair, large-scale gasket removal, pipe repair, and custodial work in industrial, commercial and residential buildings would require the use of half-mask respirators to meet the revised PEL. In addition, drywall demolition projects may need to upgrade their respiratory protection to full-facepiece negative-pressure respirators to meet the lower permissible exposure limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessing current respirator usage and predicted demand under the revised standard, OSHA concludes that nearly all construction activities will require respiratory protection during at least part of the project-day in order to comply with the 0.1 f/cc PEL. Based on the lower-bound exposure estimates provided in the literature and reported in CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990, 1985], it appears that a variety of routine maintenance activities and some abatement jobs may be able to achieve the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc without respirators. From its analysis of current exposures, OSHA anticipates that only in small-scale gasket removal and installation will respiratory protection not be necessary for most project-days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other incremental controls necessary to comply with OSHA's final asbestos standard, include (depending upon the construction activity):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HEPA vacuums or HEPA vacuum/ventilation systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wet methods;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Glove bags;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulated areas (air-tight or demarcated with caution signs);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Critical barriers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Protective disposable clothing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Impermeable drop cloths;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Decontamination area (adjacent to regulated area or remote showers and changerooms);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lunch areas;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Competent person supervision;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical exams;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recordkeeping (exposure assessment, medical exams and training);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification of building owners and employees by contractors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification of contractors and building occupants by building owners;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

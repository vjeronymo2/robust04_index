			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Leading contractor arrested JAPAN'S crackdown on political corruption claimed its most famous corporate victim last night as prosecutors arrested Mr Teruzo Yoshino, chairman of Shimizu, the leading Japanese contractor, for the alleged bribery of a provincial governor. Mr Yoshino, aged 75, denies he provided funds to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, the former governor of Ibaraki prefecture north-east of Tokyo, in the hope that the company would win contracts for a range of planned public works projects. 'No, absolutely not,' Mr Yoshino, whose home was raided by investigators, told reporters earlier yesterday. 'I would never do anything as silly as attempting to bribe someone.' However, 15 other construction company employees have been arrested in the past year for illegally providing money to local government officials, including Mr Takeuchi who is already charged with illegally receiving Y55m (Pounds 345,000) from the industry. The arrest last night follows the questioning of Mr Takeuchi and, according to the prosecutors, allegedly arises from Y10m that he claims to have received from Mr Yoshino in December last year. On Sunday Japan and the US concluded a round of construction market negotiations at which Tokyo was urged to ensure that foreign companies have an opportunity to bid for all public works contracts. Mr Yoshino, in his role as federation chairman, said earlier yesterday that the request was excessive, and Japan should experiment with a 'conditional' open bidding system to replace the present designated bidder system. The spate of arrests and confessions in the past year have provided US negotiators with evidence in their attempts to demolish the dango, the cartels which allegedly control the awarding of contracts by pre-selecting a winner and ensuring that other bidders put in estimates far higher than the 'winner'. However, the allegations against Mr Yoshino reflect the at times fierce competition among Japanese contractors for lucrative provincial contracts, particularly dams, civic centres and universities, all of which were planned in Ibaraki prefecture. Apart from highlighting the sometimes unsavoury links between politicians and contractors, the investigation has drawn attention to the priorities of provincial governments, alleged to outlay huge sums on unnecessary dams and government buildings, while neglecting less lucrative but more needed projects.</p>

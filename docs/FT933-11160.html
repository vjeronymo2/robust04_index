			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Kirin cuts forecast for full-year profitability KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's biggest beer producer, expects profits to fall this year, despite a 7.9 per cent increase to Y34.62bn (Dollars 326.6m) before tax for the first six months. The company has cut its forecast for parent company pre-tax profits to Y80bn, down from the Y82.70bn it made for 1992 and the modest rise to Y83bn it had earlier projected for 1993. That had been based on an assumed 3 per cent growth in beer sales, which Kirin now says has evaporated. Volume shipments have fallen, and revenue from the beer division edged ahead 0.4 per cent in the first six months. An unseasonably cool and rainy July will affect the second half. Income is also thought likely to be affected by Kirin's temporary suspension of advertising following the arrest this month of senior executives on allegations of paying up to Y33m to sokaiya, racketeers who disrupt shareholders' meetings unless their financial demands are met. Yesterday, the board accepted the resignations of Mr Hideyo Motoyama, the chairman, and two other managing directors, who are taking responsibility for the scandal. Although leaving the board, they remain advisers. An earnings fall this year would be the second in a row for Kirin, which is labouring under economic downturn as well as the high capital costs of opening new breweries - meaning an extra Y5.8bn in depreciation charges for 1993. First-half revenues rose 1.1 per cent to Y616.5bn, helped by a strong contribution from pharmaceuticals. Net earnings per share, Y13.88 at the interim level against Y13.18, are expected to emerge at Y35.15 for the year, compared with Y35.6. Kirin intends to maintain a dividend of Y10, of which Y5 is being paid for the first half.</p>

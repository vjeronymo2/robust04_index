			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALLEYS WIDEN SCOPE OF JUDAISM UNIVERSITY'S ART  </P> <P> Sondra and Marvin Smalley 18 years ago chose the late architect A. Quincy  Jones, dean of the USC School of Architecture, to build their contemporary  house in Holmby Hills. With 26-foot ceilings and wrap-around random-designed  rough-sawn cedar slat walls, they added a new dimension to their lives -- art.  </P> <P> The house's spectacular spaces -- both open and walled -- allowed for gigantic  canvases. And the Smalleys began acquiring pieces by Ronald Davis, Tony DeLap,  Dan Citron and Sam Francis.  </P> <P> "We had an interest in art, but we had not been collecting. It was Quincy who  exposed us to more in life -- he was a sensational man. And he liked this house  so much that his memorial service was held here for 400 people," Marvin Smalley  said.  </P> <P> Now, the Smalleys are helping to create the Sondra and Marvin Smalley Family  Sculpture Garden at the University of Judaism whose campus at 15600 Mulholland  Drive is known as the Isadore and Sunny Familian Campus in honor of her father  and late mother.  </P> <P> Tonight the Smalleys will be at the forefront of the Sculptor's Ball for a  black-tie evening of dining and dancing at the campus. The affair honors Robert  Graham, the sculptor who designed the 1984 Olympics statue at the Los Angeles  Coliseum, the Memorial to Joe Lewis in Detroit and the tribute to jazz legend  Duke Ellington in Central Park in New York. They hope to gross $150,000 and net  $100,000 for new acquisitions. "We want to make the garden grow," says Sandy  Smalley.  </P> <P> The garden, a place where students and visitors gather to study, talk and enjoy  nature, already has four pieces -- an Aldo Casanova bronze donated by Julius  and Hannah Karosen, a Fletcher Benton given by Jerry and Gloria Lushing, a  George Rickey given in memory of the Holocaust by 10 donors and a marble bench  etched with truisms by Jenny Holzer ("Action causes more trouble than thought"  and "Knowledge should be advanced at all costs") and presented by Nancy Epstein  and the Smalleys.  </P> <P> The University of Judaism is an academic institution with only 200 students and  a curriculum dedicated to the study and advancement of Jewish life. More than  5,000 are also enrolled in adult education classes. Said Sondra Smalley, "The  university is one of those best-kept secrets. With this event, chaired by Roy  Norris, we are trying to reach out to a much broader base."  </P> <P> The Smalleys were married when she was 17 and he 21. They met when she was 14  and he had just started UCLA and was working weekends delivering flowers. He  brought a bouquet to her front door and it was love at first sight. They've  been married 37 years and have four grown children.  </P> <P> Says Marvin, "Sandy never had a station wagon, because I didn't want her to get  totally engrossed in the children. When I came home from the office, I didn't  want to hear about carpools. We always had a half hour quality time by  ourselves when I got home."  </P> <P> She says, "And we still do a lot of things together. We don't get tired of each  other." They conscientiously plan two big trips a year, now that he is  semi-retired but still involved with real estate and securities investing. They  also are frequently in Rancho Mirage at their home at Mission Hills Country  Club, playing golf, going to movies, enjoying friends, "doing nothing."  </P> <P> And Sandy's favorite indulgence is two hours of gardening each morning -- a  portrait in her nightgown and robe and rubber shoes. She also does fund-raising  for the Museum of Contemporary Art and is a trustee of the Municipal Art  Gallery.  </P> <P> Marvin's love is the piano. Says Sandy, "He listens to a cassette a couple of  times and comes down and plays it all from ear. He's wonderful."  </P></p>

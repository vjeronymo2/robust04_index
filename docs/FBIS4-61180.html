			<p>BFN     [Text] As BELAPAN learned, Mikhail Marynich, Belarusian  deputy minister for external economic relations, received today  Jean-Joseph (Boillo), the economic adviser for Central and  Eastern Europe at the French Embassy in Prague. During their  conversation, both officials discussed issues related to the  condition of Belarusian-French trade and prospects for its  development. As its positive factor, Mr. (Boillo) pointed to  the Belarusian-Russian monetary merger agreement and, among  others, the results of the customs union between Russia and  Belarus. According to both sides, trade between Belarus and  France will only gain by the introduction of common customs  tariffs on the Belarusian-Russian border. Mikhail Marynich  emphasized that as a result of the customs union with Russia, a  range of Western countries will view Belarus as a springboard  for entering the Russian market, which, in the opinion of M.  Marynich, will serve the Belarusian economy well.</p>

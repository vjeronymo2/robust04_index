ANC environment spokesman Prof. Stan Sangweni also called on  the Department of Environment to turn back a container-load of  160 barrels of mercury waste due in Durban on Monday. The waste  is being transported by the Safmarine vessel Agulhas from Borden  Chemicals and Plastics in the United States.    Former Environment Minister Gert Kotze announced in 1990  that  the government had banned the importation of hazardous wastes  into South Africa. However, the government subsequently  sanctioned importation of ``spent chemicals'' by Thor for  recycling on condition the wastes originated from Thor companies.    According to Earthlife Africa spokesman Chris Albertyn, the  Department of National Health also sanctioned further imports of  mercury waste from the U.S. which did not originate from Thor.    Prof. Sangweni said on Wednesday the government should  explain its ``double standards'' in allowing the importation of  hazardous waste.    A Department of Environment said she could not comment at  short notice. Natal Attorney-General Tim McNally confirmed on  Wednesday he had requested the Department of National Health to  investigate several complaints against Thor Chemicals involving  hazardous waste. This followed a letter to Mr. McNally by  Earthlife detailing alleged infringements of health and safety  regulations by Thor Chemicals.    Three senior executives of the chemical company face charges  of culpable homicide following the death of employee Peter Cele  through suspected mercury poisoning. Thor said on Wednesday the  Borden shipment was a ``routine and unexceptional consignment.''    A spokesman challenged statements that the consignment  should  be classified as ``toxic'' waste. The company extracted mercury  from spent catalysts which would otherwise end up in landfill  sites, he said.</p>

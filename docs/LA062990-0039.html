			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ... BACK BAY CHEERS FROM THE ROBINSONS  </P> <P> John Needham, writer, and Scott Brown, graphic artist, are an incredible team!  They produced not only the quintessential article on the back bay, which they  were striving to do, but a magnificent work of art as well. On behalf of all  the friends of Newport Bay and the bay's varied inhabitants, thank you, The  Times, for the very generous, complimentary coverage.  </P> <P> Frank Robinson  </P> <P> Fran Robinson, Newport Beach  </P></p>

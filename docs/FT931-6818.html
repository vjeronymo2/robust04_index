			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / BhS to shed 800 full-time jobs BhS, part of the Storehouse retail group, is cutting 800 full-time and 2,300 Saturday jobs, but creating 2,000 part-time jobs in a further move towards flexible working in the retail sector. The store chain said the changes were aimed at ensuring well-trained staff were always available to provide higher levels of service at peak times, especially on Saturdays, and to remove anomalies in the existing staff structure. Storehouse's move follows a similar one by Burton, the retail clothing group, which announced last month it was cutting 2,000 full-time jobs but creating up to 3,000 part-time ones. Management staff at BhS have already been reduced by 900 by Mr David Dworkin, the outgoing chief executive widely credited with having turned the group around. The full-time job cuts now being made at store level account for more than a quarter of the present total of 3,000 full-time jobs, while Saturday losses account for nearly 40 per cent of weekend-only working. They will be replaced by 2,000 jobs working between 12 and 20 hours a week. The total number of employees will fall from about 13,000 to 12,000. All remaining staff working more than 12 hours a week will be entered on National Vocational Qualification training schemes to raise standards of customer service. Basic pay will be increased. BhS said it hoped some people losing their jobs would accept part-time jobs, provided they met NVQ competence standards. But some compulsory redundancies were likely. The chain is also contracting out cleaning and security functions, involving about 300 cleaners and 40 security personnel, but hopes most of these will be offered jobs with the contractors. BhS expects the changes to cost about Pounds 2m, but said this would be more than outweighed by savings in future. Mr Steve Bedford, Storehouse's group development director, said BhS regretted having to make redundancies in the present economic situation. He said: 'BhS has restructured its head office, store management and regional organisation, cutting out unnecessary bureaucracy. Now, with new staffing arrangements in the stores, the whole business really is focused on the customer.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>   [Text] The Israel Air Force's [IAF] future fighter  aircraft will be the F-15I, produced by the McDonnell Douglas  Corporation. The first planes will arrive in Israel in a short  time.    Today it is official and final. The agonizing decision has  been made and the F-15I will be the IAF's next fighter jet.  Each plane costs approximately $100 million and the Defense  Ministry's budget permits the purchase of 20 such planes. There  was a lot of hesitation and qualms by IAF officers. They found  it hard to choose between 20 F-15's or 50 F-16's at the same  price. However, the General Staff ultimately opted for the  F-15. The long range threats facing Israel weighed the decision  in its favor, and the offices of McDonnell Douglas in Israel and  abroad are celebrating a huge victory. The United States is not  only supplying Israel with the most advanced plane of its kind;  it is no less importantly supplying the accompanying technology  and this already constitutes a qualitative leap. It will be  possible to install Israeli systems in this model aircraft and  it will take time until the IAF can paint its insignia on their  wings.    Former senior IAF officers this evening criticized the  decision to purchase the F-15I.</p>

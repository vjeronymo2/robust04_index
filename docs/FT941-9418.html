			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hospitals move threatens charity projects Sir, Health secretary Virginia Bottomley, hospital trusts and medical schools will need to consider carefully their actions now that, having solicited charitable funds for projects like Philip Harris House at Guy's Hospital, they choose to make such projects either unavailable or undesirable for occupation ('Guy's role to be cut in London hospitals shake-up', February 11). They must urgently address the question of what is to happen with all the charitable funds they appear to have put at risk. This point, as much as any other, should have been considered in calculating the cost implications of consolidating on one site. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund has invested Pounds 1.7m of public donations in Philip Harris House. The objective was to bring together the research clinicians and pathologists working in our breast cancer unit and to add a new laboratory to work on gene and biological therapies, which we believe will play a major role in the next generation of breast cancer treatments. With the move to St Thomas's we want accommodation there of an equal standard at no further cost to the charity, or our money back. During all the recent months of deliberations, we have repeatedly asked for assurances regarding our investment and plans and we have been informed that no such assurance is possible. We are all obliged to pay our taxes and we all accept we have no control over how they are spent. But giving time, energy or money to charities is a matter of personal choice: people support charities precisely because they do know the charities' objectives. And they certainly do not expect the government or any other public body to throw away the fruits of their efforts. Nicholas Wright, director of clinical research, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX</p>

"The enemies of Islam fear the awakening of Muslims in  countries like Iran, Sudan, Algeria and Bosnia, and are  therefore trying to suppress them by all possible means,"  Baradah pointed out.    He lauded the accomplishments of Islamic Iran and said the  country is indebted to the unity of its people, its leadership  and dedicated efforts of responsible officials.    Baradah who arrived in Tehran on Monday, said the purpose of  his visit to Iran is become more familiar with the official  views and positions for further developing of Tehran-Khartoum  relations.    Habibi said in response that one of the ways for fighting  problems in the Muslim world after steadfastness, and struggle  and proper programming, is development of relations and exchange  of views between the officials of Muslim countries.    He said the setting up of the Iran-Sudan joint economic  commission has facilitated bilateral trade relations and  suggested that the two sides should explore the grounds for  private investments in the other country.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: Move to the micro - Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west The seven leading western industrial countries have largely succeeded in keeping their economies in good macro-economic order; in the postwar era, their people have been spared economic crises on a global scale. At the same time, western states have accumulated structural rigidities and imbalances in their economies which represent an increasingly serious threat to continued growth in the world economy. The big global challenges can, however, be tackled only on the basis of a strong world economy. One of the great challenges is the transition to democracy and market economics in the former republics of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. We must recognise clearly that the integration of the former socialist world economy into the single global world economy, the realisation of the transition to lasting democratic and market-based structures in east Europe, while simultaneously securing the efficiency of our economies, will be the crucial issues for this decade. When tackling these problems, the politician is no longer primarily concerned with the global steering mechanisms such as interest rates and exchange rates; instead the politician concentrates far more on the underlying micro-structures and the efficiency of the steering instruments (such as tax, labour-market and trade policy). The issue is one of maintaining or recreating the ability of the markets, including the labour market, to function; of the political determinants of private investment decisions; and of the role of state regulation, not least in the area of trade, environmental and energy policy. These topics are also increasingly the focus of international policy co-ordination. The recent earth summit in Rio de Janeiro is proof of this. At the same time, the political and public awareness of the problems of structural rigidities and imbalances has been heightened, not least by the difficulties of economic unification in Germany and the reform processes in eastern Europe. Certain misguided developments in the structural area, for example in nuclear energy production, are more dangerous today than mistakes in exchange rate policy. Public funds are of only marginal effect in supporting reform processes; the decisive factor is the development of private-sector initiative under reliable legal and economic conditions. This remains important for our own economies, and I sometimes wish western Germany showed the same willingness for structural change that we must expect of eastern German industry and our east European partners. The great competition between the systems of east and west is over, but the competition between efficient locations, effective policies on trade, environment, labour market, energy and competition will increase further. We need to keep sufficiently in step internationally in the micro-economic and structural area in order to avoid distortions of competition. Even more important is to make it clear that the wrong micro-economic policy  -for example, the preservation of old economic structures - will lead to a fresh separation from the world economy for the countries in question. There will no longer be any 'world economic social security'. Mistaken micro-economic and structural policy will inevitably result in the loss of prosperity and quality of life.

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE SOFTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> LADY MATADORS TRYING TO GRADUATE ON TOP  </P> <P> These are lean times for the Cal State Northridge softball program, a peek at  the exterior of the Lady Matadors' third-base dugout being positive proof.  </P> <P> There, painted in bold, white lettering and strung together in rows like  pearls, were lists of CSUN's championships.  </P> <P> Since 1982, the ledger showed, Northridge had won eight consecutive California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships, seven regional titles and four NCAA  Division II championships.  </P> <P> But the slate has been wiped clean.  </P> <P> Gary Torgeson, CSUN's coach, had the wall painted over in black. His reasoning:  Lately, the Lady Matadors have been making empty boasts.  </P> <P> "We have to get back to the level we've been bragging about," said Torgeson,  whose team had a record of 61-19 last season and failed to make the Final Four  for the first time in eight seasons. "I used to think it gave us a mental edge  when other teams came in and saw that, but we're just not playing up to that  level anymore."  </P> <P> Besides, their Division II credits will not help in a year in which the Lady  Matadors begin playing a Division I schedule. First, however, a grand exit is  being plotted.  </P> <P> "Preparing for the Division I move is good, but our priority is to get out of  (Division II) on top," Torgeson said. "We want to win the whole thing."  </P> <P> The team Northridge will field in its opener at Cal State Fullerton on Tuesday  is a vintage mixture of pitching, speed and defense -- "a very typical  Northridge team," Torgeson said.  </P> <P> With one notable exception: A little extra punch has been added to the  Punch-and-Judy slap hitters for which CSUN is notorious.  </P> <P> Among those providing added pop is Jeanne Mixon, a redshirt freshman who is  expected to share designated-hitter duties with Joanna Sanchez.  </P> <P> More power should be generated by cleanup hitter Patty Pearson, a sophomore  catcher, and left-fielder Erin McGuire.  </P> <P> Batting leadoff will be All-American Lisa Erickson, which means Northridge will  still have the slap-and-run and the drag bunt in its arsenal.  </P> <P> Erickson has batted .420 and a school-record .459 using such techniques the  past two seasons.  </P> <P> A real strength for the Lady Matadors is the pitching staff.  </P> <P> Debbie Dickmann, a three-time All-American, has used a no-nonsense approach en  route to a 76-13 record and 53 shutouts in her career at CSUN. An intimidating  6-foot-1, Dickmann has 468 strikeouts in 670 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Heather Lindstrom, the Lady Matadors' most valuable player by a vote of team  members last season, plays Tommy John to Dickmann's Nolan Ryan. Relying on  control and a variety of off-speed pitches, Lindstrom was 22-6 with an 0.74  earned-run average as a freshman.  </P></p>

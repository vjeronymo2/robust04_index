They announced their withdrawal the night before last, saying  that the dialogue had reached a dead end because of differences  between the ruling coalition parties (the General People's  Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and the YSP)  over local government, election methods, and formation of a  shura council.    A statement issued by the Yemeni opposition said that these  differences developed into exchanges of accusations, escalated  by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech the day before  yesterday in Ta'izz, over the aims some ruling coalition parties  hoped to achieve through the meeting of the Yemeni Ulema Society  at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in al-Jund, the disregard for the  Dialogue Committee's efforts, and the House of Representatives  decision to ask the prime minister and the ministers to withdraw  from the Dialogue Committee and return to their posts to  discharge their duties as members of the government.    In his Ta'izz speech, the Yemeni president accused the YSP  of  "seeking secession" with funds from certain Arab states. In  reply, the YSP issued a statement expressing interest in  preserving Yemeni unity and in continuing efforts to build a  modern state. It condemned the "lies and abuse" aimed at it.  It expressed confidence that the Arab states mentioned in the  speech were eager "to establish cordial relations based on  mutual respect, sovereignty, fraternal cooperation, and good  neighborliness" with Yemen.    The opposition's statement accused the ruling parties of  serving their own interests, not the people's interests. It  added that "the opposition submitted reasonable papers and  serious proposals for ending the crisis and laying the  foundations for stability in the country but the ruling parties  reacted to the document with reservations, making it impossible  to continue the dialogue." That, it said, "convinced the  opposition's National Bloc parties that the dialogue was not  serious and was futile, and this made them withdraw from  arguments which benefit nobody in these exceptional  circumstances."    Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning minister and member of  the GPC Political Bureau, said in reply that "they should let  their conscience be the judge as to who obstructed the  dialogue." He emphasized that the GPC did not postpone a single  session or reject any proposal made during the committee's work  since 8 November.    'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the GPC Political Bureau  and head of its General Department, has described the  opposition's withdrawal and statement as "some kind of political  upstaging" and accused the YSP of "using them [the opposition]  to abort the dialogue."    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said that "the real  identity of the opposition is now clear. It is just the other  face of the YSP. It hastily withdrew for reasons of political  gain and media blackmail." [passage omitted]</p>

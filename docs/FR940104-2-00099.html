In rating the second sub-factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant can demonstrate that its published research and other activities place it in a leadership position toward making a national contribution to solving longer-term and immediate urban problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) (15 points) The extent of need in the communities to be served by the applicant. HUD will consider the extent to which the proposal clearly delineates a need or needs in the affected communities that can be resolved through the activities of a COPC. The applicant must demonstrate how these needs were determined and how the COPC will help resolve these needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) (7 points) The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of research and successful strategies developed through outreach activities to other COPC and communities served through this demonstration program.

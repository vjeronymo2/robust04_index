			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: KICKOFF TIME FOR TV'S SUPER BOWL OF GLITZ  </P> <P> It is 7 a.m. Tuesday, and the television set in the hotel room is switched to  NBC's "Today" program.  </P> <P> Bryant Gumbel opens by announcing that America's most notorious death-row  inmate has finally been executed in Florida.  </P> <P> "Ted Bundy has died today," Gumbel says. Gumbel is somber. His co-host, Jane  Pauley, is somber. There are weighty matters to contemplate, the heinous crimes  Bundy committed, the issue of capital punishment. But suddenly, there is a  knock on the hotel room door.  </P> <P> It is Winnie the Pooh.  </P> <P> Yes, a small person wearing a Winnie the Pooh costume is at the door delivering  a press release from Walt Disney Television. He hands it over and waves goodby.  </P> <P> Consider this fleeting moment a microcosm of television industry reality, for  on the floor of Houston's sprawling George R. Brown Convention Center this  week, Winnie the Pooh, not Ted Bundy the executed serial murderer, is the real  world.  </P> <P> Spiderman and Zorro are there, delivering their greetings side by side. Kenny  Rogers is there shaking hands. So are Yogi Bear, Joan Rivers, Don Cornelius,  Robin Leach, Lou Rawls, Rex Reed, Dionne Warwick, Sally Jessy Raphael, Roy  Clark, Steve Garvey, Fawn Hall and Siskel and Ebert.  </P> <P> A huge curious throng -- including one of the crews from the CBS series "48  Hours" taping here -- envelopes Geraldo Rivera as if he were the Pope. Morton  Downey is around, taping his show. So is Judge Wapner.  </P> <P> The event is broadcasting's Super Bowl of glitz and gluttony, otherwise known  as the annual National Assn. of Television Program Executives (NATPE)  conference.  </P> <P> This is the industry's grand bazaar for syndicated (non-network) programming,  where 225 production companies and distributors of all sizes are exhibiting  their programs and stars for the benefit of the nation's station executives.  </P> <P> Gathered under one enormous roof are international buyers, makers and sellers  of programming ranging from such Hollywood giants as MCA TV and Paramount to a  New York company selling "The Truth About Communism," a 1962 documentary  narrated by Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> They're all here, your friends with the trends. You want your trash TV? You got  your trash TV. You want your crash TV -- the new "RollerGames," "American  Gladiators" and "Interceptor"? You got your crash TV. And your smash TV, your  clash TV and your cash TV.  </P> <P> Being here is like being hermetically sealed inside a gargantuan cocktail party  abounding in food, booze, TV chatter and high-powered salesmanship.  </P> <P> Entering some of the swanky exhibitions is like entering a Mercedes Benz  showroom teeming with salesmen in expensive dark suits. Only they're selling  Isuzus.  </P> <P> According to one industry source, the cost of mounting an exhibit here ranges  from $50,000 for a budget stall to $1 million for a fully equipped, fully  staffed Rodeo Drive model that merges the skills of Hollywood's finest set  designers and deal makers.  </P> <P> MCA resembles a posh club. Twentieth Century Fox has its own mezzanine. MTM  looks like an old hotel. Receptionists in "Star Trek" costumes sit at a  futuristic control panel outside lushly appointed Paramount.  </P> <P> Surrounded by potted plants, a black pianist in a white dinner jacket sits at  an old piano playing "As Time Goes By" beneath electric fans at the entrance of  Casablanca IV, which has become Rick's cafe. Two barely clad Las Vegas  showgirls stand outside an exhibit where the prospective new game show  "Hotline" is being played with actual contestants in front of an audience.  </P> <P> And not far from the ring where superstars from the World Wrestling Federation  perform daily, the star of "Monty's Traveling Reptile Show" poses in front of  an ABC News crew with an albino Burmese Python around his neck.  </P> <P> There's no escaping the selling atmosphere, even in men's room conversation:  "He cleared 26% of the U.S., and they paid him a bonus."  </P> <P> Just how much actual business is written here is debatable, however, depending  on the show and the amount of exposure it has received prior to the conference.  For most of the new ones, NAPTE is an ending, not a beginning.  </P> <P> "Every year is different," said Ave Butensky, executive vice president of Fries  Distribution Co., inside his firm's upscale exhibit. "I got a thousand people  coming in here saying, 'I'll try to come back, I'll see ya.' But who knows how  many will come back?"  </P> <P> "RollerGames" was virtually a "go" even before NAPTE, said 31-year-old David R.  Sams, co-creator/executive producer (with Michael J. Miller) of the Quintex  Entertainment series.  </P> <P> Yes, get ready to r-r-r-r-rumble on Saturday nights, for the target of the  funky "RollerGames" and "American Gladiator" is that American institution,  NBC's "Saturday Night Live."  </P> <P> "RollerGames" is scheduled to premiere in September (on KTLA Channel 5 in Los  Angeles) with a two-hour special followed by 26 hourlong episodes. "They're  calling us 'crash TV,' a step beyond the current reality shows," said former  King World sales executive Sams. A giant step.  </P> <P> "RollerGames" is an upgraded, high-tech, tongue-in-checkbook, absolutely  death-defying version of Roller Derby in which six "concept-driven" teams --  Bad Attitude, Hot Flash, the Rockers, the Maniacs, the Violators and the  T-Birds -- compete on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot Wall of  Death and a live alligator pit.  </P> <P> "The stations love the alligator pit," Sams said. "Somebody asked me if we're  gonna have the alligators at NAPTE. I said, 'No, we have enough roaming the  floor.' "  </P> <P> "RollerGames" will have cheerleaders, a "sports center" for interviews and  commentary, a commissioner (William J. Griffiths, operator of the old Roller  Derby) and rock bands playing at half time. "This is total rock and roll TV,"  Sams said. "We'll even have cameras mounted on the helmets so that you can see  the crashes at skate level." And there will be crashes.  </P> <P> Unlike Roller Derby, Sams insists, however, "RollerGames will be on the level.  "It is not orchestrated. The players (some of whom are from Roller Derby) will  develop personalities, but they'll be fighting for world championships. We'll  even have a league draft in March." And with a straight face he adds: "Will we  have drug testing? If it's necessary."  </P> <P> Isn't there a strong chance that such a gimmick show will quickly burn out and  last only one or two seasons? "Two seasons will buy my home in Bel-Air," Sams  replied.  </P> <P> Like "RollerGames," Samuel Goldwyn Television's "American Gladiators" is  designed to pick off the principally young, male audience that went in a big  way for the WWF wrestling spectaculars that occasionally alternated with -- and  even outdrew -- "Saturday Night Live."  </P> <P> Co-announced by former pro quarterback great Fran Tarkenton and former Chicago  Bear Tim Wrightman, "American Gladiators" matches ordinary people against six  inventively costumed "gladiators" -- Cattalus, Lace, Willie, Dominos, Evander  and Zap -- in such events as power ball, pugel sticks and the always popular  Velcro joust. In that one, the challenger and gladiator are dressed in Velcro  body suits and dangled 10 feet above ground. The gladiator tries to throw his  or her opponent against a Velcro-covered wall.  </P> <P> Says an excited Tarkenton on the promotion tape shown prospective clients: "The  NFL is nuthin' like this!"  </P> <P> Yet the future of "American Gladiators" is iffy at this point. It would hold  challenger tryouts throughout the nation, with the top male and female  challengers ultimately replacing two of the regular gladiators. Not Lace, one  hopes, for she is billed as "controlling men for her own pleasure and making  other women grovel at her feet."  </P> <P> "This is a chance for the average man or woman to become a folk hero," said  Goldwyn Television President Dick Askin, who likens "American Gladiators" to  "Battle of the Network Stars" and says the contests are not predetermined. "The  thing we're trying to avoid is the sleaze element," he said.  </P> <P> "Interceptor" seems to avoid intelligence.  </P> <P> However, that may be a premature judgment. Fries Entertainment has only a  paucity of promotional materials on hand -- mainly consisting of a 6-foot-5 man  dressed up in black leather as the Interceptor himself and an excerpt of the  defunct British series on which the premise is based -- to illustrate  "Interceptor." Bearing a resemblance to "The Running Man" movie, the show so  far is down only for an hour special (on Channel 5 in Los Angeles) that would  be a test for a possible series.  </P> <P> "Our development people were over in England and said they saw this terrible  show that wasn't developed properly," said Fries senior Vice President Peter  Schmid, who characterized the concept as an "adult comic book."  </P> <P> The excerpt of the English series is unintentionally hilarious, showing  contestants on dirt bikes roaring across an obstacle course while trying to  avoid an "Interceptor" who carries a zapper. Meanwhile, a sort of  director/authority figure gives them clues on getting through the course to a  home base where a key awaits. Using the key, they unlock their backpacks and  win the game and prizes.  </P> <P> "We're going to do away with that English twit you saw," said Schmid, who added  that the look of the Interceptor may change too. "You'll never know his  identity. He should be mysterious. He may look like G.I. Joe or a Ninja,"  Schmid said, producing drawings of both.  </P> <P> Or even Winnie the Pooh, for this is NAPTE.  </P></p>

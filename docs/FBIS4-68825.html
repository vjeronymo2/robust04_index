			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent Aleksandr </F> Sorokin: "Words Do Not Replace Might: View From Brussels"]    [Text] The Commission of the European Communities (CEC)  held a seminar on the prospects of developing relations with  Russia. Visitors from the CEC now descend on Moscow increasingly  often. The newspapers are trying to digest the new Russian  approach to NATO's Partnership For Peace concept. The press is  attempting to analyze the possible consequences of Russia's  entry into the European Union...    In short, one may say that in this respect our country is at  the center of attention. Russian initiatives of late put Western  politicians in a state of slight shock. To be precise, the  confusion stems not from their contents but their inconsistency  and contradictory nature. "We will not sign the NATO Partnership  For Peace document..." "Actually, we will." "We will not demand  special status for Russia within the framework of this  concept..." "Actually, we will..."    So Western politicians are not in a hurry to comment on  this.  You say something in a hurry, call someone an unflattering name,  and tomorrow this someone makes a U-turn... For Western  journalists, however, it is a free-for-all. They are outdoing  themselves in sarcasm on the subject of Russia's  less-than-successful attempts to regain its former greatness.  "This is not terribly smart," says one, and launches into  pontification on the subject of chaos, and sometimes sheer  incompetence, in the top echelons of Russian authority. "This is  not by choice," another joins the discussion, hinting at a  complex domestic political situation in Russia and increasing  attempts by politicians of all colorations to play the card of  Russian greatness. "It is neither," says a third. In his  opinion, Russia has not rid itself of an imperial mentality, and  all these swings from one extreme to another are nothing other  than a desire to retain control over its former allies.    Here is a conversation, however, not with a journalist but  an  official representative of an official organization.    [Question] What do you think of Russia's intention to join  the European Union?    [Answer] So far I only heard of such an intention from the  press.    [Question] What if it were to be confirmed officially?    [Answer] I can say only one thing. Such an idea would be  strange, to say the least.    [Question] What is your own view of it?    [Answer] Take, for instance, the 29 articles of the  agreement  on Austria's membership. How many years will be needed to reach  an agreement with Russia, for instance, on social articles  alone, if we have problems in this respect even with Austria?</p>

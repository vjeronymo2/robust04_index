			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese delegate  Choegyal today denounced the slander by a non-governmental  organization on China's human rights records in Tibet.    Speaking at the 50th session of the U.N. Commission on Human  Rights, Choegyal, who himself is a Tibetan, said a delegate of  the non-governmental organization, using rumours which he  himself admitted were unconfirmed, launched an unbridled attack  against China over its human rights records in the region of  Tibet.    "In fact, he is not concerned about human rights, his real  motive is to use the human rights issue for dividing China,"  Choegyal said.    "As a Tibetan, I have experienced decades of historic  changes  since the liberation of Tibet. We are best qualified to comment  on the situation of human rights in Tibet," Choegyal added.    He said that since the peaceful liberation, particularly  after the democratic reform in 1959, the situation of human  rights of the Tibetan people has changed radically.    In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, there have been great  economic and social progress and visible improvement of people's  living standards, with traditional customs being respected and  religious freedom being protected, Cheogyal said.    He said the Tibetan people are wholeheartedly supporting all  policies of the central government for Tibet, especially those  designed specially for the region in the past decade.    They feel from their own experiences that the past few  decades have been the best period in terms of the situation of  their human rights, Cheogyal said.    He noted that the speech delivered by the non-governmental  organization delegate "is full of distortion and fabrication."    Choegyal said, "the situation in Tibet today is known to  everybody, and one can see the overall and real situation there  as long as he holds a just position."    He said that in 1993 alone, government officials,  parliamentarians, diplomats and journalists from 24 countries  visited Tibet, in addition to about 10,000 tourists from around  the world.</p>

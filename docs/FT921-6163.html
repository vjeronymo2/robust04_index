			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Exor bid intensifies Perrier battle THE BATTLE for control of Perrier intensified yesterday when Exor, the holding group controlled by Italy's Agnelli family, launched a full bid for the French mineral water company. Exor and the Agnellis, who already control 49 per cent of Perrier, are offering FFr1,475 per share for the remainder. That is the price at which Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, launched its full hostile bid for Perrier last month, valuing the whole of the water group at FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.36bn). Unlike the Nestle offer, the Exor bid is unconditional. The Swiss company and its ally, Banque Indosuez, have by contrast reserved the right to drop out if they should fail to win acceptances for 50 per cent of Perrier plus one share. Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat group and the man in overall charge of the Agnelli family investment groups involved in the battle to acquire Perrier, had earlier indicated that he would offer 2 per cent more than Nestle for two-thirds of the shares; an option allowed under French takeover law. It was not clear last night exactly why Exor decided to table a full bid at the same price as the Swiss counterbidder. A day earlier, a Paris appeals court ruled that Exor, which has direct control of 35 per cent of Perrier, had to launch a bid for the water company. Exor is the subject of a FFr5.6bn agreed offer from the Agnellis, who control another 13.8 per cent of Perrier through Saint Louis, a sugar group. The ruling was in response to an appeal by the Agnelli camp for an exemption from French takeover rules obliging an investor or group of investors acting in concert to launch a bid once they have bought more than third of a company's shares. Exor had hoped to be able to offer a lower price, FFr1,235 per share, on the grounds that this was the price at which Saint Louis had bought its stake in Perrier last month. However, it appears that the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the French stock exchange regulator, decided that Exor must either make a full bid at Nestle's price, or launch a two-thirds bid at a 2 per cent premium.</p>

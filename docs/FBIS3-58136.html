The European Economic Area Agreement [EEA] will extend the  free movement provisions of the EC's Single Market to Austria,  Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.    The agreement gives reciprocal rights of movement, residence  and employment to UK citizens and nationals of other member EC  States. The expanded single market area will lead to increased  trade and business opportunities for all parties to the  agreement.  <H5>  Home Office Minister Charles Wardle Said Today: </H5>   "The EEA will extend the existing European Community rights  of free movement and residence to Austria, Finland, Iceland,  Norway and Sweden.    "This means that nationals of these countries in the future  will be treated in the same way as European Community nationals  for immigration purposes. They will be able to enter the United  Kingdom simply on production of a valid passport or national  identity card and will be free to work here or, so long as they  are able to support themselves financially to reside here as a  student, retired person or in any other capacity.    "At ports and airports where there are separate "EC" and  "non-EC" channels for arriving passengers, EEA nationals will  now be routed through the EC channel.    "The European Economic Area Agreement provides new  opportunities for United Kingdom companies by extending the  Single Market to these five countries. In addition the rights of  free movement and residence will allow British citizens to work  and carry out business and to reside freely in any of these  countries in accordance with Community law."    The European Economic Area Agreement was signed in Oporto on  2 May 1993. The United Kingdom ratified the agreement on 15  November 1993. Full ratification came on 10 December 1993.</p>

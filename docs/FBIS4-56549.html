			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aristides Cajar Paez] </F>   [Text] According to the latest poll conducted by the  consulting firm of Dichter &amp; Neira/Louis Harris, presidential  candidates Ernesto Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades are in  first and second place, respectively, in electoral preferences.    Presidential candidate Perez Balladares of the United People  Alliance ticket, ranks first with 33.3 percent. According to  the same poll, presidential candidate Blades of the Papa Egoro  Movement trails Perez Balladares with 24 percent while candidate  Mireya de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party ranks third with 17.3  percent. Meanwhile, presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles of  the Change '94 Alliance ticket dropped to fourth place with 16.8  percent of the electoral support.    Meanwhile, Mayin Correa, candidate for mayor of the  municipality of Panama, obtained 44 percent of the electoral  support among those polled in Panama City, followed by radio  commentator Andres Vega Domplin with 26.7 percent, and first  lady Ana Mae Diaz de Endara, who is in third place with 8  percent.    This poll was conducted with the methodology of simulated  vote-casting [votacion simulada] applied to a random sample of  5,479 eligible voters chosen among the group that is most likely  to vote nationwide. These subjects used ballots similar to the  ones that will be used on the 8 May presidential and mayoral  elections.    The nationwide poll was conducted by province between 30  April and 3 May 1994. In order to guarantee the accuracy of the  information, a pilot poll was implemented on 29 April. This  poll was carried out in the homes of persons who interviewed  face to face with the pollsters, and had an estimated 3-percent  margin of error.    In addition to electoral preferences for president, this  poll  measured people's sympathy toward candidates for mayor in the  municipalities of Panama and San Miguelito, and the political  parties nominating the various candidates for these positions.    Perez Balladares received the highest support rating in  Panama Province -- 35.3 percent of those polled, and 31.1  percent in the rest of the country. Subjects ranging from ages  30 to 39 (36.3 percent) make up his support base.    Meanwhile, Blades received support from 28.5 percent of  those  polled in Panama Province vis-a-vis 19 percent in the rest of  the country. The age group backing Blades' presidential  candidacy is that made up of 18 through 29 year-olds (33  percent).    On 2 May, Blades concluded his electoral campaign with a  concert staged outside the Rommel Fernandez Arena in Juan Diaz,  while Perez Balladares will conclude his campaign today with a  rally scheduled for this afternoon in the 5 May Plaza.    Mireya Gruber, who publicly expressed her dislike for  electoral polls, will conclude her campaign activities on 6 May,  which will be -- according to Electoral Tribunal stipulations --  the last day campaign activities will be allowed.    This is the last electoral poll LA PRENSA will publish on  the  current electoral process that will conclude on 8 May by virtue  of Decree No. 40 issued by the Electoral Tribunal on 30 April.    According to Electoral Tribunal officials, Decree No. 40  bans, as of 5 May, the media from divulging election polls so as  to prevent "the manipulation of the electorate."  <H5>  If The Presidential Elections Were Held Today, Who Would You </H5> Vote For?

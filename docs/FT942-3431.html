			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Philippine deficit doubles over year The Philippines' current account deficit reached Dollars 676m (Pounds 450m) in the first quarter, more than double the year-ago figure of Dollars 297m. According to data released yesterday by the country's central bank, however, a sharply higher net inflow in the non-monetary capital account of Dollars 1.16bn, up from Dollars 849m last year, more than compensated. A bigger trade deficit, up 30 per cent to Dollars 1.66bn, resulted mainly from increased imports of capital goods and raw materials, which the central bank said 'reflected the bullish investment climate' during the period. Helping ease the pressure were the accelerated growth in exports (up 17.8 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn) and substantial gains in short-term capital and foreign investments (up 36 per cent to Dollars 1.16bn), boosted by proceeds from the partial privatisation of Petron, the state-controlled oil refining and marketing company. Net foreign investments, bolstered by the Dollars 502m payment for 40 per cent holdings in Petron that Saudi Arabia's Aramco group won in a bidding, grew 114 per cent to Dollars 548m.</p>

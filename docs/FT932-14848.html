			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: Italy's big bang when Italians are called on to vote in eight referendums - has been virtually the only fixed point in a rapidly disintegrating Italian political universe. Not surprisingly, therefore, politicians and the media have seized on the occasion as the starting point of a new era. It is no good imagining, however, that the following days will reveal a ready-furnished political landscape. Whatever the voting figures, the scene next week will resemble the scene this week. The parties and the men who dominated Italian politics since the second world war have been demolished. New ones have yet to emerge. Most of the eight questions on the ballot papers are best described as populist-nihilist. The one that comes nearest to expressing the popular mood is that which seeks to end state subsidies to political parties - and may thereby drive them to rely even more in future on unorthodox sources of funds. But the one that is seen as providing the key to Italy's political future is that which would replace, for two-thirds of the seats in the upper house, the traditional party-list proportional electoral system with a British-style majority one. All parties have now rallied to this proposal, which in the present atmosphere may be enough to sink it. But if it does pass with a thumping majority, as expected, it is assumed that parliament will feel obliged to enact the same system for the lower house, too, and that new elections would then soon be held. The effect of such a change in 'normal' times would be to give an overall majority to the largest party - until now, always the Christian Democrats. In these abnormal times the outcome is much harder to predict, but one effect would almost certainly be to increase the strength of parties whose support is regionally concentrated, such as the Lombard League, thereby increasing the danger that Italy will fragment. Whatever the electoral system, democratic politics require strong parties with clear programmes; and effective government will probably require constitutional as well as electoral reform. An upheaval as revolutionary as that now sweeping through Italian politics calls for an elected assembly with a mandate to revise the constitution, while day-to-day affairs are managed by a broad-based caretaker government under a non-party figure commanding general respect. Mr Giuliano Amato, the current prime minister, can hardly be that figure, though he has done a remarkable job considering the circumstances. Meanwhile the investigation into corruption, and into the even worse allegations now surfacing against veteran political leaders, must be carried through. When the full truth is known there may be a case for clemency. But the Italian people would be rightly intolerant of further attempts to keep any part of the truth a secret from them.</p>

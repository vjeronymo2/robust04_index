			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Mannesmann Restructuring old businesses and diversifying into new ones are paying off for Mannesmann. The group's mobile communications venture made its maiden profits contribution in the first half. That should please foreign investors in particular, who have bought the stock on the basis that Mannesmann Mobilfunk was the German equivalent of Vodafone. Equally, the painful process of cutting jobs and shifting production to cheaper locations outside Germany helps explain the swing into profit by the automotive components businesses and the move to break-even by the tubes division. Mannesmann's new chairman, Mr Joachim Funk, yesterday made clear there is more of the same to come. But the news from Mannesmann's large engineering and plant division was mixed. Orders rose 34 per cent compared with the previous year - ahead of the German average increase of 26 per cent. The disappointment was that this has yet to show on the bottom line. Some of the blame can be attributed to the seasonality of the plant side of this business. But there are also suspicions that Mannesmann has been bidding unsustainably low prices to retain or even increase its market share. Continued growth from Mobilfunk and recovery of Mannesmann's cyclical businesses will drive profits higher over the next few years. But, with the shares already trading on about 15 times next year's earnings, the stock does not look cheap.</p>

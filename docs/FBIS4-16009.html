			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Armenian Government statement on 9 April] </F>   [Text] Azerbaijan's military aircraft infiltrated the  airspace of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and bombed  several residential areas, including Stepanakert, on 10 April.  The bombed areas are far away from the front line. The densely  populated market-place area in Stepanakert was selected as a  target. Significant damage was caused and many people, mainly  women and children, were killed.    Regrettably, the international community has failed to  properly assess the policy of bombarding peaceful residential  areas, which has been maintained since 1992. That has created  an opportunity for Azerbaijan to continue to bomb residential  areas without being penalized for such operations.    Azerbaijan's savage operations have reconfirmed that the  republic has not relinquished its policy of state terrorism  against NKR's people. The objective of that policy is to kill  peaceful residents. However, that is a gross violation of  international law and the Geneva Convention. Obviously, it is  aimed at further expanding the confrontation and undermining the  recent initiatives that have been made to restore peace in the  region.    The Armenian Supreme Council declares that Azerbaijan will  be  held fully responsible for similar activities in the future. It  also appeals to the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the CIS, the  European Parliament, and the parliaments of individual countries  to consider the military operations against peaceful people,  take practical and urgent measures as called for by  international law, prevent the bombing of residential areas, and  obstruct Azerbaijan's unacceptable activities.    Terrorist activity took place in Georgia's Marneuli Rayon on  the night between 8 and 9 April. One of the passenger cars of  the train on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track was destroyed by an  explosion. Three passengers were killed and 15 others were  wounded in the incident. Five passenger cars were completely  destroyed by the fire caused by the explosion. The engineering  installations and passenger cars on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track  have been damaged by explosions 20 times and the natural-gas  pipeline in the region has been sabotaged 12 times since the  beginning of 1993. The fact that acts of sabotage against  Armenia have taken place in an area populated by Azerbaijani  people in Georgia leaves no doubt about who is responsible for  terrorist activities. Obviously, Azerbaijan, in contravention  of all international norms, has selected Georgia's territory as  the venue of the operations it wishes to carry out to realize  its objectives. That is an indication of the effort it has been  making to involve Armenia and Georgia in the confrontation.    There must be an end to that kind of international  terrorism,  which has assumed violent proportions. The Armenian Government  states that all necessary measures will be taken to guarantee  the security of Armenia's citizens and safeguard Armenia's  interests. Azerbaijan's leaders will be fully responsible for  the worsening of the situation in the future. The Armenian  Government hopes that Georgia's leaders will take practical  measures to guarantee security of transportation between Georgia  and Armenia.    Dated: Yerevan City, 9 April 1994.</p>

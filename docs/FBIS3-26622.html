Experiments with the joint-stock system in foreign  economic and trade enterprises should be carried out under  leadership, by choice, and in a planned way. When carrying out  experiments with the joint-stock system, foreign economic and  trade enterprises should act in strict accordance with  provisions promulgated by the State Commission for Restructuring  Economy and other organs, including "Provisions Governing  Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System,"  "Suggestions on the Standards for Joint-Stock Limited  Companies," and "Suggestions on the Standards for  Limited-Liability Companies." Departments in charge of foreign  economic relations and trade at all levels should take pains to  organize and guide their own enterprises to experiment with the  joint-stock system and should refrain from rushing headlong into  mass action.    2. In order to strengthen leadership over experiments with  the joint-stock system in economic and trade enterprises, this  ministry has decided to set up a "Leading Group for the  Experiments With the Joint-Stock System in Economic and Trade  Enterprises" (for the names of group members, please see the  appendix). The primary tasks of the leading group are: 1) To  study and draw up principles and policies concerning economic  and trade enterprises' experiments with the joint-stock system;  2) To examine, discuss, and comment on applications and  feasibility studies submitted by enterprises directly under the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) to be  reorganized into joint-stock enterprises; 3) To provide guidance  to local departments in charge of economic relations and trade,  and help them do a good job in experimenting with the  joint-stock system; 4) To study and draw up policies and  management methods for planning, quotas, permits, personnel, and  finance which suit the needs of economic and trade joint-stock  enterprises; and strengthen professional management over  economic and trade joint-stock enterprises; 5) To do a good job  in the propaganda, guidance, and explanations concerning  experiments with the joint-stock system in economic and trade  enterprises; and 6) To sum up and exchange experience gained by  economic and trade enterprises from experiments with the  joint-stock system, and bring about healthy development in the  economic and trade enterprises that experiment with the  joint-stock system.    Offices will be set up under the leading group.    3. Issues concerning foreign economic and trade enterprises  engaged in experiments with the joint-stock system -- such as  their necessary conditions, establishment formalities, and the  issuance of stock to the public -- should be dealt with  according to relevant stipulations, including the "Provisions  Governing Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System,"  "Suggestions on the Standards of Joint-Stock Limited Companies,"  and "Suggestions on the Standards of Limited Liability  Companies."    4. When they are reorganized into joint-stock enterprises,  foreign trade and industrial-trade enterprises in all localities  and under different departments, as well as production  enterprises that have been granted autonomy in foreign-related  economic and trade operations, should subject their operational  scope to reexamination and reevaluation by the MOFERT, and go  through the necessary reorganization formalities in accordance  with relevant stipulations. When applying for autonomy in  foreign-related economic and trade operations, newly organized  joint-stock enterprises first should obtain the consent of the  MOFERT before going through examination and approval formalities  according to relevant stipulations.    Please submit any questions and opinions rising during the  implementation of this circulations promptly to the "Office of  the Leading Group for Experiments of the Joint-Stock System in  Economic and Trade Enterprises" under the MOFERT.    [Signed] The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade    [Dated]10 September 1992</p>

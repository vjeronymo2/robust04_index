			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / BellSouth adds to QVC war chest BELLSOUTH, the US regional telecommunications company, yesterday joined QVC Network's war party in the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications by agreeing to invest Dollars 1.5bn in QVC if it acquires Paramount. BellSouth will take the place in the QVC camp of Liberty Media, the cable television programming group which owns 22 per cent of QVC's stock. Under an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees anti-trust matters, Liberty is to divest its interest in QVC within 18 months, provided QVC wins the Paramount battle. Liberty will not go ahead with a planned injection of a further Dollars 500m into QVC to finance the bid, through an issue of convertible stock. The FTC had been concerned about Liberty's existing ties and proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable television service company in the US, which in turn plans to merge with telecommunications group Bell Atlantic. The complicated deal gives a double boost to the Dollars 9.5bn hostile bid for Paramount from QVC, a television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry figure. First, it gives Mr Diller extra financial muscle, enabling him to raise his bid to compete with an increased Dollars 10.1bn offer unveiled last Sunday by cable company Viacom, with which Paramount has agreed to merge. Second, if the full FTC commission approves the deal, the QVC bid will clear an important and potentially damaging hurdle - the government's anti-trust investigation of the deal. As part of yesterday's deal, BellSouth and QVC have also agreed to form a joint venture to create, develop and offer interactive television services worldwide. BellSouth is to buy Dollars 1bn of QVC common stock, or roughly 16.7m shares, at Dollars 60 a share, and Dollars 500m of QVC 6 per cent convertible exchangeable preferred stock, convertible into some 7.6m shares. It will become the company's largest shareholder, with roughly 14 per cent of the equity, and will get three seats on the board. If the Paramount bid fails, it will have the option to buy Dollars 500m of stock.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Britain welcomes levelling of field BRITISH FARMERS yesterday welcomed the end of the uncertainty surrounding their businesses. Their main complaint about the original plans to reform the CAP was that they discriminated against the UK, which has much larger and more efficient farms than the rest of Europe. Much of the original discrimination against British agriculture appears to have been cleared away. In particular, farmers with large acreages will be relieved at the demise of a proposal to limit the amount of set-aside land on which compensation is paid. This was the biggest stumbling block for the UK during the negotiations. 'It would appear that John Gummer has achieved quite a remarkable victory on behalf of all UK arable farmers,' the managing director of one large company said yesterday, delighted that Britain had not been left at a disadvantage to smaller European competitors. Under the reform proposals 15 per cent of the arable land will be put into set-aside. Farmers will then qualify for compensation for the 29 per cent cut in EC cereal prices. This would imply a compensation figure of about Pounds 200 per hectare. The Ministry of Agriculture said that Pounds 230 a hectare had originally been proposed for a 35 per cent cut in cereal prices, and a later proposal to cut prices by only 27 per cent would have given Pounds 175 a hectare compensation. Britain has gained further concessions within the reform package, particularly for sheep farmers in the so-called 'less favoured areas', or uplands, where the original proposals limited the number of ewes eligible for subsidy to 750. UK farm incomes, however, will continue to fall from already low levels. Booker Farming, which farms and advises on 45,000 acres in England, predicted earlier this year that the income of a top quality 500-acre farm in the UK would fall from Pounds 20,000 to only Pounds 3,500 under the original MacSharry proposals. While the impact of the latest package will not be so severe, it could still cut the farm income in half. Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, agreed yesterday that many farms were already under severe financial pressure, but he was prepared to accept lower prices if the UK was on an equal footing with the rest of Europe. As long as the reform package treated all farmers the same, 'we have got to learn to live with it,' he said.</p>

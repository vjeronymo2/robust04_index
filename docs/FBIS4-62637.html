			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow highly appraises cooperation between the UN  and Baghdad in the sphere of disarmament and hopes that it will  increase. This was stated by Russian president's envoy to the  Middle East Viktor Posuvalyuk at a briefing in Moscow today.    He said this would create real conditions for the partial  lifting of the international sanctions against Iraq. "It is  necessary that Iraq define its position on disarmament and let  international observers in. Baghdad also must recognize the  independence of Kuwait and inviolability of its borders,"  Posuvalyuk pointed out.    Commenting on a settlement in the Middle East, Posuvalyuk  stressed that relations between Syria and Israel were the main  direction there. "Contradictions are very serious here.  Damascus demands that Israel liberate the Syrian territories  occupied in 1967 and Israel demands complete normalization of  the situation on the border and security," he said.    Posuvalyuk emphasized that this issue was being discussed at  direct talks between the parties and through mediators. He said  that encouraging progress had been achieved.    He announced that he would go to Damascus in the next few  days where he would hold consultations with representatives of  Syria and other Middle East countries involved in the peace  settlement in the region.    Posuvalyuk spoke on the situation in Yemen in details. He  announced that 696 Russian citizens had been evacuated from  Yemen by May 15.</p>

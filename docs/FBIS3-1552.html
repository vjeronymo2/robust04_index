Premier of the State Council Li Peng and Goh Chok Tong,  Singapore's premier who is in China for a working visit,  attended the signing ceremony. Vice Premier Li Lanqing and  Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed the agreement.    Under the agreement, both sides support Suzhou Municipality  and the Singapore development consortium's cooperation in  building and developing the Suzhou industrial park. The area  for the first-phase development is eight square km. The project  is designed to develop a modern industrial park of considerable  size, with new and high technology as the leading sectors and  modern industries as the main structure; other supplementary  tertiary industry and social public welfare undertakings are  also incorporated into this project.    After the signing agreement, Premier Li Peng and his wife  Zhu  Lin met with Premier Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan  Yew, and his wife He Yu Zhi.    Li Peng said the decision by the two governments to  cooperate  in building the Suzhou industrial park constitutes a major event  in bilateral ties. This has provided a new pattern for and  injected new ingredients into the economic cooperation between  the two countries, Li Peng noted, adding that it is of positive  significance in the deepening of the friendly and cooperative  relations between the two countries.    Li Peng expressed welcome to Premier Goh Chok Tong and  Senior  Minister Lee Kuan Yew on their current visit to China and called  them old friends of the Chinese people. He praised them for  doing a lot of beneficial work to promote the development of the  friendly and cooperative relations between China and Singapore.  In the past two years, Li Peng said, the relations between  China and Singapore have been developing smoothly and the two  countries have conducted effective cooperation in various  spheres.    The conclusion of the agreement in a relatively short period  of time demonstrates both sides' sincerity for cooperation, Li  Peng said, adding that there will of course be much to be done  after the agreement is signed.    Li Peng said the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area is a place  propitious for giving birth to great men, with a favorable  investment environment and labor of good quality. He expressed  the belief that with the support of the two governments and  close coordination between relevant departments of both bides,  the industrial park will surely achieve fruitful results.    Li Peng also briefed the guests on China's economic  development last year and so far this year as well as on China's  current reform measures on monetary, taxation, finance, and  investment structures. He said that since last year, the country  has experienced an unprecedented excellent momentum in  attracting foreign investment, with the greater part of foreign  investment going to basic industry and the sphere of investment  expanded into tertiary industry. China is opening its market  even wider to the outside world, Li Peng said, adding that it  welcomes cooperation of every kind with entrepreneurs and  financiers from Singapore and other countries.    Goh Chok Tong and the other honorable guests arrived in  Beijing this afternoon. During the meeting, he said he was  pleased to have the opportunity of making a working visit to  China, of attending the signing ceremony of the Suzhou  industrial park, and of meeting with Premier Li Peng. The  signing of the agreement on the Suzhou Industrial Park reflects  the common aspirations of the two sides and marks a new  development in bilateral economic cooperation, Goh said.  Singapore hopes the park will yield concrete fruit soon after  beginning operations and that it is willing to make joint  efforts to this end with the Chinese side, Goh said.    Also in the afternoon, the two sides signed an agreement on  the adoption of Singapore's economic and public administration  experience. Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee  Kuan Yew attended the signing ceremony.    Under this agreement, Suzhou Municipality will borrow  Singapore's successful experience in the areas of economic  development, urban planning and construction and management, as  well as other public administration management in the  construction and development of the Suzhou Industrial Park.    In the evening, a consolidated commercial agreement for the  industrial park was signed. Jiangsu Governor Chen Huanyou and  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew attended the signing ceremony.</p>

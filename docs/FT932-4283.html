			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Brody's path from ancient Greece MR Ken Brody, newly confirmed chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, is one of those earnest, cerebral and industrious presidential appointees of the '60s generation, whose descent on Washington has been obscured by the miniflaps over Mr Clinton's assorted stumbles. A former general partner at Goldman Sachs, the investment bankers, and a specialist in real estate and high technology investment, he said he found his way into the US government by way of ancient Greece. Four years ago, he and a group of friends embarked on a Great Books course, meeting most Sundays at the Harvard Club in New York. 'The early Greeks got to me with their notion that the highest duty of citizenship is politics and government,' Mr Brody said. 'It changed a good deal of what I thought of things.' Like most Americans he had always been 'somewhat removed' from politics; he had concentrated his efforts on 'working very hard,' his family and his tennis game. A few years ago he went hunting for a presidential candidate, and met then-Governor Bill Clinton (who he still believes has 'the capacity to be a great president,' once he learns the job) through the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats. The two talked for hours, and Mr Brody signed on to the campaign, eventually becoming one of Mr Clinton's principal money raisers. His reward was the Eximbank job, his first choice because it is a comparatively small bureaucracy (about 400 employees), making 'a significant impact on exports'. Exports means jobs, and this administration holds job creation as its highest priority. At the bank, Mr Brody has already presided over some changes, such as the 'letter of interest' plan, which gives customers tentative financing approval within seven days. He's hoping to expand a Dollars 143m programme which provides working capital to small and middle sized businesses which want to export. 'We're trying to figure out how to get the banks to do more of the work,' he said. Eximbank's resources are spread very thin. He'd also like American banks to do more export finance; that yawning need is being met by US subsidiaries of foreign banks. Mr Brody's enthusiasm for his new post has made an impression on the Washington business lobby. Ms Peggy Houlihan, an official with the Coalition for Employment through Exports, said he is creative, 'a quick study' with all the right connections and, highly qualified by virtue of his training in both engineering and finance. The chairman was surprised when Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, appointed him to help run the day-to-day operations of the inter-agency Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which is expected to recommend far-reaching changes in US trade laws. He was told each member of inter-agency committees has one goal: protecting the interests of his agency. 'We're trying to do it differently,' he said. 'We are going to promote the interests of the American people.'</p>

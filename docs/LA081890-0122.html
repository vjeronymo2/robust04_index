			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. LATINOS WATCH MORE TV, STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> Latinos in Los Angeles are watching considerably more television than the  general population, according to a new study by the A. C. Nielsen Co.  </P> <P> The study, based on people meters in 200 Latino households throughout Southern  California, was designed as a pilot for Nielsen's new 800-household National  Hispanic Television Service, which the firm plans to launch early next year to  measure the viewing habits of Latino households throughout the country.  </P> <P> The service will be independent of the better-known 4,000-household Nielsen  service that reports overall national TV ratings. (About 8% of the national  sample is Latino.)  </P> <P> According to the new Nielsen study, conducted between June 14 and July 11, 61%  of Latino households had televisions on during the 8 to 11 p.m.,  Monday-through-Sunday prime-time period, compared to 54% for the general  population. Daytime television was watched by 44.5% of Latino households  compared to 31.3% for the Los Angeles market. In addition, the study showed 71%  of Latino households own a VCR, and 29.6% subscribe to cable television.  </P> <P> Nielsen estimates that there are 1,125,910 Latino households with television in  the Los Angeles area. The company puts the national Latino figure at 6,108,450.  </P></p>

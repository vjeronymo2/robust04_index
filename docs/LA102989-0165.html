			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING RIGHTS AND WRONGS: CONGRESS MUST CATCH AN OVER-EFFICIENT INDUSTRY  </P> <P> In April, 1976, the United States passed a controversial law claiming  jurisdiction over all marine harvests within 200 miles of its coasts. By the  time the law took effect a year later, Canada, Mexico and a host of other  coastal nations had followed the U.S. lead in declaring their own 200-mile  fishery jurisdictions. The actions altered forever -- or at least for the  current generation -- the rules of a coastal nation's rights to resources  within its contiguous waters.  </P> <P> In 12 years the 200-mile fishing act has changed the U.S. fishing scene beyond  recognition -- for good and, some say, bad.  </P> <P> Congress must now reauthorize the 1976 act. No one doubts that this will occur,  but the changes deemed necessary have led to hot lobbying within the fishing  industry. During the next weeks appropriate committees of Congress -- Merchant  Marine in the House and Commerce in the Senate -- will carry multiple  amendments to the floors of both bodies. Too many interests are involved to  expect easy passage.  </P> <P> Last March an incident drove home the need for new rules. A fleet of large,  Seattle-based U.S. fishing ships that process their catch on board was headed  to the great Alaskan fishing grounds in the Bering Sea, more than 2,000 miles  away. They stopped about halfway off Kodiak, Alaska, to gather some extra fish.  For two weeks, deck crews gleefully filled their nets to bursting while teams  below processed the catch.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, with a dogged efficiency that free-enterprise Americans might  have admired in another activity, the ships scooped up Kodiak's entire annual  quota of pollock -- a fish harvested in large quantities for paste, filets and  meal. This left the remote island's shore plants without the pollock they  needed to remain in full operation for the rest of the year, and left smaller  Kodiak fishing boats without the fish projected for their nets throughout the  autumn. It meant the loss of 2,000 jobs.  </P> <P> The big Seattle ships then compounded the outrage. They stripped the females of  their roe -- for which the Japanese pay inflated prices -- and dumped  carcasses, from which they harvested nothing, over the side. The greedy action  not only wasted 60,000 tons of fish that shore plants could have converted to  food and meal, but it covered the sea floor with rotting fish that plugged the  nets of local fishermen trying for other species after the outsiders had gone.  </P> <P> The American processor-trawler fleet of about 50 ships barely existed six years  ago. Their numbers now grow with success, and the fleet has become  overcapitalized. Worse, about 50 more large trawler-processor ships are under  construction, waiting to compete in a year or two. Yet the existing fleet must  already catch more fish than scientists deem safe for conservation of the  stocks, in order to meet huge payrolls and boat mortgages.  </P> <P> None of this could have happened in U.S. fishing 15 years ago, when virtually  all U.S. and Canadian fishermen on the east and west coasts of North America  were being wiped out by foreign fishing fleets. Back then several countries,  led by Japan and the Soviet Union, had taken advantage of high-seas freedom to  send fleets of efficient large catcher-processor ships to the prime fishing  coasts of the world.  </P> <P> In waters off the United States, such ships -- dwarfing the boats and gear of  local fishermen -- scraped the grounds within sight of shore, from Gloucester  and Long Island to Fort Bragg, Coos Bay and Kodiak. Canadians saw similar  exploitation. American inshore fishermen, many of whom followed in the steps of  fathers and grandfathers, turned into a dying breed. Worse, to pragmatic  politicians, none of the foreign catch contributed a nickel to the domestic  economy.  </P> <P> Then in 1976 Congress passed the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, since  named the Magnuson Act after its chief sponsor, the late Sen. Warren Magnuson  (D-Wash.). The act provides that U.S. fishermen can harvest all the sea  creatures of the U.S. 200-mile waters, within scientifically established  quotas, that they prove able to catch. These areas off the United States  coasts, with their richly productive continental shelves, happen to contain  approximately 20% of the world's entire natural seafood supply.  </P> <P> During the early years of the Magnuson Act, foreign nations were able to catch  negotiated quotas of American fish. In the past two years the foreign quotas  have been drawn down, virtually to zero as Americans have proved able to do all  the catching and processing themselves.  </P> <P> No one in the fishing business really expected that to happen so fast. But the  new American taste for fish as a healthy protein alternative to beef, combined  with high world prices for fish (particularly Japanese yen prices) and ready  foreign capital to augment dollars (particularly from Japan and Norway) have  made fishing attractive to the bold and the ambitious as well as to those  Americans who have always wanted to fish for a living. Suddenly there are no  longer enough fish to go around, even among Americans.  </P> <P> By Oct. 1, 1989, Congress was supposed to have reauthorized the Magnuson Act.  But this self-imposed deadline -- the start of the new fiscal year -- is going  to be missed by several weeks, perhaps months, as more than 60 proposed changes  run the gauntlet. Among the plethora of amendments that the House Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee reported out on Oct. 5 are provisions to improve  the effectiveness of enforcement, to make certain any foreign allocations will  benefit U.S. interests, to speed passage through the bureaucracy of emergency  actions -- and, through international pressure, to curb the use of miles-long  gill nets on the high seas. One amendment affecting fishermen on both coasts  would place tuna, a migratory species hitherto exempted from management under  the act, under the same controls as more stationary species.  </P> <P> Many of the amendments center around conservation, which opens a conflict  between two prime tenets of the original act: to develop an American fishing  industry from the great resource available, and to conserve the resource for  the benefit of the nation. Ironically, despite the word "conservation" in the  name of the act, the provisions for development have been the ones employed  most effectively.  </P> <P> Most responsible people in the fishing industry now declare that conservation  should receive the highest priority under the Magnuson Act. Yet they do not  necessarily agree on who should do the conserving. As a congressional staff  person noted: "One man's conservation is another man's allocation."  </P> <P> The roe-stripping incident off Alaska last spring was bad enough, but the  pressures that big boats feel to generate income on investment appear to be  growing worse.  </P> <P> Paul Fuchs, mayor of Dutch Harbor (the Alaskan seaport closest to the Bering  Sea fishing grounds), has had ample opportunity to observe what is happening.  The big U.S. ships catch vastly more than their quotas, Fuchs says, and get  away with it because nobody is there to watch them. They work grounds  unnecessarily where their nets take great quantities of such by-catch as crab  and halibut -- which by law they cannot keep -- as well as fish too small for  the processing machinery.  </P> <P> A volunteer witness at a recent fishery council meeting in Anchorage supported  Fuchs' contention. The man, who testified that he had worked as a crewmen on  one of the ships, said he saw more fish wasted, thrown back dead, than he saw  processed. Fuchs termed it "rape and piracy," a haunting reminder of the  accusations leveled 15 years ago against foreign fleets.  </P> <P> The only solution to such overfishing appears to be an expensive, on-board  observer program.  </P> <P> During a visit to Japan last fall, I heard an impassioned five-hour lecture on  wasteful American overfishing from the owners of a Japanese fishing company  forced to retrench after the loss of U.S. quotas off Alaska. Shun-Ichi Kanai,  president of Kanai Fisheries Co. Ltd., a thin, bald man in his 70s, spoke  emotionally as he leaned across the conference table, although the  interpreter's translation smoothed the words:  </P> <P> "I just want to express you're overdoing it. Since you're a free country, even  a barber can take as many fish as he wants. But the American resource belongs  in a big term to the world." Ironic words from the people Americans once felt  were destroying the fish resources of the nation, whose actions helped  precipitate the Magnuson Act.  </P> <P> For American fishermen, in fact, the very success of the Magnuson Act has  shifted the problem from one based on deprivation to one based on opportunity.  </P></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: British Alcan back in black Better prices helped British Alcan Aluminium, the subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of Montreal, return to the black for the first time in four years with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m, against losses of Pounds 5.2m last time. Operating profits jumped from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 13.8m in the six months to June 30, after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.1m, against Pounds 6m. Better prices in the primary sector and record fabricated tonnage pushed turnover up from Pounds 381.1m to Pounds 394.6m. Mr John Bridgeman, managing director, said the figures showed that cost reduction measures taken over the past few years were beginning to pay off. The increase in fabricated tonnage had been achieved with half the number of employees of 1982, the year the group was formed. He said, however, that margins for fabricated products were still under pressure. Improved economic activity in UK and continental European markets also helped the return to profitability. The bulk of British Alcan's rolled products are exported to Germany and Italy. Mr Bridgeman said the company continued to cut capital expenditure which stood at Pounds 4m for the period. For the full 1993 financial year capital expenditure was Pounds 18.3m. Cash generation was almost Pounds 10m ahead of the same period of last year. The cut in capital expenditure helped the company reduce total debt by Pounds 19m. Short-term borrowings were reduced from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 16.6m while long term loans were cut to Pounds 131.3m (Pounds 145.2m). Gearing fell from 38 per cent to 35 per cent. Interest charges were down from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 6.5m. Mr Bridgeman was appointed managing director last September to succeed Mr Doug Ritchie, British Alcan's chairman and chief executive, who died in August.</p>

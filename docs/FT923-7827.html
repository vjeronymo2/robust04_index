			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / New ratios offer a reprieve to equities: The effect of relaxing portfolio margins which in spite of yesterday's rise in the FT-SE index of nearly 39 points are still 381 points below the year's high - can breathe slightly easier following the relaxation in regulations on minimum solvency ratios. The relaxation also offers a reprieve for the UK stock markets, where prices could have been depressed even further if life insurers were forced to dump equities and switch into higher yielding bonds to meet regulatory ratios. Mr Peter Turvey, senior life insurance industry consultant at actuaries Mercer Fraser, said: 'The message to life insurers is 'Don't panic'. They are saying there is no need to get out at the bottom simply to meet regulatory rules which were drafted for better times.' The mechanics of the relaxation, the handiwork of the Government Actuary's Department, centre on the manner in which with-profits life companies calculate the value of asset portfolios. When asset prices fall - as stock prices have been doing all year - companies find they may not have enough assets to meet regulatory capital ratios. Broadly speaking, with-profits life insurers are required to have enough assets to meet 104 per cent of liabilities. Calculations of liabilities must take into account 'the reasonable expectations of policyholders', roughly interpreted to mean that life insurers may not simply renounce all bonuses for a given year for regulatory capital purposes. Bonuses payable to policyholders in any given year and bonuses declared but not yet paid out in previous years constitute liabilities. But the value of assets - typically stocks, bonds and property - varies daily. Since 1985 the actuary's department has insisted that the 104 per cent minimum be met even if the value of equities in the portfolio falls by 25 per cent. Life insurers must also see that asset values meet a 'resilience test'. That means they must assume the value of property holdings could fall by 25 per cent and fixed-interest investments could be undermined by a rise in rates of as much as 3 percentage points. So to have assets of 4 per cent in excess of liabilities insurers must hold more than that. How much more has become increasingly at issue as equity prices have sagged throughout the year. Mr Trevor May, life insurance industry analyst at Nomura Securities, said the slide in stock prices of about 16 per cent since the beginning of this year had brought a number of life insurers perilously close to their regulatory minimum ratios. Industry sources said at least one mid-sized life insurer made a large switch out of equities into bonds after the general election in April to meet regulatory requirements. Other smaller switches are in train. In a letter dated July 31 Mr Chris Daykin, the government actuary, told life company actuaries that for those whose equity portfolios had already sunk in value to the point where dividend yields were 5.25 per cent, it might not be necessary to build in assumptions of a further 25 per cent fall. The dividend yield on the FT-All Share Index on Friday morning was 5.29 per cent and some companies have portfolios yielding more than that. Mr Daykin said the industry had been concerned about the resilience test for some time. While 25 per cent might be too great a margin in circumstances where a significant price fall has already occurred, it might be too low for the type of frothy market which preceded the stock market crash of October 1987. Indeed, in early July the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the professional body for actuaries, issued a temporary practice note saying that life company actuaries should insist on a resilience test they deemed appropriate rather than simply relying on the existing guidelines. Mr Daykin appeared to open the door to a more liberal interpretation of resilience tests for property assets, which have been written down significantly in many life companies' portfolios. 'Property portfolios tend to differ widely. They tend to be rather lumpy,' he said. Hence, particularly in the current environment, it would be difficult to apply an across-the-board resilience test to decide on a single appropriate safety margin for property.</p>

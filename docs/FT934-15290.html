			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (6): Regional double act - Profile / Andre Rossinot, mayor of Nancy MR Andre Rossinot's two jobs, as France's civil service minister and mayor of Nancy, incarnate two trends in today's Europe: the way in which provincial cities and regions are gaining power at the expense of the national state; and how they are allying with each other across national borders. Mr Rossinot has a special brief to continue with all deliberate speed the transfer of French bureaucrats out of over-crowded Paris to the more sparsely populated provinces. For a UDF politician such as Mr Rossinot, it is the ideal job. The UDF has long believed in the regions. Its partner in the ruling coalition - the RPR Gaullists, who inherit the centralising tradition of the Bourbon kings and the Jacobin revolutionaries - has been only reluctantly convinced of the need in recent years for some devolution of power. But Mr Rossinot cautions that 'the idea of regions is new in France' - a regionalisation law passed in the early 1980s only really took effect in 1986. Interviewed in his stately office overlooking the Place Stanislas, he also complains that his Socialist predecessors gave delocalisations (the transfer of government offices out of Paris) a bad name by being 'too brutal'. Prime minister Edith Cresson's peremptory ordering of the famous Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) from Paris to a refurbished prison in Strasbourg led to legal problems, which Mr Rossinot and others in the Balladur government have subsequently had to sort out. Nonetheless, Mr Rossinot is sticking to Mrs Cresson's plan for an exodus of 30,000 civil servants out of Paris by the end of this century; so far a tenth have left the French capital. Indeed, the mayor-minister says he intends to make delocalisations a permanent feature of French territorial planning. 'We have the advantage of having more space than Britain to work with, but we also have the disadvantage of over-concentration in some urban areas and desertification in some parts of the countryside'. The Balladur government will continue to shift new powers, such as responsibility for professional training, to the regions, says Mr Rossinot. As mayor, Mr Rossinot has been able to preside over his city's growing international links. Although Nancy is also twinned with Padua in Italy, Liege in Belgium, Kanasawa in Japan and many others, its key relationship is with Karlsruhe. Twinning with this German city 35 years ago was 'an act of political courage,' says Mr Rossinot. It has paid off since, and not just in terms of sporting, student and tourist exchanges. Karlsruhe has been very active in joining Nancy and other French and German cities to lobby for a high-speed Franco-German rail link. 'As a result, the last two Franco-German summits have stressed the importance of extending the TGV east of the Rhine,' says the mayor-minister. For Nancy, in its enthusiastic courting of Karlsruhe - which extends to close co-operation between the cities' universities in chemical engineering  -Nottingham and Halle count for relatively little, despite the success of the 1991 joint exhibition by the four cities at the Hanover trade fair. Nancy is still formally twinned with Newcastle. The only economic link seems to be a plant near Nottingham belonging to Pont a Mousson, the Nancy tube-maker. Some people in Nancy also express disappointment that Nottingham's interest in the four city arrangement is more in marketing and 'Europeanisation' of the cities' image to impress the European Commission, rather than in establishing more basic business or educational links. By contrast, Nancy may eventually be drawn much closer to Halle through the medium of its German sister town, Karlsruhe.</p>

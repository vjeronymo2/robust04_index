			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Special Report </H5> <H3>  Key To Realize 80% Production Level Is To Decrease  Idling  Time By Employing Multiphase </H3>   First of all Mr. Tajima of Hitachi Manufacturing Company  talked about the topic of ``what has to be done now,'' in order  to reach the goal of &yen;50 thousand level by 1995, which  includes the need for:    (1) Technical Reform;    (2) Cooperation of LCD/equipment makers to expand the  market.    Next, Mr. Matsuno of Compaq Computer gave a lecture about  Notebook PCs and TFT-LCDs from the user's point of view. In  order to accelerate sale of the color Notebook PC that is  expected to show sharp growth, there remain major issues to  resolve including: reduced cost for color LCDs, improvement of  screen image, complete software, and lower power consumption.  Also, the size of the next generation standard LCD will be  determined by: cost efficiency, technical constraints (LCD  makers), price, maximum dimensions, stable supply (PC makers),  price, and the demand for large screens (PC users).    Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba gave a lecture focusing on the  manufacturing line structure and relooking at the cost of parts  and materials for the second term. According to a study done by  Toshiba, it was verified that there is the ``possibility of  faster production than first term'' by looking at the  specification of four multiphases, and tripled production  investment based on glass baseboards of 360 x 465, multi-sheet  equipment, and automation. If the number of production lines  equipped for different generation production necessary to meet  the demand for TFT-LCD is set as one (4 lines) for the first  term, then it is viewed that the second term will be three times  (12 lines) and third term will be over five times.    Mr. Morimoto at NEC gave a lecture about second term line  structure. For the first term, although emphasis was placed on  the verification of creation and mass production for the TFT  market, there are some reconsiderations left before pursuing  sharply increased mass production. For this reason, he mentioned  the need for: 3-4 times higher manufacturing lines than in the  first term, secured and improved quantity from manufacturing,  realization of reasonable price, and establishment of a TFT-LCD  manufacturing base.    Mr. Nakada of Sharp gave a lecture about the status and  issues regarding equipment for a second line. The scenario of  &yen;50 thousand by 1995 involves, ``twice the productivity, and  80% performance level reducing idling time, and the  reduction  of material cost by half.'' That is to say, the keys for the  second term are:    (1) improved production by multiphase;    (2) improvement for idling time by employing shorter  processing and dust control;    (3) batch vs. piece, improvement and selection of inline  method vs multichamber method;    (4) improvement for high speed and high quality film  throughput.  <H5>  Concrete Solutions Suggested by Each Material Maker </H5>   In the afternoon the panel discussion adopted the debate  format, and the status of each material and approach to the low  cost regarding color filter, LCD driver, glass baseboard, and  blacklight were discussed. In the discussion, at the request of  LCD makers, each material maker talked about their projections  from now on.  <H5>  1. Color Filter (CF) </H5>   Chairman, Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba opened the session, and  indicated that CF takes 30% in logic material cost, which  is  disadvantageous for lowering the cost of LCDs. It is necessary  to study improvement of idling time and investment production,  and the possibility of new methods. In response to this, Mr.  Nakano of Toppan Printing indicated, ``in actual cost of CF, the  ratio between black matrix (BM) and glass baseboard is quite  large. By improvement of performance in low reflection,  improvement of through-put, interface with large model, and  atomization of the inspection process, a cost reduction of  40%  is our aim.'' Mr. Tsuda of Dainippon Ink said that reduction of  processes such as elimination of BM, and improvement of  performance are under study. Dainippon Ink is currently  constructing a new plant scheduled to begin operation in 1994,  and the company will employ a four phase interface which will  increase the performance by 3 to 4 times. Mr. Yasukawa of Shinto  Painting specializing in STN talked about the company's plan to  increase production in 1994, and in the beginning of 1995, at  that time STN will complete its phase, the company intends to  plan mass production of TFT-LCD by electrodeposition. LCD makers  welcomed the newcomer. Each CF maker indicated a 60-80%  price  reduction by 1995. Also standardization for glass baseboard was  requested.  <H5>  2. LCD Driver </H5>   Chairman Mr. Kato of NEC pointed out that LSI cost structure  ratio in TFT-LCD used for the PB98 Notebook is 30%, and  the  cost is high next to CF which is about 40%. Also, doubt  about  the possibility of high performance and low cost were evident.  Mr. Sano of Sharp representing the driver cited:    (1) low LCD operation voltage (15V 5V);    (2) digital LCD operation;    (3) minute wafer processes;    (4) minute pitch;    (5) multiple outputs.    Furthermore slim TCP packaging was also cited. Responses  from  Mr. Aoki of NEC, Mr. Takagi of Toshiba, and Mr. Takuma from  Japan Texas Instruments were almost the same. Reduction of chip  size will continue and discussion about packaging still left  some issues to resolve.  <H5>  3. Glass Baseboard </H5>   Mr. Iwai of Corning Japan which has quite a large market  share cited:    (1) improvement of solvent, molding, processing, and  inspection techniques;    (2) large original board size;    (3) thin board;    (4) eliminating grinding;    (5)eliminating annealing.    Mr. Iwai indicated that it is possible to realize a  50-60%  cost reduction by adopting the above. Mr. Makino of NH Techno  Glass, a newcomer, indicated that an annual 10% reduction  by  eliminating the complete grinding process; and Mr. Hara of Asahi  Glass Fine Techno indicated 20% cost reduction by 1995 by  eliminating annealing and using a thin baseboard. As a request  to LCD makers, not only standardization of baseboard size, but  standardization of other specifications were cited. Also other  opinions were expressed, indicating that especially the method  of inspection must be intensified from now on, and  standardization is urgently needed.  <H5>  4. Back Light (BL) </H5>   Although BL is most active in the four material groups, to  fulfill 1/3 of the goal and 1/2 of the cost cut are quite  difficult. Already types are limited to short axial single light  types for black and white, and long axial single light for  color. Mr. Kojima of Chaya Industry indicated that ``power  consumption is reduced from 5W to 2.4 W.'' Also ``a complete  automated inspection process will be realized by 1995,'' said  Mr. Kojima. The other solutions he cited included the  development of material technology for standardization,  automation line (Toshiba), review of production system,  improvement and efficiency of mass production of optical  conductor baseboard and invertor circuitry, review of each  material for BL and improvement and effect of total material  technology.  <H5>  Danger Of Seeking Only Low Cost </H5>   As a closing statement, Mr. Horikiri of NEC gave a lecture.  ``TFT-LCD especially still has a problem of stable production  largely due to idling. Still the product has not yet reached the  mass production level. But stable supply by second term  production structure is important,'' mentioned Mr. Horikiri.  Also he said that material cost ``has been cut in half in the  past two years. To lower the cost, it is necessary to approach  the cost aspect at a design stage.''    This time, concrete solutions for low cost were suggested by  each maker. Issues to solve such as the specification and  standardization of glass baseboard and other materials were left  to LCD makers. Response to these issues will be the key to  explore &yen;50 thousand by 1995.    At last, Mr. Kanetani of Sharp pointed out, ``most of all  marketability and a commercial base are important, and unless  the configuration for a commercial product in 1995 is  understood, the debate this time will have been nothing but  nonsense.''</p>

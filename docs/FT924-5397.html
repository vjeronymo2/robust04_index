			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Italian tobacco strike suspended Workers at the Italian state tobacco monopoly in Rome and Genoa yesterday suspended a strike which led to a severe shortage of cigarettes, Reuter reports from Rome. A spokesman for the CGIL union grouping said the strikers made their decision after the government threatened to take over cigarette distribution. The strike, now in its 19th day, has emptied tobacconists' shelves and driven street-corner prices to six times their normal level.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA TAPES CAN BE BROADCAST, JUDGE RULES;  </P> <P> LAW: CNN HAS AIRED THE ONLY ATTORNEY-CLIENT TALK THAT IS INVOLVED. THE DEFENSE  DOES NOT OBJECT TO THE DECISION.  </P> <P> A federal judge Wednesday lifted the ban against the broadcast of tape  recordings of Manuel A. Noriega's jailhouse phone conversations, effectively  ending a three-week legal battle over the rights of the press versus the right  to a fair trial.  </P> <P> After reviewing seven tapes turned over by Cable News Network, U.S. District  Judge William M. Hoeveler determined that the only attorney-client conversation  on the tapes already had been broadcast by CNN, which had aired some of the  tapes before the judge ordered the network to stop.  </P> <P> "The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," Hoeveler said  during a hearing.  </P> <P> Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense counsel, said he had no objection to the  lifting of the ban. "The damage is done," he said. "A ban now is like shutting  the barn door after the horse escapes."  </P> <P> Rubino said he would pursue his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of  government misconduct, along with a separate motion asking that the network be  found in contempt of court for airing more of Noriega's conversations after the  judge's Nov. 8 ban, and that CNN be fined $300,000 per broadcast.  </P> <P> CNN first broadcast two weeks ago portions of several tape recordings that were  made by officials of the federal prison south of here where Noriega has been  held on drug charges since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama 11  months ago.  </P> <P> One of those conversations was between Noriega and a Spanish-speaking secretary  for Rubino who served as a translator.  </P> <P> After the first broadcast, Rubino asked Hoeveler to issue a ban, and he did.  CNN appealed that temporary order, and on Nov. 18 the Supreme Court refused to  lift it.  </P> <P> Steven Korn, an attorney for CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting Systems  Inc., reiterated the network position that prior restraint is never  appropriate. "It's fizzled," he said of the issue.  </P> <P> Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the school's  Institute of Bill of Rights Law, told the Associated Press that it would have  been better had the issue returned to the high court for a final resolution.  </P> <P> The fact that the Supreme Court let the ban stand "casts its shadow, and the  shadow is negative," he said. "Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these  sorts of strategies against news organizations. The battle isn't over yet."  </P> <P> CNN founder Ted Turner, who was attending the Western Cable Television  conference Wednesday in Anaheim, described the ruling as "a positive  development . . . . It doesn't really resolve the 1st Amendment issue  completely . . . (but) it's good for us."  </P> <P> CNN President Tom Johnson said the network can now pursue its story on the  government's taping of the ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.  </P> <P> "CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior  restraint on press freedom," he said. "Despite the unfortunate delay, CNN's  reporting of government taping of Noriega phone conversations will continue."  </P> <P> The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners' phone calls at  federal prisons. Noriega signed a release acknowledging that his calls were  being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply to  conversations with his attorneys.  </P> <P> Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease sharing Noriega's  tapes with other government agencies unless he approves.  </P> <P> The case against Noriega, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 28, is plagued  now by only one "collateral issue," in Hoeveler's words, and that is money.  Rubino says he has been unpaid for the last 11 months because about $27 million  stashed by Noriega in overseas bank accounts has been frozen at the request of  the U.S. government.  </P> <P> On Monday, Hoeveler ordered the government to try again to make some of that  money available.  </P></p>

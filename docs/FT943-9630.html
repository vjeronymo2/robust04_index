			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / People: Harwood moves to Kleinwort Ian Harwood, 41, the longest-serving member of SG Warburg Securities' top-rated economics team, is moving to Kleinwort Benson as international economist. Harwood, who has been with Warburg for 17 years, is the latest in a growing list of Warburg economists who have defected to rival institutions. A year ago John Shepperd and Nigel Richardson moved to Yamaichi International and at the start of the year Kevin Gardiner joined Morgan Stanley. Harwood's departure underlines Warburg's position as one of the more fertile hunting grounds for City economists. Because of its reputation, the firm appears to have little difficulty recruiting bright young economists some of whom are subsequently tempted away by firms prepared to pay more than Warburg. Kleinwort Benson lags well behind Warburg Securities in the areas where Harwood has made his name. He has been variously the firm's chief UK and international economist and most recently head of global asset allocation. In the latest Extel ranking Warburg was rated number one in international equity market coverage, and number three in global asset allocation and international economics. Edmond Warner, 31, KB's head of strategy and economics who joined from Baring Securities just under a year ago, says Harwood's job will be to 'beef up' macro-economic research and international marketing. Albert Edwards will continue to be responsible for global strategy research.</p>

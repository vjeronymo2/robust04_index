A decision by the County to adopt a restriction that relaxes the curfew and allows equal access to all operators could render both this proceeding and the formal complaints moot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Senate Report 103&hyph;150, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a Report on Mountain Flying which examined the FAA's oversight of general aviation safety in mountainous areas. GAO Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Aviation, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate. Aviation Safety, FAA Can Better Prepare General Aviation Pilots for Mountain Flying Risks, GAO/RCED&hyph;94&hyph;15 (December 1993) Overall, GAO recommended additional efforts to prepare general aviation pilots for the greater risks of flying in mountainous areas. In Chapter Four of the report GAO presents its views of the legal and safety issues involved with Pitkin County's prohibition against general aviation night operations at Aspen Airport, but makes no recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Based on the available information, the FAA has determined to issue this Notice of Proposed Termination. The FAA will review any additional comments, statements and data which are submitted and any other available information to determine whether the County has provided satisfactory evidence of compliance or has taken satisfactory corrective action. If the FAA finds satisfactory evidence of compliance, the FAA will provide written notice to the County and publish notice of compliance in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the FAA determines that the County has imposed an access restriction in violation of ANCA or Part 161 the FAA will issue an order in accordance with Part 161 terminating eligibility for new airport grants and discontinuing payments of airport grant funds as well as disapproving the County's PFC application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on March 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David L.

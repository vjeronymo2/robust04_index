			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--AL-WAFD says the deteriorating  political and economic conditions in Yemen threaten pan-Arab  security in this vital area on the southern approach to the Red  Sea and are causing great frustration throughout the Arab  nation. The paper says that it is a shame that hopes for Arab  unity are foundering in this crucial Arab region.    In its Thursday [6 January] editorial, the paper, which is a  mouthpiece of the opposition al-Wafd Party, links the bread  demonstrations, which occurred amid an atmosphere filled with  pessimism and disappointment, and the impending failure of  unity, which came about after many years of struggle by the  northern and southern parts of Yemen.    The paper notes the repercussions of political differences  between the two conflicting leaders, 'Ali Salih and Salim  al-Bid, on the political and economic situation in the country.  It adds that the differences have reached the point of  threatening separation and loss of unity.    The paper expresses hope that the Yemeni people will heal  their political wounds and preserve the unity of their country.  It also expresses hope that, for the sake of the Yemeni people,  the views will converge and the rift will not increase so that  the Yemeni people can deal with their economic problems and sail  to the shore of safety.</p>

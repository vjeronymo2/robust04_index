			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): When figures mislead - Performance tables aren't always the whole story Performance tables are always of interest if you have money to invest and are wondering where to put it - but they can be misleading. Weekend Money has recently excluded a trust called Manakin from its tables of top-performers because the trust's special circumstances and history mean it is not really comparable with its peers. Manakin is a small venture capital investment trust known formerly as Abingworth. It appeared two weeks ago as the top-performing investment trust over both three and five years - but it has been in liquidation since 1991. Its assets are being sold off and the profits returned to investors; the process is due to be completed within a year or two. Over the past three years, Manakin has repaid a total of 380p a share, starting with a payment of 260p in December 1991; hence the dramatic drop in share price shown in the graph. Its appearance in the best-performer tables is due to the large cash repayments it has been making to existing investors, and its slow recovery from the low point it hit after the October 1987 crash. Long wind-ups and capital repayments are particularly common with venture capital investment trusts. The nature of their holdings - mainly in unquoted companies - means portfolios cannot be liquidated overnight. It takes years rather than months as investment managers find buyers for their stakes or help companies float on a stock market. Heavy reliance on performance tables can be equally hazardous when it involves small investment trusts with assets of less than Pounds 20m or so. One or two well-chosen investments can make a huge difference to a small trust's portfolio, but the performance is not usually repeatable. Larger funds have much more diversified portfolios, so one or two spectacular performers are less likely to push them to the top of the tables. If a small fund does hit the top of the tables, buyers should beware. There might be a sudden rush of demand which could push the shares to a completely unjustifiable premium. Anyone who buys at that point is likely to end up with painfully charred fingers - something that happened a few years ago with a tiny, mainly privately-owned, trust called Capital Gearing. After it appeared as top performer, its shares were ramped to a premium of almost 100 per cent for a short while, only to revert to more normal levels once investors saw sense. If a fund's place in the performance table makes it seem attractive, always check whether there are any particular reasons for the outperformance. The health warning that 'past performance is not a guide to the future' can be particularly apt for small, specialised investment trusts.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> JOLT IN OIL PRICES SPARKS RISE IN PRODUCER PRICES  </P> <P> Fear of war in the Persian Gulf jolted oil prices for the third straight month  in October, but slowing economic growth held wholesale price inflation for  non-food and non-energy items to zero.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said Friday that its producer price index for finished  goods, one step short of retail, jumped seasonally adjusted 1.1% last month.  </P> <P> That followed increases of 1.6% in September and 1.3% in August, bringing the  annual inflation rate for the year so far to levels not seen in nine years.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices inflation, on an annual basis was 7% for the first 10 months  of 1990, the highest since a 7.1% rise in 1981.  </P> <P> Even though the October number was higher than the predicted 0.7% rise, stock  and bond markets rallied immediately after the report because prices outside  the volatile food and energy sectors were unchanged. This so-called "core"  inflation rate is considered a better indicator of long-term inflationary  trends.  </P> <P> "What we have here is an energy problem, which is driving prices higher. Behind  that, the economy is very weak and is not creating significant inflationary  pressures." said Ron Schreibman, economist at the National Assn. of Wholesale  Distributors.  </P> <P> Traders took the absence of core inflation as a sign the Federal Reserve Board  likely would stimulate the economy with lower interest rates.  </P> <P> "What is the Federal Reserve waiting for?" said Gary Ciminero, economist at  Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., who said he has expected substantial Fed  easing for the last six months.  </P> <P> The central bank, fearful of triggering a fresh round of inflation, has nudged  down rates only half a percentage point this year in two increments.  </P> <P> Faced with a severely weakened economy-including falling employment, declining  consumer confidence and a sagging retail sector-the Fed's chief policy-making  committee may decide at its meeting Tuesday to allow interest rates to fall to  stimulate growth, analysts said.  </P> <P> Economists are optimistic that despite the sharp rises of the last three  months, inflation will remain under control unless war in the Middle East  destroys Saudi Arabia's oil production facilities. The economy is simply too  weak for most goods producers to pass on higher energy costs, they say.  </P> <P> "This is a significant change from September's 0.6% rise and may mean that when  energy prices abate, inflation could settle down to a much lower rate," said  William McReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> The latest edition of a prominent survey of private economists said the nation  likely will topple into a recession before the end of the year.  </P> <P> Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., reported Friday that 44 of the  55 economists in its survey believe a downturn will start before the end of  this year. Another three said the slump would start in 1991.  </P> <P> To symbolize the shift, the survey newsletter changed its nameplate from yellow  to red for the first time since the 1981-82 recession.  </P> <P> "The climate is not going to be favorable for an increase in inflation," said  economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "We're in a bad  inflation patch now, but we'll get through it."  </P> <P> In October, energy costs led prices higher, rising 8% compared to 13.8% in  September and 9.5% the month before that.  </P> <P> Fuel oil prices rose 15% and were 67.5% higher than a year earlier. Natural gas  costs, however, edged down 0.3%.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices increased 8% and were 50.2% higher than a year earlier.  </P> <P> Food prices rose 0.9%, the biggest increase since unseasonably cold weather  froze southern fruit and vegetable crops in January.  </P> <P> Egg costs were up 9.5%; pork, 8.2%, and beef and turkeys, 5.1%. Prices also  rose for vegetables and pasta.  </P> <P> Economist Donald Ratajczak said consumer' demand for red meat has fallen about  as much as is likely and farmers are building their herds in anticipation of  growing demand. That means that they are sending fewer animals to slaughter,  pushing prices higher.  </P> <P> The increases were partly offset by declines in the prices of fresh fruit,  rice, chickens, fish, dairy products, coffee and cooking oils.  </P> <P> In other categories, the price of passenger cars fell 2.7% after jumping 3.4% a  month earlier. Economists attributed the fluctuations to the fact that price  increases and discounts this year have been out of sync with auto dealers'  usual seasonal pattern.  </P> <P> Other declines were recorded for men's and boys' clothing, floor coverings and  household flatware. Prices rose 3.4% for newspapers and were also up for books,  women's clothing, cosmetics, tobacco and jewelry.  </P> <P> The various changes left the producer price index for all finished goods at  122.3 in October. That means a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in  1982 would have cost $122.30 last month, up from $114.70 a year earlier.  </P> <P> Prices at earlier stages of the production process were also up sharply, driven  by energy. Prices rose 1.5% for intermediate-level goods and 8.7% for  crude-level goods. Excluding energy and food, however, prices rose only 0.4% at  the intermediate level and fell 1.7% at the crude level.  </P> <P> Crude petroleum prices jumped 29.2% in October.  </P></p>

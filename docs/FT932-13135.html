			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Britain oversaw EBRD's spending on HQ THE UK was the only government represented on the building committee which oversaw the spending of Pounds 55.5m on fitting the new headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. However, Mr Nicholas Bailey, the official at the Overseas Development Administration on the committee, was powerless to prevent spending on new marble, wood panelling and other 'luxuries' because the government had provided a Pounds 40m building grant to the EBRD with no conditions attached, according to a UK official. It also emerged yesterday that officials from the EBRD's shareholder governments, led by the Germans, are exploring the possibility of creating a new post of chief executive at the bank to back up Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president. The idea of appointing an EBRD chief executive has not yet been put forward by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. The suggestion would be designed to improve the organisational structure of the bank following criticisms of insufficient budgetary control. None of the other countries which own the bank were represented on the building committee, chaired by the bank's budget director, Mr Pierre Pissaloux. The UK was on the committee because of the Pounds 40m grant, which was given to the bank as an incentive to locate in London. 'After the EBRD's director approved the budget (at the end of 1991), there was nothing we could do (about how the money was spent)', said the official. 'It was a nightmare.' The UK's role in the building project would probably be examined by the auditor general, Sir John Bourn, an official said. It also emerged yesterday that the architects working on the project, Berthet &amp; Pochy of France, were appointed on the insistence of the bank and without following the public tendering procedures which usually apply to public sector projects, according to a UK government official. Mrs Marion Pochy, the wife of one of Berthet &amp; Pochy's founders, painted a mural at the bank's headquarters in collaboration with two east European artists. They are understood to have been paid less than Pounds 30,000. Meanwhile, the bank's directors, which represent the countries which own the bank, have asked for details of a spacious EBRD office in Paris, which is used principally by Mr Attali. Many directors did not know of the existence of the office, which is in a renovated 19th century palace in the Boulevard Madeleine, until last week. The EBRD said yesterday that the rent on the Paris office was paid by the French government and referred calls to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the director of the French Treasury. However, his office said the finance ministry had paid the rent up to May last year and had no idea who had been paying the rent since then. Bank sources said late last night that the bill was now being paid by the French foreign ministry. Civil servant powerless, Page 3 Jumping flash Jacques, Page 6</p>

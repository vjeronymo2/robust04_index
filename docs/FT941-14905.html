			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Blockbuster buys stake in Virgin games subsidiary Blockbuster Entertainment, the world's largest video rental company, has bought 19.9 per cent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The Virgin subsidiary develops games software for the Nintendo and Sega systems, as well as for other manufacturers. The company's recent products include games based on the films of Aladdin and the Jungle Book. Blockbuster will pay for the VIE stake with shares of an approximate market value of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m). It has also received options to buy additional shares. VIE, which has sold more than 13m copies of its products since mid-1990, last year sold a 16.2 per cent stake to Hasbro, the US toy company. It is thought that the Virgin subsidiary, which has been selling interactive software since 1983, will eventually be floated as a separate company in the US. Virgin, which refused to comment on the eventual flotation, said the Blockbuster deal would ensure its presence in the field of multimedia entertainment. Blockbuster earlier this month announced a Dollars 8.4bn merger with Viacom, the US cable television company which is bidding for Paramount Communications. Virgin said the link with Blockbuster and Viacom would mean that it could deliver games and music videos directly to people's homes. 'This is a building block in the multimedia world of the future. With Blockbuster and Viacom merging to create a cable company, we could squirt videos or Phil Collins' greatest hits down the line.' Virgin already has a joint venture with Blockbuster, announced in 1992, to build music megastores, which also sell games, in Europe, the US and Australia. Blockbuster has 3,593 video stores in nine countries and 511 music outlets, including 20 megastores in the joint venture with Virgin. Virgin said it had followed different strategies with various companies to widen the scope of its games business. Apart from offering Blockbuster and Hasbro equity stakes in VIE, the company had concluded licensing agreements with the Walt Disney Corporation to turn its films into games.</p>

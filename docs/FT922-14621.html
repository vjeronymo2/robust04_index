			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Voters get to grips with ballot reform: President Cossiga leads the way to the polls as Italians put ruling coalition to the test PRESIDENT Francesco Cossiga hauled the press out of their beds early yesterday for a photo-call of him casting his vote only half an hour after Italy's polling stations opened at 7am. 'Do you always get up so early, president?' he was asked by a resentful journalist. 'Yes,' he replied mischievously. Mr Cossiga was one of the first to experience the new voting procedures introduced last year by referendum, intended to lessen the abuses surrounding the system of preferential votes. In addition to casting a vote for a party, voters have throughout the post-war period been entitled to select up to four preferred candidates on the electoral list, and it was sufficient either to make a cross or write a number. In Rome and southern Italy this was widely exploited by the Christian Democrats and Socialists to ensure the candidates selected by the party apparatus were voted for. In the north, the preference system was little used. Yesterday, under the revised rules only one preference vote was permitted and this was only valid if the candidate's name was spelled out. Several commentators argued yesterday that the single preference system could still benefit the well organised Christian Democrats in the south to the detriment of other parties. Christian Democrat politicians have been found distributing stencils with candidates' names, in theory justified by the need to help illiterates required to write their preference. However, seven candidates in the south are said each to have ordered 140,000 such stencils. The change in preference voting was recognised by the promoters of the June 1991 referendum as only a partial reform of the electoral system and the next parliament will be under pressure to make further changes. Yesterday's vote was on the basis of a complex procedure of proportional representation. Italy is divided on a geographical basis into 32 electoral colleges, which provide the 630 deputies and 315 senators. The largest of these is that of Rome, with 54 seats for the lower chamber, and the smallest Val d'Aosta, with one. When the total valid votes in each college are counted after the booths close, this will be divided by the number of seats plus two - an equation which produces the electoral 'quotient'. This quotient represents the number of votes each party needs to obtain a seat. Usually it is impossible to allocate all seats in this way: in 1987, 16 of the seats were left spare. To fill these, the remaining votes in excess of each party's quotient, or the entire vote if a party has failed to reach the requisite quotient, are transfered to a national electoral college, where a new quotient is worked out. The system encourages small parties to enter the ring. Yesterday there were 50 groupings, with voters in Rome obliged to chose among 27 different parties. Small parties may gain no seat in a local electoral college but with their votes carried forward into the national college, they stand a good chance of picking up a residual seat because the number of their votes at this stage is often greater than the larger parties'. This, however, means smaller parties need ultimately more votes to obtain a seat than the big parties. Similar considerations apply to the senate.</p>

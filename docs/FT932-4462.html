			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Lamont embodied lack of government policy Sir, The article on the departure of Norman Lamont as chancellor ('Hounded out by fiction and foes', 6 June) did not address the reason why the approach of the tabloids found an echo throughout the country. In essence, he was the embodiment of the lack of a clear government policy. The government has claimed credit for a recovery which has been won through the hard work of the electorate and at the cost of high unemployment. The recovery is not due to any fundamental government policy which has been aimed at reducing inflation through economic restriction. The lack of clarity of government policy is exemplified by, on the one hand, Mr Heseltine's interventionist stance and, on the other, by the promotion of privatisation to reduce government intervention. The former approach has not been much in evidence - witness British Coal and Swan Hunter - and the latter policy does not inspire confidence that the government is operating anything other than a policy of 'sell and forget'. Whitehall and the electorate must recognise the necessary but limited role the government can play in the economy. Discredited policies on both sides of the former Iron Curtain have shown that no government has the secret formula for sustaining growth. Control in an economy is widely dispersed, making economic movements impossible to forecast. Government can only assist the wealth creators, the electorate, be they entrepreneurs or the workforce building quality product. Government should aim to take the long-term view, to manage the infrastructure of the country and nurture the business environment. Business will develop of its own accord but cannot be expected to be responsible for the country's infrastructure while pursuing, generally, short-term profit motives. For these reasons, members of the electorate may finally realise that the success of the economy resides with them. Whitehall is but a sideshow.

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Expedient exit from an awkward situation - Plans to allow Italian banks to take stakes in industrial concerns THE BANK of Italy's proposal to let banks take stakes in industry looks ominously like a case of expediency over invention. The growing crisis at Ferruzzi and other heavily indebted companies suggests the authorities may have no choice but to amend strict rules banning stakes in industrial concerns. With many big companies in difficulties in the recession, the banks are facing a collective debt crisis. The borrowings of the 10 biggest companies either in voluntary liquidation or in talks with their bankers total more than L50,000bn (Dollars 32.5bn). 'Italy's banks have painted themselves into a corner and they need to find a way out,' says one analyst. The exit was proposed last month by none other than the Bank of Italy. It has suggested letting banks take up to 15 per cent of industrial companies. The proposal, marking one of the biggest changes to the landmark 1936 banking law, has won cabinet approval and looks set to become law. 'Allowing Italian banks take stakes in industry is like letting the pyromaniacs into the match factory. Their track record on lending is so appalling that I dread the consequences,' says one observer. Mr Antonio Fazio, the new central bank governor, sees things differently. The change has been presented as a step towards new European Community banking rules and the German universal banking model. Supporters say the German system has stimulated growth by giving companies access to long-term capital. It has helped to isolate the corporate sector from economic instability by giving companies well-informed core investors more interested in long-term development than short-term profits. They hope the reform will transfer the German experience to Italy. Many banking analysts are more cynical about the reasons for the reform. Italian banks are facing a unprecedented crisis as soaring credit growth in the 1980s has left many companies in difficulty servicing their debts today. Lending accelerated even faster after 1990, when the Bank of Italy removed its credits ceilings. The increase was boosted by competition in the fragmented banking sector. In the booming 1980s, industrialists could easily play off one bank against another to obtain bigger loans or tighter spreads. Ferruzzi, which borrowed more than L30,000bn, is the largest of a string of big companies in crisis as a result. Others include the Aga Khan's Ciga hotels chain, which has stopped paying interest on borrowings of more than L1,000bn, Arvedi (steel) and Cameli (shipping and industry). The usual remedy would be a rescheduling, with repayments pushed back to give borrowers more time. But in many present cases, the ratio of companies' debts to earnings is so high that even medium-term recovery prospects look slim. With little hope of quick repayment, changing the rules to allow the banks to swap some of their debts for equity is the obvious expedient. Borrowers pay less interest, while lenders can offset the loss of income against hopes of a potential windfall when they sell their shares once the companies return to health. Some of the biggest industrial stakes held by German banks stem from rescue packages. Easing Italy's troubled privatisation programme is the other reason for the reform. Recession has hampered disposals by cutting profits at many of the companies for sale, making them less attractive. And potential purchasers, suffering lower earnings themselves, have become more wary of big acquisitions. Flotations, the alternative to takeovers, are restricted by the limited liquidity of the Milan bourse. The government's room for manoeuvre is further restricted by the dangers of giving private investors too big an incentive to buy privatisation shares. The risk is that savings may be diverted away from short-term government bonds, bought mainly by private investors, which are the main instrument to fund the huge budget deficit. Allowing big banks to take stakes in newly-privatised companies promises to ease disposals and avoid embarrassing flops. Banks could be temporary shareholders pending an economic upturn, when investor demand and rising stock prices would allow them to sell the shares to longer-term investors. But the Bank of Italy's plan has already led to a chorus of criticism. The main objection has been the role of the banks, dominated by the public sector, in privatisation. 'Rather than privatising, Italy will just be re-nationalising its public-sector companies by selling stakes to state-owned banks,' says one critic. Allowing state-controlled banks to take stakes in privatised companies could also be counter-productive. A number of big banks are also on the privatisation list. Lumbering them with unattractive holdings in newly-privatised industrial companies would compromise their own sale prospects. Opponents also point to the banks' poor record on lending, which hardly recommends them as future investors in industry. Significantly, bank shares fell after the reform was announced. However, looming problems with bad debts to industry and the banks' need to improve their capital ratios suggests they may not be in a position to take up the new opportunities, even when offered. Although debt-for-equity deals look increasingly likely for severe cases, such as Ferruzzi, the number of banks volunteering to buy industrial holdings looks slim. Many are chasing new capital to lift their ratios after the lending boom and are unwilling to plough money into equity stakes. Banks could finance new positions by selling some of their bond portfolios. But that, too, is unlikely as bond yields are much higher than those on share dividends, meaning that banks' profits would be reduced.  --------------------------------------------------- ITALY'S TROUBLED CORPORATE DEBTORS  --------------------------------------------------- Company                      Size of net                               borrowings                               (Lira bn)*  --------------------------------------------------- Ferruzzi Finanziaria            15,129 Cameli group                     1,900 Uno Holding                      1,400 Ciga                             1,200 Sottrici Binda                   1,130 Dalle Carbonare                    800 Polli                              700 Mandelli                           540  --------------------------------------------------- *Company estimates  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

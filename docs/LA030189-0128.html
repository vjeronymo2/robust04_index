The  existing Huntington Beach hospital will be remodeled, joined to the new  building and used to house women's health services, including delivery rooms, a  nursery for newborns and a geriatric care area.  </P> <P> The Pacifica project will increase the hospital's capacity to 161 beds from  109. Construction should be completed in 1992. The new Palmdale building, which  will increase capacity to 180 beds from 123, is scheduled to open in 1993.  </P> <P> When Affiliated was founded in 1986, it operated one hospital, the 116-bed Ojai  Valley Community Hospital in Ojai. In 1988, it bought American Health Group  International Inc. of Kirkland, Wash.  </P> <P> The $100-million acquisition brought the company up to five hospitals and one  home health-care company. The facilities purchased in 1988 were Pacifica  Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, Palmdale Hospital Medical Center,  Pacifica Community Hospital, Roosevelt Hospital in Portales, N.M., and  Evergreen Home Health Care Inc. in Burbank.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: London While the minutes of tomorrow's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will not be known for six weeks, analysts do not think the two men will agree to a base rate reduction. 'It is apparent from official comments that rate cuts have to be clearly justified on economic grounds and recent data have shown that the economy is growing at a steady pace, so no cut is needed,' says Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International. He adds that 'if they cut rates ahead of the local and European elections, it will be viewed as political. Sterling will suffer and gilt yields will rise'. M0 statistics, published today, are expected to show that the narrowest measure of the money supply grew strongly in April, which may be a guide to the strength of retail sales. However, Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets, points out that M0 growth was also buoyant in April 1993, so there may be a problem with the seasonal adjustment. With little else in the way of economic data to the published this week, gilts may be affected by political nervousness following Thursday's local council elections. International investors might take fright at bad results for the government.</p>

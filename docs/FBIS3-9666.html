Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    It has been announced that the cordial and friendly talks  confirmed the hitherto good bilateral relations between the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Libya. Minister Unkovic  stressed his satisfaction at the fact that, even in the  conditions of sanctions under which the two countries are  living, there is an interest and desire for the best possible  level of cooperation.    Trade between the two countries prior to the introduction of  sanctions by the international community was exceptionally  important to Yugoslavia so that efforts to revitalize  cooperation in future are an exceptional pleasure.    Envoy al-Turyaki expressed Libya's readiness to send  humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia via the Red Cross. According to  him, this is only a small symbol by which Libya wishes to show  its goodwill and understanding for its old Yugoslav friends.</p>

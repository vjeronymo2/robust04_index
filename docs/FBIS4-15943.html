			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "Budget </F> Federalism or Russia's Collapse?"]    [Text] During the recent presentation of the budget,  representatives of the government complained of the behavior of  individual republics inside Russia which have failed to pay  enormous sums into the federal budget. They complained and, to  judge by press reports, went to create one more economic  security service or to repeal the latest unconsidered decision  such as increasing import tariffs.    Can you imagine a situation in which some state, prefecture,  province, or even canton in another state ventured to withhold  state taxes? Only in a nightmare. It simply does not happen,  since it means the collapse of the state.    But in our country right now a single-channel system has in  fact been introduced for the collection and transfer of taxes by  Russian Federation republics like Bashkiria, Tataria, and  Chechnya. Yakutia, Karelia, and other components of our  Federation are making claims on the revenue earmarked for the  federal budget.    The authorities' reaction? In the majority of cases it is a  strikingly passive indifference. Last year attention was  successfully drawn to this issue and the president's edict on  sanctions for nonpayers was published. Separatist agreements  between the center and the components of the Federation were not  undertaken.    You form the impression that many of our eminent politicians  have confused federation and confederation.    What separate agreements can there be, what ownership of  land, the subterranean depths, resources, and property by  components of the federation, and what single-channel budget can  there be? All this is a direct path to Russia's collapse. The  people will hardly agree to that without objecting.    The legal assignment to components of such rights for  components within the framework of some agreements or additions  to the Federation Treaty is intolerable. It is already clear  that it was the center's weakness which led to the adoption of  an incomplete Federation Treaty, to the issue of countless  benefits and privileges on a purely political basis in exchange  for alleged support. It is characteristic that the more  unjustified the concessions, the less respect for the center.  Everything has been turned upside down.    Any recognition of the legitimacy of the single-channel  system for collecting taxes and of the special rights of  republics inside Russia leads to similar demands from the  oblasts. A number of them are already raising these questions  officially. Ideologists of the Ural Republic and other similar  plans are well represented in the Federation Council.    The principle of budget federalism -- the separation of the  budget and taxes and a precise revenue base for the center and  the components of the Federation -- has successfully been  included in the new budget system elaborated by the Ministry of  Finances last year. If this system is adopted by the Federal  Assembly we have a chance of resolving the problem peacefully.    We desperately need a tough political solution which would  ideally contain the following points:    -- unity of status and equal rights and powers for all  components of the Federation;    -- the categorical rejection of any forms of a  single-channel budget system and of the adoption of the  principle of the property of components of the Federation;    -- the rejection of the Center's separatist agreements  with individual components of the Federation which infringe on  Russia's interests as a unified state, of endless subisidies to  the regions for political reasons, and of attempts to isolate  "national" banks in the republics;    -- the banning of any attempts to discriminate against the  republics' nonindigenous population;    -- the toughest sanctions against those who have violated  the principles of the federation.    What has been said does not mean that it is necessary to  continue the separation of the powers of the levels of power, to  decentralize the budget system, develop a two-channel taxation,  or expand the rights of the components of the Federation in the  economic field.    But delay in this field is like death. The state's  strikingly unprofessional and impotent policy in this field is  surprising. History will not forgive us the collapse of Russia,  it must be halted.</p>

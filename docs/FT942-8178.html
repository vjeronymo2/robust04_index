			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Role of investor watchdog splits Commons committee The cross-party Commons Treasury committee is so split over the role of the planned watchdog to protect private investors in the UK that it may miss the opportunity to influence its setting-up. The MPs had hoped to agree, in the next few weeks, an interim report on the Personal Investment Authority, which is due to become operational in mid-July. They have been taking evidence about the new watchdog as part of a longer term inquiry into financial regulation. But divisions between committee members seem so deep that a unanimous report looks unlikely, and MPs doubt the value of publishing recommendations which do not have full support. Labour MPs believe the arrangements for the PIA have caused the watchdog to lose credibility in the City and want to recommend a fresh regulatory structure along the lines of the US Securities Exchange Commission. The committee's Tory majority, however, supports the Treasury view that the regulator must be given time to work, irrespective of the 'battering' it has received from companies which are due to come under its wing. The PIA is intended to be the single watchdog for private investors, replacing the existing, more complex regulatory structure. It has been criticised by many in the financial services industry but there is no consensus about whether there should be full-blown statutory regulation or whether the industry should regulate itself. Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has said it will not join the organisation and other large institutions have expressed serious doubts about joining. Mr John Watts, the committee's Conservative chairman, has called its members to a final session on Monday to try to resolve the differences. This follows a private meeting on Wednesday which broke up in disagreement. Tory members are willing to consider some changes to the PIA if the report gives it conditional support. The changes might include more independence in the system for appointing public interest directors to the regulator's board, and closer scrutiny of the watchdog's work. This could involve the PIA reporting to the cross-party committee. However, one of the Labour MPs said: 'It has become clear to us over the last few months that the PIA is dead on arrival. If the Tories cannot accept that then there will be no report.' The government is determined not to introduce fresh regulatory legislation, so ministers would be embarrassed by a critical report which they believe could damage investor protection by undermining the new regulator. Divisions have been apparent during some sessions, with a number of Tory MPs distancing themselves from attacks on Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, by Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, about regulatory failings at Legal &amp; General where Mr Palmer was formerly chief executive.</p>

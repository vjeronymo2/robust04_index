			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg retreats The sudden collapse of stock and bond markets around the world wiped out an early big gain in SG Warburg shares, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100 list and, ironically, one of the most important bond and equity trading houses in London. Early in the session Warburg had rocketed to 740p in the wake of doubled preliminary profits, which was towards the top end of the range of market estimates. The near 16 per cent dividend increase was in line with market forecasts. But by the end of a turbulent session Warburg shares had retreated to 694p before closing 4 down on balance at 699p as dealers became increasingly worried by the slide in international markets. The early surge in the shares came amid relief that Warburg had managed to avoid any big losses resulting from the volatility and overall weakness in world markets following the decision by the US Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy early in February. One merchant banking specialist said there was a big question mark over the sustainability of earnings at SG Warburg. 'Warburg relies very much on earnings from flotations and rights issues which are very much reliant on a strong equity market. If the market collapses so does the earnings stream at Warburg and the other merchant banks.' The candidates involved in the bid for the National Lottery suffered a mixed reaction to the mid-morning news that the Camelot consortium - which includes De La Rue, Cadbury Schweppes and Racal - had won the franchise. Racal shares bounded away on the news, ending the day 13 ahead at 238p. Smith New Court estimates that Racal will be the biggest winner from the contest, its earnings potential boosted by 22 per cent. De La Rue shares closed 3 up at 830p, although dealers said this was as much in reaction to several weeks of weakness - the stock stood at 1021p two months ago - as to the lottery result. Smith has pencilled in a potential 9 per cent earnings boost for the printing group and 3 per cent for Cadbury. Its shares retreated 13 to 479p. Among the losing candidates, Carlton Communications slid 22 to 901p, a solid set of results notwithstanding. BZW inched up its 1995 forecast to Pounds 179m and reiterated its positive stance. Ladbroke ended three days of weakness following Monday's veiled profits warning more steadily, the shares off 3 at 172 1/2 p. MAI lost 13 to 249p, Granada remained friendless, finishing 18 off at 490p, while Rank Organisation tumbled 25 to 380p. A hefty jump in the net asset value of Land Securities helped the shares remain one of the few shades of blue among the FTSE 100 stocks. The market had been predicting an NAV range of 630p-660p, so Land's 677p saw the shares leap to an immediate 20p premium. They later came back with the market to close 2 1/2 up at 663p on turnover of 3.4m. James Capel, long-term bulls of the property sector, are forecasting an NAV for next year of 790p. Widespread talk around the market that the sudden collapse in world markets had caught some of the big market operators on the wrong foot, triggering potentially huge trading losses, unsettled all the big clearing banks and the merchant banks. Among the clearers Barclays, 527p, and NatWest, 439p, which control two of the UK's biggest institutional broking firms, BZW and NatWest Securities, dipped 14 and 12 1/2 respectively, while HSBC, which only on Tuesday said reports it had made big losses in bond trading were inaccurate, fell 24 to 725p. The insurance broking sector endured more pain after the recent dismal profits performances with US investors said to have been steady sellers of Willis Corroon and responsible for driving the shares down 12 more to 169p, their lowest level since September 1992. Chemicals group Courtaulds was among a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to remain in positive territory during an difficult trading session, with the company's shares bolstered by a 6 per cent increase in the dividend total. At the close Courtaulds shares were unchanged at 527p. A fall in profits at Argyll Group added to the pressure on the shares in a weak food retail sector. The company said a disappointing performance from its Lo-Cost chain was partly to blame and remained cautious over the trading outlook. Argyll shares fell 9 to 239p. Good results from Morland helped the regional brewer forward 10 to 518p. A shift of stance from BZW, the investment bank, was an additional burden on the building materials sector. BZW shifted from overweight to neutral in the sector, highlighting Blue Circle as 'fully valued' and therefore a 'sell'. BCI lost 5 to 302p. BOC was one of the five FT-SE 100 constituents to resist the market's sudden decline, the shares closing 2 harder at 730p following the recent excellent results and subsequent broker recommendations. Shares in engineering group Glynwed International held up well, closing a penny lower at 358p after a two-day visit to the company by institutions and analysts. Smith New Court and Panmure Gordon were reported positive on the stock. MARKET REPORTERS: Steve Thompson, Christopher Price, Joel Kibazo. Other statistics, Page 37</p>

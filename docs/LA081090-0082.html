			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL MARINES COULD HEAD OUT FOR MIDEAST;  </P> <P> MILITARY: WHILE OFFICIALS REFUSED TO CONFIRM ANY MOVEMENT, MARINES AND THEIR  DEPENDENTS AT EL TORO AND TUSTIN REPORTED GREATER ACTIVITY AT BASES.  </P> <P> With tensions rapidly escalating in the Middle East, Marine Corps troops from  El Toro and Tustin could soon be called into action to provide air support for  American forces being dispatched to Saudi Arabia, Pentagon sources and the  local military said Thursday.  </P> <P> Military officials would not confirm reports of troop movements, but enlisted  men and their families at the El Toro and Tustin Marine Corps air stations said  both bases were buzzing with heightened activity.  </P> <P> Also, some sources indicated that plans were being made to move troops and  equipment to the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, a  932-square-mile desert base in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Twentynine Palms is headquarters for the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, a  specially trained group designed to "deploy in response to contingencies  threatening U.S. vital interests," according to the base's public affairs  office.  </P> <P> If that brigade is activated to respond to the crisis in the Persian Gulf,  troops from El Toro and Tustin would join thousands of others from Southern  California, Arizona and Hawaii as part of a 17,000-man rapid-deployment unit  that combines air, land, naval and amphibious forces.  </P> <P> That brigade is one of three that could be sent to Saudi Arabia in coming days,  Pentagon sources said, the others being based in Hawaii and at Camp Lejeune,  N.C. The chosen brigade could be flown to the Persian Gulf as early as  Saturday, when ships loaded with equipment will begin to arrive there, the  sources added.  </P> <P> On Thursday, several of the bases that provide troops to the 7th Brigade were  bustling with activity, leading soldiers and family members to speculate that  deployment was not far off. A helicopter mechanic at the Tustin base would not  comment on whether troops are already being dispatched from the base but said  it was probable that they would be.  </P> <P> At El Toro, a woman whose husband is a radar technician said that Marines there  are working extra-long shifts and have been ordered to pack their bags.  </P> <P> "He thinks they're going, but I don't want (him) to go," the woman said. "I'm  too scared. This is the second time we've been scared. Before, with Panama, we  were scared, but they didn't choose his squadron."  </P> <P> If a Marine expeditionary brigade is dispatched to the Middle East, forces from  throughout the region would likely participate, military literature indicates.  </P> <P> The 7th Brigade, whose motto is "One call gets its all," includes combat ground  units from Camp Pendleton and air combat forces from El Toro, Tustin, Pendleton  and Yuma, Ariz.  </P> <P> A service-support group, known in military circles as "beans, Band-Aids and  bullets," would accompany the troops. It would be drawn from Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> Relatives of soldiers at Pendleton said they too had heard that units were  heading for Twentynine Palms. According to the wife of one Marine lieutenant,  her husband told her that his 900-man battalion was heading to the San  Bernardino base on Tuesday and Wednesday. He did not say where they were going  after that, the woman added, "but by how he acted -- and I know him -- I got  the impression he was going to the Mideast."  </P> <P> A Marine Corps major based at Camp Pendleton, who requested anonymity, warned  that military families may be overreacting to troop movements, which might be  little more than routine training exercises.  </P> <P> "We're not officially on alert," he said. "But various units have been told to  do the things their units would normally do to bring themselves up to readiness  and to be ready to move out. . . . We're at an administrative be-prepared  status. People are drawing in to their units, getting records in line and  packing up."  </P> <P> If the 7th Brigade is called into action, forces would likely be dispatched  from Twentynine Palms and would link up with the group's five supply ships,  which are normally based on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Ships from  there have already been sent to the Persian Gulf, and they contain enough  weapons, vehicles, parts, fuel and rations to support the brigade for 30 days  of combat.  </P> <P> El Toro and Tustin would supply that force with its military aircraft, and as  such would be responsible for providing air cover to the thousands of troops on  the ground, using a combination of helicopters and warplanes.  </P> <P> El Toro is home to the F/A-18 fighter jet, RF-4 Phantom jet, A-6E  fighter-bomber, A-4 Skyhawk jet and KC-130 tanker. The air station at Tustin, a  helicopter base, houses the CH-53E Super Stallion, the CH-53 Sea Stallion and  CH-46 Sea Knight.  </P> <P> Some 7,700 Marines are stationed at El Toro, 4,300 at Tustin and more than  40,000 at Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> The El Toro base is the command center of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, the  Marine Corps' largest such group, encompassing four western U.S. bases and more  than 500 aircraft. The aircraft range from the small but deadly Cobra  helicopter based at Camp Pendleton to the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet at El  Toro.  </P> <P> The wing has 16,200 Marines based at El Toro, Tustin, Camp Pendleton and Yuma,  Ariz. The fighters and the helicopters, including giant Ch-53E Super Stallions  based at Tustin, are worth more than $50 billion, and some of the helicopters  and fighter planes are valued at more than $20 million each.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Melissa Healy in Washington, Nancy Wride in Orange County  and Tom Gorman in San Diego contributed to this article.  </P></p>

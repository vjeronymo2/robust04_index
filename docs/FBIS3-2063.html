A regulation that went into effect on Wednesday tightened  the  regulation of computer systems.    It was the country's first regulation pertaining to computer  security.    Incomplete statistics show that over 500,000 computer  information networkers have been installed nationwide in  businesses, schools and research institutions. And the number  is growing rapidly.    But network security is lax and problems abound.    Computer crimes have been reported and such cases are  increasing, said Lu Xiaobin, an official with the Computer  Management and Supervision Department.    He refused to give details, but said one case involved 14  million yuan ($1.6 million).    Computer viruses are also a serious problem. It was reported  that 70 to 80 percent of computers in 30 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions have been hit by  infections.    According to the regulation, anyone found putting viruses  into a network can face fines up to 5,000 yuan ($575).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ai Zhisheng (5337 4249 3932), minister of radio, film, </F> and television: "Persist in the Policy of Doing Two Types of  Work Simultaneously; Do a Better Job in Radio, Film, and  Television Propaganda Work"]    [Text] Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC  Central Committee, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core has introduced a series of measures in  resolutely implementing the policy of "doing two types of work  simultaneously and laying equal stress on both." The CPC  Central Committee has incessantly strengthened its leadership  over propaganda and ideological work and made tremendous  achievements and progress in overcoming the practice of  "stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." On guidance  for the media, the policy of unity, stability, and boosting  morale has been implemented in the last few years. Under the  care and direct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its  Propaganda Department, press and publication departments have  united and coordinated with each other in forming a joint force  and have maintained a high degree of unanimity with the party  Central Committee, enabling propaganda and ideological work to  create a comparatively good environment of public opinion for  reform, opening up, and modernization. All major press units  are devoting their efforts to deepen press reform. Radio and  television stations have practiced a rolling, 24-hour broadcast  system, during which the number of news broadcasts has been  increased, the volume of information has been expanded, and the  efficiency has been improved. They have provided some new  columns including the "oriental era," and have also broadcast  some good special reports and news commentaries.    Some good creations have also emerged in the fields of  literature and art. Take television series as an example.  Their quantity and quality are steadily improving. Now there  about 5,000 television series each year. The Central Television  Studio alone broadcasts 1,800 television series each year and  some are fine television series, such as "Tangming Huang," "A  Native of Beijing in New York," "Big Tide," and "Zhu Jiang  Filled With Sentiments."    Despite big economic difficulties, the film business  produced  a number of fine movies with historical subjects on the  occasions of the 40th founding anniversary of the PRC, the 70th  founding anniversary of the CPC, and Chairman Mao's centennial.  For example, the movie "Chongqing Negotiations" has produced  good social effects and economic results. There are also good  movies depicting real life. Some days ago, Comrade Li Lanqing  spoke highly of the movie "Fenghuang Qin" over the telephone.  Several central leaders also said the movie had practical  significance.    Facts have fully proved that the CPC Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is firm and forceful in  implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's policy of "doing two types  of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both."  Recently, we have received many letters from watchers,  including workers, peasants, teachers, intellectuals, and  leading cadres. Some of them are still working and others have  retired. Judging from these letters, the people welcome and are  happy about the practice of doing two types of work  simultaneously and giving correct guidance to the media. A  grass-roots-level cadre in Yingkou City, Liaoning Province,  wrote us a letter saying: "The Central Television Studio has  recently broadcast rich and exciting programs on evening  parties, documentary films, and feature films. This is very  good. I hope your ministry (including provincial and city  television studios) will frequently make and broadcast exciting,  interesting, and varied entertainment programs the people like  to see." "I also ask Minister Ai to inform other central-level  leaders that China's press publicity and television guidance are  correct, good, and well-received at present. Only by carrying  out publicity in this way will a coherent and centripetal force  be formed, will the entire party, the entire armed forces, and  the entire people unite around the CPC Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and will they work in unity and  advance bravely according to the grand blueprint on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics designed by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping."    After the Central Television Studio broadcast 100 television  series on patriotism, primary school teachers in Beijing and  some retired cadres wrote enthusiastic letters to us saying:  "We are gratified to see recent changes in propaganda work."  "Broadcasting 100 television series on patriotism is a wise  move. Many of us warmly support this, both parents and students  are happy about it."    Recently, the Central Radio Station and Television Studio  increased fine ethnic songs and dances in their broadcasts, as  well as world famous, high-style entertainment programs. This  immediately won the masses' approval. A member of the Shanxi  Provincial Party Committee's Standing Committee wrote a letter  saying: "Tonight I watched the Central Television Studio's live  coverage of a `New Year's Concert.' Evidently, the mood in  literature and art circles is changing for the better and solemn  music is beginning to appear again. Hopefully, more  entertainment programs like this will be broadcast. In this  way, the mood in the entire society will change for the better."    Although there has been some improvement in films and  television programs, there are also some aspects we must face  squarely. The ideological and artistic quality of films and  television programs is far from meeting the expectations of the  party and the people. In pursuit of economic interests, many  television studios and radio stations have complied with some  watchers' vulgarity and their programs are full of sex,  violence, and sordidness. And there have been too many imported  television programs. Some Chinese-made movies and television  programs have also adopted a vulgar style imported from abroad  and some have even distorted history, disseminated wrong ideas,  and are full of fabrications. These facts have proved that in  our actual work there is still a need to overcome the habit of  "stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." In the field  of radio and television, material development is fast, but the  quality of movies and television programs cannot meet the  masses' demand or the need of socialist spiritual civilization.    To further implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech  and the instructions of the national meeting on propaganda and  ideological work, consolidate our achievements, resolve the  existing problems, and further carry out the policy of "doing  two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on  both," we must strengthen our leadership and the entire party  must take action. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "There is a need  to strengthen party leadership over the ideological front.  Principal leaders of party committees from central to local  levels must take into account the situation, problems, and work  in theoretical circles, literature and art circles, as well as  the entire ideological front." Radio broadcasts, films, and  television programs are a component of the party's ideological  front, are the mouthpieces of the party and the government, and  are the bridges between the party and the government on the one  hand and the people on the other. Radio, film, and television  departments are exercising dual leadership with equal- level  party committee and government leadership as the main component.  We hope that party committees and governments in all localities  will continue to strengthen their leadership over radio, film,  and television work and enable local radio and television  departments and film studios to take propaganda and creation  work as their central task and improve the quality of their  programs.    I have the following five ideas on how to strengthen  leadership:    1. The task must be clearly defined and our understanding  must be unified. What is the task of radio, film, and  television departments? This seems a simple question, but our  front must clearly understand it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set a  clear task and demand on the entire propaganda and ideological  front, including those engaged in radio, film, and television  undertakings: "Our publication, television, and all other  publicity workers must pay attention to this problem. There are  communist ideals and beliefs in these people's minds. Our next  generation and the subsequent generation must be educated in  such a manner that they have lofty communist ideals. Our young  people must be prevented from falling captive to the decadent  capitalist ideology. This will absolutely not do." He  explicitly pointed out that "warriors on the ideological front  should be engineers of the human soul, hold high the banner of  Marxism and socialism, educate and guide the people in correctly  treating history, understanding practice, and having firm faith  in socialism and party leadership, and encourage the people to  work harder, make progress, have ideals, morality, culture, and  discipline, and heroically strive for the materialization of our  great and magnificent cause of socialist modernization." In  press work on our front, we must uphold party spirit and  provided correct guidance for the media. We have a  comparatively unanimous understanding of this. But our  understanding of literature and art is a little confused. Some  comrades only stress that films and television plays are art and  they themselves are artists; they do not agree that films and  television programs have educational functions, still less they  agree with the concept of a "main theme." Some commentaries even  put forward specious slogans, such as "nonpoliticization,"  "nonheroization," "nontypification," and  "nonutilitarianization." Some comrades say that film and  television should mainly be for entertainment purposes. We  should comprehensively, not one-sidedly, apprehend this issue.  Films and television programs are for entertainment and  enjoyment, but are also for improving the people's understanding  and educating them. We should not stress one of their functions  to the neglect of the others. These functions are complementary  to each other and inseparable from each other. Radio, film, and  television workers are propagandists of the party. In  particular, they should not forget their heavy responsibility  for providing ideological education and should, like Premier  Zhou said, "take pleasure in educating people." They should  bring the main theme into prominence and stick to  diversification. They should sing in praise of the main theme  -- patriotism, collectivism, and socialism -- and make their  programs rich, healthy, and civilized so as to meet the  increasing and diverse cultural and entertainment needs of the  people to the maximum.    Last year four departments and commissions, including the  CPC  Central Committee's Propaganda Department, selected 100 films  and television programs on patriotism for public showing once a  week. This was warmly welcomed by the people and provided us  with much enlightenment. It completely conformed with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "Chinese history must be used to  educate young people," and "it is necessary to understand some  Chinese history, this is a spiritual impetus for China's  development." In music and songs, we will also sort out and  select fine works in different historical periods in a planned  way for reservation purposes. They will be broadcast one after  another and popularized among the people, with the aim of  combining popularization and improvement. Efforts will be made  to gradually substitute high-style, superior Chinese and foreign  music and plays for negative, decadent, and unhealthy  entertainment programs and to replace vulgar art with elegant  art.    In accordance with Central Committee and State Council  leading comrades' instructions, we recently broadcast the  advanced deeds of a number of middle-aged and young scientists,  teachers, and personnel who returned from overseas studies.  They have good morality and are highly professional and  selflessly dedicated to the motherland's four modernizations.  This has produced good results. In the future, we will conduct  more interviews so that advanced people and heroes on all fronts  will appear on television to display the heroic style and  features of our era, set a good example for others to follow,  and encourage healthy trends.    2. Corrosion by decadent ideas from abroad must be  resolutely resisted and the bourgeois life-style must not be  allowed to spread unchecked in China.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping made overall remarks on what attitude  should be taken toward Western bourgeois culture: "We should  learn from the advanced science and technology of developed  capitalist countries, their operational and managerial methods,  as well as their knowledge and culture which are beneficial to  us. Closing ourselves to foreign countries and refusing to make  progress are stupid. But regarding things in the cultural  field, Marxism must be used to analyze, appraise, and criticize  their ideological contents and ways of manifestation." These  remarks are suitable for our work concerning radio, film, and  television productions. We must make efforts to follow these.  Radio, film, and television equipment and technology are  introduced from advanced countries. We have agreements on  cooperation and exchanges with more than 100 countries and  regions in the world and many of our television programs are  introduced from outside the country. This is necessary. The  problem is that the programs introduced from outside the country  are not analyzed or appraised. Comrade Deng Xiaoping criticized  this situation by saying that even films and video and audio  tapes which are regarded as being of a low taste, vulgar, and  harmful by Western countries are imported to China. For some  time some lowly popular music, rock-and-roll music, and even  disguised beauty pageants were rampant in radio broadcasts and  television programs. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advised us time  and again: "The implementation of an open policy will  inevitably bring about some bad things affecting our people. If  there is any risk to mention, this is the biggest risk."  "Historical experience suggests that it will not do without  opening up to the world...opening up to the world will certainly  bring about some negative factors." We must maintain high  vigilance against the decadent ideology and culture from outside  the country.    In the media field, a large quantity of Western, Hong Kong,  and Taiwan films, laser discs, and audio and video products are  flooding into China through all kinds of legal and illegal  channels (most are illegal), seriously affecting Chinese-made  films and occupying most video showing centers in urban and  rural areas. Most of these films and video and audio products  are of a low style and have done much damage to young people's  minds.    What is equally noteworthy, some people outside the country  use money and prizes as bait to reduce others into making films  which denigrate Chinese history, disseminate China's dark side,  and negate socialism. Some people have even come to China to  hold all sorts of "charity performances" disguised as "beauty  pageants." They use a great deal of money and prizes to  recklessly propagate high consumption, pleasure seeking, a  corrupt life-style, and a negative and decadent ideology and  culture. These activities have produced a great deal of serious  consequences. For the sake of socialist spiritual civilization  and to provide better education for the next generation, we must  firmly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We are  firmly pursuing a policy of opening up to the outside world and  are expanding our exchanges with foreign countries on the basis  of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, we should  remain sober-minded, resolutely resist the corrosion of decadent  ideas from abroad, and absolutely not allow the bourgeois  lifestyle to spread in China."    3. The relations between economic returns and social benefit  should be correctly handled and the wrong practice of "gearing  all efforts toward money-making" must be resolutely opposed.    In an article "The Party's Urgent Task on the Organizational  and Ideological Fronts," Comrade Deng Xiaoping sharply  criticized the manifestation of "gearing all efforts toward  money-making" in the cultural field. He pointed out: "This  `gearing all efforts toward money-making' -- a tendency of  commercializing spiritual production -- has also found  expression in other aspects of spiritual production. Some  people have simply become businessmen who put profit-making  first." Through practice, we deeply feel that "gearing all  efforts toward money-making" is an important factor causing the  practice of "stressing one point to the neglect of others." For  example, what attitude should we take on satellite television  programs from outside the country? Out of consideration for the  country's fundamental interests and for the sake of  strengthening socialist spiritual civilization, we should  exercise strict management. This is very explicit, but we have  encountered many difficulties. An important reason is that some  people think that there is a large market for manufacturing and  selling ground antennas, therefore they favor "lifting control."  In the final analysis, the rampant import of films has been  caused by "gearing all efforts toward money-making." Some  Chinese-made films have also imitated imported films to meet the  vulgar taste of some people, thus causing an unhealthy cycle and  seriously damaging our spiritual civilization.    Through practice, we deeply feel that, although spiritual  products also bear a commercial nature and the law of value  should be respected, it is all the more necessary to exercise  macrocontrol and regulation over spiritual products than  material products. We should not blindly allow the market to  regulate the prices of spiritual products. The quality of some  high-budget television series in the market is not good, and  this is a clear example.    It is the same with films. Films with good box office are  not necessarily good in quality, because rich people do not  necessarily have a great ability to appreciate good films.  Those who can appraise the quality of films are not necessarily  those who have a lot of money. In the final analysis, this  boils down to what Premier Zhou has said, namely, it is the  people who are the most authoritative judges. In a word, we  must resolutely carry out Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions:  "Ideological, cultural, educational, and health departments  should take social effects as their only criterion for judging  all their activities, and enterprises affiliated with these  departments should also take social effects as their supreme  criterion."    4. We hope all localities will provide support and assurance  in terms of policy and principle so as to promote our cause.    We hope to introduce some policies to support and encourage  radio, film, and television businesses. For example, following  the increase in revenue, our investment should also be increased  to provide financial support. All local party committees and  governments are required to do a good job in relaying the  first-channel programs from central, provincial, and city radio  and television broadcasts. Many comrades said that reception of  Central Television Studio programs is hardly available from  localities outside Beijing, particularly from the grass-roots  level. The CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department and the  Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television have jointly issued a  circular asking localities to make a success of relaying central  programs. We suggest "sending charcoal in snowy weather" in  improving radio and television understanding. We should expand  our broadcast coverage and should not carry out duplicate  construction or blindly pursue many programs. It is necessary  to further resolve the difficulties of rural, mountainous, and  ethnic areas in receiving radio and television programs. All  localities should take radio, film, and television undertakings  seriously.    5. We should build our contingent with unremitting efforts  and improve its quality.    The core of strengthening our contingent is strengthening  party building. In particular, the entire party must be armed  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. In the meantime, we should also  conduct a profound struggle against corruption for a clean  administration and firmly stop the practice of "compensatory  press reports." Now initial results have been achieved in  stopping the practice of "compensatory press reports." But  there are still some prominent problems: A small number of  famous actors and program presenters like to ask for "appearance  charges," and others are in the habit of demanding pay and  commission in soliciting sponsorships to evade personal income  tax. We will continue to resolutely rectify malpractices in our  undertakings, improve professional ethics, energetically  propagate the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, hard  struggle, and selfless dedication, and strive to cultivate a  fine image and reputation in our socialist radio, film, and  television undertakings. We are engaged in the production of  spiritual products, and therefore we should remain in a lofty  ideological realm.    In short, in this new situation, our field undertakes a  heavy  task and there are also many problems and difficulties. But we  firmly believe that under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and the State  Council, with the common efforts of all localities and  departments, we will uphold the policy of doing two types of  work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both, proceed  with our work in a down-to-earth manner, do our jobs solidly,  scale new heights in radio, film, and television undertakings,  achieve new progress, and make contributions to strengthening  socialist spiritual civilization and expediting reform, opening  up, and modernization.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak warns on outlook EASTMAN KODAK, the US photographic products company which recently ousted its chairman, has warned that it would be a 'challenge' to match last year's third-quarter earnings per share, writes Martin Dickson. In the third quarter of 1992 the company reported net earnings of Dollars 330m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, before special charges. Kodak is searching for a new chairman from outside the company, following the forced resignation in August of Mr Kay Whitmore. The company, said revenues for July and August were down by 'mid-single digits' because volume gains had been offset by negative currency exchange and lower prices.</p>

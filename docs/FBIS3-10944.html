			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article for EL DIARIO ECONOMICO] </F>   [Text] The results yielded by the main variables of the  Employers Opinion Poll conducted by the Federation for Higher  Education and Development (FEDESARROLLO) show that during the  first half of 1993, industry encountered serious difficulties  that were reflected in a slump in levels of economic activity,  but that tended to turn around during the second half of the  year.    August marked the beginning of a recovery in terms of levels  of losses and reductions in inventories, and increasing numbers  of employers reported a more favorable economic situation.    They were also more optimistic about the country's economic  and sociopolitical conditions that would them to carry out  investment programs.    All of these responses were taken from the private economic  research firm's monthly poll of over 400 industrialists in the  country's main development sectors.    When one takes a closer look at the various subsectors,  however, the results are highly dissimilar.    On the one hand, some sectors were helped by the vigorous  growth in internal demand.    These sectors produce goods not easily marketed abroad, and  their activities are linked to the production of durable  consumer goods, construction in particular.    This group includes industries that produce cement and  building materials, wood and manufactured products made from  wood, equipment, and electrical items.    On the other hand, thanks to the recovery of exports,  another  group managed to reverse the levels of losses suffered during  the first half of the year.    This group includes plastics manufacturers and printing  shops  and publishing houses.    By the month of October, plastics exports had increased in  value by 68 percent, which can be explained by the vigor of  sales to the United States and the Andean Group. Sales of  publishing houses and printing shops rose 4 percent.    To a lesser extent and more as a reaction to the domestic  market, a recovery was visible among producers of processed  foods, porcelain and glass, basic metals, metal products, and  nonelectrical machinery.    This last group includes sectors greatly affected by the  economic liberalization program [apertura] and the revaluation  of the peso. Many were able to compensate--although only  partially--for their loss of domestic market shares by increased  exports to neighboring countries. They are the textile  industries, leather and manufactured leather goods, paper and  cardboard, industrial chemical substances, and rubber products.    Textiles found a better market in Venezuela with a  90-percent  increase in sales. Likewise, producers of leather goods  (excluding shoes) sold 123 percent more to that country than  during the same months of the previous year.    Paper mills sold 78 percent more products to Venezuela and  60  percent more to the rest of the Andean Group countries.    Sales to Venezuela by manufacturers of industrial chemical  substances dropped 16 percent, but rose to Peru, Ecuador (17  percent), and other South American countries (over 20 percent).    Special mention should be made of the transport equipment  and  materials sector, which joined with construction in leading the  sector throughout 1992, substantially reducing their level of  losses starting in the first quarter of 1993.    Nevertheless, levels of production and orders at the end of  the year are far higher than they were previous to 1991. This  sector benefited greatly from the liberalization of trade since  it was able to import consumable expenditures at a lower cost.  It was also aided by lower interest rates and the expansion of  credit that boosted demand.    Nevertheless, the high levels of sales of national and  imported vehicles in late 1992 and early 1993 came in response  to demand, which explains the abovementioned behavior of this  industry's main indicators.    It is one more sector that benefited from expanded access to  the Venezuelan market: During the first 10 months of 1993,  exports rose by 143 percent.    Finally, the results of the poll show that the utilization  of  the installed capacity of industry in 1993, 77.2 percent, did  not suffer major variations in terms of its behavior over the  past five months. However, that figure did increase for  beverages, ready-to-wear, leather, plastics, cement, and glass  and porcelain.</p>

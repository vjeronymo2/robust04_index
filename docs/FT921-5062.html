			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / N-plant anger grows in Philippines MR Ramon Mitra, Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives and a leading contender to succeed President Corazon Aquino in May elections, said yesterday that he was opposed to the operation of a nuclear power station which was the subject of an out of court settlement in the US on Wednesday, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Environmentalists have aggressively opposed the plant, partly because of its location near an earthquake fault line in Bataan province, 60 kilometres northwest of Manila. 'The information I have is that this plant can never be operated,' Mr Mitra said. He was speaking after the Manila government reached an out-of-court settlement with Westinghouse Electric of the US and Burns and Roe, a US consultant to Westinghouse, on a bribery lawsuit against the US firms in connection with the construction of the Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.22bn) plant. The Philippines had accused them of bribing the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos, when he was president, to win the contract in 1973. The settlement came a day before the case was due to be heard in a federal court in New Jersey. The settlement is expected to lead to suspension of the lawsuit, but Mr Rene Saguisag, a member of the Senate committee advising the government on the case, said if the agreement was not formalised in six months, or if the terms were not accepted by the Philippines congress, 'the two parties would go back to a new trial'. In Manila, the government announced that Westinghouse would 'pay the Philippines cash and cash equivalent in the amount of Dollars 100m and repair, refurbish and upgrade (the plant) to current nuclear safety standards.' The payment will comprise Dollars 10m in cash and Dollars 90m in credits and discounts. In exchange, Westinghouse will operate the plant for 30 years, selling electricity to the state-run National Power Corporation at a fixed price.</p>

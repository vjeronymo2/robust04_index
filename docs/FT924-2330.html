			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Coffee table travel RECESSION or not, coffee table travel books are still thudding from the presses, many of them distinguished by standards of photography and reproduction that seem realer than reality. A good example: The Nature of Russia by John Massey Stewart, published by Boxtree (Pounds 17.99) and based on Anglia Television's Survival series. The TV films were first-rate and so is the book, which includes more than 100 specially commissioned pictures, some from previously inaccessible areas. One day, wildlife tourism may be as important to the former Soviet Union as it now is to Africa. This book tells why. The same could be said of Indonesia, and of Wild Indonesia by Tony and Jane Whitten, with photographs by Gerald Cubitt (New Holland Publishers, Pounds 24.99). Indonesia is made up of more than 13,000 islands: an archipelago of immense beauty and biological importance whose protection has become one of the biggest ecological issues of our time. This Is Zimbabwe, by Peter Joyce (New Holland, Pounds 19.99), was also photographed by Gerald Cubitt. It is not quite as ambitious as the Indonesian book, but Cubitt's work is - again  -a wonder. From the sublime to - well, Timpson's English Villages, by John Timpson, with pictures by Michael Stead (Headline Book Publishing, Pounds 19.99). Timpson says he has avoided a surfeit of maypoles and morris dances; instead, he chose his villages to reflect the quirkier aspects of English social history, and in that he has succeeded. More specialised is Portrait of the Tweed, a celebration of the Borders landscape by Ian Bavington Jones, who also took the pictures (Cassell, Pounds 20). The author takes a year in the life of the river, tracing it upstream, season by season, to its source in the remote moorland of upper Tweedsdale. Plenty of legends and anecdotes. Just as attractive is Highland Sketchbook - A Year in Glen Esk, by Derek Robertson (HarperCollins, Pounds 17.99), which mixes diary and artwork from a year-long journey through Glen Esk, in the foothills of Scotland's Grampian mountains. And there are those who will enjoy Queen Victoria's Scotland by Michael Stead, who also took the photographs (Cassell, Pounds 17.99), which draws on the queen's journals as well as historical accounts to trace her progress through the Highlands. Some of the best photography on offer is Tom Kelly's, in Ireland: The Living Landscape (Roberts Rinehart, Pounds 17.95), which has text by Peter Somerville-Large and poems by Seamus Heaney. Kelly, says the publisher, is considered Ireland's greatest landscape photographer. Some of the work here is good enough to make your heart stop. Egypt is a crowded market in the coffee table stakes, but Egypt, by Peter Stocks, with photographs by David Couling (George Philip, Pounds 19.99), merits attention. Far more unusual is A Historical Atlas of the Jewish People, edited by Eli Barnavi (Hutchinson, Pounds 30). It is beautifully produced and spans more than three millennia. There are nearly 1,000 maps, plus drawings, photographs, chronologies and commentaries by dozens of experts. The atlas covers all main themes of the Jewish experience: prehistory, biblical background, tribal movements, revolts, wars, religious developments and the growth and shaping of the Jewish faith. Where it can, it touches on language, literature, art and music. First rate. Also beautifully produced is Christopher Saxton's 16th Century Maps (Swan Hill Press, Pounds 14.95). In the 1570s, under the authority of Elizabeth I, Saxton, a Yorkshireman from Wakefield, surveyed and drew maps of all the counties of England and Wales. This is a facsimile edition of the hand-coloured copies of Saxton's maps from the library at Chatsworth House, with an introduction by Prof William Ravenhill of Exeter University. For those who like their travel in bitefuls, Michael Palin's Pole to Pole (BBC Books, Pounds 16.95) is easily recommended. Nice idea: pole-to-pole along the line of longitude 30`E (Leningrad, Istanbul, Luxor, etc). And more first-rate photography: Basil Pao.</p>

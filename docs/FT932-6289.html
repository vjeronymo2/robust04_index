			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (12): Investment initiative launched  -Profile of Cumbria's coastal strip JUDGING by the glossy brochures which promote most parts of Britain, there are certain factors - beautiful scenery, executive housing, good communications - which tip the balance when companies consider relocating. The brochures, however, are often more coy about another crucial consideration - the availability of grant aid. A certain embarrassment lingers about admitting the need for financial incentives to attract inward investment. But the fact the Department of Trade and Industry has received 2,000 representations lobbying for inclusion on its redrawn assisted areas map shows the significance of such aid, which also attracts European funds. Nowhere was the announcement of the new map more anxiously awaited than in the Cumbrian Travel to Work Areas of Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow-in-Furness. Superficially, the unemployment statistics of Cumbria's coastal strip might suggest it has fewer problems than many other parts of Britain; in February, the unemployment rates for Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow TTWAs were 12.5, 9.8 and 9.4 per cent respectively, compared with a UK rate of 10.5 per cent. But behind the figures lie deep-seated structural problems; the Cumbrian coastal strip, already tussling with difficulties of geographical peripherality, poor road, rail and air links and traditionally low levels of indigenous entrepreneurship, is in the middle of considerable job shedding at its two dominant workplaces, the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing site and VSEL's shipyards in Barrow-in-Furness. Consultants have predicted unemployment will rise sharply. In Copeland's case, the latest forecast is unemployment of more than 20 per cent by the end of 1994. Although phased over a few years the job cuts - at least 6,000 from the Sellafield site and more than 9,000 from VSEL - are especially traumatic because of the lack since the 1970s of any substantial inward investment into the area to diversify its industrial base. 'Nothing of any major significance moved in during the 1980s in the whole of West Cumbria,' says Alan Williams, business manager of the West Cumbria Development Fund. British Nuclear Fuels, which is ploughing more than Pounds 1m annually into the fund to encourage economic regeneration, is also building on its presence as a big local purchaser and source of technological know-how by developing the new Westlakes science and technology park near Whitehaven. So far, 15 companies, employing 102 people, have been signed up, filling Westlakes' first phase. Of these, seven are from outside the area. None is a total relocation; their headquarters remain elsewhere. Phase II, now under development, will be marketed to attract more businesses from outside West Cumbria. The Northern Development Company, responsible for encouraging inward investment into north east England and Cumbria, believes indigenous growth is crucial to long-term regeneration of the Cumbrian coastal strip's economy. 'The real gains lie in local business development,' says NDC chief executive Dr John Bridge. In the shorter term, however, local economic development bodies believe significant inward investment, either by companies relocating or expanding, is vital to create more jobs. In a spirit of self-help, the county's public and private sector and job-creating agencies have created the Cumbria Marketing Initiative, a Pounds 1m campaign to attract inward investment, launched in Barrow last October by board of trade president Michael Heseltine. Under the slogan 'Cumbria will work for you', it aims to raise awareness of the county as a potential business location. Last month it reported it had generated more than 100 inquiries from companies 'interested to learn more about the benefits of relocating to Cumbria'. These inquiries are being chased up and a harder-sell second phase campaign is planned for year two. Self-help, though, cannot surmount every obstacle. Unintentionally underlining the area's remoteness from Westminster, four ministers have since October at short notice cancelled visits to Copeland. Among them was Mr Heseltine, who had to cancel the latter part of his Cumbria Marketing Initiative launch when bad weather grounded his helicopter, needed because the road from Barrow to Whitehaven was far too slow. 'Self help can only be part of a total package; at the end of the day we have to offer incentives,' says Bob Metcalfe, Copeland borough council's director of development and services. 'There have to be sticks and carrots; the carrot of Regional Selective Assistance is absolutely vital.' At present, Workington TTWA has Development Area status, but Copeland and Barrow are non-assisted, placing them at a severe disadvantage. Even within West Cumbria, Workington's DA status has caused imbalance; 80 per cent of business developments assisted by the West Cumbria Development Fund in recent years have been in Allerdale, which includes Workington. Sellafield's expansion cost Copeland its development area status in 1983; ironically, it is the site's job-shedding which has made the borough's pleas for assisted area status more insistent. In support of the three TTWAS' bid for DA status, Cumbria county council argues that nearly 50,000 people work in manufacturing and energy-related industries within them, about 70 per cent of the county's employment in these sectors. In the 1980s, their performance helped raise Cumbria's gross domestic product from below to above the UK average. Without new industrial development in Barrow and West Cumbria, says the council, Cumbria GDP will fall back to early 1980 levels, when it was 10 per cent below the UK average. The area's problems, the argument runs, are structural, not cyclical. 'While the south east will get better of its own accord, we're going to need an injection of new business in this area to broaden the base,' says Furness Enterprise chairman Mr Alan Forsyth. The intensive national lobbying over the new map and the new aid for pit closure areas - Cumbria's mines shut too soon to benefit - are viewed with some gloom in the county. 'There is a distinct possibility the assisted map will be drawn on a political basis rather than a needs basis,' says Mr Metcalfe. The investment which assisted area status should attract is crucial, he says. 'If we don't get that we are in terminal decline.'</p>

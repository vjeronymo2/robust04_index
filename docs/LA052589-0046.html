			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCORD REACHED IN SCHOOL STRIKE;  </P> <P> DISTRICT, L.A. TEACHERS AGREE TENTATIVELY ON 24% SALARY HIKE  </P> <P> A tentative settlement was reached early this morning to end a teachers' strike  that paralyzed the vast Los Angeles Unified School District for eight  emotionally charged days and disrupted the education of nearly 600,000  students.  </P> <P> Under the agreement announced at 1 a.m. by union and district officials,  teachers would get a retroactive 8% raise for the past term and 8% for each of  the following two years. They also would receive several long-sought policy  changes including the elimination of mandatory yard supervision by elementary  school instructors and the creation of shared-decision making councils at  schools.  </P> <P> Teachers will also receive half of the pay they were docked for withholding  grades and the rest they can earn back through extra work.  </P> <P> "It's like a marriage," district negotiator Dick Fisher said of the compromise  settlement. "You don't win or lose, you try to keep an ongoing relationship."  The union scheduled a ratification vote at a noon meeting today at the Sports  Arena, but teachers could return to their classrooms as early as Friday. Both  sides held out hope that classes will quickly return to normal. The school  board also must approve the agreement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimum Pay Hike  </P> <P> The minimum pay for district teachers will rise in steps from the current  $23,440 to $29,529 in July 1990. Top pay will jump from $40,871 to $51,490 for  a teacher without an advanced degree and from $43,319 to $53,938 for a teacher  with a doctorate degree.  </P> <P> The pact is designed to bring a measure of labor peace for the next two years  to the nation's second-largest school district after New York City. Teachers  worked this school year without a contract, although taking various job actions  such as withholding grades to pressure the district until the traumatic strike  began on May 15. The teachers' strike was the first in 19 years; the 1970  strike lasted 23 days.  </P> <P> Clearly, the announcement last week of enormous amounts of unanticipated state  revenues helped to break the deadlock. Leaders from both sides in the dispute  attributed the settlement and newly upbeat mood to their trips to Sacramento on  Tuesday and assurances from state legislators there that the district was to  receive at least $40 million in extra state funds this fiscal year. However,  still up in the air is how much of that money can be designated for salaries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sense of Realism'  </P> <P> According to Johnson, legislators had "brought a sense of realism" to the  situation. He particularly praised Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)  for helping defray tempers. On Monday, the district and union swapped barbs  about their respective bargaining positions and a quick resumption of  negotiations had appeared unlikely.  </P> <P> Teams of three officials from each side entered the Westin Bonaventure Hotel  downtown about 3 p.m. for talks under the supervision of a state mediator. On  one side of the table were Weintraub, schools Supt. Leonard Britton, and  district negotiator Dick Fisher; bargaining for the union were Johnson, union  vice-president Helen Bernstein and negotiator John Britz.  </P> <P> In the days leading up to Wednesday's bargaining session, there had been some  misdemeanor arrests and sporadic incidents of unruliness. But fearful  predictions of young people getting caught up in bursts of gang violence never  came true as students skipping school seemed more intent on watching movies,  shopping and playing video games. After a few days, some students even said  they were getting nostalgic for their teachers.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, one of the most serious incidents occurred when a striking  teacher at Andrew Carnegie Junior High School in Carson was arrested and held  on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon when he allegedly threw a rock at  a car crossing a picket line and hit a 12-year-old student. A spokesman for the  county sheriff said teacher David Torgersrud, 30, of San Pedro, was being held  with bail set at $5,000. The girl was treated at a hospital for cuts and then  released.  </P> <P> School police said two other teachers were arrested in less serious incidents  Wednesday, one of them for attempted trespassing at district headquarters.  </P> <P> While signs pointed toward a settlement throughout the day, the school district  still asked a Superior Court judge Wednesday to limit picketing at schools and  other district property. Judge Kurt agreed to temporarily bar striking teachers  from blocking entrances to school sites and ordered them to remain in pairs 12  feet apart. But Lewin refused to limit the overall number of demonstrators.  </P> <P> The settlement ends 18 months of maneuvering and disagreement, both between the  union and the district and among various members of the school board. During  this time, many parents and students saw themselves as innocent victims.  </P> <P> Some observers saw much of the discord as a struggle between two men -- the  school superintendent Britton and union head Johnson.  </P> <P> In his previous post as head of the Dade County, Fla., schools, Britton had  earned a reputation as a friend of teachers by backing their efforts to gain  some say in school management. But soon after his arrival in Los Angeles two  years ago, the UTLA began to ridicule Britton as an enemy who spent upwards of  $90,000 a year-half of that in overtime-to pay for a driver and a man whose own  salary of $141,000 was higher than that of the mayor or governor.  </P> <P> Johnson, meanwhile, antagonized some district officials for what they saw as  baiting, unfounded attacks on them. They called Johnson's rhetoric  inflammatory.  </P> <P> The personality conflicts were complicated by political divisions on the school  board, with much of the bickering played out behind closed doors.  </P> <P> Although negotiations began for a new contract began in January, 1988, six  months passed without success and the existing contract expired June 30. In  September, the union began a boycott of unpaid, non-teaching duties such as  some yard supervision and the following month, it rejected a district offer of  a 17.4% pay increase over three years. Last December, a statemediator was  brought in to help the bargaining along.  </P> <P> Then in January, the union took a new tactic when it threatened to withhold  first semester grades from the district and give union-produced report cards to  the students. A wave erupted of large demonstrations by students fearful that  their chances for college admission would be hurt. The district responded by  ordering teachers to turn in their grades or have their pay docked. After a  judge refused to intervene, the union backed down on the grade issue, only to  repeat the tactic just the strike began.  </P> <P> By February, the district had increased its offer to 20% over three years with  the promise of an additional 4% if more state funds became available. But a few  weeks later, union members by a nearly 9-1 margin authorized their leadership  to call strike and later chose May 30 to walk out.  </P> <P> Then this month, the UTLA rejected a new offer of 21.5% over three years.  Britton ordered teachers to turn in grades early, by May 15, or face losing  their May paycheck. The union moved up the strike date to May 15 and a  last-minute effort to avert it failed.  </P> <P> From the beginning, it was clear the strike was crippling the district.  Hundreds of thousands of students simply walked off campuses and more than  two-thirds of the teachers walked picket lines. The numbers of students dropped  drastically in the first few days and then slowly began to rise, never reaching  much higher than 50% of the total enrollment of594,000. Some striking teachers  returned to their classrooms but never enough to staff schools properly.  </P> <P> On the third day of the strike, the landscape changed dramatically with two  events. A long-awaited state fact-finder's report on contract proposals was  released and supported the district's position, among other things, that the  teachers were well paid.  </P> <P> But that news almost was lost in Gov. George Deukmejian's surprising  announcement that state revenues would be $2.5 billion higher than anticipated  in the next two years and that a good chunk of that would go to education under  the rules of recently passed Proposition 98. At least $40 million would go to  the Los Angeles district this year although not all could be used for salaries,  officials said.  </P> <P> Formal negotiations resumed May 18 for the first time in four months and the  two sides met for four consecutive nights at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel.  Those talks exploded in rancor last Sunday as both sides accused the other of  lying.  </P> <P> A long strike seemed likely until legislators summoned the two sides to  Sacramento Tuesday. After hours of talks with state legislators, the two sides  agreed to this latest meeting and returned to the hotel.  </P> <P> The strike was costly not only in terms of lost wages for teachers but also  because the district stood to lose large amounts of state funds based on  attendance figures. However, state officials said that those loses probably  would be more than offset by the district's lower expenses during the strike.  Britton said the district saved $12 million in unpaid salaries during the first  week alone.  </P> <P> The settlement was certainly better for the union than the conclusion of its  last strike, a 23-day work stoppage in 1970. At that time, UTLA was seeking its  first contract and hefty raises but teachers ended up settling for the  district's original 5% pay raise offer, and the average instructor lost about  $1,100 during the strike. But the creation of school advisory councils and new  reading programs was a victory for the teachers.  </P> <P> This time, the union has been better organized and has broader support among  teachers. About two-thirds of the district's teachers, nurses, counselors and  librarians walked out last week, compared to about half in 1970.  </P> <P> Participants say some wounds never fully healed from that strike 19 years ago.  The same may be true this time around. Faculty lounges are likely to remain  tense for some time, particularly because strikers have said they resent the  fact that the contract will benefit colleagues who never walked out.  </P> <P> Clearly, the strike and the settlement will affect the June 6 run-off elections  which could lead to a new majority on the school board. Of the two board  members seeking relection, Julie Korenstein is viewed as pro-union and Alan  Gershman as unfriendly to union interests.  </P></p>

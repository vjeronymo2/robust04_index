			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Inflationary pressure in US stays subdued US producer prices for finished goods rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 1.7 per cent in the year to July, indicating that inflationary pressures remain subdued, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The figures were in line with forecasts in financial markets and followed a 0.2 per cent increase in producer prices in June. Excluding prices of food and energy, which tend to be volatile, the 'core' producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.5 per cent in the past year. It has held steady at this level for several months. The moderation of wholesale price inflation was interpreted in financial markets as further evidence of an unusually lacklustre economic recovery. Most analysts expect it to feed through into lower consumer price inflation, which is running at an underlying rate of about 3.5 per cent. Reuter adds: Mr Robert Dederick, an economist, said wholesale inflation was well in check. 'The prolonged period of stagnation has caused a lot of pain, but there has been some payoff in the form of reduced inflation.' The tame inflation picture could give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates further to spur the economy, without fear of igniting new price pressures. Fed policymakers are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday.</p>

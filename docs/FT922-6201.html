			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Caretaker government imposes further three-month freeze on capital spending in Italy ITALY'S caretaker government yesterday imposed a further three-month freeze on capital spending projects in a symbolic gesture to answer the EC's recent harsh criticism of the country's public finances, writes Robert Graham. In January, the government imposed for a six-month period a series of stiff requirements for approval of capital spending projects to hold down the public sector deficit, which was rising beyond 10.5 per cent of GDP. The main effect of this measure was to permit the Treasury to scrutinise all large investment requests and withhold approval unless ample justification was provided. Yesterday's cabinet meeting extended this procedure until September. The saving will be little more than L1,000bn (Pounds 452.7m), against this year's projected deficit of more than L165,000bn.  But the authorities were anxious to signal to Brussels that public spending would be closely monitored while a new government is being formed.</p>

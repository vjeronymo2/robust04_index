He said a decision would be made shortly on when to resume  the UNHCR land convoys crossing Serb territory to different  points in Bosnia, which were also suspended Monday.    "We are receiving the security assessments from UNPROFOR and  UN observers in Bosnia. The trucks are loaded and ready to go.  There is a good chance that the convoys will also be going," he  said.    More than 20 airlifts to bring supplies into Sarajevo were  planned for Tuesday, he said.    Though the airlifts and land convoys through Serb territory  were halted, a dozen other land convoys went ahead as scheduled  from Metzkovic for different towns in central Bosnia.    Of the convoy blocked in Hadzici, Redmond confirmed it had  been stopped in "Serb-controlled territory by about 100 women  who were demanding the release of their husbands apparently  detained by the government forces."    "We will try again today to reason with them and get things  going. If we do, it will be the first time in many months that  we will be able to use that road," he said.    In other developments, a prisoner exchange was made Tuesday  between 128 Moslems who had been held by Bosnian Croats at Rodoc  and 61 Croat prisonners detained in Jablanica, the International  Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva said.    The ICRC, which was supervising the exchange, said it had  also started repatriating 200 displaced Croats, mostly women and  children, who had been living in difficult circumstances in  Jablanica. Most had asked to rejoin their families in Mostar,  in southern Bosnia.</p>

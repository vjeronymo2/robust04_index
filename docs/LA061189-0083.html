			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AERIAL PHOTOS SPOTTED PERIL AT A-PLANT, AFFIDAVIT SHOWS  </P> <P> Aerial infrared surveillance showed hazardous wastes being illegally burned at  the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed  Friday in last week's federal raid on the facility.  </P> <P> The affidavit also accused Rocky Flats operators of illegally discharging  pollutants into a creek on plant property and of unpermitted dumping of  hazardous wastes.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Hilbert Schauer unsealed the affidavit after a newspaper  challenged withholding of the information that led Schauer to issue a search  warrant for the raid Tuesday on the plant, which is located 16 miles northwest  of Denver.  </P> <P> The 116-page affidavit catalogues the allegations made by FBI agent Jon Lipsky  and indicates that the investigation into possible criminal violations of  hazardous waste laws will probe activities at the nuclear weapons plant going  back to November, 1980.  </P> <P> Rocky Flats is operated by Rockwell International Corp. for the Department of  Energy. The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The affidavit also questions the DOE's decision to award an $8.6-million bonus  to Rockwell for excellent management of Rocky Flats.  </P> <P> The Rocky Mountain News reported in Friday's editions that the General  Accounting Office also has launched an investigation of performance bonuses  awarded Rocky Flats' managers.  </P> <P> The GAO investigation was the third blow sustained by the facility last week.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, 75 FBI and Environmental Protection Agency agents raided Rocky  Flats in an operation dubbed "Operation Desert Glow." On Wednesday, the  Colorado Department of Health announced it had found 25 environmental  violations at the plant.  </P> <P> The affidavit revealed that the FBI conducted aerial infrared surveillance at  the plant on three nights in December to determine whether the incinerator in a  plutonium reprocessing building that was closed for safety violations was being  illegally operated. They found that it was. Building 771 had been closed by DOE  inspectors in October. It reopened in January.  </P> <P> The DOE closed the building after a warning sign outside the building was  accidentally covered up, and three DOE inspectors walked in without proper  protective garb.  </P> <P> The affidavit also said that there was probable cause to believe Rockwell and  DOE officials in November, 1985, falsely certified that Rocky Flats was in  compliance with all applicable ground water monitoring requirements under the  1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  </P> <P> "In fact, various Rockwell and DOE officials were aware of serious  contamination and were informed that the monitoring system was deficient and  did not comply with the RCRA," the affidavit said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions Arise on Bonus  </P> <P> Also questioned in the affidavit was an $8.6-million bonus awarded Rockwell by  DOE in May, 1987. It said that DOE gave Rocky Flats' health and safety programs  and its waste-handling high marks.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, other DOE findings had said that "Rockwell had  significant problems controlling radioactive contamination at the plant and  that Rockwell provided DOE with erroneous and incomplete reports on  environmental, health and safety matters."  </P> <P> Chris Sankey, a DOE spokeswoman in Washington, said agency officials had not  had time to study the affidavit and had no comment. She also said she was  unaware of the GAO investigation.  </P> <P> Telephone messages left for Dennis Hurtt, Rockwell's spokesman in Denver, were  not returned.  </P> <P> FBI agents continued their on-site inquiry at the plant Friday. The  investigation is expected to last at least through this week, said Bob Pence,  agent in charge of the Colorado FBI office. The Justice Department is  investigating whether hazardous waste was illegally disposed of at the plant  and the actions then covered up.  </P> <P> The GAO investigation of the bonus program at Rocky Flats and other weapons  plant is expected to be completed in about two months, said Carl Bannerman,  assistant director of the GAO's energy division in Washington.  </P> <P> The GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress, is expected to send  investigators to the plant later this month, after the on-scene Justice  Department probe is completed, Bannerman said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SLAPS GABOR WITH EXTRA HOURS OF SERVICE  </P> <P> An angry Beverly Hills Municipal Court judge ordered Zsa Zsa Gabor to perform  60 extra hours of community service Tuesday, saying fund raising at her Bel-Air  mansion was not the way to serve time for slapping a policeman.  </P> <P> "If there is any violation of probation, County Jail will be the sanction,"  Municipal Judge Charles Rubin warned.  </P> <P> He asked Gabor if she accepted his decision.  </P> <P> "Yes, what can I do?" Gabor said.  </P> <P> "You could go to jail. Do you want that?" the judge shot back.  </P> <P> "It's outrageous," the former Hungarian beauty queen later told about 80  reporters.  </P> <P> Gabor, 72, was sentenced last year to 120 hours of community service on her  conviction of slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman who stopped her  Rolls-Royce last June for expired registration tags.  </P> <P> Rubin originally ordered her to do the service at the Lower Income Elderly  United Community Assistance Program in Venice, with the time to be completed by  March 30.  </P> <P> Rubin ordered Tuesday's hearing after he received a sparse account from the  shelter's executive director, Vera Davis, about how Gabor spent her time.  </P> <P> Davis said Gabor spent about 50 hours at the shelter and the rest of the time  working from her Bel-Air mansion, organiz ing a June 8 fund-raiser for the  shelter.  </P> <P> "It's clear to me the defendant had a rather lax attitude about it," Rubin  said.  </P> <P> "(It) means nothing to Miss Gabor, buying community service hours. She is a  wealthy person," Rubin said after meeting with Gabor and her attorney, Harrison  Bull, for 3 1/2 hours. "The primary motive was Miss Gabor's promotion, and not  fund raising.  </P> <P> "I repeated numerous times (at the original sentencing) that she perform  community service at the center."  </P> <P> Gabor later told reporters: "I served food. Why do I have to promote myself?  I'm so damned famous it's sickening."  </P> <P> Rubin gave Gabor credit for 34 1/2 hours of community service time from her  120-hour sentence. He ordered her to serve the remaining 85 1/2 hours, plus 60  penalty hours.  </P> <P> "Miss Gabor must now document her community service time and there will be  random, in-person verification," the judge said.  </P> <P> The remaining 145 1/2 hours must be completed by Sept. 28 and the hours will be  served at several agencies.  </P> <P> "You may not do any fund raising" as a part of the community service, the judge  ordered.  </P> <P> "I don't have any qualms with Miss Gabor's assistance and fund raising," said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, but "there is an aspect of humility that goes  along with this."  </P> <P> He said community service usually includes handling telephones or serving food.  </P></p>

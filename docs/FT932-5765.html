			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Evening Post at Pounds 4.1m and cautious for this year COST-CUTTING helped to boost profits at Bristol Evening Post, the regional newspaper group which recently shrugged off Mr David Sullivan, its long-time hostile shareholder and Sunday Sport publisher. The group announced a 22 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m on sales 1 per cent lower at Pounds 60.6m for the year to March 31. The figures compared with profits of Pounds 3.35m on turnover of Pounds 61.4m. The profit advance was helped by the introduction of FRS 3 which resulted in the comparative profits being restated downwards. Last year's reported figure was Pounds 4.06m. Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said the loss of 122 production and distribution jobs had resulted in a Pounds 1.14m reduction in staff costs. However, the company was still cautious on trading for the present year. Mr Clarke said both advertising and circulation were running at lower levels than last year. 'The recovery will be slow,' he said. 'The current situation is still erratic.' As a result, the final proposed dividend is being maintained at 7.75p, making a total for the year of 11.75p, a 2 per cent advance on last year's 11.5p. Earnings per share were 1.2p ahead at 11p. The group took a Pounds 1.8m charge to pay for the costs of the reorganisation, which was offset by a Pounds 1.6m profit on the sale of investments.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Facing some bitter choices - Roderick Oram on the problems confronting the brewing industry Mergers, not meteorology, are what British brewers really need to solve their structural problems and restore their profits. A few hot weeks in southern England this summer boosted their volumes but did little for their bottom lines given the competitive pressures, over-capacity and long-term decline in beer consumption afflicting the industry. The companies will focus on the short-term fillip during their reporting season, which begins on Thursday with Whitbread. The rate of decline in the industry's beer volume has slowed to about 1 per cent this year, from more than 2 per cent last year. The price war initiated last year by Bass and Courage has abated, although hefty discounts are still available, particularly to large customers. They can buy a keg of draught lager at a discount of about Pounds 90 on the typical wholesale list price of Pounds 210, said Mr Ian Pressnell of Plato Logic, a drinks consultancy. Thus, profits from beer wholesaling are likely to be lower for a number of companies, analysts forecast. But with profits rising in their other businesses, which include pubs, wholesale drinks distribution, hotels and holiday parks, overall profits will be up for most companies. Looking a short way ahead, the brewers are unlikely to get any joy from the Budget on November 29. The Chancellor is thought to be very resistant to excise duty cuts. He has little room for financial manoeuvre, and throughout the government there is scepticism that a duty cut would help stem the rising tide of cross-Channel beer imports. Even some backbenchers of the Treasury select committee, who recently heard evidence on the subject, think brewers have exaggerated both the import threat and the beneficial effect of bringing British duties part way down to low French levels. It is longer term considerations, however, which could be the most intriguing aspect of the results season. Analysts and investors will be searching for clues to the winners and losers in the wave of restructuring which will roll through the industry over the next year or so. 'Getting down from five to four big brewers, and then quickly down to three, would have a dramatic and positive impact on the industry after years of being moribund,' says Mr Ian Shackleton, an analyst with James Capel. These would be the largest changes by far since those that flowed from the government's 1989 'beer orders'. To an extent, they would also be the settling of unfinished business from those directives. Five years ago, the government tried to increase competition in the industry by loosening the tie between brewers and the pubs that formed a large part of brewers' retail distribution system. Some companies, such as Grand Metropolitan and Boddington, got out of brewing to focus on retailing. Others transferred their brewing to joint ventures to try to increase their heft. Allied Domecq, for example, joined with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, to create Carlsberg-Tetley. For all the shuffling of assets, the industry was left suffering. Beer consumption is in long term decline, with an ageing population switching some of its spending to other drinks, or at least to imported premium lagers. Some 25 per cent of brewing capacity is excess to demand. On the retail side, pessimists estimate that Britain has about 10,000 more pubs than drinking habits can support. The result is too many low-quality and uninviting places which make consumers even more inclined to drink at home. The off-trade accounts for about 24 per cent of total beer sales, and is gaining about 1 per cent a year from the on-trade. These unfavourable dynamics have left some companies as uncertain holders of brewing or pub assets. GrandMet is seeking a way out from IEL, its pubs joint venture with Foster's, the Australian brewer. Allied Domecq may want to quit brewing to focus on spirits. Whitbread is trying to work out whether to plunge into retailing and give up brewing, or to build a twin future on both. The linchpin is Foster's, owner of Courage, the second largest UK brewer with a 19 per cent share compared to Bass's market leading 23 per cent. It indicated at its recent annual meeting that it hoped to complete before Christmas its review of its British brewing and pub businesses. Any deal it subsequently decides to do would most likely happen next year. Some analysts believe, though, that GrandMet and Foster's might try to resolve their ownership of IEL before this year-end. If Foster's decides to sell Courage, the price tag could be about Pounds 400m. Among potential British buyers, the most likely are Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Whitbread, ranked joint fourth with 13 per cent each. Courage would give S&amp;N a southern base, and make it a truly national brewer. Conversely, Courage's northern breweries would extend Whitbread's product range and geographic reach. In an ideal world they might want to split Courage between them, but that would be a difficult deal to engineer. For whoever buys Courage, the real pain will come in leading the industry's rationalisation of production. But the cost of this and other changes will be borne by many. The results season will give some indication of the companies best able to seize the opportunities ahead and pay for them.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          RESULTS FORECASTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Date    Company      Interims/      Pre-tax        Previous   Per cent                      finals         profits                     change                                    forecast  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 17  Whitbread      int    Pounds 137.2m   Pounds 135.7m      +1.1 Nov 23  Morland        fin     Pounds 9.75m   Pounds 8.87m       +9.9 Nov 29  Marston's      int     Pounds 12.3m   Pounds 11.5m       +7.0 Nov 30  Bass           fin      Pounds 545m   Pounds 508m        +7.3 Dec 2   Wolverhampton         &amp; Dudley       fin     Pounds 37.3m   Pounds 36.5m       +2.2 Dec 5   Scottish &amp;         Newcastle      int      Pounds 145m   Pounds 109.1m     +32.9 Dec 13  Greenalls      fin     Pounds 71.8m   Pounds 68m         +5.6 Dec 13  Vaux           fin     Pounds 29.5m   Pounds 26.6m      +10.9 Dec 15  Greene King    int     Pounds 10.7m   Pounds 9.5m       +12.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

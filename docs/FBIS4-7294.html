			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kulachada Chaphiphat] </F>   [Text] Just as enthusiasm increases for substantive  sub-regional economic cooperation, the Asian Development Bank  (ADB) is finding it hard to meet its lending capacity goals. The  Bank is under pressure to implement its identified projects.    At the recent Conference on Subregional Economic  Cooperation,  infrastructure and energy were high on the agendas of the Mekong  countries, and ADB had hoped to play a landmark role in funding  the massive amounts of investment required.    Given the loan squeeze, the Bank, rather than playing  `family  doctor' was forced to fund many white elephant projects.    "The Bank as an institution must move beyond the traditional  private sector `window' and explore innovative mechanisms for  public-private partnerships, and find effective ways to link  technical project information to the investment decisions of  enterprises," ADB's President Mitsuo Sato told the heads of the  six nation delegation from Cambodia, China, Myanmar [Burma],  Laos, Thailand and Vietnam at the Third Conference on Mekong  sub-regional economic cooperation last week in Hanoi.    Sato also urged greater responsibility on the part of  regional governments in finding unilateral and collective  approaches to regulatory, legal and institutional bottlenecks in  order to attract massive private sector investment in so-called  "hard side" projects like transport and energy development.    He stressed that "soft side" economic cooperation, (chiefly  energy management coordination), though hardest to implement,  must be simultaneously addressed along with "hard side"  cooperation.    The reorientation of the Bank's policy to seek private  sector  help in regional development stemmed mainly from tightening  budget control. The private funding is needed, however, to help  share in its lending which this year reached more than US$ 10  billion for infrastructure projects in the Mekong region.    The Bank's 1993 annual report, released last week, said the  ADB members should widen the private sector's role in  infrastructure projects, expected to soar to one trillion  dollars by 2000. Beyond 2000, the private sector's funding of  the subregional projects will account for 70 percent of  investment in the region.    The Bank's Programs Director (West) Noritada Morita said in  an exclusive interview with The Nation that the role of the  private sector in financing these projects in the future will be  formidable, and greatly complement the Bank's funding options.    With increasing private sector involvement, Morita said, the  Bank's role is to continue to provide technical information and  to act as a middle agent to meet the needs of each country in  the Mekong region.    Morita also shared widely held concerns about the possible  negative effects of private sector involvement in subregional  economic development, especially concerning the impact of  development on societies and the environment.    He said the responsibility lies on each government to  control  potential environmental damage caused by private sector  involvement. Governments, he said, should provide tax privileges  and other incentives for sound environmental policies on the  part of the private sector.    "It is very difficult to say. Ability to combat  environmental  abuse depends on the maturity of the society the government and  the public," he said.    The Bank has come under pressure from traditional donors, in  particular the United States, who are looking to channel  financial resources to other emerging areas besides the Mekong  subregion.    Nevertheless, the Bank's 55-member agency was able to defend  its proposed capital increase from US$14 to 28 billion this  year, with the aid of Japan. The Bank is committed to conducting  a basic reform of both its structure and policy to weed out the  bad projects and raise lending criteria.    The Bank has been criticized for unsuccessful projects.  About  20 percent of ADB projects, mostly in infrastructure, have been  unsuccessful, although it still rates well in comparison to  similar institutions.    Morita, echoing Sato's policy, said the Bank was devising a  new lending strategy incorporating environmental provisions into  funding eligibility requirements. A blueprint of the Bank's  restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of this  year.    Among the "soft side" projects proposed at last week's  conference was the proposed creation of an environmental forum  to engage policy makers and private agencies to address  environmental concerns and formulate regional standards for  environmental regulations. It also included the setting up of a  working committee on trade to look into ways to harmonize trade  and tariff codes which have impeded cross border economic  cooperation.    Morita described the meeting as extremely successful, as  participating countries were not only be able to show their  readiness to take part in the "hard side" of economic  cooperation, namely transport and energy sectors, but also an  increased willingness to cooperate on the "soft," but harder to  implement, side of economic cooperation.    An official attending the conference expressed caution,  however. "Some projects are designed to make the Bank look good  and to please donors but did not really address demands of  lenders," the official commented.    The official said that while there was an increasing concern  for environmental degradation in the subregion, not all  participating countries are ready to join hands, and some  preferred that it be addressed at the national level.    The failure of the delegations from Cambodia, Thailand and  Vietnam to deal with off-shore disputes regarding oil and gas  production demonstrated that certain sensitive areas exist which  defy resolution by the conference.    Morita, however, said the Bank's success should not be  measured by the number of projects that were agreed upon by  participating countries.    "Our success is in helping small countries sustain economic  growth and development, in helping these countries reform their  economies, and in making the private sector more active.  Ultimately we are striving [to] reduce poverty in the region,"  he said.</p>

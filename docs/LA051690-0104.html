			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> BACK YARD BRAWL IN DRUG WAR;  </P> <P> MARIJUANA HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CASH CROP IN IMPOVERISHED EASTERN KENTUCKY. A  LOOMING EFFORT TO DESTROY POT FIELDS THERE PARALLELS THE COCA BATTLES OF THE  ANDES.  </P> <P> Here in the heart of Appalachia, the silence of spring will soon be shattered  by the roar of National Guard helicopters. The federal government is taking aim  at America's No. 1 cash crop -- marijuana.  </P> <P> In a decade of stern anti-drug rhetoric, figures from the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration show that domestic marijuana production has jumped sixfold,  tripling in the past three years alone. And perhaps nowhere has the  transformation been so striking as in these hills and hollows of eastern  Kentucky. This poverty-cursed land, which once drained dollars from moonshine  stills, now depends largely on a marijuana economy. The back yard boom here in  America has spawned hostility and an unanswered question in Peru and Bolivia:  Why is the U.S. government cracking down on coca production in those countries  while allowing Americans to grow marijuana with impunity at home? The impending  Bush Administration crackdown marks a belated American attempt to set a better  example.  </P> <P> But even with a proposed 400% increase in anti-pot spending, the prospects for  inroads against American marijuana remain bleak. Even the most optimistic  Administration officials say that an all-out, two-year effort might reduce  domestic production by a modest 10% at most.  </P> <P> For those who have watched marijuana take control of this impoverished rural  region, the obstacles appear even more considerable. Far from being a hippie  pastime, marijuana has become a way of life -- a garden-path to prosperity in  places where residents have little to lose.  </P> <P> With summer fast approaching, the impending clash in the Marijuana Patch looms  as a home-grown parallel to the intractable coca struggles of the Andes, as  governments search for ways to persuade farmers to abandon crops that are  lucrative but illegal.  </P> <P> The Kentucky operation will be costly, as helicopter-borne National Guardsmen  slash and burn marijuana crops. But because the crackdown is intended primarily  for foreign consumption, the Administration plan is likely to renew an old  debate about the wisdom of a war on marijuana, a widely used drug about which  the public has long been ambivalent.  </P> <P> "It's going to cost a lot of money to get a little payoff," federal drug czar  William J. Bennett acknowledged recently. But, he hastened to add: "If we don't  act on our own land, we have no place to stand when we ask others to act on  theirs."  </P> <P> At least 5,000 tons of American marijuana made its way to the U.S. marketplace  last year -- enough to meet an unprecedented 35% of the domestic demand. Now  more potent than dope grown anywhere else in the world -- with eight times the  kick of 1960s-vintage pot -- a single 1-pound plant brings an average $1,200  return.  </P> <P> Those numbers combined last year to push marijuana higher than corn as the  nation's biggest cash crop. Farm-gate receipts for pot-growers currently are  estimated at more than $13 billion. At street prices, the domestic industry is  even larger, government experts say.  </P> <P> "At minimum, this business is worth $20 billion to $30 billion a year," says  John P. Sutton, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's cannabis  investigations branch.  </P> <P> Kentucky is hardly alone among the states as a major marijuana grower. The top  five states -- which together produce 90% of American-grown pot -- also include  Hawaii, California, Tennessee and Missouri.  </P> <P> But it is in eastern Kentucky, frustrated federal anti-drug officials say, that  the pot boom most typifies the out-of-control germination that brought the  marijuana rage to the nation's unlikeliest places. And it is in dirt-poor  places like Booneville, seat of Appalachia's most impoverished county, that the  potent weed appears to have assumed the most control.  </P> <P> While the mountain terrain is too steep and remote for any exact accounting,  the evidence is overwhelming. A full one-third of all the marijuana plants  cultivated on U.S. public lands are found in this region's multi-county Daniel  Boone National Forest. And state officials say that even among its pot-rich  neighbors, Booneville's Owsley County stands out in emerald-green at  harvest-time when it is viewed from a helicopter.  </P> <P> Informants tell prosecutors that as many as four in 10 residents now grow  marijuana for profit. When the crop comes in, the marijuana-growers settle  their grocery store debts in C-notes. Field hands who earlier seemed to be  unemployed pay cash for new trucks. Even those who do not grow marijuana  themselves make clear where their loyalties lie.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean we're bad people," protests Jody Sizemore, a sixth-generation  Owsley County resident. "We're just poor as Jobe's turkey."  </P> <P> "People used to get out and bad-mouth the growers," said Judge Jimmie W.  Herald, a bearded young man with a bowl-haircut who is the newly elected top  official in the county of 6,000 persons. "Now, they just stay quiet."  </P> <P> The reasons for the transformation began outside eastern Kentucky. By focusing  its attention on foreign marijuana, the federal government for years provided a  de facto subsidy for the home-grown market. Meanwhile, a paraquat herbicide  scare tainted Mexican marijuana in the '70s, and interdiction halted a  Colombian flow in the '80s. As a result, domestic growers flourished, producing  the marijuana of choice for the nation's estimated 12-million regular users.  </P> <P> That meant easy cash for anyone willing to take the risk. It was the depths of  Appalachia, where a moonshiners' legacy gave a particular allure to  lawlessness, that held the readiest crop of risk-takers.  </P> <P> The rugged terrain proved an ideal camouflage for marijuana, even as it grew to  three times a man's height. And at big-city prices -- paid to local brokers by  eager Eastern merchants -- even a small plot could bring profits of thousands  of dollars. "Topography used to be our curse," said one grower of a  particularly potent local variety. "But for Bible Weed, it has been a  blessing."  </P> <P> The result throughout the region was a near-epidemic of pot-growing in  communities where earlier it had been hard to find even a marijuana cigarette.  "The people we're finding in the marijuana patches -- by education, skills and  economic class -- are exactly the same kinds of people as we used to arrest at  the moonshine stills," said Michael Murphy, an assistant U.S. attorney who  specializes in drug cases in the region.  </P> <P> "People's out of work, and naturally they got to feed their families," said  Sheriff Edd Jordan, whose Clay County office already is cluttered with  marijuana seedlings seized in recent raids. "That's why they got this stuff  coming in."  </P> <P> If Owsley County has now become home to the most concentrated of the state's  pot-growing, residents and outside experts both say the most important  explanation lies in its down-and-out economic status. With a per-capita income  of less than one-fourth the national average, the county is devoid of any real  industry. Of the 20 coal mines in operation in 1980, only two remain. The  average tobacco plot brings in about $2,000 a year. Nearly everyone who works  must cross county lines.  </P> <P> "What else are our people going to grow?" asked Charles Beach Jr., vice  president of a Beattyville bank that serves much of Owsley County. "Nobody  thinks anything more of growing marijuana than when they were stripping tobacco  stalks and hauling it to market."  </P> <P> Over a pork-chop lunch at the Purple Cow restaurant, Food Town grocery store  owner Junior Brewer nodded his head in agreement. "A lot of these people just  don't have anything to lose," he explained.  </P> <P> As in the case of moonshine-making during the 1930s, such Appalachian  desperation has bred stubborn resistance in the face of just about every  government effort to beat back the Marijuana Patch. While in Northern  California the seven-year Campaign Against Marijuana Planting shrank the crop  there by about two-thirds, Kentucky and its neighboring states can hardly claim  a single success. Every year, machete-wielding lawmen cut down more marijuana;  and every year, more of it is grown.  </P> <P> The difference, federal officials contend, is that the old California growers  were largely outsiders who fled in the face of government pressure. In eastern  Kentucky, the problem is home-grown.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it's going to take to get control of it," said an  exasperated Jack Gregory, a Forest Service official who heads up anti-marijuana  efforts in the South. "The fact is, the dope growers outnumber the good guys."  </P> <P> Indeed, when the Kentucky state police and National Guard mounted a joint  "whack-and-stack" offensive against Owsley County marijuana early last summer,  they found locals so hostile that one storekeeper padlocked his store rather  than sell soft drinks to the "brought-ins."  </P> <P> And when the lawmen pulled into a nearby gas station for a fill-up, they found  the pumps suddenly rendered inoperable. By day's end, the team had to regroup  at a makeshift supply depot on safer ground -- the parking lot of a fast-food  restaurant in a neighboring county.  </P> <P> If the government has its way in the new war on marijuana, huge increases in  manpower and machinery this summer will make such resistance irrelevant. The  Administration proposes to increase anti-pot spending from about $9 million  last year and $18 million this summer to more than $36 million beginning Oct.  1. Millions of dollars more in Pentagon assistance already is on its way to the  National Guard.  </P> <P> At the same time, the White House is planning a major prosecution effort aimed  at interrupting a pattern that has resulted in the destruction of millions of  plants, yet permitted most growers to go free and plant again.  </P> <P> But with the initial stage of Kentucky's operations already under way -- and  the first of a projected fourfold increase in National Guard air missions  slated to begin in less than two weeks -- pressure on both sides is such that  it is uncertain what the effect of the crackdown might be.  </P> <P> In eastern Kentucky courtrooms, lawyers and judges say, past prosecution  efforts have stalled -- not because evidence has been lacking but because  small-town juries no longer recognize marijuana-growing as a serious crime.  Prosecutors strain to recall when last they won a marijuana case, telling  instead of countless hung juries even in the face of ironclad evidence. So  clannish are these counties that a defendant is inevitably an acquaintance,  causing jurors to think twice about judging a neighbor.  </P> <P> "Even in court, the people really do have a lethargic attitude when it comes to  marijuana," said Commonwealth Atty. Thomas K. Hall, whose responsibilities  include Owsley County. Adds another embittered prosecutor: "The judge is not  going to put his people in jail."  </P> <P> "Frankly," said Commonwealth Atty. B. Robert Stivers of Clay County, "it's  almost impossible to get a conviction."  </P> <P> In frustration, the state now plans to turn to federal courts for help with  marijuana-cultivation cases from the most-blighted counties. In that  more-removed system, prosecutors have succeeded in winning prison sentences of  as much as five years.  </P> <P> But at all levels, officials acknowledge that such a stop-gap solution is  unlikely to affect the so-called small-time grower, whose 50 well-tended plants  might bring a net income of close to $50,000 a year. In Owsley County, such an  entrepreneur still need have little fear of prosecution. A significant reason,  officials hint: Marijuana-induced apathy has not stopped at the line of the  law.  </P> <P> "You'd have to be a fool not to notice that all these big 'uns everybody's  talking about, nothing's ever happened to them," said Stivers, the county  prosecutor. "Hell, yeah, there's corruption. And that's all I'm going to say."  </P> <P> The airborne assaults may bypass courts and sheriffs, but critics remain  skeptical that even an all-out air war this summer can finally reverse the  marijuana boom. Public opposition to aerial spraying leaves the government with  one hand tied.  </P> <P> And already, some growers have sought to blunt the more-rudimentary "machete"  offensive, either by planting decoy crops or by scattering their pot plants to  ensure that at least some remain unscathed. While authorities contend that the  growers' new caution is a sign that the government is making progress, they  acknowledge that the 750,000-acre Daniel Boone Forest still offers plenty of  places to hide.  </P> <P> "It's always been one for the thieves, one for the helicopters, and one for  me," said Harper Corder, a Forest Service special agent.  </P> <P> In a land where guns and mining explosives are commonplace, there are also new  signs of resistance of a more-assertive sort. Deadly booby-traps, now rarely  seen around marijuana fields elsewhere, tripled in number last year in eastern  Kentucky. Marijuana-related murders took three lives in Owsley County. And in  these heavily timbered woods, arson is a constant -- and often-heard -- threat.  </P> <P> At the same time, in counties mistrustful of outside authority and grateful for  even illicit riches ("Marijuana?" a grinning car dealer said. "That is the  economy.") there are new indications that the crackdown will face stiff  resistance. Some Owsley County residents tell of the 21-year-old who cracked up  his brand-new Corvette on a mountain road last month, then walked away  untroubled. "It was paid for," he told onlookers, "And so's the next one."  </P> <P> And even when the stories are scornful -- the backwoods family that weekly  squandered hundreds of dollars in marijuana riches on store-bought potato soup,  a pre-prosperity delicacy -- there is solidarity in a mountain kinship.  </P> <P> "You might not like what some of your neighbors are doing, but you like the  people," said Sizemore, the lifelong Owsley County resident. "You might wish it  to stop, but not so bad that you'd wish anything bad to happen to them."  </P> <P> "Every time they go out there with those helicopters, that's a vote for me,"  chortled Gatewood Galbraith, a Lexington lawyer who is gambling a dark-horse  gubernatorial campaign on a legalize-marijuana platform tailored for eastern  Kentucky.  </P> <P> In South America, politicians will be watching as well -- but for different  reasons. Resentful of an Administration plan to link foreign aid to  coca-eradication, Peru and Bolivia have already made clear that they view the  marijuana-crackdown as a test of U.S. hypocrisy. "In reality, we have to prove  to these countries that we're serious about our own effort," said the DEA's  Sutton.  </P> <P> Conversely, with the Administration preparing to dispatch $175 million in  assistance to help wean Andean farmers from their illegal coca crops, some  wonder whether the parallel ought to be drawn more exactly.  </P> <P> "Marijuana has become a way of survival for some of these folks," said Richard  (Smitty) Taylor, who heads the Drug-Free Kentucky Commission for Gov. Wallace  Wilkinson. "If you don't address the economic system in these places,  ultimately, you're not going to be successful."  </P></p>

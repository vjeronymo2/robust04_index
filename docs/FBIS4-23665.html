			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Things get no better in the Liberian movement, ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], split  between Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces and the Krahn wing of  Roosevelt Johnson.    In spite of Alhaji Koromah's protestations, it seems very  few  of his men are left in his old headquarters at Tubmanburg  following Roosevelt Johnson's recent assault on the town, and  the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] has been accused of  siding with Johnson. Well, yesterday, Roosevelt Johnson called  us to say that Alhaji Koromah has now been finally and  irreversibly ousted as ULIMO leader. Today, Alhaji Koromah  called us from Conakry to repeat allegations against ECOMOG.  Robin White asked him what he had to say:    [Begin recording] [Koromah] We are asking the field  commander of ECOMOG to immediately withdraw his forces --  Nigerian forces that are in ULIMO territory -- because they have  contravened the Cotonou accord by engaging in active combat  against us, along with the dissidents.    [White] What exactly are you accusing the ECOMOG troops of  doing?    [Koromah] In fact, I got word from my commander by radio  communication that the iman of Tubmanburg, Imam Mohamed Sheriff,  who sought refuge at the ECOMOG base in Tubmanburg, has been  found dead. Secondly, another commander of ULIMO, Brother Allen,  was taken by the Nigerian ECOMOG, tortured -- his bodyguards  killed -- and asked as to where we were getting our arms and  ammunition from.    [White] Have you now fled to Guinea?    [Koromah] You have interviewed me many times from Conakry.  I have fled to nowhere. We control six counties within  Liberia, so, this is no fleeing. In fact, from here I will be  touring a couple of other countries that contributed to ECOMOG.    [White] But you couldn't get to Tubmanburg today.    [Koromah] Today, no; it is not on may schedule.    [White] But you wouldn't be able to go there at all.    [Koromah] Well, it's the insecurity in times of fighting.  Obviously it will not be prudent to go and sit in the middle of  the fighting and be a target just to prove that you are in  control or you are brave. That will be stupid.    [White] How many men do you still have with you?    [Koromah] I have the entire ULIMO, beside the dissidents.  You should be asking those who are fighting how many couple of  hundred men we have! We have more than nine, 10, 11 thousand  ULIMO soldiers, and you ought to know that Lofa alone has six to  seven thousand ULIMO soldiers!    [White] Mr. Koromah, if they only have a couple of hundred  men, why have they managed to drive you out of Tubmanburg?    [Koromah] Well, if you were listening to me, you wouldn't  ask that question. I just told you that these people are  fighting along with active combat Nigerians, and they're using  heavy artillery and other things, and they never drove us out of  Tubmanburg!    [White] They say that they've sacked you as ULIMO leader.    [Koromah] Well, I mean they want to kill me, so we shouldn't  be surprised to hear them say they sacked me. Somebody wants  your head, he's talking about sacking. They don't have  legitimacy, territorially, militarily, and otherwise to sack  anybody anywhere. So, they cannot be recognized by any  international organization. These are dissident groups that are  fighting. My only concern here is that we do not want the  peacekeepers to continue to get involved with it. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trading losses Trade policy developments rarely have much immediate impact on financial markets. Their long-run implications for economic growth are considerable, however, which is why the setback in the Uruguay Round is such dismal news. The Dollars 100bn annual boost to world trade arising from a successful round would, after all, constitute a 3 per cent increase: a welcome antidote to economic slowdown. Doubtless the insults will flow freely if the breakdown turns out to be irreparable. The US is far from blameless. But the European Community's determination to toe the French line has been still more destructive, even when viewed from the narrow perspective of its own economic interests. While the US is at least set to enjoy the benefits of the North American free trade area and fast growth in the Pacific rim, the EC is struggling to cope with Maastricht uncertainty, and the economic ravages of tight German money. The combination of a stronger dollar and possible US economic recovery after next month's election has created export opportunities which might offset some of the domestic worry. The US takes some 17 per cent of EC exports to third countries, still a considerable share even though it has fallen from 21 per cent five years ago. But chances of export-led recovery in Europe would be jeopardised if the Uruguay Round collapsed. Indeed, there is every chance that the US will turn up the heat in the transatlantic oilseeds dispute by imposing trade sanctions. Washington's hit list is heavily slewed towards products from Ireland, the home of the EC's farm commissioner, and France, which it views as the main culprit. Insofar as this involves wine and spirits, though, the penalty would partly be paid elsewhere, for example by Guinness through its LVMH connection and Allied-Lyons which controls Courvoisier.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (20): The networking revolution - A look at the way that local area networks are sweeping the world THE LOCAL area network revolution is in full swing and shows no sign of slowing. By the end of this year, around 35m personal computers used for business, or a third of the total installed worldwide, will be connected to networks within a single site, according to Mr Lee Doyle, a research director at International Data Corporation. He estimates that by 1996 around 40 per cent of the PCs in the world will be networked and - in Europe - the LAN proportion will rise from 42 per cent to 59 per cent. Market research produces very different statistics on the size of the market, because of widely differing definitions. Figures for the total world market for LAN products in 1992 vary between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn. Where all the analysts agree is that it is growing fast, probably at 30-40 per cent a year. This growth has been boosted by a sharp drop in prices for many types of essential LAN products such as routers, which help to gather and disseminate information. Most LANs have one of two configurations, Ethernet or Token Ring, both of which are well-established. At the lower level, involving cabling, bridges and routers, the principal suppliers are IBM, Digital and BT, although increasingly challenged by many others such as Mercury's DataComs subsidiary, BICC and Ungerman Bass. At the higher level, the beneficiaries are companies such as Compaq, which provides the powerful workstations, and Novell, the dominant software supplier. The first phase of networking began in the mid-1980s, when users began to find that their standalone personal computers were not able to do what they wanted. They had to be able to exchange data for most practical purposes. The networking movement was pioneered chiefly by American businesses such as American Airlines, which now has over 20,000 networks. A second phase is being brought about by the trends to 'downsizing,' 'client/server structures' and 'workgroup computing.' 'Downsizing' and 'rightsizing' are the vogue words to describe the process by which many organisations are moving systems to smaller machines which are more economical. Many are also splitting their systems in what is called a client/server structure, whereby large databases remain on the centralised servers but users can communicate with them from applications on their desktop PCs. At the same time some are starting to adopt applications known as 'workgroup' computing, 'groupware' or 'workflow automation,' that enable teams to share information more effectively. Mr Ben Smith, UK sales director of Novell, talks of two cultures - the corporate culture and the workgroup culture - and says that the barrier between them is gradually being broken down by local area networks. He takes the view that many senior information systems managers in large companies, who grew up in the world of centralised mainframe-based computing, remain hostile to local area networks and are obstructing their expansion. This opinion is shared by some other industry-watchers. Ben Smith expects that LANs will reach a form of co-existence with mainframes, rather than replacing them. Mr Hugh Jenkins, systems products manager for Compag, agrees on this point. He notes that Compag is now building PCs specifically designed to run on LANs, with special security features essential for LAN management. The ability to disable particular disk drives to protect sensitive data and to guard the LAN against software viruses are among the features that are becoming standard in LAN-specific PCs. The rapid growth in the market for laptops is not evidence for a return to standalone PCs, as half of them are now used in conjunction with LANs, he says. Many large companies worldwide are finding real communication benefits from connecting their personal computers, especially through shared databases, both local and remote, online order processing, shared printers and electronic mail. Large computer users are transferring more and more routine applications such as accounting and desktop publishing to local area networks. There are also industry-specific applications emerging - for instance, to run a doctor's practice or a shop. LANs can connect from five to 250 users. Ten-user and 20-user systems systems are still the most common, but there are signs of a shift to larger groups. More than half of the new installations are greater than 20-user. This may reflect the experience of users who report that groups of 20-30 people derive most advantage from the new workgroup software products such as Lotus Notes. LANs of 100 or more users are becoming common and many large companies have 400-500 user configurations. More LANs are being linked to each other to create very large user groups, sometimes of up to 1,500 people. Mercury has recently won several contracts for networking British hospitals, including St Thomas's in London, where 2,000 PCs in five buildings will be tied together. This is believed to be the largest National Health Service hospital network so far and will be watched closely by other hospitals to see if the doctors and nurses get the hoped-for improvement in information service. BT, the UK's largest computer user, is in the middle of an internal office automation project on a much greater scale, linking local area and wide area networks with the aim of connecting 50,000 users in the next two years. This huge scheme is intended to integrate several proprietary office automation systems.</p>

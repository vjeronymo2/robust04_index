			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Export fears hit prospects for growth GROWTH prospects for the economies of the Asia-Pacific region have dimmed significantly over the past six months as a result of the worsening outlook for exports, according to economic forecasters from around the Pacific Rim. The Pacific Economic Co-operation Council, grouping businessmen and academics from the 15 countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum as well as from Mexico, Chile and Peru, now predicts an average growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the region this year, rather than the 4.2 per cent rate it forecast in May. For 1994, the group expects a slight acceleration to 3.7 per cent, compared with an earlier forecast of 4.2 per cent. The inflation outlook for the Pacific region, however, continues to improve, the council says. Despite inflation problems in individual countries such as China and Indonesia, consumer prices are expected to rise by only 3.5 per cent this year and to slow further to 3.3 per cent in 1994. China remains the fastest growing economy in the region, despite the government's efforts to prevent overheating. 'The critical question is whether they are able to do it gradually or whether there will be a hard landing. Our forecasters believe there will be a soft landing,' said Professor Lawrence Krause, the leader of the forecasting team. The council expects growth of 13.5 per cent in China this year, slowing to 10.2 per cent in 1994, with inflation slowing from 11.8 per cent in 1993 to 9.8 per cent next year. Excluding the US and Japan, the two biggest economies in the region, the council projects average growth of 5.6 per cent both this year and next, with inflation averaging 5.4 per cent in 1993 and 5.1 per cent in 1994. The council has official observer status at Apec meetings, and its forecasts are used as a consensus basis for discussion by member governments.</p>

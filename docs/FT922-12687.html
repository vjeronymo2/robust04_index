			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: Too reliant? Sir, Lex praises Inchcape's results (March 31) and adds 'the figures also contradicted the notion that Inchcape is too reliant on the motor industry and Toyota in particular'. What does Lex mean? In the past 10 years managers have proved unable to make a success of diversity. In a back-handed way Lex is suggesting that diversity or risk-spreading is good. Does Lex think that Toyota is too reliant on the motor industry? Andrew Campbell, director, Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, 17 Portland Place, London W1</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Bill on restrictive trade may be delayed A planned strengthening of the law on anti-competitive behaviour may face further delay because of the pressure on the government's 1994-95 legislative programme. While the list of measures for inclusion in the Queen's Speech in November has yet to be finalised, it is understood that reform of legislation on restrictive trade practices is well down the Department of Trade and Industry's list of priorities. High on the DTI's agenda are a possible Post Office privatisation bill and a bill to deregulate the gas market. Pressure on legislative time is so heavy that legislation to pave the way for gas-market reform is thought not to have been included in a list of core bills for the autumn, agreed by the cabinet last month. This is in spite of the fact that delaying the bill until 1995-96 would make it difficult for it to be passed in time to implement plans to open 5 per cent of the gas supply market in 1996. The government announced in April last year that it had decided to strengthen existing law on anti-competitive behaviour while backing away from radical changes such as the introduction of large fines. The plans envisage strengthening the law in four ways: Wider powers for the Office of Fair Trading allowing it to search and seize documents in certain circumstances. Additional scope for companies to give undertakings to the OFT which could be enforced through the courts. Powers for the director- general of fair trading to make interim orders prohibiting any further anti-competitive behaviour. Extension of the law to cover some property rights, such as rights of access. Among the reforms rejected by the government were proposals that could have resulted in companies facing fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover.</p>

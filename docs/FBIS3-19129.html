Before the FDP Executive  meeting which followed, party chairman Klaus Kinkel said it is  now time to "roll up our sleeves."    Kinkel regards the FDP's difficulty as walking a tightrope  between loyalty to the coalition and taking a position of its  own: "The FDP has the problem that it is a coalition partner in  Bonn and, as far as actual issues and style are concerned, it  wants to bring this coalition to a respectable end and it will  do so. On the other hand, we have to show independence. So we  are caught in a bind."</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Employees May Buy Slice of Domino's: Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan  said Domino's has retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.  to study the feasibility of an employee stock ownership plan. He said he will  decide whether to implement an ESOP on completion of the study and will remain  as chairman of Domino's if one is adopted. Under the ESOP, Domino's would  borrow money, lend it to employees as a group to buy a majority share in the  company and distribute stock to employees as a benefit redeemable as the loan  is paid off.  </P></p>

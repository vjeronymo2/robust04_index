			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Clamping down hard on the clampers: Growing demands for the government to curb car parking cowboys WHEN Mr Trevor Whitehouse's car was wheel-clamped, he cursed, paid the fine  -and started his own wheel-clamping business. Now the government is under pressure to curb Mr Whitehouse's activities, along with the other 250 or so car-clamping contractors in Britain. New research by the RAC, the motoring body, suggests that up to 250 companies clamp 15,000 cars a week in Britain. A government consultative paper is overdue, but is likely to appear before a Commons debate next week on a private member's bill to control clamping. The delay may reflect the fact that the government is caught between public outrage over the activities of 'cowboy' clampers, the desire of clamping companies for some form of regulation and the concern of businesses to safeguard their parking spaces. Car clamping on the streets is licensed and controlled by the police, but on private land the decision on whether to clamp and how large a 'fine' to impose rests entirely with the landowner. Consequently, 'cowboy' car-clamping on private land has triggered a stream of well-publicised complaints over the past three years about aggressive tactics and high fines. Not only have release fees been as high as Pounds 240, but contractors - who frequently work on a commission basis - have been known to clamp medical vehicles, and even a visiting police car. The government has to balance this outrage against the fears of parking space owners that their valuable parking spaces are being used by motorists. Many businesses - including law firms and retailers - as well as public buildings such as hospitals, use clamping contractors to safeguard their carparks. 'It's politically difficult and embarrassing for the government, because it cuts across so many grey areas,' says Mr Edmund King, campaigns manager of the RAC. 'At the moment anyone can set themselves up as a wheelclamper - all they need is a couple of clamps, and they charge what they like,' Mr King said. In Scotland, private clamping is in effect illegal - the Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh ruled last June that clamping a vehicle and then charging for releasing it was equivalent to 'extortion and theft'. There have been calls for the law in England to be brought into line. 'We are begining to think there isn't any option,' says Mr John Spellar, Labour MP and author of the bill. A complete ban would not be acceptable to businesses that use clamping. 'We need car clamping to protect our revenue. It's a legitimate weapon in the fight against illegal parking,' says British Rail. One of BR's contractors says sales of parking tickets have increased 30 per cent since clamping was introduced at stations. The Home Office suggested illegal parking be covered by the criminal law of trespass. Mr Spellar suggests that another solution would be to extend the powers of the police and traffic wardens on to private property. But since these options could be legally complex, the Home Office is understood to favour a third idea; introducing regulations that would allow bona fide institutions to hire wheelclampers, but prevent private landowners from profiteering. 'The complaint is not about wheelclamping per se - it's about the way that some people go about it,' the Home Office said. Many clamping contractors, nervous about losing lucrative business if a total ban were applied, say they welcome government guidance. 'I would be all for regulation. The law is so vague,' says Mr Tony Philips, owner of the Southern Car Clamping company, who says regulation would drive out the cowboys. His small company, which started three years ago, makes Pounds 60,000 a year on 70 sites. He boasts of the time his company once clamped 27 cars on a street. The RAC says enforcing controls could be costly and bureaucratic. Furthermore, discriminating against small-scale landowners is no guarantee of good conduct - many of the clamping cases the RAC and AA have pursued in court have involved companies working for hospitals and local authorities. So far these court cases have proved inconclusive. Most companies settle out of court, or they vanish when faced with charges. Meanwhile, the clamping companies appear to be thriving. Mr Whitehouse says profits can be made not only from fines but also from renting out warning signs. His Preston-based company, National Clamps, counts the BBC, British Telecom and several large retailers among its clients.</p>

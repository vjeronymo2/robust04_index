			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Alexandra Andon editorial: "The 15th Military Accord"] </F>   [Text] When General Grachev's visit to Bucharest and  implicitly the signing of the military cooperation accord  between Romania and Russia were postponed last December, there  was a strong public reaction. According to the schedule, the  Russian minister's appearance in Bucharest was to take place a  week after the parliamentary elections in Russia, the moment  when the "Zhirinovskiy reality and diversion" were consecrated.  Ilie Ilascu's sentence was causing maximum tension in  Bucharest. Under those circumstances, the Russian Embassy's  reaction, coupled with the two unambiguous factors of political  reality, was causing a just perceptible fear. General Pavel  Grachev's visit and the signing of the accord already ran the  risk of being interpreted as a gesture of succumbing to  pressure. Two or three weeks later, with the impending visit of  the U.S. President to Europe (Partnership for Peace, Moscow, and  so forth), these fears were similarly intense, but had changed  in content. The question asked was: Why is Grachev not coming,  do the Russians not want to discuss things with us?    Both the attention paid to the planned event and the radical  change in the form of concern reflected a simple truth: Russia  is the great power next to us that cannot be ignored or provoked.    After 14 military cooperation accords concluded in the wake  of 1989 between the Romanian Ministry of National Defense and  the defense ministries in Western or neighboring countries, the  15th accord with Russia, which will be signed at the beginning  of next week, has been interpreted in numerous ways.    In fact, these documents resemble one another. As for  differences, they lie in the form of military cooperation.  Concluding the accord with Germany, the Romanian side was  interested, for instance, in sending its officers for training  by its partner. Ukraine (the last country with which such an  accord was signed) is interested in having its naval officers  trained in Romania. As for cooperation with Russia, we cannot  ignore the fact that a major part of the Romanian Army's  equipment, especially aviation, is of (ex)-Soviet origin.    The political will and the substance of the security policy,  which have brought about the conclusion of a number of such  accords, are, however, alike. The strategy is to try to repeat  Titulescu's [inter-war Romanian foreign minister] strategy  immediately after World War I when he initiated a basic  bilateral accord with the Soviet Union. The fate of a small  country affected by the turbulent currents in the Balkans did  not permit at that time, as indeed now, a strategy different  from that of moving closer and strengthening, in every way,  relations with the West, while maintaining amicable relations  with Moscow.    For the time being, however, the balance between the two  great requirements is being achieved in a dynamic way by  constantly adjusting to changes in the domestic and foreign  political arena. The mechanism is moving, advancing along a road  that, unfortunately, does not resemble a fast train track, but  rather our homeland's roads. Guidance requires ability and it  also requires the fulfillment of all the European commitments  assumed so far, be they in the area of arms reduction or within  the Partnership for Peace. To deny one component would be  dangerous because it could compromise the entire thing.</p>

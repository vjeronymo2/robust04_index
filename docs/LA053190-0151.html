			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CONTEST CITES GARDENS THAT SAVE WATER  </P> <P> Drought-resistant landscapes do not have to be dominated by cactus and rocks if  the more than 50 entries in Ventura County's Water-Efficient Landscape Contest  are any indication.  </P> <P> Almost all the gardens nominated in the just-completed event were "lush,  attractive and colorful," said Lorraine Timmons, water conservation assistant  for the county's Water Conservation Program.  </P> <P> The contest was created "to emphasize that we need water-efficient landscaping,  given our semiarid environment, and that the landscaping doesn't have to look  desert-like" to accomplish this, Timmons said.  </P> <P> As an example, Timmons, who coordinated the contest, pointed to the year-old  home of Ken and Pixie Belch of Ojai. The property on South La Luna Avenue won  first place in the residential tract home landscape division.  </P> <P> The Belches' most water-stingy plant is probably the lippia, a thick,  attractive ground cover with tiny white and purple flowers, Timmons said.  Instead of a thirsty lawn, lippias, which flourish in the desert, decorate the  entire front of the property.  </P> <P> Other drought-resistant plants in the garden include two Australian natives --  red flowers called kangaroo paws and 30-foot trees called melaleuca  leucadendra, which are related to the eucalyptus.  </P> <P> There are also alstroemerias -- South American native flowers with pink-purple  blooms -- and anisodontas, bushy plants with heart-shaped leaves and small  brown blossoms.  </P> <P> "It's not only beautiful, it's also easy to maintain," Pixie Belch said.  </P> <P> The Belches' landscaping was designed by Martin Fletcher, a Santa Barbara  landscape architect, and Mae Barnett, a vice president of Bay Colonies, a Santa  Barbara company that developed five homes in the Ojai neighborhood.  </P> <P> In another water-saving move, Bay Colonies also installed low-flow sprinkler  heads and a drip irrigation system.  </P> <P> Fletcher and Barnett will be honored with other contest winners at the  California Landscape Contractors Assn.'s Beautification Awards Banquet on  Friday at the Oxnard Lobster Trap Restaurant.  </P> <P> Other first-place division winners include William Worthington of Camarillo,  residential custom home landscape and best use of native plant materials; Sam  Williamson, superintendent, Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club Golf Course, large  turf area; Imre and Lisa Rozsa of Ojai, hillside planting in a native oak  setting.  </P> <P> In other categories, first-prize winners include Mary Strum of Ventura,  creative use of hardscape; the Casitas Municipal Water District, water  conservation demonstration garden, and Beada Gamulski of Ojai, best use of  cactus in a commercial landscape.

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping learners in their place THE sleek new designs and moulded bumpers of today's cars mean that learner drivers in the UK have a problem in safely attaching 'L' plates to their car  -and removing them when a qualified driver takes the wheel, as required by law. So Inventions, of Milton Keynes, has come up with a seven-inch rigid plastic case that resembles a compact disc box. On one half is printed the red 'L', on the other half are strong magnets that fix to the roof of the car while the 'L' stands perpendicular. Inventions: UK, 0296 728136.</p>

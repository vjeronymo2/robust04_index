			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS EARN NCAA SOCCER TITLE  </P> <P> Before the 1990 collegiate season began, UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid told a few  close coaching friends that his Bruins had enough talent to win another NCAA  Division I soccer championship.  </P> <P> Sunday, after 150 minutes of scoreless play that included four overtimes,  Schmid's premonition was fulfilled at the University of South Florida.  </P> <P> The Bruins beat Rutgers, 4-3, on penalty kicks to claim a second NCAA  championship. UCLA won the first time, 1-0, over American University in eight  five-minute overtimes in 1985.  </P> <P> The first NCAA tournament games decided by penalty kicks gave UCLA a title even  though the Bruins were scoreless in 270 minutes Saturday or Sunday. In  Saturday's semifinal against North Carolina State, UCLA won on penalty kicks,  5-3, after two scoreless overtimes.  </P> <P> Sunday, freshman Jorge Salcedo's penalty kick -- UCLA's fourth -- slid under  the cross bar, ending a 3-hour 20-minute match which degenerated as time went  on because of fatigue.  </P> <P> "I said we were a team of destiny, and you've got to be lucky to win anything  in a cup competition," Schmid said. "I don't want to see a lot more of those  (penalty-kick) games."  </P> <P> UCLA (19-1-4) and Rutgers (20-3-2) played give-and-take through the first 90  minutes, the Bruins taking control of the tempo after 25 minutes.  </P> <P> But Rutgers defended staunchly and used a little luck to push the game to  penalty kicks.  </P> <P> UCLA's Billy Thompson hit the post in the 84th minute, Joe Max-Moore missed  wide from eight yards in the 114th minute and Paul Ratcliffe watched as a  defender deflected what seemed a sure goal in the 137th minute.  </P> <P> Midfielder Alexi Lalas' header off the bar in the 105th minute was Rutgers'  only clear-cut chance.  </P> <P> In the end, penalty kicks were the only way to decide the game.  </P> <P> Shooting first, Lino DiCuollo of Rutgers scored, but UCLA's Sam George shot  weakly, with Rutgers' Bill Androcki saving.  </P> <P> Max-Moore scored in the second round to tie the kicks, 1-1, after Rutgers'  Steve Rammel missed wide. When Dave Mueller of Rutgers shot high and Tim  Gallegos of UCLA scored, the Bruins led 2-1.  </P> <P> Rutgers' Maurice Mazzocchi converted the fourth attempt, and UCLA's Chris  Henderson matched him, keeping the Bruins ahead 3-2.  </P> <P> Chris Beach kept Rutgers alive temporarily with a third conversion, leaving it  up to Salcedo.  </P> <P> There was never a doubt. The midfielder from Cerritos blasted a high,  right-center shot directly under the bar.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar gains on rate rise THE DOLLAR regained ground against the D-Mark yesterday after Sweden's central bank raised interest rates to 75 per cent to support the krona, writes James Blitz. However, in spite of the dollar's rise, pressure on sterling and the Italian lira remained intense in a very nervous market. In later American trading, the Bundesbank, UK Treasury and Bank of Italy were all forced to deny rumours that there would be a realignment of currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism or that either the pound or lira would be devalued. The extraordinary rise in the Bank of Sweden's marginal interest rate negated the effects of Finland's devaluation the day before. The Bank of Finland devalued the markka by 13 per cent on Tuesday, triggering large-scale selling of the Finnish currency and the Swedish krona, and the buying of D-Marks and Swiss francs. The Swedish authorities have pegged the krona to the Ecu to strengthen their application for EC membership, and they underlined the policy yesterday with the rise in rates. But they could do little more than staunch the selling of their currency: it ended slightly firmer at around SKr3.6580 to the D-Mark, against Tuesday's SKr3.6620. Sweden's move prompted some caution about the rise of the D-Mark and induced some dollar buying. After touching a low of DM1.3890 in American trading the night before, the dollar moved up to a high of DM1.4115 and closed in London at DM1.4110. In New York it finished yesterday at DM1.4140. European currencies were depressed against the D-Mark after the Bundesbank drained a surprisingly large amount of liquidity from the German money market, pushing rates close to the Lombard level and renewing fears of an interest rate rise. In later American trading, both the pound and the Italian lira came under renewed pressure after a Bundesbank source was quoted in the market as saying that the lira, peseta and sterling were all 'candidates for devaluation'. At one stage, the pound was trading at DM2.7808 and the lira at L765.0. The UK Treasury again issued a statement saying that no ERM currency was seeking a realignment, while the Bank of Italy said it would not devalue its currency. In London, the pound had closed unchanged at DM2.7875, while the lira finished at L763.2 per D-Mark, up from a previous close of L764.3. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency trading at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the Swedes would find it hard to resist devaluing at some stage. 'By devaluing the Finnish markka by so much over the last year, the Finns have gained significantly over Sweden in terms of exporting their forestry products,' he added.</p>

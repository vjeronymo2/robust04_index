			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bowater gains cheap finance from vendors BOWATER, the UK packaging and printing group which announced plans to acquire two specialist packaging companies for Pounds 444m on Monday, has agreed cheap financing from the vendors. The agreements are seen as a sign that the vendors were desperate to get rid of the companies concerned. Although the purchase of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging is to be financed mainly by a Pounds 333.5m rights issue, Bowater has agreed to borrow a total of about Pounds 200m at between 5 per cent and 6.3 per cent, which is well below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Bowater is paying Pembridge Investments Pounds 212m for DRG Packaging. At the same time, Societe de Banque Thomson, the French finance house which controls Pembridge Investments, has agreed to help finance the acquisition with a four-year Pounds 157m loan carrying an interest rate of 6.3 per cent. One of the parties involved in the deal - who asked not to be named  - said the low interest agreed on the loan financing was 'merely a way of covering up the fact that the vendor is making a loss on the sale of DRG.' Such financing by a vendor to assist with the sale of a company is not unusual, but the interest rate in this case is considered very low. Bowater is also buying Cope Allman for Pounds 232m, of which Pounds 200m will be used to pay off existing debt. The debts include loans of Pounds 100m to ADT, the security and car auction business which owns 49 per cent of Quoteplan, Cope Allman's vendor. As part of the deal, Bowater will receive a Pounds 50m five-year loan at 5 per cent from ADT Finance BV, a company which is associated with the vendor.</p>

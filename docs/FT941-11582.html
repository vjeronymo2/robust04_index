			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Viacom edges ahead in Dollars 10bn Paramount battle Viacom, the cable television group, yesterday appeared to take a lead over rival QVC Network as their Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, entered what may be its final phase. Both bidders slightly improved their offers for Paramount on Tuesday night, the date set by Paramount board for final bids. Viacom was widely viewed on Wall Street yesterday as offering slightly more attractive terms, although analysts cautioned that the offers were very close. However, the perception that QVC was the more likely to lose helped lift its stock Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 3/4 , while Viacom's B shares dropped Dollars  1/3 to Dollars 33 1/2 . Wall Street thinks both are over-paying, and the market punishes whichever stock looks like winning. Paramount, meanwhile, reinforced the belief that its financial performance is deteriorating by announcing yesterday that it expected a net loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m in its third quarter. Paramount shares dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 . Paramount's board is expected to meet on Friday to consider the new bids, and shareholders have until February 14 to decide. If neither side wins more than 50 per cent of Paramount's stock by then, the five-month battle will grind on until a victor emerges. Viacom's new bid leaves unchanged its offer of Dollars 107 a share in cash for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock, but improves the value of the securities offered for the remaining 49.9 per cent. Analysts estimated the combined value of its cash and stock offering at around Dollars 83 to Dollars 84 a share. QVC increased the cash in its offer from Dollars 92 a share to Dollars 104, but simultaneously lowered the value of the securities element, leaving the overall value of its bid at around Dollars 86 to Dollars 87 a share. Some Dollars 500m of the Dollars 750m needed to boost its cash bid is coming from BellSouth, the Baby Bell telephone company, which is buying a further tranche of QVC stock. Analysts said that while Viacom's bid was slightly lower in apparent value, investors might prefer it because it offered a little more cash and a guarantee to pay up to Dollars 12 a share to stockholders if its 'B' shares trade below Dollars 48 in the year after a Paramount takeover.

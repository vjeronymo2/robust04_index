			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TAX FREEDOM DAY MARKS THE END OF UNCLE SAM'S CUT  </P> <P> Tax Freedom Day for 1989 arrived today, which means starting Friday an average  American worker can keep all earnings made during the rest of this year free of  federal, state and local government taxes.  </P> <P> Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, said it took  the average American worker 124 days -- from Jan. 1 to May 4 -- to satisfy this  year's tax obligations, assuming every dollar in the paycheck was allocated for  the various taxes.  </P> <P> The good news is that the 124-day tax bite period has remained unchanged in the  last three years.  </P> <P> By comparison, in 1950 it took the average worker only until April 3, or 93  days, to satisfy the tax obligations. Since then the tax-bite period has grown  steadily.  </P> <P> Stated differently, the foundation said taxes will take a 2-hour, 43-minute  bite from the worker's eight-hour earnings in 1989.  </P> <P> The foundation report said the total tax bite from the workday is far ahead of  the next most costly item, housing and household operations, which will take  away 1 hour and 25 minutes of the wages.  </P></p>

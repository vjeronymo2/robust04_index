			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES CITY CENTER PLAN  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks City Council has approved a $55.6-million budget to convert a  former animal theme park called Jungleland into a new city government center,  launching one of the largest and most controversial redevelopment projects in  the city.  </P> <P> The budget -- twice the amount estimated by city officials four years ago --  includes funds for a new civic center, City Hall, theater, civic auditorium and  five-acre park.  </P> <P> According to Mayor Alex Fiore, the primary cause of the dramatic budget  increase from the $28-million estimate made in 1986 is the addition of a  $12-million government center and $3.3-million auditorium for the City Council  itself.  </P> <P> The council also voted on Tuesday night to pay an estimated $2.4 million to a  management company to oversee the project over the next three years.  </P> <P> Construction of the center is expected to start in May, 1991, with completion  expected in August, 1993.  </P> <P> The center will be located on a 20-acre site at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and  Conejo School Road.

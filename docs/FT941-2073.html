			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Three accused of insider trading The first test of the Netherlands' 1989 insider-trading law began yesterday with the trial in Amsterdam of three Dutch investors and a brokerage house. The defendants - Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen, Mr Eric Albada Jelgersma and Mr Leon Melchior - sold more than 4m shares in HCS, a computer company in which they were the main private shareholders, on July 31, 1991, the morning after they had met the company's bankers to discuss a Fl 127.5m rescue plan. Prosecutors say the shares were sold to depress HCS's share price in the expectation that the lower price would be used several days later to fix the price of a private share placement in which the three would participate. The defendants deny that a firm decision had been taken on the private placement. HCS, which later launched a rights issue, was declared bankrupt in 1992.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Deadline extended for Buckingham bid At the request of the independent directors of Buckingham International, the hotels and nursing homes group, the Takeover Panel has extended the deadline by which Jemma Trust and Naaz Holdings must make mandatory offers for the company. In December the Panel ruled that Jemma and Naaz were acting in concert in Buckingham shares and that an offer at 2.75p per ordinary share and an appropriate offer for the secured convertible loan stock 1995 of Buckingham were to be made by February 28 1993. The Buckingham directors anticipate that the offers, together with the advice of the independent direc-tors, will be announced by March 5.</p>

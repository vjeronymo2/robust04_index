			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Portugal bourses given options plan Portugal's stock exchange commission (CMVM) yesterday proposed a restructuring of the country's two bourses as part of plans to create a futures and options market. The CMVM aims to reconcile opposing bids by the rival Lisbon and Oporto bourses to set up a national derivatives exchange. Mr Fernando de Costa Lima, CMVM president, said the commission proposed replacing the spot market in Oporto with a futures and options exchange and developing a national spot market in Lisbon. The Lisbon and Oporto bourses compete with separate spot markets although more than 150 of the most liquid shares are quoted on a national continuous market for which Lisbon and Oporto act as separate trading floors. Last year, the two exchanges presented rival projects for a futures and options market. Mr Costa Lima said the two bourses should overcome their differences and co-operate in building two national markets for spot and derivative operations. He made the proposals with the backing of Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portugal's finance minister. Ms Graca Carvalho, an analyst with Totta Dealer, welcomed the proposals as a means to end competition between Lisbon and Oporto for the same small market. She said the Oporto exchange was better equipped to handle a derivatives market but Lisbon was unlikely to welcome the new market going to its rival. There was no reaction from the two bourses. Many analysts believe Portugal's capital market needs to develop greater liquidity and transparency before a futures and options market would be successful. However, Ms Carvalho said the new market would help generate more liquidity. The average daily volume of share trading in Lisbon is Es2bn (Dollars 11.4m), some 10 times higher than it was 18 months ago.</p>

At the splendid ceremonies, President 'Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in the course of remarks, described the  reasons for the victory of the revolution and the survival of  the Islamic Revolution. [passage omitted]    Hojjat ol-Eslam Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni also spoke about the  special characteristics of Imam Khomeyni.    Our correspondent Ruhani-Nezhad reports on the president's  speech at these ceremonies.    [Ruhani-Nezhad] In his speech Hashemi-Rafsanjani honored the  memory of his eminence, the imam [Khomeyni] -- may his soul be  admitted to paradise -- the founder of the Islamic Revolution of  Iran, and praised the epic-makings and self-sacrifices of Iran's  revolutionary people. He described the Ten Days of Dawn as the  real feast of Iran's Muslim nation and all the deprived Muslims  of the world. He said: During the blessed Ten Days of Dawn,  the Almighty's blessings and favors were displayed in a manner  never before seen during the length of our history, in all their  glory and greatness. The president pointed to the factors  making for the victory of this great development during the  current century and noted that the life-giving Islamic doctrine  and the important principle of the velayat-e faqih and  leadership were the most important factors in achieving victory.  He said: With the passing of incidents, events, and the trend  of the Islamic Revolution, this fact has been proven that  motivation by a doctrine, people's belief in Islam, and  society's full confidence and trust in the leadership, not only  led this great movement to victory but also played an important  role in its preservation, survival, and continuation until today.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The destiny-making and important  events following the victory of the Islamic Revolution, that is,  the imposed war, the economic boycott and many other plots, each  of which could have left an impact on the Revolution's  direction, were all foiled and rendered ineffective, thanks to  the virtuous leadership of his holiness the imam -- may his soul  be admitted to paradise -- and the rational measures of his  eminence, Ayatollah Khamene'i, respected leader of the Islamic  Revolution, and the extensive and enthusiastic presence of the  people on all the arenas of the Revolution.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized: In order to strengthen and  stabilize the Islamic system all the more and to strengthen  economic development and completely cut our ties of dependence,  we should fully follow the eminent leader of the revolution and  be present on the scene to defend the aspirations and valuable  heritage that was passed down to us by his holiness the imam.</p>

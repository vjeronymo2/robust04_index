			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Suchinda's honeymoon may end before it begins / Examining the problems already besetting Thailand's new government OPPOSITION parties have warned that there will be no honeymoon for the new Thai government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the former army commander. They are almost certainly right. An estimated 30,000 people, demonstrating on Monday in a central Bangkok plaza near both parliament and Supreme Command headquarters, applauded loudly as elected leaders from four opposition parties called for Gen Suchinda's resignation. Some of the speeches were uncommonly blunt. One speaker pointed out Gen Suchinda's dubious distinction of being the first of 19 prime ministers since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 to have been the target of demonstrations even before he made his first policy statement to parliament. Gen Suchinda was de facto leader of last year's coup, which led to a 13-month government led by an appointed civilian prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, whose administration was largely clean and competent. Now, following the March 22 general election in which Gen Suchinda did not stand, he is himself prime minister at the head of a government including many of the ministers he overthrew ostensibly because of their alleged corruption. Critics of the military say that the election, which saw widespread vote-buying, represented a second coup on the sly. Far from being a return to democracy, they say, the election became another step in the ascendancy of the group of officers known as Class 5, the fifth class to graduate from the military academy under the revised post-Second World War curriculum. Within the military, membership of a clique, usually based on a graduation class, can be all-important. And the consolidation of Class 5's power is probably unprecedented in recent history, even though rivalries within it cannot be ruled out. The staunchest critics warn that a third 'coup' would be possible if members of the government coalition demanded too much influence or money in return for their support. The precedent, they say, would be 1971, when the strongman of the day staged a coup 'against himself' to get rid of a troublesome parliament. This analysis is debatable because Thailand has changed. Unlike in the 1970s, Gen Suchinda has had to resign from the army. Public opinion forced the drafters of last year's constitution to drop a provision that would have allowed serving government officials to hold cabinet posts. Nevertheless, Class 5's strength is clear. Gen Suchinda has been replaced as army commander by his brother-in-law and former classmate, General Issarapong Noonpakdi, who was interior minister in the post-coup government. His successor is a Class 5 former air force officer, Air Chief Marshal Anan Kalintha. Gen Suchinda's successor as armed forces supreme commander is another Class 5 graduate, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, who played an important part in the creation of the pro-Class 5 party, Samakkhi Tham (Justice Unity), and in bringing together the five-party coalition that supports Gen Suchinda. When parliament convened for its first debate last Thursday, the opposition wore black to mourn the demise of democracy. Outside, a former member of parliament had been on hunger strike for a week. On Sunday, Bangkok's voters, in the election for the capital's governor, gave 88 per cent of their votes to two candidates representing anti-military parties. By Monday's mass public demonstration, the lone hunger striker had been joined by more than 40 others. Members of the five-party coalition supporting the new prime minister have been forced into a corner. In the general election campaign, they proclaimed their democratic principles by pledging that the leader of the largest party would head the government. This turned out to be Mr Narong Wongwan, who was immediately engulfed in controversy when it was revealed that last year he had been refused a visa to enter the US for allegedly being associated with drug smuggling. The coalition then chose Gen Suchinda and faced another round of criticism. Gen Suchinda had himself broken his pledge not to seek the premiership. Coalition members deny that their support is undemocratic, arguing that their 195 seats in the 360-seat House of Representatives allows them a mandate to support any prime minister as long as they do not violate the constitution. Some younger MPs considered to be among the more able members of the coalition have pleaded with the public to give the new government a chance. Gen Suchinda has repeatedly stressed that his priority is to make sure that the economy continues to be run properly in order to maintain investor-confidence and Thailand's position as one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The reappointment of an unelected technocrat finance minister, Dr Suthee Singhasaneh, and Gen Suchinda's choice of economic advisers suggest that fiscal and monetary caution will continue. Priorities are likely to remain the avoidance of inflation, balance of payments problems and excessive debt. Gen Suchinda has also announced that he will continue with the junta's declared objective of reducing corruption. However, the fact that he has been forced to appoint ministers with questionable backgrounds is seen as an indication of his limited bargaining power. Much will hinge on the discipline of the coalition parties; some factions disappointed by not gaining cabinet posts are already threatening trouble. Much will also depend on the behaviour and unity of Class 5. Questions are beginning to be raised concerning the ambitions and numerous family connections of the new army chief, Gen Issarapong. And Air Chief Marshal Kaset has made no secret of his own political ambitions. The air force chief also has numerous business interests, including chairing the boards of Thai Airways International and the company that imports Hyundai cars. When he took over as supreme commander he is reported to have pledged to continue the tasks begun by Gen Suchinda and to keep out of politics. One observer responded: 'Gen Suchinda had better watch his back.' The comment was a joke, based on Gen Suchinda's previous pledges to stay out of politics, but, still, it had the ring of truth as well.</p>

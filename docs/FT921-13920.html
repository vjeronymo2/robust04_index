			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: Pearl launches FSAVC Pearl Assurance has launched a free-standing Additional Voluntary Contribution contract. As explained in the Weekend FT last week, FSAVCs are similar to personal pensions but need to be taken out in addition to a company scheme. New business figures from life offices are showing that sales of AVCs were high last year. Pearl's Expectations FSAVC will invest in the main Pearl with-profits fund. This might be attractive for people near to retirement because of the relative security of with-profits funds compared with their unit-linked rivals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague/Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- The information  that the Czech Republic ranks sixth in international trade in  arms was challenged by Kamil Cermak, press spokesman for the  Trade and Industry Ministry, today. He called incorrect the  data by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  (SIPRI), according to which the Czech Republic had made a profit  of DM800 million [German marks] from military equipment exports  last year, the sixth largest in the world.    Cermak said that the Ministry had turned to SIPRI to explain  from where it had drawn the data on Czech arms exports and to  rectify the matter. He said that in 1993 the Czech Republic had  exported $167 million worth of weapons. In 1992, the last year  of the Czechoslovak Federation, the exports amounted to about  $150 million, particularly thanks to exports of Slovak-made  tanks and heavy weaponry.    About 80 percent of Czech exports is constituted by L-39  Albatross jet planes made by the Aero company. The rest are  artillery, hunting, and short fire arms, Cermak said. Czech  weapons are exported especially to third world countries which  comply with the legal terms of arms exports.    Reacting to the news about the Czech Republic's alleged  sixth  position among arms exporters, Eva Slavkovska, deputy chairman  of the Slovak National Party (SNS), said today that the armament  industry conversion in Czechoslovakia affected only Slovakia,  but "came" to the country from the Czech Republic. Because the  Slovaks had got caught by the Czechs' goal-orientated game, the  Czech Republic has now been profiting from arms exports, she  said.    Slavkovska pointed out that under the federation, when a  substantial part of the armament industry was concentrated in  Slovakia, Czechoslovakia had ranked seventh among world arms  exporters. The SNS was a coalition partner of the former  government of Vladimir Meciar.</p>

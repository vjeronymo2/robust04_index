			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EASTER AT DRIVE-IN;  </P> <P> WORSHIPERS PREFER THE INFORMALITY OF SERVICE ON WHEELS  </P> <P> It was Easter Sunday service with a difference. Worshipers waved to each other  from their cars, mostly late-model American sedans. In response to the  preacher, they honked their horns. Many tuned in to the sermon on their vehicle  radios, 540 on their AM dials. And, since this service was being held on the  site of a drive-in movie theater, others monitored the preachers' words on the  drive-in's speakers.  </P> <P> Afterward, they had the option of checking out the swap meet in the adjoining  parking lot or trading in their vehicles at any of the nearby dealerships.  </P> <P> "People don't want to get out of their cars, that's how this whole thing  started," Phyllis Mosier was explaining as she checked off the numbers of  vehicles attending Sunday's 9 a.m. service. "We had 58 cars the first Sunday  this month, 53 the second. We had 32 at our Easter sunrise services this  morning. It was beautiful. There must be another 50 or so cars here now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pulpit on Back of Truck  </P> <P> Since November, 1974, the Chula Vista Community Church has held Sunday services  in the parking lot of the Harbor Drive-In Theater, near the National City line,  at the south end of the celebrated "Mile of Cars," a seemingly endless series  of dealerships and signs. The minister preaches to his flock from a pulpit  fashioned in the back of a truck, a large cross providing the backdrop.  Microphones hook up his words with the drive-in's speaker system and with the  local radio station. Also amplified are religious tapes and music by the church  pianist, who sits in the church truck. On Sunday, pots of lilies festooned the  pulpit. The blank movie screen stood behind the site.  </P> <P> The vision of worshipers praying in their Chevrolets and Plymouths,  concentrating on a minister preaching from the back of a truck, is initially a  bit jarring for those who have long associated organized religious worship with  churches, temples and mosques, many lavishly designed and decorated. The  setting can lead to some clashing images: A recent drive-in marquee featured a  number of films, including a movie called "Unholy," above the sign advertising  the drive-in church services.  </P> <P> No matter. However bizarre it may appear, the drive-in worship concept is a  logical and fairly well-rooted extension of America's fascination with the  automobile (drive-in eateries, movies and funeral homes are long-established).  And it does have an allure for many -- and not only in Southern California,  where the notion seems almost emblematic. Such services have, in fact, been  held for some time at scattered sites throughout the nation. (At one Michigan  drive-in, a parishioner here noted, worshipers during winter months use  portable heaters hooked to the speaker poles.)  </P> <P> Why a drive-in church? A lot of reasons.  </P> <P> For one thing, many of the more than 100 or so worshipers each Sunday are  elderly, infirm or disabled; the drive-in ceremony is accessible. Others speak  of the ease of having their children in the back of the car and not having to  worry about them screaming and upsetting other worshipers, or finding baby  sitters. Smokers like being able to light up with their supplications.  </P> <P> For others, though, some of whom drive her from as far away as Riverside, there  are deeper reasons.  </P> <P> "Some people feel more comfortable; this has become their place," explained the  Rev. Paul Veenstra, senior pastor of the Chula Vista Community Church, who  performs the weekly service between ceremonies at the congregation's nearby  community church.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Linked to Crystal Cathedral  </P> <P> The Chula Vista church, of evangelical Christian beliefs, is a sister  institution to the Crystal Cathedral Ministry of Robert Schuller, the noted  "Hour of Power" televangelist who has also held such outdoor services. Rev.  Veenstra, who is committed to the drive-in concept, says his outdoor sermon is  the same as his in-church message, though he speaks of a special feeling among  the drive-in congregation.  </P> <P> Indeed, a congenial family atmosphere prevails at the service. The congregation  of 100-150 at the drive-in session is mostly white, although a number of black  families also attended. (The large area Latino population, mostly Roman  Catholic, was not in evidence at the drive-in service.) Young and old alike  were present.  </P> <P> Clearly, a need is filled. For those too intimidated or turned off to walk into  a church, the drive-in option provides a relatively non-threatening  alternative. Such services, says Rev. Veenstra, frequently serve as a kind of  half-way facility for worshipers "transitioning" back to church after being  away from organized religion for months or years. Many one-time churchgoers  become reacclimated here and later return to more standard worship.  </P> <P> But many others say they have no real interest in returning to the old way.  They're happy in their cars. While some park in the back of the lot and  studiously avoid fellow-churchgoers, preferring solitary contemplation, many  others mingle before services at a coffee table set up in front of the theater  concession stand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turn on Lights for Communion  </P> <P> Apart from its setting, the service resembles other Sunday offerings. As in  most churches, a collection is included; the usher goes car to car. On a  bimonthly basis, communion is also served. Those who want to receive the bread  are asked to illuminate their headlights. The minister also performs Baptisms  in front of the congregants.  </P> <P> "What better place to worship than in the outdoors, in God's own creation?"  asked John Van Ballegooijen, a genial retiree from the Midwest, who has been  attending Sunday drive-in services regularly almost since the concept took hold  here almost 15 years ago. Van Ballegooijen spoke as he fiddled with the speaker  system in a booth set up behind the pulpit in the truck.  </P> <P> Along with the convenience of not having to exit from one's car, there are also  other practical advantages. For instance, pets aren't welcome at most church  services. It's different here.  </P> <P> "I'd say we get a good half-dozen dogs here every Sunday," noted Phyllis  Mosier, the volunteer, who was going to car to car as her pet, Pretzel,  remained back in the car with her husband, Bob. (Occasional barks could be  heard during the hour-long service.) Mosier also plays her accordion on  Sundays.  </P> <P> Many drive-in aficionados spoke approvingly of the informality. Even on Easter  Sunday, a traditional time of strutting new outfits, many of those present wore  jeans.  </P> <P> "I have to wear a suit the rest of the week," said Ron Dellinger, a banker from  Chula Vista, who donned a leather jacket and open-neck shirt. "It's a more  relaxed atmosphere."  </P> <P> Children in attendance appear to appreciate the novelty and the ease of it all.  The church runs a Sunday school concurrent with the services. An Easter egg  hunt preceded services Sunday, sending youths scurrying about the parking lot  and projection building seeking the hidden eggs. In the summer, the Sunday  school sponsors "Jesus loves you" hikes in the parking lot.  </P> <P> "At least you don't have to sit on those hard church seats," noted Angel Perry,  10, dressed in pink for the occasion. "You're more comfortable. If it's  raining, you turn on the windshield wiper. If it's cold, you just put on the  heater."  </P> <P> Added Tiffany Smith, 9, also dressed in her Easter best: "You don't have to get  out of your car. If you like something, you don't have to clap. You just honk  your horn."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An ordinary session of the Council of Ministers  was held on 12 April 1994 under the chairmanship of Prime  Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko. [passage omitted]    The first point on the agenda concerned the state of  security  in the country from 6 to 10 April 1994, which the government  members noted was calm. However, they stressed that the  situation in Rwanda might have negative effects on security in  our country. The Council of Ministers urged all those concerned  to sit round the negotiation table. It also recommended that  everything be done to repatriate Burundian nationals residing in  Rwanda who wanted to come home.    The second point on the agenda was to evaluate the field  visits carried out by certain government members to Kirundo,  Bubanza, Karuzi, and Makamba provinces. The situation was  generally calm. Kirundo was experiencing the arrival en masse of  Rwandan refugees and of Burundians returning home. [passage  omitted]    Regarding preparations for the funeral of the head of state,  His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, and those of government  members recently deceased, the Council noted that preparations  were going smoothly. The Council of Ministers informed the  public that first, the bodies of the three late officials, His  Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, Minister Bernard Ciza, and  Minister Cypriaque Simbizi, had reached Bujumbura; second, as  early as today, 13 April, books of condolences will be available  at the Ministry of External Relations and Cooperation, at the  City Hall and at St.-Michel Church; third, on 15 April a  memorial service will be held at St.- Michel Church; fourth,  the funerals are scheduled for Saturday, 16 April 1994 at the  sites reserved for the martyrs of democracy. The Burundi  Government once again calls on the population to maintain peace  and security. This is the only way to honor the memory of our  dead officials.</p>

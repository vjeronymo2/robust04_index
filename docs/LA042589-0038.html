			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a post-crash high last week,  confirming new highs recorded previously by the transportation average and the  NASDAQ composite, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas  Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> "Ten of the 68 San Diego stocks we chart joined in the celebration and made new  highs," Katz said Monday.  </P> <P> Those new highs were by Humphrey, at $6, up from $3.25 at year's-end;  Christiana Cos., at $10.625, up from $6.35; Home Fed Corp., at $39, up from  $24.875; BSD Bancorp, at $6.375, up from $3.875; Southwest Bancorp, $6.125, up  from $3.875; Beeba's Creations, $10.75, up from $7.375; DH Technology, $9.625,  up from $5.625; Medical Imaging Centers, $8.75, up from $5.25; Psicor, $10.75,  up from $8.75, and Oak Industries, $1.375, up from $1.  </P> <P> Four of those gains were the result of last week's announcement of excellent  first-quarter earnings, Katz said. Humphrey reported earnings of $.21 versus a  $.02 loss a year earlier. BSD Bancorp reported earnings of $.21 versus $.14 the  year before. Home Fed reported $1.31 versus $1.07, DH Technology had earnings  of $.25 versus $.04, and Southwest Bancorp reported $.08 versus a 10-cent loss.  Most of Southwest's movement, however, was driven by its proposed merger with  Security Pacific at $6 a share.  </P> <P> Oak Industries' move was evidently related to the anticipated proxy fight to  unseat five of the eight board members at its June 6 annual meeting.  </P> <P> The largest percentage drop of the week was registered by Cousin's Home  Furnishings, whose stock finally reflected continuing annual losses, as the  stock dropped $.625 to close at $.875.  </P> <P> Yuba Natural Resources continues to remain unchanged despite former chairman  Richard Silberman's legal difficulties.  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric rose $.625, to $37.875, as its proposed merger  with Southern California Edison was approved by both companies' shareholders.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F> Franz-Olivier Giesbert -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Balladur. At the  end of the ministerial seminar, eight measures for economic  recovery and against unemployment have hit France. There was a  breath of optimism as well. Are you confident? Is our economy  getting better?    [Balladur] Yes, indeed. And a number of figures show this.  If you compare the situation ten months ago with what it is  today, a number of improvements have appeared. The budget  deficit is less than it was a few months ago, deficits in the  social service budgets are much smaller, the deficit of the  National Union for Industrial and Commercial Employment has been  reduced to zero, interest rates have gone down by 40 percent,  and -- more importantly -- we are gradually achieving growth,  still timorously, but we are achieving it, and this year it will  be positive. And finally, as far as unemployment is concerned,  things look less dark, since in the first six months of 1993  there were 200,000 more people unemployed, and in the second  [half of 1993] -- it is still a huge number -- there were  100,000 more, which is half as much, and this trend is being  confirmed.    [Giesbert] Do you have the figures?    [Balladur] I have the figures that are to be issued today:  In  December, unemployment went up by 4,300 rather than the average  of 30,000 which is what it was ten months ago. Of course, there  is still a long way to go. [passage omitted]    I am not happy with the situation. I do not find it  satisfactory either. This is why we decided yesterday to adopt  a number of measures to enable us to go further. [passage  omitted]    The French people are worried about the future -- and this  is  quite understandable. When there are more than three million  unemployed in a country, there is almost one in every family or  in a family they know well. So they are worried, and since they  are worried they save a lot and do not consume enough. So our  aim is to stimulate consumption, and that is why we adopted a  number of measures, in particular connected with the motor  industry and [words indistinct]. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Yesterday the government announced plans to pay  car owners 5,000 francs to trade in their vehicles for new ones.  You have thus given quite a helping hand to the motor industry  which is in a very bad way. You said that things are getting  better in some sectors, but they are not getting much better in  the motor industry.    [Balladur] No, indeed. The motor industry's turnover fell  greatly in 1993, and that is one of the reasons why the revival  of consumption must happen through the motor industry, as it  must happen through housing, too. [passage omitted]    The way I see things is that you have to encourage people to  consume more. This can be done by reducing interest rates, by  unfreezing workers' shares, by the measures we have taken over  housing, by the ones we are taking today over the motor  industry. In other words, nothing is ruled out of the area of  our work and of our efforts.    [Giesbert] You announced a decrease of 0.75 points in the  payment rates of building and loan savings plans, which is  currently six percent. That is not going to make you very  popular.    [Balladur] Excuse me, but this will reduce [the cost of]  loans given to families when they want to buy their home. The  two things are linked. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] There is a huge black spot: interest rates are  much too high. Isn't this the explanation for our (?100)  bankruptcies every day?    [Balladur] Not at all, not at all. The short term interest  rates were 11 percent when we came to power ten months ago, and  now they are less than seven percent. Long term interest rates  were 7.5, and on the whole they are now 5.5. Our rates are at  the same level as those of all the European countries, including  Great Britain -- without devaluation! This is a false problem.  The truth is that interest rates must go down further, but in a  natural way, because if we want to reduce them artificially, we  shall have a crisis at the end of which we will have to raise  them. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Do you expect to reduce income tax on households  next year?    [Balladur] We have already reduced it this year by 19  billion  [francs]. It will be reduced again next year.    [Giesbert] By how much?    [Balladur] I cannot tell you today, but by an amount that  will not be far off the same.    [Giesbert] A little bit of politics: It is often said that  you do not get on well with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.  Originally you said he was the best person to head the RPR-UDF  [Rally for the Republic-Union for French Democracy] list for the  European elections. Today you don't really seem to want this.  Why?    [Balladur] First, I get on well with all the ministers. I  chose them, and if I chose them it was because I knew we could  work well together. This applies to all of them, including the  minister of foreign affairs, who is carrying out his job and his  mission very well. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the upper house of the Russian  parliament said the meeting between the heads of parliament of  Armenia and Azerbaijan, due to take place in the Kyrgyzstan  capital Bishkek on 3-6 May, offered a chance to resolve the  issue of Azerbaijan's disputed Armenian-speaking enclave of  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek on Monday and the  same day signed an interparliamentary agreement with the head of  Kyrgyzstan's legislature, Meditkan Sherimkulov, said Azerbaijan  had recently stated readiness to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as  "one of the parties to the conflict." This is a "major step  forward" in the negotiation process, Shumeyko said.    He said a peace mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly  of  the Commonwealth of Independent States "has done a good deal" to  achieve peace in the embattled enclave. "We will be working as  much as necessary for the settlement of the conflict in  Nagorno-Karabakh," he said.</p>

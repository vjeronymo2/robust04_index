			<p>BFN     [Text] State Secretary of the self-proclaimed  Transdniestrian Republic, Valeriy Litskay, was satisfied with  the fact that the Moldovan parliament had ratified the agreement  within the scope of the CIS and the Economic Union. He  suggested in an interview with INTERFAX that this would help  renew the talks between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol at a  completely new level.    The Gagauz leaders shared this opinion. They approved of the  ratification of the agreement by the Moldovan parliament at the  session of the Gagauz parliament in Kamrat today.    President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic, Stepan  Topal, said in an interview with INTERFAX on the telephone that  the Gagauz leaders had been seeking ratification of these  documents for the last two years. He suggested that the  Agrarian Democratic Party and the Socialist party currently in  power in Moldova and their moves, including the agreement's  ratification, had laid a good foundation for the renewal of the  Moldovan-Gagauz talks at a new level.    The Gagauz parliament approved the activities by the  commission for renewal of the talks with Kishinev on the status  of the regions with a largely Gagauz population and recommended  that the commission work even more energetically.</p>

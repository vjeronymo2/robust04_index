			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The Japan Securities Dealers  Association has named Sadakane Doi, chairman of Daiwa Securities  Co., as its next chairman, current association head Masaru  Aratani said Tuesday [10 May]. Doi is to assume the two  year-term chairmanship on July 1, Aratani told reporters.    It will be the first time since a series of stock scandals  in  1991 for an official from one of the "big four" brokerage houses  to head the securities industry organization. Before the  scandals, involving payments of loss compensation by brokerages  to big customers after the collapse of the "bubble economy," the  big four -- Nomura, Nikko, Yamaichi and Daiwa Securities  Companies -- customarily took turns to supply the association's  chief.    In line with the association's self-governing rule, Doi will  give up the rights to represent Daiwa, though he will remain the  brokerage's chairman when he becomes the association chief.    The Finance Ministry initially wanted a full-time chairman  of  the association, but the association argued that limits should  not be put on the post.    Giving up of the company representative rights by Doi is  viewed as a compromise between the ministry and the association.  The association will hold a general meeting on May 25 to change  its articles so Doi can assume the association's chairmanship  while remaining in his post at Daiwa.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CHRISTMAS CARD UNVEILED  </P> <P> This year's White House Christmas card depicts the snow-covered South Portico  of the presidential mansion decorated for Christmas.  </P> <P> The card is a reproduction of a watercolor by artist William T. Gemmell, who  has directed the White House's Office of Graphics and Calligraphy since 1977.  It is the first time that his art has been featured on a White House Christmas  card.  </P> <P> The scene shows the White House draped in greenery with a single wreath and red  bow hanging from the Truman Balcony. The White House Christmas tree is visible  through the windows of the Blue Room.  </P> <P> The message inside reads: "The President and Mrs. Bush extend their warmest  wishes that Christmas and the New Year will hold much happiness and peace for  you and those you love."  </P> <P> As many as 150,000 cards will be mailed during the next week, with the  Republican National Committee picking up the cost of printing and mailing. The  Reagans sent 125,000 cards last year.  </P> <P> Leslie Goodman, a committee spokeswoman, said it is not known how much the card  mailing will cost. "We don't know until the bills come in. That's about a month  from now," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Book Review: Powerful threat of German weakness GERMANY AND EUROPE: The Crisis of Unity By David Marsh William Heinemann, 236 pages, Pounds 17.99 Published in German as Der zaudernde Riese: Deutschland in Europa, C. Bertelsmann, 256 pages, DM39.80 German politicians, particularly Chancellor Helmut Kohl, grossly underestimated the problems of transforming East Germany, and then made the task harder still through misjudged policies, argues David Marsh in his book on Germany and Europe. In a shrewd and imaginative analysis of the impact of unity, Marsh develops a persuasive underlying thesis - the main threat to Europe comes not from German strength but from German weakness. As Financial Times Bonn correspondent from 1986 to 1991 and European editor since 1991, Marsh witnessed German unification and the hesitant moves towards greater European unity at first hand. The author provides a powerful account of how the decisiveness with which Kohl seized the opportunity to merge the two Germanys politically deserted him when it came to economic union. In 1990, Kohl talked of 'flourishing landscapes' in the east within three or four years, and promised unity without pain - 'no one will be worse off'. The reality was different. The combination of monetary union at a one-to-one rate, instant membership of the European Community, unrealistic wage rises and the shrinkage of eastern markets led to the almost immediate collapse of east German industry. Economist Holger Schmieding described the impact on east Germany as 'probably the greatest economic crisis ever to befall an advanced industrial economy in peace time', with a spectacular fall in output and employment. Marsh describes how Kohl decided on immediate union overnight and then forgot to, or decided not to, inform the Bundesbank. 'Seldom in the field of economic history had a step of such consequence been prepared with so little forethought.' Against the advice of Karl Otto Pohl, then Bundesbank president, the government went for a one-to-one conversion rate 'which gave 16m east Germans the opportunity to satisfy their pent-up yearning for western consumer goods, but simultaneously stripped them of the means to earn the future incomes necessary to pay the bill'. Disastrously, Kohl and his coalition government promised west Germans that unification could be achieved without tax increases. When east German industry collapsed, annual public transfers of DM150bn were needed from the west to prop up income and consumption. This was largely financed by borrowing (though, after the election, taxes were also increased) - so much so that the public sector borrowing requirement soared from 1 per cent of west German gross domestic product to 7 per cent in 1994. This was not the only consequence of the failure to put the financing of unification on a proper footing. The Bundesbank - taking, as required by law, a strict view of its anti-inflationary responsibility - increased interest rates three times in 1992 and again in July 1993. The west German economy, the growing uncompetitiveness of which had been disguised by an immediate consumption splurge, was plunged into a deep recession. Marsh shows how the Bundesbank's tough policies, which may have been necessary for Germany, fed through into other European economies where they were inappropriate. High German interest rates prolonged European recession and led to two exchange rate crises which weakened the European Monetary System and delayed further the goal of European monetary union. Marsh records a revealing telephone conversation that took place in October 1990 between John Major, at that time UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Pohl before Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank made it clear that it thought sterling was overvalued at DM2.95. Major replied that Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, insisted on going in at that rate. The author's judgment on Maastricht was that it was an understandable attempt, led by the French and enthusiastically supported by Kohl, to bind the new unified Germany into a 'European framework to make, in Thomas Mann's phrase, 'a European Germany not a German Europe' '. But because unification proved so much more difficult a task and had a much greater impact on the rest of Europe than most European politicians had believed, it was undermined almost from the start. Marsh argues that 'Europe will not be united until Germany is united', and that Germany should concentrate on making a success of unification. The author presents a relatively optimistic scenario for the future. The German system of corporate and social consensus will adapt itself to necessary economic and industrial change. Self-sustaining growth will begin in east Germany. The European Union, led by Germany, will shift its focus to the eastern half of Europe and prepare to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Plans for European economic and monetary union will be postponed, although a D-Mark zone will emerge with the prospect of a single currency in the form of the D-Mark. 'A prerequisite for an effective and self-confident Europe is an effective and self-confident Germany with the ability to set the EC agenda along with its main European partners, France and Britain,' the author concludes. But how is that to come about if Germany is so preoccupied with its internal problems, if France resents German leadership, and if Britain continues with its traditional posture of continental reluctance? Maybe that is the subject for another book. The reviewer is Labour MP for Durham North. His own book on post-unification Germany will be published next year</p>

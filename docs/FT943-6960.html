			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Lockheed barred from exporting Hercules: Decision raises doubts over Pounds 1bn tender to supply RAF Lockheed, the US aerospace company, has been barred indefinitely from exporting its C-130 Hercules aircraft by the US State Department, raising doubts about the company's Pounds 1bn bid to supply the UK with replacement transport aircraft. The company is accused of breaching the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing foreign officials on previous contracts. Lockheed is attempting to sell 30 of the latest-generation C-130J aircraft to Britain and 12 similar transporters to Australia. The ban, revealed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, was imposed by the State Department on August 18. It follows the indictment in June on bribery charges of two Lockheed executives and the company's Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company (LASC) subsidiary, which makes the Hercules transporter and the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. The scandal comes during a battle over the UK transporter order between Lockheed and a group led by British Aerospace, which wants the Royal Air Force to buy a European alternative. Lockheed already has export licences for the UK deal, but the political sensitivity of the issue would make any conviction embarrassing. The Ministry of Defence had hoped to make a decision before the end of the year. The C-130J is due to be in service by 1996. The company is accused of paying an Egyptian politician, Ms Leila Takla, Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) to help secure an order for three Hercules aircraft five years ago. It denies the allegations and is contesting the court case. The two executives accused are Mr Allen Love, formerly LASC's director of Middle East and North African sales, and Mr Suleiman Nassar, a Lockheed regional vice-president who operated from Geneva and is being sought by investigators. If convicted, Lockheed faces an indefinite ban on exports from its LASC subsidiary until it can satisfy the State Department that practices have been improved. Export licences granted before the June 22 indictment still stand, and the company can appeal on a case-by-case basis for any ban to be lifted. Licences for potential UK and Australian exports should be unaffected by the court case, according to the company. Even so, any conviction would raise the political stakes in the UK of deciding to buy a US rather than a European made transporter. In a separate report, the US Air Force said that the C-130J would be five months late and would be Dollars 200m over-budget. A Lockheed spokesman said the company was happy with its estimates.</p>

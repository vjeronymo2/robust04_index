			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Azerbaijani Defense Ministry communique issued on </F> 17 January; read by announcer]    [Text] The Armenian military units launched an attack  against the Fizuli sector of the front line at 0100 today.  Azerbaijan's military forces counterattacked and forced the  enemy units to retreat to their positions, after suffering  several casualties.    According to the information received from the occupied  areas, the Armenian military command has involved the militia  units in the fighting to achieve its occupationist objectives in  Khankendi [formerly Stepanakert] and the other occupied areas in  Azerbaijan.    Meanwhile, helicopters continue to urgently transfer  reinforcements and military equipment from Armenia to Daghlyk  Karabakh. They transfer the wounded Armenians back to Armenia  after unloading their cargo. The dead bodies of Armenian  conscripts from Armenia are transferred in trucks from Daghlyk  Karabakh to that Republic through the Lachin corridor every day.    More than 1,000 enemy troops have been killed in the recent  clashes. That has been concealed from the Armenian people. It  seems that the dissemination of such reports will not be in the  interest of Armenia's leading circles and those who wage the  bloody war.</p>

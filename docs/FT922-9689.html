			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Two face Pounds 30m cheque trick charge TWO businessmen were yesterday alleged to have used a solvent to remove the details on two cheques and to have inserted the names of new payees and inflated their value from Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 to Pounds 15m each. Southwark Crown Court in London was told that Mr Jabinder Singh Bedesha and Mr Gurvinder Chopra planned to present the drafts at the Saudi Arabian Bank in Saudi Arabia. Mr John Mcguinness, prosecuting, said the two thought they had recruited a crooked manager at the bank, a Mr Nazeem, for a promised Pounds 6m cut. In the event, Mr Nazeem turned out to be an undercover police officer. Mr Bedesha, a director of a clothing wholesalers, from Ilford, Essex, denies conspiring to use a false instrument.

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Revamp costs hit Johnson Cleaners Johnson Group Cleaners, the largest dry cleaners in the US and the UK, yesterday warned that profits would be hit by a Pounds 2.4m charge to pay for a reorganisation of its British operations. The announcement follows the company's warning in August that full year profits were expected to fall in 1994. Difficulties in both dry cleaning and textile rentals led analysts to rein in profits estimates at the time from Pounds 18m to Pounds 17m. Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said yesterday's statement was not a profits warning. It was instead a positive step to enable the company to 'improve a lot faster', he said. 'We are confident that all the steps we are taking will have a positive effect on trading next year.' The reorganisation would mean the loss of up to 100 jobs, including some senior managers. Johnson would also step up the closure of 50 marginal dry cleaning shops. The actions would result in savings of about Pounds 500,000 a year, Mr Greer said. From the beginning of next year, Johnson's textile rentals and dry cleaning businesses would be run as separate companies. Managing directors have been appointed to both divisions and the textile rental business would trade under the name Apparelmaster UK. Johnson is the fourth largest garment rental operator in the UK. A specialised and focused management would allow the businesses to respond more quickly to pressures and opportunities, said Mr Greer. 'We would like to expand by acquisition again and this way we will be able to do so much more quickly.' Mr Greer said trading in the dry cleaning business had not improved since the warning in August. On a brighter note, 'steps have been taken recently to reduce the overhead costs of the lossmaking franchise dry cleaning business in the US,' he said. 'It is expected that this business will break even in 1995.' Analysts have estimated that the US franchise business had been losing about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year. The shares closed up 1p at 256p.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise bought Relief that there were no unpleasant surprises in Enterprise Oil's interim results, and a growing feeling that the stock had been oversold since the unsuccessful bid for Lasmo, triggered a burst of strength in Enterprise shares. The stock price forged ahead 13 to 400p, the best performance in the FT-SE 100 Index, after keen turnover of 3.6m shares. Smith New Court was said to have been an aggressive buyer, with Mr Chris Grudniewicz, oil specialist at Smith, saying 'the shares are cheap under 400p'. Mr Grudniewicz said the shares had underperformed the market by 10 per cent over the past month and 'all the bad news is already in the price'. He cautioned that the market remained concerned on two issues - corporate governance and the failed bid for Lasmo. Enterprise retains a near 10 per cent stake in Lasmo; the latter rose 2 1/2 to 159p. British Gas was one of the few FT-SE 100 stocks to remain in positive territory throughout a difficult trading session, the shares being lifted by news that the group was maintaining its interim dividend. They closed 3 higher at 298p on turnover of 11m shares. 'There was relief about the dividend and the underlying earnings figures were better than expected,' noted one analyst. He said the company is to hold a presentation to analysts on September 29 to outline its broad strategy. Comments to analysts from Glaxo that it had no immediate expansion plans in the US refocused attention on the UK takeover targets Wellcome and Zeneca. Wellcome, also feeling the effects of a good reception to its new anti-migraine treatment, gained 13 at 696p. Zeneca, which announced that it had set up the potential to borrow up to Dollars 750m in the US, moved ahead 16 to 838p. However, turnover was not excessive and the rise was exacerbated by a shortage of stock in the market. Fisons, another perennial target, put on 1 1/2 at 154p. Cable and Wireless dropped 9 to 430p on very heavy turnover of 9m shares following talk in the market that Cazenove, C&amp;W's own stockbroker, had downgraded its earnings estimates for the group. Cazenove has a policy of not commenting on client business. C&amp;W announced that it was cutting prices on its business tariff for its One-to-One mobile phone service. The latest price war in cellular phones also impacted on BT, which eased 1 1/2 to 394 1/2 p, and Vodafone, 3 cheaper at 202 1/2 p. Hanson was a beneficiary of BTR's bad news, with one leading broker recommending a switch into Hanson, whose shares closed only 2 easier at 248p after heavy turnover of 9m following massive dividend washing in the US on Wednesday night. Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, dipped on concern over future sales growth and competition from own brand drinks. The shares lost 4 at 468p in spite of 10 per cent underlying profits growth and 12 per cent margins - above the average for the sector. Supporter Mr Carl Short of SGST said the market had taken a 'churlish view of a strong performance' and upgraded his full-year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 483m. Property group MEPC dropped 12 to 432p following negative comment. Agency broker James Capel shaved sector forecasts yesterday, including MEPC's, and Smith New Court cut profits estimates on Wednesday. Paper company Arjo Wiggins Appleton put on 8 at 287p after better than expected half-year results and a confident statement. Arjo announced profits of Pounds 105.1m, against Pounds 63m previously and market forecasts of Pounds 78m to Pounds 87m. David S. Smith moved forward 12 to 560p after a very confident presentation at its annual meeting. Publishing group Emap eased 2 to 416p after announcing a one-for-eight rights issue at 360p a share to raise Pounds 77m to halve its debt and ready itself for acquisition opportunities. Manweb outpaced the other regional electricity stocks, the shares closing 4 higher at 866p after the group said it had bought in a further 1.5m shares at 870p. Other statistics, Page 37</p>

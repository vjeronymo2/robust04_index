			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / High-tech future for rustic town THE SMALL town of Kington in Hereford &amp; Worcester is to become the 'high-tech' rural community of the future. It has been selected for a national pilot scheme to study the impact that state-of-the-art technology can have on the economic and social fabric of small towns and villages. The Kington Connected Community project will be sponsored by the government and private and public-sector partners. It will be monitored over a 12-month period by the Henley Centre, the social and economic research company. Kington, close to the Welsh border, has a population of 2,200 and serves an agricultural area of 150 square miles. During the next few months it will receive communications and computer equipment worth more than Pounds 250,000, as well as financial support to establish a 'telecentre' and provide training for business and computing skills. The Department of Trade and Industry, British Telecommunications, Apple Computer and the Rural Development Commission are the lead partners in the pilot scheme, which was awarded to Kington after competitive bids from a number of other towns. Kington will be equipped with a 'telecentre' and a 'town area network'. The 'telecentre' will contain about 15 Apple computers, plus high-speed data links, teleconferencing facilities, and software for a wide range of established and start-up businesses. Kington's businesses, schools, clubs, tourist information office and shops will be offered equipment linked to a local telecommunications network. This will be upgraded by a connection to BT's ISDN2 service to give enhanced data-transfer capacity. Projects planned range from providing a common administrative back-up system for five local primary schools to the provision of a single stock-control system for a chain of three sports shops run from the town. Mr Miles Swinburne, a local construction manager who helped put together Kington's bid, said: 'People can see the writing on the wall for communities like ours, and they want to use modern communications to do something about it.' The aim, he said, was to protect existing community activities and attract new businesses to the town. 'We don't only want 'teleworkers' who want to work from the country, but small high-tech companies run by people brought up in the area but who have been sucked into the south-east because of the perception of remoteness and inadequate communications,' he said.</p>

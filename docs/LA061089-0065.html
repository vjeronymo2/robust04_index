			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSHA ORDERED TO REVIEW FORMALDEHYDE CANCER RISK  </P> <P> A federal appeals court Friday ordered the Labor Department to reconsider the  cancer risk from exposure to formaldehyde and its decision not to guarantee  full wages to workers disabled by the gas.  </P> <P> The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington said the department's Occupational  Safety and Health Administration "has failed adequately to explain" its finding  that the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde was not  significant if employers complied with OSHA's exposure limits.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel also concluded that OSHA offered a "feeble" explanation  of its decision not to include in its standard for formaldehyde exposure  provisions guaranteeing that workers will be paid full wages and retain  seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illness linked to the  substance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Annual Exams Not Required  </P> <P> The court, ruling in a suit filed by three unions, upheld OSHA's decision not  to require employers to provide annual medical examinations to workers exposed  to formaldehyde, a colorless gas that, when mixed with other materials, has a  number of applications in industry and is found in many construction and  consumer products.  </P> <P> Also upheld was the OSHA-set exposure "action level" at which employers are  required to provide workers with training, protective clothing and other  protective measures. The unions failed to show that lowering that level would  significantly enhance worker safety, the court said.  </P> <P> An OSHA spokesman said agency officials had not reviewed the decision and had  no immediate comment.  </P> <P> OSHA, revising a 1972 standard, in 1987 set a maximum permissible exposure  level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during an eight-hour workday and  set the action level at 0.5 p.p.m.  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers and the  International Molders and Allied Workers unions challenged the standard, saying  OSHA should have set a far more stringent exposure limit.  </P> <P> The court, in remanding to the Labor Department the question of cancer risk,  questioned the formula used by the department to extrapolate the cancer risk to  humans from the risk found in animal studies.  </P></p>

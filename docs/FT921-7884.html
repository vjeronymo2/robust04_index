			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Latin America's new-found allure - The recent rush of private capital to the region Flows of private capital into Latin America tripled last year to more than Dollars 40bn, eight times the 1989 level, according to research published this week by Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. The research, which concentrates on five countries - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela - indicates that the types of inflows have become more diversified among bonds, equities, country funds and direct foreign investment. The 1991 inflows included a substantial repatriation of flight capital, funds previously placed abroad by Latin American residents. The 1991 inflow generated nearly three times the funds necessary to finance the deficits on the countries' trade in goods and services, and helped to boost foreign exchange reserves by Dollars 15bn. Salomon's emerging markets group calculated that bond issues, private placement, commercial paper and certificates of deposit together accounted for Dollars 11.7bn of the total, and direct foreign investment accounted for Dollars 13.9bn. American Depositary Receipts - bundles of shares packaged to suit US investors - and country funds together accounted for Dollars 6.4bn. Investment flows were encouraged by lower interest rates and the recession in the US and Europe which contrasted with high growth rates and relatively high domestic interest rates in Latin America. 'More importantly, Latin American economies are becoming more productive and internationally competitive. The overall economic outlook and investment opportunities in the region have improved with declining inflation levels, positive GDP growth rates, reduced fiscal deficits, privatisation of state owned enterprises and movement away from protected markets,' it said. New trade policies, including negotiations between the US, Mexico and Canada over a free trade agreement, were also significant. It described as surprising the ability of countries such as Argentina and Brazil to raise capital in the international bond markets while remaining in substantial arrears on their debt to commercial banks. Capital flows to Argentina were 10 times higher in 1991 at Dollars 5.1bn, than in 1990, while inflows to Brazil were 20 times greater at Dollars 11.6bn. Inflows to Mexico nearly doubled to Dollars 16.1bn. In the case of Venezuela, they increased from Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 4.8bn. Inflows to Chile fell to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 2.0bn, due mainly to the end of the country's debt for equity conversion programme. The research identifies a number of 'noteworthy' trends: A large proportion of the capital flowing into Latin America was short-term and attracted mainly by local interest rates significantly higher than in the US. All countries but Brazil registered solid growth rates in 1991, while growth for all countries save Brazil is projected to exceed 5 per cent this year. Average growth in gross domestic product (GDP) across the region translated into per-capita growth of 0.9 per cent, reversing a eight-year trend of declining GDP per capita. Inflation also dropped sharply. Privatisation initiatives have gained momentum, attracting debt, foreign investment and a reduction in domestic, and to a smaller extent, commercial bank debt. Brazil has raised Dollars 1.6bn after its programme finally began last October, and hopes to raise Dollars 18bn over three years. In Argentina, all the main industries will be outside state control by the end of this year. Mexico raised Dollars 7.2bn in 1991 from the privatisation of nine banks alone; a further nine are due for privatisation in the first half of this year. Venezuela raised Dollars 1.9bn from the sale of a 40 per cent stake in its state telephone company late last year. Non-bank institutional investors became significant investors in the region in 1991, while the volume of repatriated flight capital rose considerably. With an estimated Dollars 200bn of flight capital leaving Latin America over the past two decades, some observers think that more than half of the capital now entering Latin America is from Latin American investors. Mexico estimated returning flight capital at close to Dollars 5.5bn in 1991. Regional investment funds now total some Dollars 800m. Direct foreign investment in Mexico amounted to more than Dollars 5bn, in Brazil to Dollars 1.3bn and in Chile to more than Dollars 1bn. Four of the top performing markets in 1991 were in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Brazil. Market capitalisation of these countries has climbed dramatically: Mexico's grew from Dollars 33bn at the end of 1990 to Dollars 83bn at end-October 1991. Although most capital was short-term in nature, some countries, in particular Mexico and Chile, began to attract longer-term capital. The resurgence of economic growth and the prospects for numerous free trade agreements with the US have led to a number of joint ventures between Latin American and US and European companies. Some multinationals are directly acquiring stakes in Latin American companies - such as the Dollars 320m purchase by PepsiCo of 70 per cent of Empresas Gamesa. 'As in western Europe we expect the formation of strategic alliances to be an increasingly important element of capital flows to the region during the 1990s,' the report concludes.  ------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL FLOWS TO LATIN AMERICA 1989-1991 (USDOLLARS M)  -------------------------------------------------------------                1989      1990      % of      1991      % of                                     GDP                 GDP  ------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina    1,400.5    521.5       0.8     5,100.0     7.6 Brazil         150.0    406.3       0.1    11,626.0     2.7 Chile        1,149.9  2,045.4       7.4     1,669.0     5.8 Mexico         702.3  8,395.2       3.6    16,072.8     5.9 Venezuela    1,020.2  1,842.6       3.7     4,797.0    10.0 Regional       577.2    175.0                 829.0 Total        5,000.4 13,386.0              40,093.8 % rise  year-on-year           167.7                 199.5  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Salomon Brothers  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

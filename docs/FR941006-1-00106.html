			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iron is an essential nutrient that, in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, can be toxic. For some women of child-bearing age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for some young children, iron from dietary sources alone may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be insufficient to meet their metabolic iron requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Access to products that provide iron is useful for these groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that their iron requirements are met. However, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumed acutely in large quantities by young children, iron is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic and can, in some cases, lead to death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the mid 1980's, an upsurge in reported accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric ingestion of iron-containing products has occurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref.1). This fact, and the many resultant injuries and deaths  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of children, have created a dilemma with respect to how to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that iron sources are available while still minimizing the risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to children. In response, FDA is proposing regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that a warning be placed on labeling about the adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of acute, high dose iron ingestion by children and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit-dose packaging be used for certain iron-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These requirements, if adopted, will apply to iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products in addition to the existing requirements of CPSC, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that child-resistant packaging must be used for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing products available (see section II.B. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document). The agency tentatively finds that the effect of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new requirements, in conjunction with those of CPSC, will be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly reduce the risk of accidental pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The types of iron-containing products that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with poisonings of young children are those offered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid oral dosage form (e.g., capsules and tablets) as: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children's and adult's multi-vitamin/mineral supplements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain iron or iron salts (these products typically provide less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 30 mg of iron per dosage unit), (2) products intended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use as iron supplements (these products typically contain 30 mg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more of iron per dosage unit), and (3) drug products that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain iron or iron salts (these products typically contain 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg or more of iron per dosage unit). In this document, the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``iron-containing products'' refers to all of these types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is not aware of incidents of poisoning being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by iron-containing products in liquid or powder form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, these products are not subject to this proposal. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency will consider what regulatory action is appropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take with regard to iron-containing products in liquid or powder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form if it becomes aware of information indicating that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products have caused or can cause poisonings in children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document also does not bear in any way on conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods containing naturally occurring or added iron. Pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron poisoning from consumption of iron-containing foods in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional food form is unlikely because of limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in the large quantity of food that would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingested to cause an adverse effect in young children. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, a serving of a highly fortified breakfast cereal that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains 100 percent of the recommended daily intake for iron of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18 mg, would provide only 7 percent of the amount of iron that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered necessary to produce symptoms of iron poisoning in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 kilograms (kg) (22 pounds (lb)) child (i.e., 25 milligrams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (mg) per (/) kg of iron, which equates to 250 mg total iron for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 kg (22 lb) child. (See section I.B. of this document.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the agency is not aware of any pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings that have resulted from ingestion of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods in conventional food form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Iron Requirements of Children and Women of Childbearing Age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iron is an essential nutrient because it is a component of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blood and muscle tissue and because of its role in metabolic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactions. Iron-containing compounds in the body may be grouped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into two categories: (1) Those that serve metabolic functions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) those associated with iron storage. The compounds in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first category include hemoglobin (a component of red blood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells), myoglobin (a muscle protein), and iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enzymes. They account for approximately 80 percent of body iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compounds in the second category are involved in the maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron homeostasis and include the storage compounds ferritin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hemosiderin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the supply of dietary iron becomes inadequate to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the body's needs, iron is mobilized from iron stores to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of red blood cells and to perform other essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-dependent functions. When body iron stores are low or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depleted, as often occurs in women of child-bearing age and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very young children, a person is vulnerable to adverse effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with iron deficiency anemia and with a reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolic and body functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: SIB to issue information on perils of opting out The Securities and Investments Board will this month take action to ensure that people considering buying a personal pension instead of remaining in their employer's or former employer's occupational scheme are aware of the pitfalls. This follows the City watchdog's publication last December of a pilot study which suggested widespread failure among sales agents to comply with regulators' standards and raised public concern about the mis-selling of personal pensions. SIB said in an interim statement yesterday on its progress in handling pension transfers and opt-outs, that a full report on ensuring high standards in future business would be published after it had been considered by SIB's board in mid-March. The focus of this month's report is likely to be on ensuring that sales agents properly explain the possible pension sale to customers, and on strengthening the monitoring and control arrangements in companies and among regulators. There will also be a fact-sheet or checklist, intended to advise people what issues they should raise with sales agents when discussing pension transfers. It is likely to emphasise that most people in an occupational scheme run by their current employer should probably not leave. SIB's statement came as Labour MPs seized on the report in yesterday's Financial Times to question Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, about the costs to the taxpayer of the growth in personal pensions. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, asked whether the FT investigation did not reveal 'an atmosphere of scandal' surrounding the industry. Mr Lilley vigorously defended the development of the private pensions market. He said: 'If we didn't have the opportunity for people to opt for private pensions where their firm has occupational pensions, many of those 40 per cent who are making greater provision than if they had stayed in Serps would not have done so.' SIB used yesterday's announcement to set out the planned timetable for work on pension transfers. By the end of April the self-regulating organisations such as Lautro, for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, for independent financial advisers, must tell their members which categories of pension transfers they should reconsider as a priority. The categories might include people coming up to retirement, or those who have transferred out of a scheme with index-linked benefits. By the end of July the regulators will publish guidelines for companies and regulators on compensation for people who received poor advice. There will be advice for individual investors about how to respond and, if necessary, how to complain. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Collecting: Youth and beauty prepare for the new season - Italy's top art and antique fairs TWO IMPORTANT international art and antique fairs take place in Italy. One, in Florence, is staged in the 15th century Palazzo Strozzi, its interior extravagantly garlanded with flowers and studded with potted trees, its gala opening, which hails the start of the autumn season, a crush of long titles and short skirts. The younger Milan Internazionale dell'Antiquariato, a biennial event and staged in alternate years with the Palazzo Strozzi fair, takes place in the less glamorous Halls 19 and 20 of the Milan Fair Ground. 'The venue may not be so beautiful,' says Franco Sabatelli, president of the Italian Federation of Art Dealers (FIMA) 'but it lends itself much better to an art fair.' More important, it is at the heart of the commercial centre of the wealthiest region of Italy, and one of the richest in Europe. This year sees the 11th Milan fair (on until May 10), organised by EXPO CTS in collaboration with the Milan Chamber of Commerce and the under the auspices of FIMA and the local society of art dealers. While last September's Palazzo Strozzi fair squeezed 60 or so dealers into its labyrinthine Renaissance interior, Milan is host to some 130, and offers spacious stands. Sabatelli is not alone in believing that the quality of exhibits will be higher than in Florence - and indeed greater than two years ago. There are, however, a number of Italian dealers who also believe that the quality of dealer, as much as exhibit, is too uneven - a polite way of saying that too many participants are simply not up to scratch. A few have registered their dissatisfaction with the vetting procedure - always a vexed issue at Italian art fairs - by deciding not to exhibit this year. Noticeable at this year's event, and last year's Palazzo Strozzi fair, is the growing internationalisation. From Antwerp, for instance, comes the illustrious Bernard Blondeel; Galerie St Honore comes from Paris; Lingenauber from Dusseldorf; Elvira from Madrid; Bruno Scardeoni from Lugano and Newhouse from New York. Most of the outsiders come from Britain: Ciancimino, S. Franses, Sarti, Bernard Shapero Rare Books and Trinity Fine Art. That said, the fair remains essentially an Italian event. Like all Italian fairs, no more than 15 per cent of exhibitors are non-Italian. While the increased foreign participation is not universally popular - in the same way that the foreign quota at Grosvenor House displeases some of the British trade - foreign dealers bring the advantages of new blood and fresh goods to the restricted home market. So many of Italy's 70 or so regional fairs simply show the same deck of objects constantly reshuffled. Moreover, it is a means of strengthening the selection of Old Master paintings on show, inevitably the weakest part of any Italian antiques fair. The fear of important pictures being 'notified' by the state, which would prevent them from being legally exported, discourages dealers from reproducing them in catalogues or taking them to fairs. Milan and its newly prosperous hinterland no doubt also account for the predominance at the fair of decorative and not too demanding pictures, and of expensive Lombard furniture. This wide-ranging fair also embraces silver and jewellery, Oriental and tribal art, ceramics and glass, 19th century painting, the 20th century, sculpture and objets d'art, and carpets, tapestries and textiles. A number of dealers are taking particular trouble this year, perhaps because Italian collectors are at last beginning to feel the effects of world recession or are alarmed to realise that they are among the few still actively buying works of art. Individual stands reflect the range of most dealers in Italy where specialisation is relatively unusual. That diversity characterises the stands of a number of the foreign exhibitors, too. Trinity Fine Art, for instance, which has offices in London and Milan but its two directors in Rome and Paris, offers a wide selection of paintings, from a gold ground altarpiece by Cosimo Rosselli to a lively bozetto by Valerio Castello, some 30 Old Master drawings, an Algardi bronze, Roman silver by Antonio Arrighi, plus terracottas and maiolica. Sarti is there for the first time to show that the company sells far more than just furniture or Italian works of art. Its 48 sq m space is filled with 15th and 16th century Italian paintings, plus the likes of a Russian malachite candelabrum, a Spanish marble tempieto table centre, as well as furniture, French, Dutch, Irish and Italian. While Scardeoni brings Garofalo and Mola, the French and German dealers field Northern masters. A particular strength of the fair is its textiles, with Blondeel and S. Franses joining the ranks of Battilossi, Halevim and Eskenazi. For some reason, northern Italy boasts a disproportionate number of the world's top carpet dealers. Even here there is diversification. Blondeel, for example, also brings Limoges enamels; Eskenazi, alongside a group of rare 18th century Eastern Turkistan rugs and classical 16th century carpets, Chinese Tang Dynasty figures and 17th century Japanese sculpture. In 1990, the Milan fair brought in some 40,000 visitors, and more are expected this year. Added attractions are a series of lectures on collecting, with contributions from such respected art historians as Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios and Alfonso Perez Sanchez, and guided tours (some in English) on specific aspects of collecting. The fair exhibition documents the recent restoration of the 13th century frescoes in the Capitolino of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan which was sponsored by FIMA. The restored frescoes will be unveiled on May 6.</p>

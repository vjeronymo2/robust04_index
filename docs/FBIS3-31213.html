Carnogursky said the party had yet to decide whether it  would  suggest June or some later date, though it was leaning towards  the autumn. Premier Vladimir Meciar earlier this week suggested  June for premature elections.    The KDH chairman refused to comment on whether his group had  come to an agreement with the opposition Democratic Left Party  (SDL) on a possible date.    Carnogursky said that a motion calling for the premier's  resignation was unlikely to be put forward during the next  session of parliament, on Wednesday [16 February], though he  added that it would certainly be made at some later date.    If Meciar were to link a vote on the privatisation law  amendment, expected in parliament on Wednesday, to the issue of  confidence in his cabinet, Carnogursky said, the KDH would vote  against the bill, even though that would mean voting against the  changes to privatisation legislation, proposed by opposition.  Carnogursky said he believed that if the premier did not link  the issues the opposition would get the changes into law.    Asked whether he would like to see the premier leave  government before early elections were held, Carnogursky said:  "The recalling of government is for us more of a question of  principles, rather than of strategy." He could not say,  however, whether the opposition is unified on the issue, though  discussions between them are to continue non-stop until  Wednesday's session.</p>

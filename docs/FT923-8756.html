			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Light on the horizon - The Week Ahead THREE OF the biggest UK insurance companies will still be in the red when they report pre-tax losses for the first half of 1992 next week. But with rate increases in the home, motor and commercial insurance markets taking hold, and companies avoiding the weather losses which have bedevilled them in recent years, there are some glints of light on the horizon. General Accident, which reports on Tuesday, is expected widely to do best with pre-tax losses cut to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m compared with a deficit of Pounds 105.2m at the same stage in 1991. GA might even have made a small profit in the second quarter, according to some analysts. Commercial Union, the most successful and aggressive UK insurer, is on Wednesday expected to report losses of around Pounds 30m, a deterioration on last year's Pounds 26.3m. Royal Insurance, which has the weakest balance sheet, is on Thursday expected to register losses of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 97m last year. Royal, a market leader in domestic mortgage indemnity insurance, continues to be affected badly by the slump in the housing market. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report a significant fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June when it announces its results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen from Pounds 967m to around Pounds 760m. Last year's results were, however, boosted by acquisition benefits. Net debt, which is US dollar denominated, is expected to have fallen to Pounds 1.1bn because of the weakness of the currency. British Airways' first-quarter figures, on Tuesday, should reveal pre-tax profits of around Pounds 90m compared with Pounds 9m a year earlier. The market will also be looking for news of progress on cost cutting, the recent deal to take a Dollars 750m stake in USAir, and clues over the impact of price wars in the airline industry. BA appears to be gaining market share, but this might be at the expense of a lower turnover per seat.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Recession seen as easing in Scots electronics THE RECESSION has bottomed out in the Scottish engineering industry and the electronics sector is leading an upturn, according to a quarterly survey by Scottish Engineering, an employers' organisation representing 300 companies. Orders increased for 52 per cent of electronic engineering companies in the past three months, and 47 per cent of medium-sized companies - between 100 and 500 employees - in all sectors also said they had taken more orders. A total of 67 per cent reported a rise in orders in the previous quarter. Overall, 39 per cent said orders were up and 34 per cent said they were down. Small companies and the foundry sector showed the greatest decline. A total of 32 per cent of companies questioned were more optimistic, while 24 per cent were less optimistic. A balance of 2 per cent of companies reported an increase in capital investment. More investment in training is planned by 30 per cent of the sample. Reductions in staffing and overtime continue throughout the engineering industry, although at a slower rate. Only 19 per cent report employment levels up. Prices were down in 34 per cent of cases, and up in just 9 per cent. Colonel Howard Johnson, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said: 'I believe that we have a confident industry gearing itself for an early turn around of the recession.' The survey had a response rate of 56 per cent of members, and responses from some non-member companies were included for the first time.</p>

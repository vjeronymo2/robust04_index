"The main purpose which unites us is the struggle against  Georgia's joining to the CIS. We must avoid arguing on  second-rate issues," Leader of the National Democratic Party,  Georgi Chanturiya stressed.    The opposition parties refused to establish a single  organization. They decided to carry out their political  cooperation through regular consultations which will take place  in different parties' headquarters.    The opposition has initiated collection of signatures for  the  country's independence and against Georgia's joining to the CIS.  The opposition parties adopted an appeal to the UN, the world  community and the heads of state which says that the Georgian  leadership had tried to legalize the loss of independence and  the republic's joining to the modernized Russian empire.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Russian upheaval may trigger selling in Europe NEWS of political upheaval in Russia came as Europe's bond markets were closing and had little impact on cash prices. However, it pressured futures prices in after-hours trading and could spark further selling today. Moreover, the dollar surged against most European currencies, reasserting its safe-haven status. 'This (the Russian crisis) may cause a little nervousness by US and Japanese investors who have been the big players in Europe,' said Mr Mark Capleton, international bond strategist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'But it's unlikely to be material,' he added. GERMAN bonds ended about 1/8 point lower, with the news from Russia erasing the bund future's late gains. The December contract closed at 98.82, down by 0.15 of a point from Monday. Although Germany's latest monetary data showed much weaker-than-expected money supply growth, the release had little impact on prices. German M3 grew at 7.2 per cent through August, whereas economists' forecasts centred on a growth rate of around 7.9 per cent. However, after encouraging remarks last week from Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the market had discounted a lower figure and largely ignored the numbers. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank set fixed-rate repos at 7.60 per cent, the same rate as last week, for today's allocation. This disappointed some dealers who had hoped for a return to variable-rate repos. DUTCH bonds were given a small lift by the government's announcement that it has completed its funding programme for this year, though they ended lower on the day in line with bunds. The yield gap between the German 10-year benchmark and its lower-yielding Dutch counterpart widened to 17 basis points from 14 on Monday. FRENCH bond futures' earlier gains were wiped out in the late sell-off, leaving them to close about 1/4 point lower on the day. Fading hopes of a rate cut at Thursday's repo operation by the Bank of France also dampened prices. IN LONDON, gilts ended little changed as traders digested the Bank of England's announcement for plans to auction Pounds 3 1/4 bn of 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004 next Wednesday. 'The amount was a bit larger than expected and the coupon a bit lower,' said a trader. JAPANESE government bonds rallied to a six-year high after the Bank of Japan delivered a larger-than-expected 3/4 -point reduction in its official discount rate, to 1.75 per cent. Although this is seen as the last cut in the current cycle, prices are expected to remain supported by buying from Japanese funds, said one dealer. AFTER initially staging a solid recovery from Monday's losses, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell yesterday as investors rushed into shorter-dated securities amid growing concern about the political unrest in Russia. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/16 at 101 19/32, yielding 6.128 per cent. In contrast, at the short end of the market the two-year note was up 3/32 at 100, to yield 3.857 per cent. Prices slipped at the opening in response to news of a bigger-than-expected 7.8 per cent rise in August housing starts. The figures on building permits were also above expectations. The early declines, however, did not last long, as retail buyers entered the market, attracted by the low prices. By late morning Treasuries were back in positive territory across the entire yield curve. Trading picked up pace during the afternoon, however, when the first news emerged of political turmoil in Russia. Amid rumours that the military was intervening to oust President Boris Yeltsin, investors sought out the short end of the market as a safe haven, while selling longer-dated Treasuries.</p>

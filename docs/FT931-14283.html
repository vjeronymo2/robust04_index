			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift down in lacklustre trade TRADING all but ground to a halt yesterday afternoon as the London stock market turned its attention from the uncertain economic scene to the heightening tensions in the Middle East. Although shares rallied after giving ground when Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, said inflation in Germany was still 'unacceptably high', news of a fresh allied air strike against Iraq unsettled the market in the second half of the session. With Wall Street activity reduced by the Martin Luther King holiday, London closed on a lacklustre note. Firmness in sterling gave some support at first to hopes that the next cut in UK base rates will not be too long delayed, in spite of a warning from Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, that the government faces difficulties in keeping inflation under control. But optimism was finally discouraged yesterday by Mr Tietmeyer's comments, which undermined hopes that the Bundesbank might this week lead the way to lower interest rates across Europe. The FT-SE Index closed 2 points lower on the day at 2,763.1, having failed to sustain an early gain of 10 points as investors hoped that the new trading account which opened yesterday would bring some recovery from the setback of the previous week. In the absence of support from the investment funds, share prices moved narrowly throughout the session. The more revealing image of the trading session came from the day's Seaq volume total of only 488m shares, the lowest daily figure since the turn of the year. On Friday 616.5m shares were traded, and retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.19bn, well up to recent daily averages. US dollar weakness, in spite of warlike developments in the Middle East, took the heart out of the international blue chips. Leading oil issues suffered from the subdued trading pattern on Wall Street. Traders believed that the London market was still restrained by fears of rights issues from leading UK companies, and also by concern over the outlook for the government bond market as the City awaited details of the impending funding moves. The current setback in equities was ascribed to the unexpected commitment of investment funds to UK stocks during the Christmas period. At that time, share prices rose strongly, with gains often exaggerated by lack of stock on traders' books, and are proving highly vulnerable now that the institutions have backed away again. Today is expected to bring the first comprehensive details of the Christmas selling season at the leading UK retail stores. Hints of higher retail sales volumes in the final days of December, which traditionally provide the lion's share of sales and annual profits for the retailers, underpinned the stock market's Christmas gains. The warnings on inflation, both from the UK chancellor and the Bundesbank vice-president, have also damped down the enthusiasm shown on the London stock market during the final months of last year. Hopes for a further reduction in UK base rates, probably to 6 per cent, have now been postponed until the spring and, according to some analysts, will be incorporated in the chancellor's Budget measures.</p>

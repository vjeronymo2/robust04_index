			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph NASDA comment] </F>   [Text] ETS-VI Protoflight Test Completed: Three  Tests Conducted in Addition to Six Major Experiment Themes;  Testing Entered Final Stage in Preparation for Launch in 1994.    The Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) is a 2-ton  three-axis-stabilized geostationary satellite scheduled to be  launched in the August-September launch season in 1994 by H-II  Launch Vehicle Flight No. 2. The purpose of the satellite is to  establish fundamental technologies for applications satellites  and to develop, test and validate the satellite-borne equipment  required for advanced satellite communication technology.    ETS-VI has undergone protoflight testing at the Spacecraft  Integration and Test Building in Tsukuba Space Center since  March 1992, and all tests were completed at the end of August  1993. The protoflight test, including environmental testing in  simulated space environments, is to verify the appropriateness  of the ETS-VI satellite design and to confirm the designed  functions in space. The major tests conducted are described  below.  <H5>  (1) Electric Performance Test </H5>   Electric function and performance of the satellite were  tested.  <H5>  (2) Mass Property Test </H5>   The satellite weight and center of gravity were measured.  <H5>  (3) Vibration Test </H5>   Sinusoidal vibration equivalent to that generated during  rocket launch was applied to the satellite. Strength and  rigidity of the satellite structure in this environment and  satellite-borne equipment resistance against vibration were  verified.  <H5>  (4) Acoustic Test </H5>   Acoustic loads equivalent to those generated during rocket  launch were applied to the satellite in the Acoustic Chamber.  Strength of the satellite structure in the acoustic environments  at the launch and the satellite-borne equipment resistance  against the acoustic environments were verified.  <H5>  (5) Deployment and Separation Shock Test </H5>   Resistance of the satellite and satellite-borne equipment to  shocks generated by pyrotechnic ignition (*1) was tested.  Deployment and separation functions were verified at the same  time.  <H5>  (6)Thermal Equilibrium and Thermal Vacuum Test </H5>   The satellite was put in the large space chamber which  simulates the vacuum and cryogenic conditions in space and given  thermal input by the Simulated Solar Ray Irradiation Equipment  and thermal infrared lamps. Thermal design and thermal function  and performance on orbit and electrical performance of the  satellite in the thermal vacuum environments were verified.    In addition to the above tests, alignment measurement, solar  paddle irradiation test, and propulsion system leak test, etc.  were included in the protoflight test. The satellite will be  transported to Tanegashima Space Center for launch in April 1994  after undergoing partial modification necessary to employ it in  flight and compatibility tests for intersatellite data relay  experiment. The satellite will undergo final verification and  preparation at the launch site.</p>

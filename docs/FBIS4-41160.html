			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] On Thursday morning, President Yeltsin is to fly out  to Greece to attend the meeting of the European Union leaders  (June 24 and 25). At 10:00, Friday, he is expected to sign the  agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the European Union in St. George Church in the  island of Corfu.    Russia's Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told  Interfax that the agreement was ready for signing. In the  evening June 23, after the final coordination of the text  printed in the 10 languages of the signatory states, this  document will be initialled by the leaders of the delegations  involved in the talks.    Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Georgiy  Gabunia announced that the package of the agreement-related  documents consisted of about 100 pages, including the joint  declaration and exchange letters.    He also said that according to the agreement, the European  Union would not consider Russia to be a country with a  state-controlled trade system, but a state with a transitional  economy.    The Ministry's leading expert Maksim Medvedkov told Interfax  that the agreement had been drafted during intensive talks which  continued for two years. He also said that serious problems had  been caused by the European Union's reluctance to ease the  access of Russian goods to its markets, and by disagreements  over Russia's uranium exports and the procedure of the European  Union banks' work in Russia. "These problems have been solved on  the whole," he said.    IF Note: The draft agreement provides for the mutual  observance of the basic GATT principles with a few exceptions  reserved for the nuclear materials on which a separate agreement  will be concluded in 1997. As to the European Union's banks,  according to the reached compromise, the five banks which have  been granted the permit to deal with Russian residents, but  which have not used this right given the Russian president's  decree on limiting foreign banks' operations (November 1993),  shall have their rights restored. The rest of the banks will  carry out limited operations during a lengthy transitional  period. For instance, the maximum share of foreign capital in  the Russian banking system will be limited to 12 percent. The  number of foreign banks' branches will also be limited.    Medvedkov said that the agreement on partnership and  cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European  Union set forth the terms for the Russian economy's gradual  integration with the European economic system. It envisages a  gradual implementation of the principles of freedom of trade,  services and the movement of capital, and of the establishment  and operation of companies. The most favored nation status will  be granted on a mutual basis.    IF Note: The European Union is Russia's biggest economic  partner. It accounts for 35 percent of Russia's trade turnover  with foreign countries and 36 percent of the Russian exports.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong Kong  Government's unilateral move in announcing a series of new  measures involving major changes to the operation of government  departments has violated provisions of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration.    Shen Guofang, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry,  made  the remarks here today.    The British Hong Kong Government announced unilaterally on  June 16 the so-called package of measures to further enhance the  public's access to information, Shen said.    The measures involve major changes to the operation of  government departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to  Hong Kong's smooth transition, he said.    The spokesman pointed out that in accordance with the  relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, such  matters should be discussed at the Sino-British Joint Liaison  Group.    The unilateral move by the British Hong Hong Government  without prior consultation and agreement with China is  unacceptable to the Chinese side, he said, and thus all the  responsibility and consequences arising therefrom shall be borne  by the British side.</p>

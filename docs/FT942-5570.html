			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italian bank approves plans for fund-raising The directors of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the newly privatised Italian bank, have formally approved plans to raise up to L2,362bn (Dollars 1.5bn) through the issue of new shares and warrants. BCI said the fund-raising proposals would be put to shareholders next month. The group said the cash raised would be used 'to ensure the balance of the structure of the group, faced with further development of its activity as a 'universal bank', and to consolidate the traditional leadership position of BCI'. The bank issued a statement last week outlining the plans, following increasing market speculation about a rights issue. Shareholders will also be asked to approve further capital increases of up to L2,000bn over the next five years. BCI is negotiating to buy a 1 per cent stake in Commerzbank of Germany, and is part of the consortium bidding for a large minority stake in Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank set for privatisation.</p>

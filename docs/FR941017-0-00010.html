			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter cited a recent revision of the rules regarding the use of HSTAIC, and suggested that these revisions may ameliorate any perceived logistical difficulty. The revision cited was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a final rule on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9617&hyph;622,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket No. 91&hyph;65&hyph;2), with an effective date of August 31, 1994. The final rule amended the regulations (1) To require a $32,000 deposit for each lottery application; (2) by changing the application and lottery dates; (3) by requiring lottery winners to pay the costs of maintaining HSTAIC for certain periods when it is reserved for the lottery winner and not available to other importers; (4) to state that APHIS will not accept applications for the lottery from persons with outstanding debts to APHIS; and (5) to discontinue the practice of ``tiering'' the lottery that previously gave certain animals priority to use HSTAIC. These changes were promulgated to discourage frivolous applications, to help ensure that there is adequate time to assemble necessary information prior to each lottery, and to minimize financial losses incurred by APHIS. However, the basic conditions for the use of HSTAIC remain unchanged_importers must apply for space in HSTAIC, space is very limited, only a small percentage of applicants are granted use of the facilities, and use of HSTAIC is expensive. In contrast, other U.S. animal import centers such as NYAIC can handle multiple importations at one time, do not require importers to go through a lottery in order to reserve space, and are not as expensive as HSTAIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that regulations concerning the importation of llamas and alpacas should be placed in a separate subpart in 9 CFR part 92, so that llamas and alpacas could be regulated separately from other ruminants. We have made no changes based on this comment. All research conducted by APHIS or reviewed by APHIS indicates that, at this time, there is no reason to regulate llamas and alpacas separately from other ruminants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter said that APHIS should have conducted a quantitative risk assessment in deciding whether to remove the requirement for quarantine at HSTAIC. The commenter also requested that APHIS promulgate the risk assessment criteria it plans to follow so that interested parties would have an opportunity to supply relevant information to APHIS for consideration. A risk assessment was prepared for this rule. It focuses on the risk of FMD being introduced into the United States by llamas or alpacas imported from Chile under this rule. The risk assessment indicates that there is a negligible risk of FMD being introduced into the United States under this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter determined that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) an environmental impact statement should be prepared for this rule. In response to this comment, APHIS has prepared an environmental assessment, which resulted in a finding of no significant impact concerning the provisions of this rule change. Specifically, the finding of no significant impact concluded that ``(i)mplementation of the proposed action should not increase the likelihood of introduction of FMD into the United States or have any significant impact on human health and safety or the health of domestic animals or wildlife.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations require llamas and alpacas from Austria, Belgium, Chile, France, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Korea, and Spain to enter the United States through HSTAIC, where they must remain quarantined for at least 40 days. Costs depend on the size of the shipment, but are generally $1,092 per head. Competition for the quarantine space at HSTAIC is intense. Import requests are awarded on a lottery basis. Since 1990, when this lottery system became effective, three importations of llamas and alpacas have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The greater ease of importing could attract persons into the business of importing llamas and alpacas from Chile into the United States. (We are not aware of any llamas and alpacas in other countries declared free from FMD on or after September 28, 1990, that are available for export.) Based on past requests for the use of HSTAIC, imports could reach 900 llamas and alpacas per year, although we consider half that number more realistic. This rule will save importers of Chilean llamas and alpacas at least $592,488 for a shipment of 900 animals and $296,244 for a shipment of 450. For purposes of this analysis, savings are calculated using shipments of 450 animals because HSTAIC can accommodate no more than 450 llamas and alpacas per shipment. The rule will be beneficial to importers of Chilean llama and alpacas, who will save approximately $700 per llama or alpaca imported through an animal import center other than HSTAIC. The decreases in price and quarantine time, along with greater access to quarantine facilities, will remove some barriers to entry into the import market. We estimate between 15 and 20 importers, all small entities, could be affected by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

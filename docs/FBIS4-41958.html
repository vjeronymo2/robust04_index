			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "`Hurricane' in Moscow Has </F> Swept Past"]    [Text] A massive operation carried out under the  leadership of the Regional Administration for Combatting  Organized Crime [RACOC] and involving the Moscow Criminal  Investigation Department [MCID], the Economic Crimes  Administration [ECA], and 20,000 soldiers of the Dzerzhinskiy  Motorized Rifle Division has ended with almost no results.  RACOC Press Center staffers explained that, on the eve of the  operation, several mass media organs reported that an operation  was being prepared....    But was it only this "public disclosure" which played a part  in the operation's failure?    Having checked out 689 facilities around Moscow and  practically cordoned off the city (43 Dzerzhinskiy Division  pickets were on the roads into and out of Moscow), the militia  detained 2,251 people. Some 759 of the detainees had  administrative proceedings instituted against them (mostly for  breaking the city's residence regulations). No criminals were  found among the detainees and they were all released. Some  1,053 motor vehicles together with 27 parking lots were also  inspected during operation "Hurricane."    In the opinion of RACOC, the success of this massive  operation lies in the detection of 119 economic crimes (of which  8 were committed earlier) and in the closure of 193 commercial  enterprises for various offenses. A total of 196 commercial  enterprises, 14 hotels, 36 companies and banks, and four markets  were checked. A total of 219 crimes were exposed (it is unknown  what they were, given that, according to information from RACOC,  criminal proceedings were not instituted).    Obviously, a serious discussion of the massive operations  still lies ahead. But their benefit to the city treasury is  clear -- as much as 119 million rubles in fines were exacted.  But this argument is hardly likely to work with taxpayers --  much more is spent on maintaining the law enforcement agencies  and carrying out large-scale actions like "Hurricane."    Finally, on the subject of the results achieved. RACOC  staffers consider that the sheer fact that the criminal elements  did not turn up at their previously known hangouts is evidence  that the gangs fear and respect the law enforcement agencies.  But it is also evidence of something else -- the service for  the surveillance and analysis of criminal groups works much  better than the defenders of public order and our security. For  this reason there is little to rejoice at. Perhaps the only  people who will be happy are the capital's champions of  "universal equality," as well they might be now that they can,  after all, burst into and turn upside down any enterprise in any  form of ownership....    The reasons for our law enforcement officers' failures and  their long-term plans for combatting crime will be discussed in  a conversation with RACOC Leader Vladimir Rushaylo, who has  kindly agreed to meet our IZVESTIYA correspondent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, by Diplomatic </F> Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Excerpts] President Boris Yeltsin has expressed  satisfaction with the start of a Russian-American summit in  Moscow. "All is going well," he told an Interfax correspondent  after the first round of talks on Thursday morning, lasting 20  minutes longer than scheduled. The delegations met in a narrow  circle. [passage omitted]    The meeting was held in an atmosphere of sincere partnership  with neither side trying even to imply its specific role,  Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, commenting on  the first round of talks as the two sides met in a narrow  composition this morning. In his words, both sides proceed from  a premise that peace and stability in Europe and worldwide is  impossible without Russia and the United States.    Elaborating the point, Kostikov said the world was in need  of  "a solid new order and great powers." As shown by various  conflicts including military, there can be no stable peace  without great powers, he went on to say. Kostikov spoke of a  widespread beliefs in Russia that it remained a great power  politically, militarily and culturally.    Russia's elections and new constitution, the NATO summit in  Brussels and the implementation of the Tokyo accords by G-7  states dominated the agenda of the morning session, he said.    President Yeltsin spoke of Russia's turbulent though chaotic  process of parliamentarism and democracy, but he stressed that  his country had already joined the club of constitutional  democracies. Kostikov said the two leaders had exchanged views  on relations between the legislature and executive in a modern  democratic society.    Clinton briefed the Russian leader on the resolutions  adopted  by the NATO summit in Brussels including the U.S. partnership  for Peace proposal. Kostikov said that since little was known  of the U.S. proposal in Russia, such information was useful. As  he described the U.S. initiative as a politically attractive  declaration rather than a real program, Kostikov said it needed  more substance.    There were no differences on the impossibility of drawing  new  demarcation lines in Europe, the spokesman said.    For his part, member of the Presidential Council Andrannik  Migranian said the obscurely-worded concept of the Partnership  for Peace proposal would for a long time leave Eastern Europe  and Russia outside the framework of mechanisms for decision  making on European security.    He is opposed to attempts to try to make NATO universal and  create a European security structure in its place. Instead,  Migranian calls for a security structure allowing all countries  to take an equal part in any decision making on European  security.    He also said the question of understanding and recognition  of  Russia's special role throughout the former Soviet Union would  come on the summit agenda. Migranian says that Russia is the  only factor capable of safeguarding regional peace and security.  He denied that Russia was out to establish a neo- imperial or  hegemonistic order in the region, adding that the reason was  that no single international agency or regional force was able  to act as guarantor of peace and stability in that area. "I  think the sooner the western countries agree to provide  appropriate financial and diplomatic support to Russia, the  quicker peace and security will come to reign in what used to be  the Soviet Union," Migranian said.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigory Karasin described the  U.S.- proposed Partnership for Peace initiative as an  alternative to the mechanical expansion of NATO and a rapid  acceptance of new members. In his words, Russia will hold a  comprehensive exchange of views on the Nato's Brussels summit  with as many countries of Eastern and Western Europe as possible  to determine optimal ways of promoting cooperation in  maintaining stability and security in Europe.    Karasin said the Russian-American dialogue must not be taken  as an attempt by the two great powers to strike separate  accords. The question is one of joint searches for such means  of European stability that will provide security guarantees to  all European states regardless of size, geography, economic or  military potential, he said.</p>

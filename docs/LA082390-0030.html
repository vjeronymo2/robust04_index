			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE?;  </P> <P> QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW'S MILITARY ADVISORY ROLE IN BAGHDAD  </P> <P> Moscow has joined with most of the rest of the world to condemn the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait. But it seems fair to ask why among the 7,800 Soviet  citizens still in Iraq there are about 200 military experts who continue to  provide advice and services to dictator Saddam Hussein's armed forces.  </P> <P> A Soviet spokesman excuses this with the remark that the experts are  "fulfilling their contractual obligations." In other words, it's business as  usual, even if that business means helping an outlaw state violate the rules of  international behavior. At the same time, however, Soviet Prime Minister  Nikolai Ryzhkov has ordered all other Soviet agencies to sever ties with Iraq  to comply with U.N. resolutions.  </P> <P> Moscow should rethink its notion that contracts associated with arms deals  impose greater legal or moral obligations than do unanimous U.N. Security  Council resolutions against an aggressor. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev  has expressed his revulsion at Iraq's recent behavior, including its holding of  foreign hostages in Kuwait and Iraq. Gorbachev has specifically voiced regret  that Iraq's army and air force carried out their aggression primarily using  Soviet-supplied weapons and equipment. This principled position is at  considerable variance with Moscow's apparent determination not to interrupt its  military advisory role in Baghdad.  </P> <P> The most generous explanation for all this may be that the Soviets don't want  to rile Hussein while a lot of Soviet citizens remain under his control. The  evacuation of those citizens is supposed to begin this weekend. After that,  perhaps, the Soviets may try to bring their advisers home.  </P> <P> But meanwhile, how much help are all those experts giving to Iraq's military?  It's not being alarmist to note that at some point, maybe soon, this military  could come into conflict with American and other forces sent to the area to  repel aggression. U.S.-Soviet relations would surely be set back if fighting  came, and "contractual obligations" found Soviet advisers on the wrong side.  </P></p>

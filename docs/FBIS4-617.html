			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] on Tuesday [12 April] appealed to all civil  servants not to go on strike in the run-up to the April  election. The TEC, which has formed a task force to examine the  grievances of civil servants who are striking in several of the  homelands and self-governing territories, appealed for a virtual  moratorium on strike action and said the TEC would hold  discussions with the trade union federations to urge them to  refrain from strike action "in the national interests".    The TEC noted the importance of civil servants in the  electoral period, in particular security forces. It noted too  that concerns had been expressed about job security, pension  payouts and the rationalisation process.    The TEC said a successful election would lead to a stable  country that could attend to civil servants' grievances.    The TEC wanted civil servants to accept its assurances that  their jobs would be secure after the election.</p>

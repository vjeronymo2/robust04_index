			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- Today, Zambian President  Frederick Chiluba and his delegation travelled to the eastern  city of Santiago de Cuba continuing his official and friendly  visit to this nation. The Zambian head of state, whom his Cuban  counterpart, Fidel Castro, invited to the island, will meet here  with Zambian students majoring in many subjects.    Some 43 students from the African nation are studying in  Cuba  at university centers in the Provinces of Camaguey, Santiago de  Cuba, and Villa Clara, and in the nickel-producing Moa  Municipality. In the last 10 years, about 79 Zambian students  graduated from college, and six finished their technical studies.    Chiluba has contemplated the possibility of strengthening  bilateral cooperation in activities related to the sugar  industry, agriculture, public health, and the pharmaceutical  industry. One of the issues he analyzed during his stay in  Santiago de Cuba is the ratification of an agreement on having  Cuban technicians build a sugar mill in Zambia financed by  Lusaka.    The guest and his delegation visited such centers of  economic  and scientific interest as the Carlos J. Finlay Biotechnology  Institute and the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, one of the most  important hospitals on the island. They also visited an  agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and the  Mario Munoz Sugar Mill, located in Los Arabos Municipality, in  Matanzas Province.    President Chiluba, 51, is the leader of the Movement for  Multiparty Democracy (MMD), winner of the 31 October 1991  elections, and an heir of Kenneth Kaunda.    Zambia, which has an area of 174,000 [figure as received]  square km, is the world's third largest producer and largest  exporter of copper. The country has other resources such as  precious and semi-precious stones, ferrous and non-ferrous  minerals, and tobacco.</p>

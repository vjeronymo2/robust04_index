			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman </F> of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform,  by Mihaela Pantea and Romulus Maier; place and date not given:  "If the Program Is Not Respected, They Will Dismiss Me"]    [Text] The following interview with Mircea Cosea, minister  of state and chairman of the Council of Coordination, Strategy,  and Economic Reform, revealed a radical modification in the  direction of Romania's privatization program. The mainly  economic principles that Mr. Cosea has followed so far have been  replaced by mainly political ones, to an overwhelming degree.  No doubt, Mr. Cosea has an innate talent of "causer," along  with an intellectual finesse that make him outstanding among the  members of Vacaroiu's cabinet. However, Mr. Cosea failed in his  attempt to totally hide the clear pressure he is facing from the  representatives of the leftist PDSR to limit, at least in the  first phase, the possibility of concentrating capital in the  hands of a few businessmen or society people.  <H5>  Accelerated Privatization Does Not Require Legislative </H5> Modifications    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Mr. Cosea! The Council you are heading has  developed a program of accelerated privatization. Is this a  readapted old program, or a totally new one?    [Cosea] This is not a new program; nor can it be a new  program because other people have considered this problem before  us. The various programs that are now in circulation under  various names in Bucharest are actually programs of Prague  University, namely the programs of Rapacinski and Friedmann. In  the new program, we are starting from some rules of the game  that cannot be ignored:    1. The current legislation must be preserved although, from  my viewpoint, it would have been preferable to modify it, namely  to simplify it and make it more transparent. The present law is  not very bad, but it is too sophisticated and disregards some  realities prevailing in Romania, namely the reduced economic  education and an almost non-existent infrastructure and  computerization in this area.    2. The need for the privatization process to be fully  transparent because, at the level of the individual person,  privatization means corruption, quick accumulation of wealth,  and traffic through influence.    3. A maximal simplification of the procedures and methods.  And very much connected to the above is the possibility  envisaged in the new program, namely to use a variety of  privatization methods, not only the MEBO [Management and  Employee Buy-on] or a standard method, for example.  <H5>  One Certificate -- One Man -- One Enterprise </H5>   [ROMANIA LIBERA] Concretely, what is the time span of the  privatization program?    [Cosea] In the first phase, the program aims at solving two  problems: Setting up the system of ownership certificates and  establishing a secondary capital market in which these  certificates can be marketed. Through this program, we proposed  to limit the possibilities of changing these certificates into  stocks at the enterprises to be privatized, on the basis of "one  certificate/man/enterprise." We must give equal chances to all  the certificate owners, at least in the first wave of  privatization (about 3,000 enterprises eligible for  privatization beginning with 1 September 1994), because there is  real social pressure in this direction.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] However, when some people have sold their  certificates for meager sums, there were generally buyers; in  other words, there was a certain balance of supply and demand    [Cosea] From the viewpoint of the market economy, there is  indeed a perfect balance. The only problem is that we do not  have a market economy, and the level of our economic education  does not allow such an approach. Once a person has sold his  certificate, I can tell him "good day." But he will ask me what  the government has done in the last two years to explain to him  how and when to use these certificates. Nothing! Therefore, we  thought of an equitable solution, but I repeat, in the first  "wave" of privatization.    The Last Train for Romania [subhead]    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Will such a restrictive measure lead to a  conflict between the government and the large owners of  certificates, many of them important supporters of the  government?    [Cosea] In this first phase, privatization will certainly  create great dissatisfaction. This also explains the lack of  political will that has been characteristic so far.  Privatization is a risk and, for any party, it can become a  factor of losing support.    When they accepted this role, those who are in the  government  must also have accepted the risk of leaving the game. On the  other hand, they have an immense responsibility, and knowing the  moment when actions must be taken is of major importance. This  moment is the last one for Romania. If we continue to delay  privatization and continue to be afraid of the possibility of  losing political support or of a government fall, the risk is  great....    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is this program the best version of  privatization for Romania?    [Cosea] In any case, this program will accelerate  privatization and, in the second phase, by liberalizing the  exchange system of the aforementioned certificates (beginning  with 1 January 1995), a series of improvements will be made to  allow access to an unlimited number of certificates on the  market.   <H5>    There Are No Declared Enemies </H5>   [ROMANIA LIBERA] Could this program be blocked by a  decision?    [Cosea] Theoretically, it can be blocked at the level of  three factors: the Private Property Funds, the State Property  Fund, and the Government Property Fund. However, it has no  declared enemy yet.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] You advance the possibility of privatizing  3,000 enterprises in the framework of this program by the end of  this year. The representatives of the World Bank in Bucharest  showed distrust in this version, and only saw the possibility of  privatizing a few hundred enterprises at this stage.    [Cosea] The program was presented to the World Bank and they  made some constructive observations with some interesting  points. I know that there is distrust regarding the number of  firms that can be privatized this year, but I think that we can  carry out what we have decided.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] You are the first Romanian official who  connected his position to the implementation of a certain goal.  You declared that you would have resigned if the treaty with  the IMF had not been signed at the end of 1993. Will you do the  same if this program is not fully implemented?    [Cosea] I think that, before I resign, if the program is not  implemented, they will dismiss me!</p>

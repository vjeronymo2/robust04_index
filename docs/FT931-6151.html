			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Mexican air traffic control deal upheld FIVE multinational companies which protested against the award of a Dollars 21m (Pounds 15m) contract to install a new air traffic control system in Mexico have lost a battle to have the contract overturned. Mexico's government watchdog announced last month that it had found no irregularities in the contract tender and rejected the complaints. The five - IBM Air Traffic Control, Calmaquip of Miami, Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary, Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems and Nissho Iwai  - had complained that an initial tender offer for the contract was unjustifiably cancelled by the Mexican Ministry of Transport and Communications. It said none of the bids complied with the contract requirements, a statement contradicted by each company. Mr Kaveh Moussavi, an agent then acting for IBM, further claimed that three men, whom he took to be government officials, asked him for Dollars 1m to secure the contract. He refused to pay and 10 days later the tender offer was cancelled. Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation investigated the complaints lodged by the five companies for several weeks before concluding that the contract was justifiably awarded to Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy in a second tender. In supporting its case, the comptroller showed excerpts from an independent report by the Canadian subsidiary of Martin Marietta of the US, which indicated where the losing companies had not complied with the original specifications in the first tender. The comptroller also said that it was unable to pursue Mr Moussavi's allegations, because he had offered no names or evidence of his encounter. Mr Moussavi, however, says the government investigation into his claims was perfunctory. He was denounced on pro-government television and threatened with prison by the minister of transport and communications, actions which he said would deter future whistle-blowers. The investigation has been criticised by others. A foreign diplomat said that a 'major weakness' in the government's investigation was that the comptroller was limited to looking at procedure and rules, and not at the quality of the different technologies. Calmaquip maintains that it complied with the required specifications. Mr Armando Paz, its chief financial officer, has demanded to see the background papers of the Martin Marietta report. Complaints by foreign companies about the awarding of contracts are not rare in Mexico: the comptroller reports there were 400 last year, about 1 per cent of all government contracts. The number of complaints may reflect in part differences in business practices in Mexico and the US. As the diplomat said: 'In the US and Canada performance details (of the technology) are more significant than the absolute adherence to the letter of the contract. In Mexico any deviation from code, however unimportant, can lead to disqualification.' However, such deviations are sometimes overlooked if a company establishes good relations with those issuing a contract, according to a businessman representing a big British company in Mexico. 'In Mexico, a decision is often based on who they know and trust, so good contacts can be invaluable. While I do not pay bribes, our Mexican agents can share their commissions.' He believed this was common practice. Encouraged by the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, more foreign companies are contemplating business in Mexico.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC sees opening for new regime - Ruling against US steelmakers draws a mixed response THE CASE for a new Multilateral Steel Arrangement has been strengthened by the US International Trade Commission's largely favourable ruling this week against big US steelmakers, EC officials said yesterday. Relieved that the ITC had discarded many of the complaints against foreign imports, the European Commission said it was time to reach agreement on a new regime which prohibited state subsidies, eliminated tariff and non-tariff barriers, and included a 'disputes mechanism'. Officials suggested the US had been delaying support for an MSA agreement until the outcome of the ITC case. In 1991, EC steelmakers exported about 4m tonnes to the US. The US Commerce Department imposed preliminary countervailing duties on about 1.9m tonnes earlier this year; the ITC ruling reduces the total subject to duties by 50 per cent. The EC officials said a key factor was that the ITC ruling removed many prohibitive duties, making an improvement in US market access more likely. Thus, German exports of corrosion-resistant steel remained subject to duties, but only at a level of about 5 per cent which was not necessarily a deterrent to selling in the US. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, and the German Steel Federation yesterday joined forces to denounce the ITC's ruling as discriminatory. The ruling would impose anti-dumping duties of between 5.47 and 50.17 per cent on corrosion-resistant products, cut-to length plates and cold rolled plates, Mr Rexrodt said. Officials at the economics ministry said it was felt the ruling affected German companies more severely than steelmakers in other countries. France gave a qualified welcome to the decision, with Mr Gerard Longuet, minister for industry, post and telecommunications, saying it represented a 'three-quarters victory' in an issue which had 'poisoned relations between the US and the EC'. To the extent that a 'disastrous' outcome had been avoided, the ruling would have a positive effect on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in Geneva, he added. However, Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel producer, protested against the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties upheld on corrosion-resistant products. Canadian steelmakers backed the ruling. They will be refunded several hundred million dollars from provisional duties but await ITC confirmation of a 28 per cent tariff on galvanised steel exports and 68.7 per cent on heavy plate exports.</p>

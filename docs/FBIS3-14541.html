In an editorial today, the  newspaper expresses confidence that Iraq, since it is a  heavyweight, will be the decisive factor in the balance between  supply and demand in the oil markets in a manner that preserves  the rights of the exporting countries.    The paper focused on the contacts several oil companies and  establishments are making with Iraq. It said the ghost of the  resumption of Iraqi oil exports is haunting some agent OPEC  member states which placed the wealth of their peoples at the  service of the imperialist and Zionist circles to prevent the  organization from reaching an agreement that secures the  interests of its members.    It said the objective of the aggression against Iraq was  clear from the beginning when the imperialist circles tried to  control oil sources and tighten the siege on Iraq. It added  that the aggression did not stop, but expanded to include all  oil-exporting countries with the aim of preventing them from  utilizing their resources in building their development  capabilities and improving their economic and social conditions.    The newspaper emphasized that the only way to stop  aggression  against oil states is through fixing a production ceiling by  which all OPEC member states abide in order to secure the rights  of exporting nations and find the means that secure growth and  prosperity for these nations.    The newspaper criticized the OPEC ministerial committee's  decision to maintain the current output ceiling. It said this  decision will seriously harm those who adopted it, and is viewed  as serving the interests of imperialism, whose prosperity and  might have been realized at the expense of the struggling and  developing nations.</p>

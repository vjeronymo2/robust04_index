			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi names banks to draw up restructure plan FERRUZZI, Italy's second-largest industrial grouping, announced yesterday that it and its parent company, Serafino Ferruzzi, had hired five domestic banks to draw up a restructuring plan for the financially troubled agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group. In a statement, Ferruzzi said the plan called for an industrial and financial reorganisation of the group and that the five banks - Banca Commerciale Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino and Mediobanca - would assist it in carrying out the plan. The statement indirectly confirmed that Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former Ferruzzi executive, would not play a role in the restructuring. It had been widely reported that Mr Cragnotti would assist in the much-needed recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi group. The statement also seemed to exclude a role for foreign financial institutions. Last week, it had been reported that Goldman Sachs and Citicorp, both of the US, would advise Ferruzzi in the restructuring. Although no details have been disclosed, the shake-up, made necessary by the group's indebtedness, could include a large capital injection supported by the banks, possibly through an exchange of debts for equity. Through Serafino, the Ferruzzi family's private holding company, Ferruzzi has a 45 per cent stake in the stock market-listed Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), which controls Montedison, the food-to-chemicals group. Ferfin last week reported a loss of L1,519bn (Dollars 1.04bn) in 1992, compared with a net profit of L115bn in 1991, while Montedison posted a loss of L1,244bn for 1992, compared with a profit of L168bn in 1991. The group's consolidated net indebtedness jumped to L15,123bn at the end of 1992 from L8,801bn a year earlier. Ferruzzi had already announced a disposals plan aimed at concentrating group assets in the agro-industrial division, while shedding its interests in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plastics. Generali, Italy's largest insurance group, raised consolidated net profit in 1992 by a marginal 0.9 per cent to L675.7bn (Dollars 443m) from L670bn.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Queens Moat creditors to be told about loss QUEENS MOAT Houses' 60 bank creditors will today be told that the international hotel group made a loss last year, but that it still has a 'sizeable net asset value', bankers said yesterday. The emergency bank meeting, which has been arranged by the UK bank Barclays, will hear preliminary details of an investigation of the group's affairs by accountants Grant Thornton. Bankers will be told this afternoon that Queens Moat made a loss in 1992, compared with their expectations a fortnight ago that it had made pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m. The loss, which Grant Thornton has not quantified precisely, has been caused by a re-examination of Queens Moat's accounting policies and of management incentive contracts. Under these contracts, Queens Moat's managers guaranteed that their hotels would generate specified revenues and the company then booked these future revenues as profits. However, much of this revenue was never paid, so the company has to write off 'tens of millions' of previously reported profits, a banker said. Grant Thornton will also recommend changes to a series of Queens Moat's accounting policies, leading to a further drop in Queens Moat's profits. The accountants believe that the gross value of the group's hotel assets has fallen sharply from more than Pounds 2bn last summer. However, a banker said the fall was likely to be less than 25 per cent and he was confident the company had positive net assets. Barclays has asked the banks to suspend principal and interest payments on Pounds 1bn of debt pending the completion of Grant Thornton's inquiries. However, banks will be told they are unlikely to suffer big loan losses. A debt restructuring proposal is expected to be made in a few weeks, whose main element will be a request to reschedule principal repayments for several years on two main facilities: A Pounds 415m multiple facility, converted into D-Marks and due for repayment in November. A DM550m (Pounds 226m) revolving facility, signed last August and maturing in four years. The facilities were arranged by National Westminster Bank, though Barclays will chair today's meeting. Each has an exposure to Queens Moat of at least Pounds 80m. Several German banks are exposed, including Dresdner, WestDeutsche Landesbank, Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank.</p>

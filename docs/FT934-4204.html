			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Share transfer query I would like to give some of the shares I own to my children on condition that the dividends are paid directly to my wife by the company registrars. Do you know if the registrars would carry out such a wish and, furthermore, would this arrangement be acceptable to the Inland Revenue? That is to say for tax purposes would my wife show these dividends on her tax returns but not my children even though the shares are registered in their names? What are you trying to achieve? If you mean that you want the dividends paid to your wife in her capacity as the children's guardian (to be credited to accounts in names such as 'Mrs Maggie Briefcase for Adam Briefcase (a minor)', then that should be possible: you could, for example, transfer the shares into your wife's name with a distinguishing designation for each child, eg each child's initials, making it clear in a formal letter to her that it is not your intention to confer any beneficial interest in the shares upon her personally. On the other hand, if you mean that you want your wife to be able to spend the proceeds of the dividend warrants just as she pleases, then you would have to create a trust, giving your wife a life interest or an interest for a fixed term. This is something which you should discuss with a solicitor; it may be prohibitively expensive, unless you are talking about substantial sums. In this case, the dividends would probably be taxed as though they were your own income. In the situation outlined in the first paragraph, the dividends would only be taxed as though they were your own income if they amounted to Pounds 80.01 or more in each tax year, by virtue of section 663(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The figure of Pounds 80.01 is based upon the assumption that (a) you are talking about shares in UK companies and (b) the rate of tax credit does not change from the current one-quarter. As we so often have to say to readers who seek our help, we could have given you a simpler and more helpful reply if you had given us more precise facts and figures.

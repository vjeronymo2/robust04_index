			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JAGGER DENIES MODEL ROMANCE  </P> <P> Rolling Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger denied today that he was romantically  involved with a blond German model who he said was trying to capitalize on a  brief association with him by giving interviews to reporters.  </P> <P> British tabloids had a field day with pictures of Jagger and 24-year-old model  Christina Haack and Jerry Hall, the Texas model and mother of his two children.  </P> <P> Several of the newspapers today also showed a woman trying to deliver a huge  bouquet of flowers at Hall's London home, claiming that they were the  47-year-old rock star's attempt to apologize.  </P> <P> Haack told reporters that she dated Jagger for three days while the Rolling  Stones were on tour in Munich. She said that they dined, that he came home to  her apartment and that they are "very, very good friends."  </P> <P> Jagger said he only spoke with Haack in a club for a few minutes and did not  visit her apartment. Haack, who resembles Hall, is "obviously making the most  of a few minutes with me," Jagger said.  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not really such a good way to run a railway Sir, While there is much to commend French Railways, handing over British Rail to our French colleagues might not have the effects your correspondent, Noel Clarke (Letters, November 22), claims. In 1992, for example, InterCity delivered 87 per cent of its trains on time or within 10 minutes. In the same year, 74.9 per cent of French TGVs clocked in within 14 minutes of advertised arrival times. InterCity achieved that without subsidy. In total, French Railways receives about 50 per cent more subsidy than BR as a proportion of its income. We may still have our imperfections, but BR has posted some remarkable improvements in operating performance in recent years, and has consistently been among the most efficient in Europe financially for a decade. Ian MacKellar, chief press officer, British Railways Board, 24 Eversholt Street, London NW1 1DZ</p>

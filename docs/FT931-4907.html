			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Observer: Undistinguished Meanwhile, at least the great British public will not have to volunteer names for the Military Medal - an honour awarded to 'other ranks' for conspicuous bravery. Its demise is unlikely to be mourned even by those few survivors of the 1914-18 war in Europe. In his book Old Soldiers Never Die published in 1933, Frank Richards, a British soldier who fought throughout the first world war, wrote about the class divisions which existed even in battle: 'In the spring of 1916 another decoration was introduced, called the Military Medal. There were no grants or allowances with the Military Medal, which without a shadow of a doubt had been introduced to save awarding too many Distinguished Conduct Medals. With the DCM went a money-grant of Pounds 20, and a man in receipt of a life pension who had won the DCM was entitled to an extra sixpence a day on his pension. After the new decoration was introduced, for every DCM awarded there were 50 MMs. The old regular soldiers thought very little of the new decoration.'</p>

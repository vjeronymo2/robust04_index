One known  possible interaction is that of a relativistic electron beam and  only the field of the first harmonic (fundamental component) of  such a structure, their interaction being attended by large  diffraction losses tolerable only in ultrahigh-power devices.  Another known possible interaction is that of an electron beam  and space harmonics of the periodic structure generated on the  inside surface of the waveguide rings, in which case one can  always minimize diffraction losses by optimizing the dimensions  of the waveguide segments. A third possible interaction now  under investigation is that of a relativistic electron beam and  an oversize waveguide with a retarding structure placed on its  inside surface. The possibility of electromagnetic radiation  being amplified during resonance interaction of a relativistic  electron beam and the field of space harmonics in an open  waveguide line is demonstrated theoretically, of interest being  radiation wavelengths much smaller than the waveguide period. As  a specific case is considered a planar quasi-optical waveguide  with a large period 2D on one side and structures with a small  period d on periodically spaced mirrors. The efficiency of this  interaction is calculated analytically in the Fresnel  approximation and then compared with that of conventional  interaction where the period of the retarding structure is  comparable with the radiation wavelength. It is shown that  resonance interaction in such a system is possible even under  less stringent design constraints on the electrodynamic  structure with a small period d, the Fresnel parameter however  depending on the interaction mode and can be as large as twice  the number of space harmonics of the 2D period. Therefore,  achieving significant interaction output in such a system  requires special means of minimizing diffraction losses. Figures  1; references 6.</p>

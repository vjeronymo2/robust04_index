			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Man in the News: The Tories' chief whip - John Smith If Mr John Smith's rave reviews are to be believed, the ancient and all but moribund art of parliamentary oratory may just be making a comeback, rejuvenated by the unblinking eye of television. Can Labour's fortunes be revived by similar means? Until Thursday's emergency debate on the economy, the growing view among commentators was that the Conservative party's civil war over Maastricht had rendered four-times defeated Labour all but redundant. The 'end of party politics' thesis, tacitly reinforced by the media's increasing tendency to sideline Labour's spokesmen, had, instead, turned the Tory Euro-sceptics into Her Majesty's government's de facto, if unofficial, opposition. But that is to reckon without the character and capabilities of the new Labour leader: in short, the importance of being Mr John Smith. Curiously, for a place that makes the unpredictable commonplace, nothing that occurred in the Commons chamber this week came as much of a surprise. Mr John Major made a virtue of the Dunkirk spirit and retreated bravely under fire. Mr Smith proceeded in his debut as opposition leader to demonstrate the formidable debating skills for which he has long been known. With easy confidence, at times smiling, at others solemn, he raked the Tory frontbench with a potent salvo of observations ranging from outright ridicule, through wry sarcasm to withering contempt. His chief charge was incompetence. Television audiences, not to mention the Labour backbenches, witnessed the impact as his shots, mercilessly directed at the hapless prime minister, found their mark. Three times Mr Major took the unusual and risky step of rising from his bench to interrupt his accuser. Three times the Edinburgh advocate ensured that the prime minister was firmly returned to his seat like an unreliable witness whom the jury at home could safely afford to ignore. Mr Smith's demeanour at the despatch box appeared to intimidate his Tory opponents from making any running with the most damaging charge - that he had firmly backed continued ERM membership and opposed devaluation. Long-time Commons' watchers claimed that, though it was a vintage performance, Mr Smith has proved a more powerful prosecutor on previous occasions. Many cited his celebrated demolition of Sir Leon Brittan during the Westland affair or the debates where he left no less a figure than Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson, whitefaced on the government bench. But to Labour's foot-soldiers and, indeed, some Tories, such nit-picking did not contradict the most salient fact: for the first time in 13 years - since Mr (now Lord) Jim Callaghan stepped down from the leadership in 1979 - the Conservatives now face a confident, heavyweight opponent. With Labour's annual conference opening tomorrow in Blackpool, a reminder of his debating skills is timely. Mr Smith's leadership was well past its honeymoon phase by this week. Despite his crushing victory in the July leadership election, critics within the party were suggesting that his public appearances had been lacklustre if not 'laid back'. Genuine fears existed among senior party figures that a less than adequate debut in the Commons could trigger a return to factionalism, with the left openly opposing the right-wing leader's stance on the European issues. Some, not least his rival for the leadership, Mr Bryan Gould, were openly suggesting that his firmly pro-Maastricht, anti-devaluation, anti-referendum position was simply wrong. But by raising morale this week, the Labour leader has guaranteed himself a smoother passage at Blackpool than he might otherwise have expected. He has also vindicated, in many minds, the cautious strategy that has drawn criticism in some quarters of the party. This 'softly, softly' approach has reinforced his supporters' claim that a non-confrontational style of party management is also having an impact in its highest forums. Members of the national executive committee have remarked that Mr Smith's interventions on policy issues have been restrained and understated, lowering the tension that Mr Kinnock's 'back me or sack me' manner used to generate. 'Neil was like a nervous street-fighter,' one NEC member recalls. 'Smith has the confidence to say little and let things pass him by because he feels secure about his arguments and positions.' A similar message emerged from this week's shadow cabinet. First, the leader listened patiently to the arguments of the pro-referendum minority. He then pointed out why he disagreed, that a majority were with him, and the importance of the principle of cabinet responsibility. Calmly adding that, while he had welcomed a debate, it was now time to apply that principle, he then asked if anyone disagreed? 'There was silence,' a witness relates. This behind-the-scenes example of what Mr Smith likes to call, in a characteristically legalistic phrase, 'analytical reasoning and persuasive exposition', has been employed to good effect elsewhere. In an unreported meeting with senior union leaders 10 days ago, he swiftly dispelled the potentially damaging impact of a speech Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader, made at the TUC conference, advocating devaluation. The Labour leader simply explained that Edmonds' view was not the party line and requested that the barons adjust their rhetoric accordingly. There was no dissent. Quietly too, Mr Smith has strengthened his grip on party policymaking, ensuring that he will chair a new Joint Policy Committee that will, in effect, filter out those deemed unhelpful on Labour's voyage back to the polling booths. None of this, of course, diminishes the mountain Labour has to climb. The charges against Mr Smith, that he is a plodder, that he lacks imagination, that he naively believes in the 'one last heave' solution to Labour's electoral ills, are far from answered. But the prime minister now knows that at every Question Time from now to the next election, he runs the risk of playing the punchbag and handing Labour a twice-weeky telly-opportunity for the evening news bulletins. The end of party politics has been postponed.</p>

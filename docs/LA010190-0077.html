			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: HOPES ARISE WITH THE DAWN OF A NEW DECADE  </P> <P> Like birthdays, years divisible by 10 have a special aura about them. In the  case of our private birthdays, the aura gets darker and darker as the numbers  go up. Turning 50 has a chill about it, like a cloud passing the face of the  sun, and let us not speak of 60 at all.  </P> <P> The world's birthdays have no such darkening auras, and it is a small miracle  of our lives that no matter how dark things have been for the individual or the  world up through Dec. 31, New Year's Eve always carries the hope that things  will change for the better. The hope may be as thin as a penlight at the end of  a very long tunnel, as it has often been in wartime. But the hope is there,  because things have always gotten better before, or so you tell yourself as the  bells ring and the horns toot in the crisp night air.  </P> <P> Even in the hard, realistic light of New Year's morning, a guarded optimism is  at very least an allowable state of mind.  </P> <P> And if the old year has ended up in a rush of good news, personal or  collective, as this one surely has collectively speaking, then the new year  begins with a sense of possibility that is headier than any Champagne.  </P> <P> The year 1989, lately dead, and the ending decade have been memorialized and  analyzed to a true fare-thee-well. And seeing the bits of film and tape,  hearing the litany of new voices discovered and familiar voices gone still, and  glimpsing again the triumphs and the tragedies, it is impressive to realize how  much we've all borne witness to.  </P> <P> But, as Mort Sahl once remarked in an album title, the future lies ahead, and  the view from New Year's morning is indubitably ahead. Not to those  intimidating resolutions. Yes, yes; we're all going to eat less and exercise  more and save more and be better persons in each and every way, at least  through Wednesday.  </P> <P> Resolutions, unreal to begin with, tend to have rather short lives. On the  other hand there are hopes -- and the first day of any year is nothing if not a  time of hope -- that should last longer than the resolutions.  </P> <P> I hope, for example, that the movie makers will rethink the prevailing  conventional wisdom that only home runs count. Singles and doubles have a place  in the Hollywood scheme of things too. Those swollen budgets, averaging $18  million to $20 million but occasionally peaking at twice that or more, have  deprived the movies of one of their greatest strengths -- variety. Variety in  size, themes, tone, casting.  </P> <P> The argument always is that little pictures cost as much to distribute as big  ones so you're better off making big ones that have more selling points. The  trouble is that the big budgets carry timid compromises, like barnacles.  </P> <P> There are signs of hope already in the success of modest-cost films such as  "sex, lies, and videotape," "Do the Right Thing" and even, in its limited  showings, Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V." The hope at last is for more hope.  </P> <P> I hope the television networks read the handwriting on the screen about their  still-declining share of prime-time viewing. They are losing to cable, to  independents, to VCRs. Indeed, their share of viewing time may be even lower  than the measurers can measure.  </P> <P> And what, the networks might well ask, are their viewers viewing instead? Even  less objectionable programming, which is to say, even blander and more  derivative stuff? Not exactly. A lot more sports, certainly, on cable, which  feeds an evidently insatiable appetite in the society.  </P> <P> Beyond sports, what we watch appears to be a mosaic of what you can only call  the good stuff, films and specials for cable (the networks abandoned variety  shows too quickly), plays, documentaries, profiles, news in breadth and depth  and, not without a touch of irony, the best of what network television did in  the past, the excellence of which now also carries a heavy icing of nostalgia.  </P> <P> The networks' old quest for LOP (Least Objectionable Programming) is obviously  an inadequate response to the new challenge they face. The hope is that they  will try upgrading their offerings to a viewership that is now anything but  captive.  </P> <P> Television's not a wasteland; never was, entirely. There were oases in the  thinnest of times, and the medium's inventiveness and immediacy have at their  best been spectacular. The power of television's news coverage increasingly  shapes history as well as recording it. But even here the networks are under  siege from CNN and other quarters.  </P> <P> The hope, I think, is for a counteroffensive by the networks, taking risks and  showing their undoubted muscle, instead of cutting costs and plotting spinoffs.  </P> <P> I can't say I hope, but I wish that the pop music I hear seemed to originate  deeper in the soul. For a time in the '60s particularly, the voices of rock  spoke for a generation and reflected, early on, its angers and concerns, its  rejection of what it saw as outworn values but its essentially positive  aspirations for change.  </P> <P> Today much of what I hear, or read about, seems to me to reflect the  disenchantment of senders and receivers. It's hard not to sense a strained  quest for commercial novelty, preferably built on shock value. Cynicism  pervades the music, or probably more accurately the industry.  </P> <P> It seems no accident that the possibility of a Beatles reunion holds such  fascination for so many, or that the individual Beatle tours have done so well.  There is a terrific nostalgia for the (relative) innocence and the romantic  idealism that their music carried in the '60s when they owned the world.  </P> <P> It is also no accident that someone like Bruce Springsteen, who has a point of  view and whose attraction is therefore lyrical as well as musical, should  command such a following.  </P> <P> (I remember watching a 1965 rehearsal of the Byrds and a young man beside me  shouting, "This is it! Facade show business is dead!" It isn't; it just uses  megawatt amplifiers and wears artfully torn jeans.  </P> <P> My hope, I guess, is that out there somewhere are new composer-musicians who  are looking beyond a facile and fashionable cynicism to find new angers and  concerns. It may well be beyond them, but we can not give up the possibility of  change.  </P> <P> There is a banquet of subsidiary hopes lurking about.  </P> <P> I hope the theater will rediscover the lean, sophisticated musical as an  alternative to the overwhelmingly spectacular musical. I hope for the spirit of  Rodgers and Hart, as well as revivals of Rodgers and Hart.  </P> <P> I hope the Los Angeles Theatre Center will hang in there, while more and more  customers find their way to it and discover that it is a safe and exciting  oasis in an undeniably off-putting part of downtown. The operating losses have  not dimmed Bill Bushnell's daring as a producer, and I hope they never will.  </P> <P> I hope the writers of crime fiction will ease off on drunken private eyes and  serial killers; both are becoming not so much bores as trivializations.  </P> <P> To end on a more cosmic level, I hope -- no, I pray -- that Mikhail S.  Gorbachev holds his own against the troglodytic Old Guardsman who undoubtedly  lie in wait for him. He has diverted us all from a collision course with  catastrophe. The world is not free of terror or terrorists but it is  immeasurably saner than it was a year ago, and a hope for more of the same fits  this morning like none other.  </P></p>

During the meeting, Hu Jintao first extended greetings to  President Lacalle from President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li  Peng. He said: Although the CPC delegation's visit to Uruguay  has been very short, we were welcomed and treated warmly by the  Blanco Party and the Uruguayan Government. Hu Jintao praised  Uruguay's social stability, continuous economic development,  independent and peaceful foreign policy, and active  participation in international affairs. He said that Uruguay has  become a respected member of the Latin American and  international communities.    Speaking on the international situation, Hu Jintao said: The  world currently is undergoing drastic and complicated changes.  The old world structure has collapsed and the new one has not  yet been formed. China and Uruguay should strengthen  cooperation with the masses of developing countries and make  concerted efforts to establish a fair and rational new  international order.    President Lacalle stated: At present, ongoing changes in the  world indicate that China is becoming one of the world's most  important countries. Uruguay places great hopes on  strengthening its friendly and cooperative relations with China.  I hope that our relations will not only be limited to the field  of trade. We should also strengthen our ties in the political,  cultural, and other fields.    President Lacalle continued: At present, in the unstable and  changeable world situation, countries sharing common interests  should form economic blocs to make the best use of their unified  strength. South American countries hope to form a large  community and to turn our region into an important region of the  world. Hu Jintao said: China praises Latin American countries'  efforts in promoting regional unity, and I sincerely hope that  the integration of Latin America will succeed.    Hu Jintao and his party arrived in Montevideo on the evening  of 18 April to begin a friendly visit to Uruguay. On the same  evening, the CPC delegation and the National Leadership  Committee of the Uruguayan Blanco Party held working  consultations. Both sides briefed each other on their party and  national situations and exchanged opinions on international  issues of common concern and on ways to further strengthen  bilateral ties. After the talks, the National Leadership  Committee of the Uruguayan Blanco Party gave a party to welcome  the CPC delegation.</p>

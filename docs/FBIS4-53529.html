			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Crafty Ruse"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Ichiro Ozawa and other  ultra-rightists of Japan are openly making haste with the  completion of legal preparations for military expansion  overseas, raising a terrific hue and cry over "a security  crisis" with regard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated recently that  the government was examining "emergency legislative  arrangements" for the reaction of the "self-defense forces" in  "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, taking issue  with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. And the general director  of the defense agency and the chief cabinet secretary also said  that practical preparations for "security emergency legislative  arrangements" had been completed by and large.    The "security crisis" advertised by the Japanese rulers is a  sheer fiction. No one threatens or intends to attack Japan  today.    Their outcries over "a security crisis" are a sophism for  justifying their hostile policy against the DPRK and their  scheme to stage a military comeback to Korea.    In actuality, the reactionary ruling circles of Japan,  peddling the ware of "security crisis," are seeking to establish  "an emergency system" and "a wartime mobilisation system"  through the "security emergency legislative arrangements"  against "an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and  legally gratify their desire of military reinvasion.    Japan has made all military and material preparations for  reinvasion. What remains to be done is to create a legal  foundation allowing it.    In advertising "a security crisis" over the "nuclear issue"  of the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries also intend to prop up  the unstable present government by sidetracking the attention of  the Japanese people.    The militarists manipulated by the force of Ichiro Ozawa are  wringing their own necks in the suicidal act of getting  overheated in the reinvasion moves while crying for the  establishment of "an emergency system." The Asian people are  highly vigilant against the reinvasion moves of the Japanese  right-wing reactionaries.    The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters should face the  reality squarely and give up their foolish attempt to repeat the  past crimes.</p>

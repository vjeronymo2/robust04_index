			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Business school to probe competitiveness of City THE London Business School is to conduct a wide-ranging independent investigation into the competitiveness of the City of London, it was announced yesterday. Funding of Pounds 1.5m for the City Research Project is being provided by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City. Professor Richard Brealey, Professor of Corporate Finance at the LBS, will be project director. The investigation is expected to take three years. Its purpose is to identify and, where possible, to quantify the elements making up the City's competitive position. They will be compared with those of other financial centres - particularly New York, Tokyo, Paris and Frankfurt. The corporation's initiative follows consultations with the Bank of England and the Department of Trade and Industry. Professor Brealey said yesterday that the main thrust of the research programme would be identification of 'the key determinants of competitiveness and how these are shifting over time'.</p>

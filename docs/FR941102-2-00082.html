The PRA Implementation Plan was developed to ensure that the increased use of PRA methods and technology in nuclear regulatory activities would be implemented in a consistent and predictable manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. The purpose of the workshop is to inform the public of NRC activities related to increasing the use of PRA methods and techniques in regulatory applications and receive public comments on these activities. The principal focus of this workshop will be PRA applications for commercial power reactors and while the NRC presentations will be broad in nature, NRC staff representatives will be present to address specific areas of concern or specific line items in the PRA Implementation Plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> November 28, 1994_Advance notification of intent to attend the workshop, desire to comment or make a presentation during the workshop, or both, is requested by the NRC.

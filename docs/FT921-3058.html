			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (2): 'We can still catch them' - A fervent believer in Europe's potential JACQUES STERN, former chairman of Groupe Bull and doyen of French computer industry executives, embodies the hopes, ambitions and contradictions of the European information technology industry. He believes passionately that Europe can, despite its current weakness in data processing markets, catch up with the US and Japan if it puts the right technology policies in place. He remains steadfastly optimistic about Europe's potential despite years of failing to cajole its major firms to work together. And he is sharply critical of initiatives that spend public money on programmes that he believes are destined to fail. He is concerned, for example, about Esprit, the European Commission driven programme in precompetitive research designed to give European companies experience in working together. He explains that when Viscount Etienne Davignon, EC vice president from 1977 to 1984, initiated the community's R&amp;D framework for IT, he saw Esprit as the first step towards a European industrial policy for IT. Davignon had failed to persuade the leading electronics companies to work together on product planning, production or marketing. Still fiercely independent, they were afraid of letting rivals in on their commercial secrets. So Esprit was launched as a pre-competitive vehicle in the hope that working together in research might inspire collaboration closer to the market. That hope was never fully realised and, with time, the gulf between research and the market has widened. At that time Davignon was Commissioner for both research and industry. Today, research and industry report to two different Commissioners. 'Esprit is not at fault, neither are the people managing the programme, who are doing a good job in Brussels. But governments can question spending large amounts of money from one precompetitive program to another if there is no industrial application. The final goal of Esprit must be to bring in cooperation innovative and competitive products to the markets that serve real needs.' The second phase of the Esprit programme, finishing this year, represents a Community investment of more than Ecu3.2bn. Mr Stern now heads the Advanced Computer Research Institute, a small research organisation based in Paris. He is unwilling to talk about his research, fearing the moment is not right to reveal progress, but he is known to have an abiding fascination with the development of supercomputers, which he likens to the creation of a Formula One racing car. The emphasis, he points out, is on doing everything faster. Just as competition improves the breed, so techniques developed for supercomputing eventually filter down to more mundane levels of computing: 'If you are not active in this market, you lose these skills.' Supercomputing is also a market controlled by US and Japanese companies. By the turn of the century, Mr Stern worries, there will be more supercomputers in Japan than in the US, with Europe trailing hopelessly if nothing is done. Supercomputers will soon be used for many commercial tasks including the design of automobiles and aeroplanes and buildings where their ability to 'visualise' structures and forces in three dimensions can improve quality and shorten design cycles. Much of what Mr Stern advocates these days turns around the idea of conserving Europe's information technology skills for the future - a holding operation while the community thrashes out an effective industrial policy for electronics. He sees a powerful opportunity with the advent of open systems, the emergence of hardware and software from different manufacturers that works easily together. He believes that all new computer products will soon be based on standard microprocessors of the risc variety. Risc, or reduced instruction set computing, is a technology which trades off simple microprocessor chips against complicated operating software. The result can be very fast chips which, linked together in networks, generate enormous processing power. The advent of risc and open systems is proving one of the few major disjunctions in a business which, despite the rate of change, is often predictable. Mr Stern says: 'It is easy to forecast what is going to happen; the difficulty is to say when.' There are only a handful of risc chip designers - International Business Machines, Sun Microsystems, Mips, Hewlett Packard as well as Intel, Motorola and Disitel Equipment. Groupe Bull has recently signed an agreement with IBM which gives it access to the computer giant's risc technology, a deal which Mr Stern believes was both fortunate - IBM was seeking new markets for its risc technology - and essential. Without a source of risc technology, Bull would have been cut off from the leading edge of open systems developments. There are a number of prerequisities for success in risc. First, considerable expertise in the design and fabrication of microprocessors. Second, experience in the kind of complex software - optimising compilers - which makes the best use of the advantages of the risc chip. Third, volume sales to give economies of scale. Mr Stern suggests that short term alliances with the US manufacturers of risc technology could give European suppliers a breathing space to devise ways to collaborate on the development of indigenous risc processors. But with Europe's semiconductor manufacturers in disarray and trailing behind the US and Japanese producers, has not Europe missed the bus on chip manufacturer? Mr Stern is unambiguous: 'You cannot drive innovation if you do not control the hardware.' European electronics may be sickly, but it has hidden strengths, he argues. There is, for example, software engineering, an area where European companies are equal to any in the world. Software engineering involves the development of methodologies, technologies and software which make it simpler to write computer programs. Software productivity has become a key issue in business with projects notoriously overunning on time and budget. Software engineering, which essentially aims to turn program production from art to engineering discipline, has a key role to play in improving matters. Mr Stern's prescription to return Europe to health involves a strong lead from Brussels with the full support of the national governments of the community. It would strengthen Europe's indigenous players through alliances with companies overseas, while seeking ways to help small, innovative companies. It is some years since Mr Stern has publicly set out his ideas on the rejuvenation of the European industry, but time has dulled neither the urgency nor the content of the message.</p>

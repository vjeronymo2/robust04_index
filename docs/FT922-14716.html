			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Private View: Silent, violent, and nobody's pawn - Lennox Lewis, the British contender for the world heavyweight boxing championship, talks about hype, stardom, money and . . . chess THIS WEEK, by way of a change, I took on the British and European heavyweight boxing champion, Lennox Lewis - and beat him. He opened carefully, but soon launched an attack that had me pinned in the corner. With a flurry of vicious exchanges, I managed to haul myself off the ropes and dash for the open. Then, by a fluke, I found the shot to drop him. Checkmate. But Lewis, British contender for the world heavyweight crown, is a natural chess-player and if he had not just done five rounds in the ring with Mike 'The Duke' Dixon, his sparring partner from Atlanta, Georgia, I think he would have mashed me At 6ft 5in and 16 1/2 stone, Lewis is big, strong and handsome. But he is also a thinker and light on his feet. Watching him at training in a west Country gym this week I was reminded of Muhammad Ali, The Greatest, and Lewis's boyhood hero. Boxers do not have to be thugs. There were five professional boxers in the converted cider farm this week where Lewis is training for his fight with Derek Williams, the Commonwealth champion, in London's Albert Hall on April 30. The others were 'Pepe' Correa, Lewis's new trainer, Harold Knight, assistant coach - both from America - and Tex Woodward, the gym's English owner. Forget the grunts and thud of body blows, the shouts and flying sweat, the heavy beat of the rap music. Here was a group of gentlemen in pursuit of the noble art. I squared my shoulders, poked a punch-bag and felt a twinge of envy. Whether Lewis wins the crown or not (he is ranked fourth in the world but his path to current champion Evander Holyfield is not clear), he sees himself as Ali's heir, a boxer who uses his brains. 'I'm a deep thinker, very deep,' he told me. 'My friends call me 'chemist' or 'scientist' 'cause I'm always thinkin' and always one step ahead. That's why I like chess.' I asked Lewis how he became a boxer. What were you like as a child? 'I would say I was quiet, very playful. I liked to fight, and I liked competition. What about schoolwork? 'I was quite good. The only thing I would say that interrupted it would be boxing. But I did finish high school.' Lewis was born in east London 26 years ago of Jamaican parents (he did not know his father). When he was 12 his mother Violet took him and his elder brother Dennis, who now works for him, to Toronto. At school in Canada the other kids mocked his Cockney accent. 'So I would go and fight them all the time. After about the third time getting the strap from the principal - he's a nice guy - he said I should get into contact sport because I was an aggressive kid.' Were you? 'I would say more hyperactive. I wanted to do everything. I was into everything. So I took up boxing and I seemed to excel so I stuck with it.' Lewis had played American football and soccer and won a basketball scholarship from high school. But boxing was his element. He won the World Junior Championships and Commonwealth Games and then the superheavyweight gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. Three years ago he turned professional, accepting a bid from the English stable run by Frank Maloney. The principal backer was Roger Levitt, now his commercial manager, who invested Pounds 1m in pursuit of his dream of begetting Britain's first world heavyweight champion for 100 years. Levitt is perhaps better known as the head of the failed financial services group who has been remanded on bail for alleged fraud. I asked Lewis why he chose to come back to England. 'I could come over here and not be mixed up in the hype. The most important thing to me was control over my career and destiny. Most boxers don't have that. They gave me more control - basically every decision I have the final say over, where I want to train, who I want to fight. I would hate for my career to be wrecked by another individual. I would rather it be wrecked by me. 'I look at the dark side of boxing - the bad promotions, bad opponents they pick, the money they would take from you. I want to make sure there's nobody ripping me off or using me in any way. 'I hate the critics that don't know anything about boxing. They go out there and say 'I like to see you throw more punches' and not realise what you go through.' I asked him whether he would be able to sack any or all of his own team if he wanted. 'Let me tell you, I employ all of them. You have to remember, without me they have nothing.' But you are still only 26. Can you really be self-sufficient? 'That's why I bring my mother into it, She advises me on certain decisions. She can only advise me - but mothers always get their way in the end if they really want it] I bring my brother into it.' Lewis may be a soloist, a chess player, but I wondered how aggressive he was in the ring. How do you think of your opponent? I asked. 'I don't have any hate for him. It's more like a competition. I'm there to outdo him, to hit and not be hit.' Do trainers tell their boxers to beat their opponents' brains in? 'I feel that's the wrong way to teach a guy. Maybe that's a way of motivating them but I don't need that kind of motivation. I'm more the silent, violent, deadly type. I would say I'm more vindictive because if a guy hits me I'm going to hit him back three times for every one. You're not supposed to hit me.' Are you afraid you'll end up with scrambled brains? 'Well, like I said, there's people that's made for boxing and people that aren't. My style is the art of hitting and not being hit. There's always some risk but there's risks in everything.' Have you met anyone who has made you afraid? 'I haven't met anyone like that, really. No. If I feel threatened something else comes out in me. It's like putting a cat in a corner and he has nowhere to go. The cat will leap at you and start clawing.' One boxing critic I've read said you sometimes look bored. 'Because of my talent. I'm a natural boxer. I don't have to work as hard as a lot of people. I can go out and run five miles where another heavyweight will be struggling. That's what separates me from a lot of boxers. They're brought into the ring because they're no good at anything else.' Is there a danger you might get a big head? 'There's always that danger. But I've never had a big head, right from the beginning. People look at me as some star. I don't. I look at myself as an individualist trying to reach a goal.' But you don't have that killer mentality. 'No, because boxing is a controlled violence. If you look at most of the guys out there, after the fight's over they're huggin', which is the good thing about the sport.' You might think a heavyweight boxer like Lewis was the safest person in the world. But it seems that other men, especially when they are drunk, cannot resist provoking him. 'If a guy comes up and challenges me for a fight I laugh it off as a joke. Yeah, I've had guys try and hit me.' Have you had to put someone on the floor? 'I've sort of controlled them down. If a guy is drunk and he can't fight I won't knock him out. If a guy takes a knife out on me . . . more times I'll go away from things like that because I think: I could hit him, but I could hurt my hand. Or I could hurt him, kill him.' Thinking of former champion Mike Tyson's sentence for rape I asked Lewis how women reacted to him. 'A lot look at me and say 'that guy's got plenty of women falling all over him.' It's not necessarily true.' He is wary of feminine wiles. 'I've had women sending nude pictures in the mail, following me home. It's really bad like that. There's certain rules I stick by. I watch who's following me, I watch myself when I'm out drinking. Women have different ways . . . ' Do you have a girl friend? 'I plead the Fifth Amendment.' How much does money mean to you? 'You can always make money at anything. But how many people actually become champions? I'm a gold medallist and that means more to me than money. When I die and I go away I'll always have that in the history book. I don't want to become a billionaire.' What are your weaknesses, then? 'I would say I give people too much of a chance. I've been told that.' You mean you don't like confrontations? 'Exactly. That's me. If I have to, I will. I have to psych myself up to do it. If someone takes a liberty with me, then I'm very quick to put them in their place. I would say I'm shy, too. I'm not as outspoken as people would want me to be.' Lennox Lewis sometimes sound too good to be true. But if he has the mean streak he claims, I did not find it. If you became world champion, would you try and do something to improve the sport's image? 'Definitely.' What example would you set? 'I would like to be a role model. A lot of athletes out there don't realise that there's young kids looking up to them. Boxing taught me control over my aggressiveness as a youngster. And I think it builds character. It builds a man to have a controlled fight with a guy and then be friends. That's why I stress to you, when people say 'fighting', it's not fighting, it's boxing.' Thanks very much, I said. 'Want a game of chess?'</p>

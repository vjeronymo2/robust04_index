			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and his entourage  returned from a two-day official visit to France late last  night. The talks demonstrated that the French partners have been  very well informed about the political situation in Slovakia.  They have expressed sincere interest in cooperating with us in  numerous spheres. Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik granted  an interview to our editor Magda Pospisilova last night, after  his arrival by air from Paris.    [Begin recording] [Pospisilova] When you were received by  French President Francois Mitterrand, it took almost an hour  instead of the planned 35 minutes. This attests to the success  of your trip. Can you tell us something specific?    [Moravcik] I was very pleased by the president's interest in  the events in Slovakia and our foreign policy, especially  Slovakia's endeavors to integrate with the European Union. I  had enough time to explain our policies to the president. I  stressed that the presence of France in the center of Europe,  and Slovakia as well, was very important from the point of view  of stability in Central Europe and that of the stability of all  Europe.    The president was also intensely interested in our relations  with our neighbors--he was, above all, interested in relations  with Hungary. I explained our policy aims in this sphere in  great detail, and I can say that my explanation met with great  understanding on the part of the president.    [Pospisilova] The result of all this is also the fact that  Mr. Mitterrand accepted an invitation to visit Slovakia.    [Moravcik] Yes, I conveyed an invitation from our president,  and I can say that the president accepted this invitation with  genuine and real interest.    [Pospisilova] When will this official visit take place?    [Moravcik] We assume that it will take place in September.  It is now a technical question--we must agree on a suitable  date for both sides.    [Pospisilova] You said during all of your meetings in Paris  that we ourselves were capable of agreeing about bilateral  questions with Hungary and that we did not need the mediating  role of the European Union. How did the French side accept your  words?    [Moravcik] With great respect, above all, when we explained  our approach toward the solution of the open questions that  remain between the two countries. There are no problems in this  respect.    [Pospisilova] You had talks with former French President  Giscard d'Estaing about the significance of political parties in  creating stability in Central Europe. What should our political  entities do for this?    [Moravcik] The basic idea is very simple. I think it is  being implemented in practice in our political life. A  political party structure similar to that in Western Europe  should be created. It is very important because the  significance of direct cooperation between the political parties  is growing.    [Pospisilova] How many of the big economic projects that you  discussed in Paris will be started by the end of September--that  is, by the beginning of the elections?    [Moravcik] It would be good if there were as many as  possible.    [Pospisilova] Which ones specifically?    [Moravcik] We would be very glad if we could make progress  in  completing the building of Mochovce [nuclear power station];  there is also a chance that cooperation in the sphere of the gas  industry will become more dynamic. We are interested also in  cooperation in the automobile industry and in the participation  of French firms.    [Pospisilova] So far, you have talked only about what you  agreed with the French representatives. What are the open  questions?    [Moravcik] [passage omitted] As for the Bratislava metro, I  expressed our view--that we considered this project very  interesting because it was of a high technical standard, but, in  view of our current economic situation, we had to consider in  greater detail whether the economic possibilies existed for it.    [Pospisilova] You also had talks with Minister of Defense  Leotard. Did you discuss possible cooperation in the arms  industry?    [Moravcik] Such cooperation is being considered. I think it  would be for the benefit of our industry. [end recording]</p>

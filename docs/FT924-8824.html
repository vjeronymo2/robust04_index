			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Fresh focus at the White House The first report a US president gets each morning is prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency and tells him about potential trouble spots overseas. This tradition is part of a web of institutional arrangements that focus a president's attention on foreign policy and defence rather than the economy or domestic issues. Mr Bill Clinton says his presidency will be different. He intends to 'focus like a laser beam on the economy' and has told his transition team to concentrate initially on economic appointments, such as secretary of the Treasury, rather than secretary of state. Politicians of President George Bush's generation were young adults during the 1950s when the US enjoyed an overwhelming economic advantage. Confronted by a hostile Soviet Union, they naturally took the economy for granted and focused on diplomatic and military challenges. The world looks different to a baby-boomer such as Mr Clinton. In the two decades since he left Yale, the US has lurched from one economic crisis to another: productivity growth has slumped, imports have soared and the living standards of many families have stagnated. After the cold war it makes sense for him to focus on economic renewal. Without faster growth, he can neither make good his social promises nor, ultimately, preserve the US's status as the world's sole superpower. Yet Mr Clinton's hopes of focusing on economic and social challenges could be dashed once he reaches the Oval Office. Even if he is spared a foreign policy crisis in the first months of his presidency, there are enough simmering kettles - from the Middle East to the Balkans and the former Soviet republics - to occupy him 24 hours a day. To keep economics to the fore, Mr Clinton's advisers are planning to create an economic security council headed by a economic security adviser, that would play an economic role somewhat analogous to that of the National Security Council and national security adviser. The hope is that a high-powered economic council would devise a strategy for US economic renewal in the post- cold war world rather as the NSC developed the 'containment of communism' defence strategy in the late 1940s. Just as General Brent Scowcroft, the current national security adviser, hovers at Mr Bush's elbow, so an economic security adviser would stick like glue to President Clinton, ensuring that he always took the economic effects of decisions into account. To replace experts on arms control by experts on trade and financial markets has a certain appeal given that the main threat to American hegemony is now economic weakness. The objection to a new advisory body, however, is that there are already too many centres of economic power, including the Treasury secretary, the budget director and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Conceivably one of these could play the hands-on advisory role of an economic Scowcroft; alternatively, the president could redefine the role of existing agencies such as the NSC and insist that candidates for top foreign policy posts have economic expertise. If Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, say, were to become Secretary of State and an economist were appointed in place of Gen Scowcroft, the Clinton administration might not need an a new advisory body. On the other hand, the difficulty of co-ordinating advice from different economic agencies - which frequently disagree on policy matters - would remain. All the relevant cabinet officers, including the trade representative, the commerce and labour secretaries and perhaps a new industrial policy czar could have seats on an economic security council and thus help formulate long-term strategies. Some analogies between foreign and economic policy, however, are false. A president can order swift action to counter a military threat; he cannot exert the same rapid leverage over the economy. (The only individual with real executive power over the economy is the Federal Reserve chairman and he must consult fellow governors and regional Fed presidents before acting.) On economics, the challenge Mr Clinton faces is less in restructuring White House institutions than in changing attitudes - in convincing both the public and Congress that 'quick fixes' do not work. After labouring for a decade to promote growth in Arkansas, Mr Clinton must know that a quick fiscal stimulus next year will not solve US problems. As president, his main long-run challenges are to raise the secular national savings and investment rate, reform the healthcare system and improve the quality of education and training. Raising the savings and investment rate will require more than an investment tax credit. Much tougher budgetary controls, perhaps including the explicit means-testing of popular entitlement programmes, such as pensions, as well as controversial tax reforms to deter consumption will be essential. If Mr Clinton is to fulfil pledges on infrastructure, education and healthcare he may even need a new source of revenue such as a national value added tax. This economic campaign will be at least as tough as the fight against communism; it will require consummate negotiating skill, congressional co-operation and sustained effort over years, if not decades.</p>

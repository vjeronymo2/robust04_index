			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> TWA Lowers Fares: TWA announced savings of up to $160 off its lowest fares to  attract passengers to the fall and 1990 travel seasons. The company's "lowest  fare guarantee" ensures that even if TWA's fares are reduced after tickets are  purchased, passengers will be refunded the difference, and they will be allowed  one "free" travel date change without penalty. Tickets can be purchased any  time before Sept. 1 and from Sept. 9 through Dec. 15 for domestic travel, and  for international travel from Oct. 1 through May 21, 1990.  </P></p>

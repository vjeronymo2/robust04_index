			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Observer: Jaws in line for vice Temperatures are rising at the Bundesbank. Besides the strains of defending unpopular policies, it has the small worry of who will succeed Hans Tietmeyer as the German central bank's vice-president when he steps up to replace Helmut Schlesinger in the coming summer. One likely candidate, evidently allowed a much higher profile recently, is loquacious Reimut 'Jaws' Jochimsen, president of the Dusseldorf regional central bank and a former economics minister for North Rhine- Westphalia. The 59-year-old won attention in Britain four months back when the text of one of his speeches turned out to contain remarks - withdrawn before he spoke - that the principal obstacle to an EMS realignment was 'prestige'. Black Wednesday was not far behind. An ex-academic whose views defy easy categorisation, he is variously described by domestic and foreign commentators as a hawk or a dove on the one hand, and as pro- or anti-European on the other. But as he's a staunch SPD member, his politics certainly fit - redressing the balance after the solid rightwing bias at the top since Karl Otto Pohl resigned. Bundesbank-watchers say Jochimsen was limbering up for the vice-presidency during last week's council meeting, at which as many as six members apparently voted for rate cuts, leaving only a three-strong majority for no change. Jochimsen acted as the conciliator and is credited with engineering the eventual compromise of nudging down money-market rather than official rates. Nice to think that the Bundesbank's already highly delicate task is being complicated by further personality games.</p>

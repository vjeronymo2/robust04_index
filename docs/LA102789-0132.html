			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WGA EXPRESSES 'CONCERN' IN AGENCY-WRITER FLAP;  </P> <P> MOVIES: GUILD SAYS THAT ALLEGED THREATS AGAINST WRITERS WOULD VIOLATE ITS  'BASIC AGREEMENT.' CREATIVE ARTISTS AGENCY HAS DENIED CHARGE BROUGHT BY WRITER  JOE ESZTERHAS.  </P> <P> One week after a screenwriter's allegations against Creative Artists Agency  President Michael Ovitz surfaced in the press, the Writers Guild of America,  West has issued a cautiously worded statement saying that it "views with grave  concern threats of interference with a writer's career opportunities from any  quarter, including agents and/or employees."  </P> <P> The statement, released Thursday, came in response to a four-page letter in  which screenwriter Joe Eszterhas alleged that Ovitz threatened his career after  he announced plans to leave CAA to join his longtime friend, Guy McElwaine, at  rival International Creative Management. Eszterhas, one of the industry's  highest-paid screenwriters, has authored such hit films as "Flashdance" and  "Jagged Edge."  </P> <P> After news of the letter appeared in the press, the writers guild's electronic  bulletin board -- which enables members to "talk" to each other through their  computers -- lit up with messages urging the guild to take action in support of  Eszterhas.  </P> <P> "If any of us has been attacked, we have to see this as an attack on all," one  guild member wrote. "We can't let a writer's success or lack of success isolate  a member from whatever strength this organization can muster . . . Joe E. may  not need the guild to fight for him but the guild needs to stand with him."  </P> <P> "That took guts," another guild member wrote, "I absolutely agree that the WGA  should back him 100%. How many of our rules for agents does this break?"  </P> <P> "Assuming the letter is the genuine thing, which seems more than likely," came  another response, "I would like to extend to the brave Joe Eszterhas my support  and approval of what he's doing here in two ways: Maybe a message from his  brothers and sisters, and maybe a strong message to our BOD (board of  directors) . . . "  </P> <P> Leaders of the guild -- which represents 7,500 TV writers and screenwriters --  met with CAA officials "to express and discuss its position and to seek a  resolution of the matter," according to the statement. "Furthermore, the WGA  has made inquiries of CAA and Mr. Eszterhas and sought certain  acknowledgements, assurances and representations."  </P> <P> The statement released by the guild was approved by both CAA and Eszterhas.  </P> <P> "It is the position of the WGA that were such threats to issue from an agent,  and/or were such threats to be carried out, directly or indirectly, there would  be a serious breach of the (guild's) Basic Agreement (which serves as a legal  contract between talent agents and guild members)," the union said in its  statement.  </P> <P> CAA, said the guild statement, "acknowledged that any threats to a client of  interference with his or her career opportunities and actions undertaken to  carry out such threats would be a serious breach of the Basic Agreement." CAA  also assured the guild that "it does not condone the use of threats for the  purpose of inhibiting a client from exercising a legal right to terminate or  change representation."  </P> <P> Eszterhas' letter reconstructs purported portions of conversations Eszterhas  had with Ovitz and an underling, agent Rand Holston, in late September after  the writer told Ovitz he was leaving CAA to join McElwaine, one of his oldest  friends in the business.  </P> <P> According to Eszterhas' letter, Holston warned the screenwriter that Ovitz  would go out of his way to damage his reputation with studio executives and  that CAA would withhold its stars and directors from his projects. "Mike's  going to put you into the . . . ground," Holston is quoted as saying in the  Eszterhas letter.  </P> <P> Both Holston and Ovitz have declined comment on the letter. But the agency  issued a statement last week denying Eszterhas' version of events, and released  a letter from Ovitz to Eszterhas in which the CAA president said his  "recollection of our conversation bore no relationship to your recollection.  </P> <P> "I want to make it eminently clear that in no way will I, Rand or anyone else  in this agency, stand in the way of your pursuing your career," Ovitz added in  his letter. "So please, erase from your mind any of your erroneous anxieties or  thoughts you may have to the contrary."  </P></p>

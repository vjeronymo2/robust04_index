Guides 1.13, 1.89 and 1.97; Oyster Creek is a single unit facility with no adjacent units to rely upon in the event that a design basis were to disable the fuel pool cooling system; and Oyster Creek has not docketed any material with regard to BWR design deficiencies identified in the 10 CFR Part 21 Report of Substantial Safety Hazard (November 27, 1992) of Messrs. Lochbaum and Prevatte, and thus Oyster Creek may be in violation of NRC regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Petition is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The Petition has been referred to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this Petition within a reasonable time. By letter dated October 27, 1994, the Director denied Petitioners' requests for an immediate suspension of the operating license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A copy of the Petition and the Director's letter are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, NJ 08753. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of October 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William T.

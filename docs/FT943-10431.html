			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Greek flight safety warning Greek air traffic controllers, whose five-month go-slow has caused long delays in aircraft arrivals and departures, have said they cannot guarantee the safety of flights. After a union meeting, at which the controllers voted to continue with their work-to-rule protest in pursuit of higher pay and a more modern air traffic control system, an official said 'the safety level of flights is at a critical point' and that employees were not responsible for this. However, a Transport Ministry official warned the government could force the controllers to return to their normal work rate. News reports have speculated that this might mean putting them under Defence Ministry jurisdiction, which makes it illegal for them to strike.</p>

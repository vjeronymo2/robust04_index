			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Motor jobs fall by the wayside: The sector's sharpest post-war decline BY the spring of this year, some 70,000 motor industry-related jobs will have been lost in the UK over 24 months, according to an estimate by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The estimate is necessarily a fairly broad one, embracing losses not just at the main vehicle manufacturers, importers and large component groups but also the myriad small parts suppliers and the retail motor trade. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing 12,000 motor traders, says about 25,000 of those casualties will have occurred among car and truck dealers in just 12 months, as a long-awaited sales recovery has not materialised. Instead the industry has plunged into its sharpest postwar decline, with car sales down 30 per cent from the record 2.3m of 1989 to 1.59m last year, and commercial vehicle sales sliding to nearly half 1989 levels. Both trade groups have used the figures recently in Budget submissions to the chancellor, trying to secure the abolition of special car tax and other aids to kick-start the industry into recovery. The statistics make bleak reading for an industry which can claim to be not only the country's largest manufacturing and exports sector, but also its biggest single retail activity. The industry still directly employs about 700,000 people. But the figures are not quite as dismal as they seem. Like the further round of Ford and Vauxhall job losses announced yesterday, they incorporate the natural wastage and voluntary redundancies involved as the UK industry fights to get itself into the leaner, more productive shape it needs to survive the 1990s. Both Ford and Vauxhall emphasised that their cuts were not directly recession-related, and Rover Group, the British Aerospace subsidiary, made much the same point about many of its job cuts announced last year. Altogether, 2,000 jobs were lost from Rover's 40,000-strong workforce, virtually all through voluntary redundancy and natural wastage. The impact of recession was felt mainly through short-time working, affecting about 1,200 workers for several weeks. Some manufacturers, however, were hit not just by the UK recession but by reduced sales in big export markets as competition, particularly from Japan, stiffened. Jaguar saw 1,500 jobs go, not all voluntarily. Another Ford luxury-car unit, Aston Martin, lost 85 out of 535 jobs. Rolls-Royce, which suffered a near halving of its worldwide sales last year, has lost 750 jobs at its Crewe headquarters and closed its Mulliner Park Ward plant in north London, with the loss of a further 500. Truck makers have been hit proportionately harder. Leyland DAF, the UK-Dutch venture, is expected to cut another 1,200 UK jobs in the next two years, having lost 600-700 in each of the past three years. Iveco Ford, second in the UK truck market, has cut its workforce by 500 in the past year to 1,400  -although its cuts, too, have been achieved through natural wastage or voluntarily. Smaller cuts among manufacturers such as the Cheshire-based ERF have contributed to the SMMT and RMI's overall job-loss total. Things would have been worse last year had not buoyant Continental markets kept vehicle production to within a few per cent of the 1990 level. The creation of extra employment by Japanese manufacturers offsets some job losses. Last month, Nissan surprised the industry with a plan to lift capacity at its Sunderland plant to 300,000, from 220,000 next year, involving the creating of an extra 1,000 jobs. Toyota's car plant at Derby will add 3,000 jobs from the end of this year, and Honda's plant at Swindon another 1,400. That presumes - as Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, asserted last week  -that the new Japanese transplants 'don't simply move jobs from Dagenham to Derby'.</p>

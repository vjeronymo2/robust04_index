			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Your flexible friend - Inland Revenue A NEW look Inland Revenue will be emerging over the coming months as the government's Next Steps and Citizen's Charter initiatives get fully into gear. Some policies may be subject to change depending on which party wins the election next month, but many developments are already in train and are likely to proceed regardless of the outcome. The most obvious changes beginning to appear are linked to the Revenue's adoption of the Citizen's Charter. For the next tax year, it is committed to dealing with 90 per cent of all correspondence received from taxpayers within one month, and at least acknowledging receipt of letters for the remaining 10 per cent. From the end of April, 17 tax inquiry centres around the UK will experiment with flexible opening hours, some starting at 8am and other closing as late as 8pm. A programme for redesigning leaflets and tax forms has started, and the first new tax form - for appeals and postponements - will appear later this year. A new style of income tax form is expected to follow by April 1993. A more fundamental change comes with Next Steps, an ambitious restructuring of the operations of the Revenue announced last year, which begins on April 1. About 96 per cent of staff will pass from central control into 34 executive agencies. The idea is to divide the operations of the Revenue into small, focused business units, with devolved management responsibility and accountability. Each agency will have a named 'customer service manager' able to deal with the public. The initiative will not be immediately obvious to individual taxpayers, but they may benefit indirectly if the principle of improved efficiency and administration enshrined in Next Steps works as planned. Phase two of Next Steps, unveiled earlier this month and still under development, would create a three-part structure of Revenue offices. There would be a series of local 'taxpayer assistance offices', designed in a way officials compare to a travel agency or building society, attractively set out and located in city centres. The offices would be staffed by employees able to offer basic advice, provide tax forms and leaflets, and make simple amendments to tax records such as adjusting an individual's tax code. The aim would be to allow problems to be dealt with on the spot. Routine administrative work would be concentrated in a limited number of 'service centres'. The centres would both send out tax assessments and process the returns, replacing the current system of separate tax and collection offices in tax districts around the country. New technology should help speed work. In the longer term, Revenue officials hope to have a single named person to whom every taxpayer can turn to deal with their affairs.</p>

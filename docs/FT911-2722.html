			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Trading account ends on sombre note ANOTHER official warning against optimism on domestic interest rates and disappointing GNP figures from the US left UK shares unsupported as the two week equity trading account came to its close yesterday. The popping of champagne corks in the offices of one leading UK marketmaking firm apparently celebrated the end of its unusual financial year rather than any specific view on the stock market. The new trading account in equities extends for three weeks and covers the period of the local elections in the UK; these are expected to test the popularity of Britain's governing Conservative party. The market yesterday repeated the trend of recent trading sessions by edging forward from a slow start but quickly running out of support. Equities were on the downside for most of the session and extended their losses when Wall Street responded negatively in early trading to news of a drop in US GNP over the first quarter of the year. London managed a modest rally as Wall Street steadied to show a fall of only 3 Dow points as the UK market went home for the weekend. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,471.3, a net 10.8 down on the day. Seaq trading volume increased to 536.5m shares from Thursday's 463.8m but the higher turnover reflected increased inter-market business. The stock market has fallen by just over 54 FT-SE points, or about 2 per cent, over the two week equity account which closed last night. Most of the fall came this week as the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industries warned of a deepening economic recession. The Bank of England's signal to the London money markets that interest rates should stay at 12 per cent for the present was no great surprise for the equity market which has resigned itself to waiting for some time for any further good news on the interest rate front. Government bonds, which had been easier throughout the session, fell in late dealings following the US data on gnp and inflation. Longer dated bonds ended with losses ranging to about  3/8 of a point. The trickle of equity rights issues, which is draining away institutional cash holdings, continued, although yesterday's calls were modest; Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank called for Pounds 49.3m and McAlpine, the construction group, for Pounds 38.8m. A poor interim statement from Guinness Mahon did little to lift the gloom which has descended over the UK corporate sector this week as the evidence of recessionary pressures has strengthened. Equity strategists, while still optimistic for the end of the year, predict that shares may move sluggishly over the second quarter of 1991. After the substantial improvement seen in February and March, trading volume has fallen away sharply and is struggling to maintain last year's average daily levels.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foreign mining companies hope to strike it rich in Cuba - Attractions that make the Caribbean island 'a promoter's dream' THE OFFICES of Joutel Resources in Toronto could easily be mistaken for a Cuban trade promotion agency. Gloosy coffee-table books featuring the Caribbean island lie in the reception area. Geological maps of Cuba dot the walls, and pictures of Cuban government officials line the chairman's bookshelf. The company last summer became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Its exploration manager and another geologist will move there soon in the hope of striking rich on the three properites, totalling 1.2m acres, to which Joutel now has exploration rights. Joutel is by no means alone. BHP of Australia, the UK's RTZ, and Inco, the Toronto-based nickel producer, are among others rumoured to be seeking a foothold in Cuba. US companies are barred from direct involvement by Washington's long-standing economic embargo. Metall Mining, a subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has already agreed to spend CDollars 1m (USDollars 756,000) over four years to acquire a 25 per cent interest in one of Joutel's properties. Another junior Canadian company, Caribgold Resources, also recently signed a joint venture with Geominera. As in the Joutel deal, costs will be equally shared by the Canadian and Cuban partners. Summing up both the risks and rewards, Mr Barry Allan, mining analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, describes Cuba as 'a promoter's dream'. It is 'genuinely an under-explored area', he says, while cautioning that 'you're talking about very early grassroots exploration and that's a high-risk activity'. Mr Hugh Harbinson, Joutel's chairman, says that 'our ambition is to find three deposits in three years.' Joutel will be looking primarily for gold, but also for a variety of base metals. Under the agreement with the Cubans, the company has up to eight years to prepare a mine feasibility study. It plans to start an airborne geophysical survey in January. Pointing to the geological map on his wall and to some colourful rocks on his desk, Mr Harbinson notes that Russian geologists have already done a good deal of preliminary exploration work in Cuba. Joutel and Caribgold each claim that several hundred mineral occurrences have been catalogued on their properties. As further evidence of Cuba's mineral wealth, the Canadians point to three nickel mines in Oriente province, on the south-east tip of the island, which have been sizeable suppliers to the former Soviet Union. The Canadian companies are being backed by a group of securities firms, including Gordon Capital and Thomson Kernaghan of Toronto and Yorkton Securities of Vancouver. They are in the process of raising CDollars 4m, mostly from Europe, to finance Joutel's share of exploration costs. Caribgold recently raised CDollars 8m. Thomson Kernaghan described Cuba in a recent research report as potentially 'one of the best new places to invest in Latin America'. It cited the island's volcanic origin, educated population and the willingness of the Castro government to allow foreign investors to repatriate profits and dividends. Mr Harbinson is unconcerned by the threat of political instability. He says that no other claims have been registered against Joutel's properties and 'we're going on the assumption that any new government will honour our contracts'.</p>

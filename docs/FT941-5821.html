			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Observer: Unsold Carr The death at 81 of one of Britain's more interesting novelists, James Lloyd Carr, probably means that another piece of the jigsaw concerning the late unlamented Robert Maxwell will never quite be slotted into place. Carr once told a colleague the tale of how, in the late 1980s, a Rolls-Royce drew up out of the blue outside Carr's modest house in the sleepy Northants town of Kettering. Out stepped Cap'n Bob himself. Carr wouldn't disclose the details of the conversation, in order, he said, to avoid further embarrassing Maxwell's family. He restricted himself to depicting Maxwell's massive ego. But Maxwell's visit almost certainly was to try to buy Carr's tiny publishing company, Quince Tree Press, which never achieved an annual turnover exceeding five figures; Carr specialised in miniature chapbooks, maps and some of Carr's own novels. Maxwell was turned down; making Carr not just a lovely novelist, but also a very canny publisher.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, Feb 2 (TANJUG) -- President of the Republic of  Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic and a European Union delegation,  headed by the new head of the E.U. monitors in the former  Yugoslavia Konstandinos Yerekostopoulos, on Wednesday called for  a resumption of the negotiating process for the resolution of  the conflict between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia.  Martic said in a talk with the E.U. delegation in Knin, the  RSK's political centre, that the Serbs in the RSK expected of  the E.U. monitors only objectively to report on the struggle of  the Krajina Serbs for bare survival. Martic said the only way  to assist the warring sides was to enable the RSK and Croatia to  separate in a civilized manner and to live as two neighbouring  states. Martic said it was an illusion to insist that the  Krajina Serbs and Croats live in the same state. Peace must be  achieved first and a political solution sought only then, Martic  said.    Greek Ambassador Yerekostopoulos, for his part, said the  talk  was constructive. He set out that his country, which chairs the  E.U. for the first six months of this year, would continue  making efforts for the resumption of the peace process and its  successful conclusion.    The ceasefire between the RSK and Croatia was last weekend  extended until February 28. The `Christmas' ceasefire agreement  was reached on December 17 last year. The RSK was three years  ago proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated territories of  the then Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession  from the former Yugoslav Federation and the attempt of its  authorities to turn Serbs from a constituent people into a  minority. Although the RSK has been a U.N. Protected Area  (UNPA) since March 1992, Croatia has carried out aggression on  it three times since in the hope of establishing its authority  there.</p>

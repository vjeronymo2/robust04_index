			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Civil Service numbers attacked MR QUENTIN Davis, a Conservative MP, yesterday attacked the government's record in curbing Civil Service numbers and called on ministers to follow the lead of the private sector and privatised industries in improving productivity. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told a sub-committee hearing of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that efficiency improvements had been offset by policy decisions which had increased activity in the Civil Service. Executive agencies would deliver greater efficiency, he said.</p>

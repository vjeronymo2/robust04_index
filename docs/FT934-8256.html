			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (8): Philosopher speaks with the voice of reason - Pasqual Maragall / Barcelona's mayor, a Mr Fixit in public matters, is also a reflective scholar WHILE the public image of Pasqual Maragall is that of a can-do mayor, who organised in his home town what are generally considered to be the best Olympic games to date, the private persona is a deeply reflective intellectual. Mr Maragall is something of a philosopher mayor, who likes to discuss Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, in the way that a philosopher king such as Frederick of Prussia talked about Voltaire. He toys with Sir Ralf's ideas about the 'centre of gravity' between civil society and politics, between individual egoisms and general welfare. Running a big city, which is what he has been doing for 11 years, since he was 41, allows him plenty of scope to test and to formulate theories. Mr Maragall may be a mayor, but he is also a scholar who studied at New York's New School for Social Research and taught economics at Barcelona University before he was drafted into city politics. The city, says Barcelona's mayor, is where a proper gravity can be established, where tensions can be overcome. He goes on to make bold claims: 'What Europe really has in its favour is a system of cities.' He asserts that Europe's true roots, and therefore its best projection to the future, lie 'not in the nations, not in the regions, but in the cities.' In Mr Maragall's view, nations and regions rest on identity and are exclusive - and that spells trouble. The cities are inclusive, and those who live in them know that collective identity is not enough. The urban nucleus, which is confined and complex, has historically ensured 'contacts' between its different components and established a 'system of minimum guarantees'. The upshot is that those who live in a Manchester, a Hamburg and a Barcelona will always be able to 'understand each other', because the very stresses of city life impose the 'minimums' and the 'contacts'. The same cannot be said, Mr Maragall argues, 'for a Bosnia or a Flanders'. The mayor believes Europe 'is going to be terrified of its diversity' and that, because of this, the true value of cities will be realised. The cities will become, if not exactly islands of mutual tolerance, at least 'safety nets' where peaceful co-existence can be practised. Mr Maragall dismisses the Hollywood vision of blade-runing urban wastelands as a specifically 'American nightmare'. The city is not the enemy of the human in Europe, and certainly not in Barcelona. In the philosopher mayor's fiefdom, the gravitational pull is rational and reasonable.</p>

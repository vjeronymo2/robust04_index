			<p>Turkey   <F P=102>   944K0991C Yerevan AZATAMART in Russian 30 Mar 94 p 5 </F> <F P=103> 944K0991C </F> <F P=104>  Yerevan AZATAMART </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Echo of Batman Explosion Heard on </F> the Bosphorus"]    [Text] The rivalry seen with respect to routes for  exporting the main wealth of Azerbaijan and Central Asia--oil  and gas--to the West has acquired new overtones over the past  two weeks.    As we know, the main rivalry that has developed with respect  to laying the pipeline, which promises huge profits, is between  Russia and Turkey. Although this issue also affects the  interests of Armenia, Georgia, and Iran, these countries can  only indirectly influence the selection of a plan from among  those available.    The Turkish plan envisages the laying of pipeline along the  routing Kazakhstan-Azerbaijan-Iran-Turkey, following which the  oil will leave the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in tankers and  travel westward. In agreement with this routing on the whole,  the West has expressed the desire that the pipeline pass through  Armenia instead of Iran. This would preclude its dependence on  the unpredictable Iran.    The routing proposed in the Moscow plan differs radically  from the Turkish proposal and entails laying the pipeline from  Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan across the Northern Caucasus to  Novorossiysk, where tankers would transport the oil to  designated delivery points.    Whereas Ankara's program seemed preferable to the West over  the initial period, Russia's increased influence over the past  year is presently forcing a more serious look at the  Novorossiysk version.    As a counteraction to this version, Ankara is now presenting  before diplomatic and political circles the issue of review of  the treaties on use of the Straits, providing justification for  this by virtue of concern over the ecological state of the  straits in the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara, and  over the safety of the population of Istanbul situated in the  path of the oil tankers.    Ankara has already been attempting for a long time now to  effect a review of the Montreux Convention and obtain greater  control over the Straits. The Turkish arguments have become more  convincing following the collision of two Cyprian tankers in the  immediate offshore area of Istanbul, as a result of which  significant quantities of oil spilled into the sea. Turkish  firefighters required three days to extinguish the flames, and  the oil has not yet completely come to the surface.    Turkish diplomats are trying to use this pretext in the best  way to reinforce their demands for a review of the convention  and for an immediate reduction in the volume of oil transported  through the Straits.    Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Cetin has already  declared that tanker movement through the Straits will be  reduced. This wholly contradicts the points stipulated in the  Montreux Convention. Such a position would inflict a strong blow  to Russia's economic and political interests, and in returning  to its prior geopolitical space, Moscow can hardly be expected  to tolerate a disregard for these interests on Turkey's part.  The latter realizes this full well and, in order to avoid  leaving Moscow out of the game, has proposed a new  variant--initially deliver the oil out of Novorossiysk to  Samsun, and from there to Ceyhan. This routing would allow the  Turkish side to control the significant section of the pipeline  that passes through its territory. During the days of the uproar  over the accident in the Bosphorus, when the Novorossiysk  version was threatened and chances once again appeared for the  Baku-Ceyhan routing, explosions resounding in Batman again  reminded everyone of the Kurdish factor--one of the main  arguments against the Turkish alternative. This is the fourth  such instance occurring in the southeastern region of the  country. The first three took place along the Shrnak segment of  the Baghdad-Ceyhan pipeline, and the damage they caused did not  turn out to be very significant only because the pipeline has  not been operational since the Gulf War.    The disruptions in Batman have turned out to be far more  substantive. According to American sources, the damage comes to  about $60 million. A very large-scale oil production combine,  built in 1955, is situated near this little city, with its  60,000 inhabitants. What occurred in Batman provides a weighty  argument against exporting oil across Turkish territory. As a  result, serious factors currently stand in the way of both sets  of plans. Whereas Turkey may attempt to exert pressure in the  Straits issue, it cannot ignore the problem with the Kurds.    The lack of desire and inability of Turkish leaders to  resolve the Kurdish problem over the course of decades is once  again threatening the country's economic progress. At one time  terrorist acts inflicted an extremely serious blow to the  development of tourism, which brings in tremendous revenues. But  the obstacles that stand in the way of the Russian routing are  surmountable. There need only be renewed discussion of the  provisions of the Montreux Convention and a decision made. And  so, following serious rivalry over influence in the Caucasus and  Central Asia, as a result of which Ankara had to hang its head  and quit the region, we now await a new and important struggle  surrounding the question of status of the Straits.</p>

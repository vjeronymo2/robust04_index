			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: LIT recovers to Pounds 1.29m The strength of its UK operations helped LIT Holdings to produce a much improved result for 1991. Pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.29m for the year compared with a loss of Pounds 344,000 in 1990 for this financial services group. Turnover was Pounds 83m (Pounds 91.1m) but operating profits from Johnson Fry rose 50 per cent from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 2.4m and LIT America contributed Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.52m). Both businesses are seasonal, so the bulk of profits were accrued in the first half when the pre-tax profit was higher at Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 838,000). Central charges fell to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.45m) benefiting from the refinancing of short-term debt into medium-term debt and redeemable preference shares. Dividend payments on these shares took Pounds 203,000 after which losses per share were reduced to 1.4p (3p).</p>

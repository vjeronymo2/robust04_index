			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERBIANS VOTE; COMMUNISTS TRY TO KEEP POWER  </P> <P> Serbians cast ballots Sunday in a referendum called by the republic's ruling  Communists, who are attempting to retain power by exploiting rising Serbian  anger over ethnic Albanian separatism in Kosovo province.  </P> <P> The referendum asks voters in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six  republics, to approve a Communist political program that calls for the  enactment of a new constitution before promised multi-party elections.  </P> <P> The Communists have proposed a constitution that eliminates virtually all  autonomy for Kosovo, where the 1.7-million-strong ethnic Albanian majority has  called for independence. The Albanian demand has outraged the rest of Serbia.  </P></p>

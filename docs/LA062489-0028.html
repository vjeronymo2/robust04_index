			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STARTING A NEW CYCLE;  </P> <P> JOHN WILLIAMS EXCHANGED HIS BASKETBALL FOR A BICYCLE AND RESOLUTELY PEDALED TO  A BERTH ON TEAM USA  </P> <P> The colors seized him. Splashes of reds, yellows, blues, greens. They poured  past the ever-widening eyes of John Williams so swiftly he could hardly  distinguish where one hue started and the next began.  </P> <P> His expression was that of a youthful Norman Rockwell subject staring into a  kaleidoscope for the first time. He leaned closer, squinted, then pulled back,  trying to focus on the array of darting figures before him.  </P> <P> "I was blown away," said Williams, still fascinated by the vision four years  later. "Just the colors, there was so much accent. I didn't even know what was  going on, but I was so into it."  </P> <P> Williams, 25, known as Scooter since childhood, was hooked.  </P> <P> He had experienced more than a roadside view of his first cycling race. The  Mountain View Criterium, which the small town just south of Palo Alto no longer  plays host to, served as Williams' direction.  </P> <P> "Sitting there watching that race," Williams said, "I decided I wanted to race  bikes."  </P> <P> This April, 3 1/2 years later, Williams received a tattered envelope. Several  forwarding addresses were scribbled over the face of the letter, which  eventually landed in the mailbox at his parents' home in Agoura Hills. In the  upper-left corner was the emblem of the United States Cycling Federation.  </P> <P> The note inside, signed by USCF Executive Director Mark Hodges, asked Williams  to race for Team USA, the Olympic development program based in Colorado  Springs, Colo. Williams treated the correspondence like it had Ed McMahon's  picture on it.  </P> <P> Am I the John Williams whose life is about to change?  </P> <P> "It was totally a shock to me," he said. "I got this letter and thought it was  a mistake. I actually called Mark Hodges to say, 'This is John Williams. I  received a letter. Are you sure I'm the right person?' "  </P> <P> Hodges, who had heard reviews of Williams' racing through a track manager at a  San Jose velodrome, assured him he was.  </P> <P> "John's going to be quite an asset to Team USA in the future," Hodges said.  "He's really, really fast. I see him challenging some of the guys in '92."  </P> <P> That's 1992, as in the Year of the Olympics.  </P> <P> Yet the trail from criterium clod to Olympic hopeful can be considered smooth  only if one takes into account the trials preceding.  </P> <P> Scooter Williams was first and foremost a basketball player.  </P> <P> At 6-foot-2, he was an All-Camino Real League guard while at Serra High, a  private, all-boys school in Gardena. Before graduating in 1982, Scooter three  times led the Cavaliers as far as the playoff quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Scooter, of course, is a basketball player's nickname. Cyclists are called Ulf  or Franz or Alexi, and are not given nicknames because their real names are so  colorful anyway.  </P> <P> In fact, when Hodges received a recent inquiry about "this Scooter Williams  kid," he asked, "Scooter who? You mean, John Williams?"  </P> <P> Uh, right.  </P> <P> Williams was raised a mere double-dribble from the Great Western Forum, when it  was known simply as Fabulous. He mixed it up on the playgrounds of Inglewood  with the likes of Laker Byron Scott, former UCLA and Boston Celtic swingman  Kenny Fields and Milwaukee Buck guard Jay Humphries.  </P> <P> He was going to be a basketball player and in 1982 headed off to Stanford with  a full scholarship and a world of expectations packed neatly away in his duffel  bag. What he found instead was a new coach -- Tom Davis -- new rules, and,  finally, a situation that became very demoralizing.  </P> <P> In three seasons at Stanford, Williams scored 49 points and had 22 rebounds. He  played in just 16 games. In 1984, at the start of his junior season, he  suffered a stress fracture in his right foot.  </P> <P> Still not healed, Williams red-shirted his senior season with the intention of  returning. He never played for the Cardinal again.  </P> <P> When healthy, he got little playing time. When injured, little encouragement.  So Scooter Williams began his arduous transition to John Williams.  </P> <P> At the time, he placed much of the blame on Davis, whose first season at  Stanford coincided with Williams'.  </P> <P> "When I was there, it got to the point I wanted to leave," Williams said. "I  thought of transferring. Several times, I'd sit in my room and cry.  </P> <P> "I took myself away from the players, the involvement, the people. People I  loved. Friendships I had formed that are, now, still really good friendships.  It was quite an emotional time for me. I hated him.  </P> <P> "I didn't like to come home to see my high school friends, because I was  embarrassed that I didn't play. I was supposed to play."  </P> <P> Davis, who now coaches at the University of Iowa, remembers Williams as a  "unique" and "lively" personality and recalls his emotional difficulties as  relatively typical.  </P> <P> "What he was going through was normal," Davis said. "I think any time you're  looking at players who are not in the starting lineup or the starting rotation,  it's always a difficult relationship. It's just a matter of trying to accept  that role and not being broken by it. I thought Scooter was handling it well."  </P> <P> On the exterior, perhaps. But Novian Whitsitt, a friend and fellow guard at  Stanford, saw a hurt in Williams' eyes that far exceeded the hurt in his right  foot.  </P> <P> "Scoot usually didn't wear his heart on his sleeve," said Whitsitt, who works  for the Pacific 10 Conference in Walnut Creek. "But if you knew him, you knew  he was in a lot of pain.  </P> <P> "There were conflicts with the coaches. He felt he should be playing more. And  then the injuries came. Scoot was a talent in basketball that really went  untapped."  </P> <P> Williams, attempting to draw one more basketball season from what was once a  wellspring of promise, spent several hours a day in the training room during  the latter part of his junior year. The recovery process included tedious  sessions on a stationary bike, when he stared at the same concrete wall day  after day, rigorously pumping to the beat of his own rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Eager to break away from the training room, Williams bought his first racing  bike -- a secondhand, $650 Italian-made Somec. The original owner threw in a  pair of tattered cleats to seal the deal. Whitsitt, who set up the transaction,  took Williams on his first ride through the hills of Palo Alto the same day.  </P> <P> "I was worn out," Williams said. "I think it was about a 20-mile ride. And what  seemed like really large hills were just rollers."  </P> <P> Not long after that ride, on a warm Sunday afternoon, Williams and his  girlfriend, Alicia Costantino, mounted their bikes for a lazy ride through  Stanford's surrounding communities. They happened upon Mountain View and the  rainbow of racers.  </P> <P> "I stayed there the whole day," Williams said. "On the way home, I remember  having a real good ride because I was so hyper about it. I went home and shaved  my legs. I was going to look the part."  </P> <P> All that was left was to become the part.  </P> <P> When his training regimen finally reached what he considered a competitive  level, Williams registered for a race in San Jose on Memorial Day weekend,  1986. He bought his first hard-shell helmet the night before. As it turned out,  he never really got going fast enough to use it.  </P> <P> Four miles into the race, he was dead tired. Six miles in, 36 miles from the  finish line, he was lucky. The rear tire of his used Somec found a piece of  glass and blew out. Williams was done, and somewhat wiser for the experience.  </P> <P> "I was glad," he admitted with a typically wide smile. "I got off, picked up my  tire, and went back. I was really kinda happy.  </P> <P> "I knew after that I would have to start working."  </P> <P> Williams became a regular on the hills and paths in and around Palo Alto. He  joined the Stanford Cycling Club and enlisted the help of experienced cyclists  in the Bay Area. Upon graduation from Stanford in January, 1988, Williams put  his degree in economics to good use by manning the cash register at a local  bike shop.  </P> <P> Then, another race, this one at UC Irvine. And, another disaster.  </P> <P> With his friends and family in the crowd, Williams was buried again.  </P> <P> "I got dropped," he said flatly. "No flats, no excuses. I just got dropped. And  I was so embarrassed. I was coughing after the race. It was so hot and I was  just winded. I vowed to myself at that point, that I would never be that  embarrassed again."  </P> <P> John Williams was obsessed.  </P> <P> A breakthrough came in the second race of the 1988 season. The evidence hangs  over the Williams' family Mercedes in their two-car garage. The old Somec is  suspended on two nails. Along the head tube, just above the front fork, a  serpent-like gouge rakes all the way to the underlying metal. Williams pointed  to the scar and recalled a day in Sonoma.  </P> <P> "I was training hard, getting stronger," he said. "In that race, I crashed, got  up and finished 12th.  </P> <P> "Then I knew I could compete. I knew I could finish a race."  </P> <P> Top 10 finishes started to come, including a fifth in the California road  racing championships in Lancaster early this month.  </P> <P> He had come a long way from the day he cheered a blown tire. The tears he had  shed in his Stanford bedroom were all but forgotten.  </P> <P> "John is real, real intense," Hodges said. "Almost too intense sometimes. It's  sometimes like he's striving to be perfect.  </P> <P> "It usually takes quite a bit of time to develop these skills, but we'll have  him for at least the next three years. I know he's a heck of a rider."  </P> <P> Williams said that he would officially sign with Team USA after this year's  USCF Senior National and Road Criterium, held July 11-20 in Park City, Utah.  Team USA provides a monthly stipend, coaching, mechanical support, equipment  and clothing. His goal is a top 10 finish.  </P> <P> "I kind of thrive on the pain of it now," he said. "When I first started it, I  quit when I hurt. I like the pain of it now. I like climbing and hurting. I  enjoy hearing people suffering behind me. I enjoy that feeling."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Listing of Actions, Failures, and Refusals That Subject Individuals to Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer, and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08. Therefore, the Director is not approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 823&hyph;24) will be modified to reflect this decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

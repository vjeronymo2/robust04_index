			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the  state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee,  has stressed the need to hold elections in the occupied  territories within three months, adding that this depends on  Israel's approval.    In a statement to DPA broadcast yesterday, President  Abu-'Ammar urged the Security Council to quickly adopt a  resolution condemning the massacre, which claimed the lives of a  number of Palestinian worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.    Brother Abu-'Ammar said providing security for the  frightened  and infuriated sons of the homeland in the occupied territories  is more important than other issues. Brother President  Abu-'Ammar described Israel's refusal to renegotiate the already  signed agreements as an attempt to gain time. He added that the  Israelis are playing tactical games and are not willing to  provide anything tangible.</p>

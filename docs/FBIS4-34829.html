			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee  and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade], has reiterated that  beginning today, banking institutions such as Bancor [Banco  Nororiental de Venezuela], La Guaira, and Amazonas will begin  paying depositors up to 100,000 bolivares upon presentation of  their bankbook. Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report:    [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this statement after she was  summoned by the congressional Finance Commission regarding the  granted financial assistance. Aguirre had said only depositors  in Caracas will be paid today.    [Begin recording] [Aguirre] Only offices in Caracas will  make  payments while offices in the interior will begin payments  tomorrow. Concerning Banco Amazonas, its Caracas offices will  open at 1400.    [Cayone] Will payments be made only upon presentation of a  bankbook [word indistinct]?    [Aguirre] Yes. Payments will only be made in this manner.  [end recording]    [Cayone] Meanwhile, Deputy (Jorge Roy) has said the Radical  Cause Party will file criminal charges in the coming days  against the Finance Ministry, the Banks Superintendency, and  Fogade, because that party believes the granted financial  assistance violates the General Banking Law.    [Begin (Jorge Roy) recording] All financial assistance that  has been granted in the past days must comply with Article 314  of the Banking Law, no exceptions. Article 314 clearly  stipulates that no financial assistance can surpass the total  amount, whatever it may be, which Fogade collected during the  previous year or the previous two semesters. Fogade never  collected more than 100 billion bolivares in 1993; therefore,  the granted financial assistance should not have surpassed 200  billion bolivares.    We asked Aguirre about this issue today, and she said she  should have an answer ready by tomorrow, because her lawyers are  studying the case. We are totally convinced this financial  assistance is illegal, because it should have never surpassed  100 billion bolivares. As soon as we have Aguirre's report, we  will proceed to file the corresponding charges. [end recording]</p>

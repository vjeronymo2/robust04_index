			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Nikolayev under the "Demands" rubric: </F> "Novosibirsk Leaders Do Not Believe Rybkin's Promises"]    [Text] State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has met in Moscow  with representatives of Novosibirsk Oblast trade unions who  asked the speaker to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the  region. Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that they  informed Ivan Rybkin that the production slump in the oblast has  "reached critical mass," beyond which "a disintegration of  technological links sets in," and urged the speaker for taking  "effective measures."    For his part Ivan Rybkin promised to help resolve the most  acute problems in order to stabilize the economic situation in  the region. However, "What this help is going to be and when  could it be forthcoming was hard to understand from what Mr.  Rybkin said," stated Viktor Babakov, head of the oblast's Trade  Union Federation. He thinks that "promises cannot improve  things" today, all the more so because they were given to  Novosibirsk people at various levels in the past and have not  been acted upon up to now. In the meantime enterprises are  grinding to a halt in the oblast one after another, forcing  nearly 30 percent of the personnel to go on administrative  vacations.    Mr. Babakov stated in this connection that the oblast's  trade  unions demand that the Russian Government immediately send an  authoritative commission to resolve the socioeconomic problems  on the spot. The Novosibirsk trade unions intend to insist on  modifying the tax policy and adopting a state employment program.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1906(a)(2) requires every individual entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to receive Medicaid to apply for enrollment in a cost-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective group health plan as a condition of initial or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued eligibility for Medicaid. However, under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1906(b)(2), enrollment in the group health plan is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of initial or continued Medicaid eligibility for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child if a parent fails to enroll that child. We also note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that where a Medicaid eligible spouse (for example, a wife)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot apply for enrollment in her husband's group health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan if her husband fails to enroll her, she will not lose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of his failure to enroll  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her. This is because the section 1906(a)(2) requirements do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to a Medicaid eligible spouse who does not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the independent ability to apply for enrollment in a cost-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective group health plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Services Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1906(c)(2) of the Act, an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment in a group health plan does not change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual's eligibility for benefits under the State plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, under section 1902(a)(25), Medicaid is a payer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last resort with respect to services covered under the group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health plan. In other words, the group health plan's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment is considered primary to any Medicaid payments. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State must pay for services covered under the State plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are not otherwise included in the group health plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the terms and conditions applicable to all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid recipients. States must establish their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to pay for Medicaid services that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included under the group health plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that some providers that participate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group health plans may not be Medicaid-participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers. Of course, States should always encourage all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers to participate in Medicaid. However, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest of State flexibility, we are offering several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options that States may elect to resolve problems that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arise from non-Medicaid-participating providers furnishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services to Medicaid recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, States that deem providers to be Medicaid-participating providers merely through the submission of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bill for services to the State Medicaid agency (as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently permitted for qualified Medicare beneficiaries)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may similarly do so for providers in cost-effective group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health plans. In lieu of this voluntary provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement, States could require that all providers in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-effective group health plan bill States directly for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual charges on services provided to Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients. In other words, States may deem all providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in cost-effective group health plans to be Medicaid-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating providers by billing the State directly for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any care or services provided under the group health plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but which are not fully paid by the group health plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, States may ascertain what percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers in a group health plan participate in Medicaid,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and incorporate that percentage into the determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a group health plan is cost-effective. If the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that fewer than a certain percentage (specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the State) of all providers in a group health plan are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not Medicaid-participating providers, the group health plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be cost-effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If either of these options is not feasible for a State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we will allow a State to reimburse recipients directly in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event a recipient is billed directly for any care or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services provided under the group health plan, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan, but which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not fully paid by the group health plan. We will allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to pay recipients directly where a State demonstrates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that failure to do so would render section 1906 of the Act a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nullity. A situation in which the provisions of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1906 could not be effectuated but for direct payment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients presents extraordinary circumstances sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to justify direct payment to recipients. Under any of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios, a State would have to pay for all cost-sharing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations, even if such costs are above the State's usual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid rate for services provided to Medicaid recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the State agency must pay for an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollee's premiums for a group health plan determined cost-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective, and for all deductibles, coinsurance, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items and services otherwise covered under the State plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 1906(a)(3). Further, when a non-Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible family member must first be enrolled in a group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health plan in order for the Medicaid eligible member to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive coverage, section 1906(c)(1)(B) provides that where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is determined to be cost-effective (taking into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of all such additional premiums), Medicaid payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is available for the premiums (but no other forms of cost-sharing) of the non-Medicaid eligible member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

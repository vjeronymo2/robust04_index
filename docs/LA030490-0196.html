			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD;  </P> <P> LARI PITTMAN: BREATHING LIFE INTO HIS ART  </P> <P> FACES  </P> <P> One of Lari Pittman's goals with his new suite of paintings, "Beloved and  Despised, It Continues Regardless," was to make the work alive. So alive, in  fact, that viewers would feel the paintings were literally talking to them.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make the work chattier and more conversational," said Pittman,  whose show is at La Cienega Boulevard's Rosamund Felsen Gallery through  Saturday. "I wanted you to be forced, because of the inhabitants in (the work),  to talk back at it."  </P> <P> Pittman called his new works, which include six 6-by-5-foot paintings, two  massive 10-by-8-foot paintings and an accompanying suite of lithographs, "a  litany of sorts" that scrutinize human behavior and the need for relationships.  The conclusion, the 38-year-old Pittman says, is that "nothing has changed . .  . desire is still a pulsating beat for people."  </P> <P> Of course the "desire" depicted in the works isn't always your typical romantic  desire. For instance, in "This Recipe: Beloved and Despised, It Continues  Regardless," the artist has placed a pair of connected audiotapes inside a  man's reproductive organs. These organs are linked to a woman's large womb,  which is linked with an arrow to a young, pigtailed girl. Beneath them is an  ongoing traffic jam, which in addition to cars, contains mechanical items such  as radios. This, the artist says, depicts the economical basis of many  relationships.  </P> <P> In addition to his Victorian-clad figures, Pittman, who in 1983 had his first  one-person shows -- simultaneously -- at Rosamund Felsen and Newport Harbor Art  Museum, paints a wealth of symbols. They range from arrows ("a way of directing  the viewer in, around and through each piece in the same way that a good sign  would do") to coffins ("to show the discussion of death and mortality as not  inherently being a morbid topic").  </P> <P> "I don't like stingy work," the CalArts-trained Pittman says with a smile. "My  paintings are very active and full. But I always know when they're finished --  a work is finished when it comes to a real agitated, full boil."  </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> After four years of operating Merging One Gallery in Santa Monica, Diana Wong  is ready to close her gallery. She has taken out an ad in ArtNews magazine  offering the space -- which is connected to her studio and home -- for rent.  "It takes up all my time when I run the gallery," said Wong, who is herself a  painter and would like to concentrate more time on her own art. "But I will  continue doing it until I am able to lease it out."  </P> <P> Michael Kohn Gallery is the latest of those that have moved to Santa Monica.  The gallery, now at 920 Colorado Ave., is hosting its inaugural opening on  Saturday with an exhibition of new work by New York-based painter Joan Nelson.  Already moved into Michael Kohn's old space at 313 N. Robertson Blvd. is the  new gallery Martin Lawrence Modern. Martin Lawrence's current show of original  works on paper from the '60s, '70s and '80s by artist Tom Wesselmann runs  through mid-March.  </P> <P> A show at the Zero One Gallery on Melrose Avenue may literally knock your socks  off. Entitled "Inaugural Gooseflesh," the exhibition attempts to channel  Salvador Dali's spirit in a seance overseen by a professional trance-channeler.  Produced by members of the Actors' Gang and Strike Theater, the "exhibition,"  at 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday nights through March 16, includes interactive  installations relating to various aspects of Surrealism and Dadaism, as well as  a performance based in part on playwright Andrew Dallmayer's "Hello Dali."  Admission is $15. Information: (213) 466-7957.  </P> <P> OVERHEARD:  </P> <P> At Sotheby's Beverly Hills preview of an auction of the Harry A. Franklin  Family Collection of African art last Tuesday night, a well dressed crowd of  collectors, dealers, curators and artists gathered for a last look at a revered  local collection that will be sold on April 21 in New York. While a few knowing  collectors quietly speculated that a renowned Cameroon sculpture known as "The  Bangwa Queen" would break the $2.08 million record for African art, a young man  in tweeds told a well-coiffed matron in a Chanel suit, "If you dropped a  million or two at an Impressionist auction, you might get a 10th-rate Renoir.  If you spent the same amount at this auction, you could have a world-famous  masterpiece with an impeccable pedigree."  </P> <P> CURRENTS:  </P> <P> The Craft and Folk Art Museum has received two major works valued at $200,000.  The works were donated by museum trustee Daniel Greenberg and his wife, Susan  Steinhauser, and will go into the museum's permanent collection. The first  work, "Fantasy Mural" by Massachusetts-based artist Dan Dailey, is an  8-by-8-foot construction composed of 64 individually etched glass panels that  was commissioned by the American Craft Museum in New York. The second is  "Rodia's Tower" by New York sculptor Steve Linn, an 11 1/2-by-9-foot glass  sculpture that was inspired by the artist's visit to Los Angeles' Watts Towers.  . . . In other Craft and Folk Art Museum news, Director Patrick Ela says  attendance figures at the museum's new Wilshire/Fairfax May Co. home have  tripled from those at the museum's previous site, at Wilshire Boulevard and  Curson Avenue. According to Ela, weekend attendance at the museum (which opened  on the fourth floor of the May Co. in November) now ranges from 400 to 600  visitors per day.  </P> <P> DEBUTS  </P> <P> The first West Coast solo exhibition for landscape painter Lucian Burg is on  view at Marilyn Butler Gallery through March 24. Burg lives and works in San  Francisco during the winter months and paints in Vinalhaven, Me., during the  summer.  </P> <P> Painter James Griffith has his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles at  Saxon-Lee Gallery through March 31. Griffith's oil paintings, titled  "Hope/Fragments of Nature," reflect the complex impact of man on nature and a  changing world view.  </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> Santa Fe Art Colony, a 2-year-old downtown artists' loft complex housing 57  live-in studio spaces for emerging artists, is the site of an open-studio  weekend Saturday and next Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Forty-eight artists in 35  studios are scheduled to participate, including Kim Abeles, Trevor Norris,  Arnold Schifrin and Rudy Mercado. The complex is at 2401 S. Santa Fe Ave.  Information: (213) 583-4011.  </P> <P> Appraisal specialists from Butterfield &amp; Butterfield auctioneers will be at  the Newport Harbor Art Museum on Monday. For $10 per item ($5 per item for  museum members), the specialists will provide fair market appraisals for  furniture and decorative arts, antique and fine jewelry, paintings and prints,  Oriental works of art and silver. No appointment is necessary. Proceeds will  benefit the museum's sales and rental council. Information: (714) 759-1122.  </P> <P> "American Art in the Sixties," a 1972 film focusing on key figures of the  decade, will be shown Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art. Also shown at LACMA on Saturday will be "Francis Bacon," a 1986  documentary revealing how the artist's way of life affects his vision of the  world. The latter film begins at 4 p.m. Information: (213) 857-6000.  </P> <P> EARLY WARNING  </P> <P> The Smithsonian Institution is holding a four-day seminar April 24-27 in  Washington tracing major developments in American painting from the Federal  period to the Armory Show of 1913. "150 Years of American Art" will highlight  the works of John Singleton Copley, Samuel F.B. Morse, Frederic Church, Winslow  Homer, Thomas Eakins, the Luminists, and Hudson River School painters Thomas  Cole and Asher B. Durand.

Admission for all galleries and special exhibitions is now $5 for adults; $3.50  for students and seniors with I.D., and $1 for children under 17. . . . A  percentage of sales of works in Couturier Gallery's group show, "The  Environment in Crisis," will go to the Hollywood-based Environmental Alliance  for its efforts in coordinating visual art activities for Earth Day 1990.  Artists included in the show, which runs through April 7, are Kim Abeles,  Martin Betz and Richard Roederer.  </P> <P>  Suzanne Muchnic contributed to this column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

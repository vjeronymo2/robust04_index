			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Pictures of Beirut A racehorse being exercised. A convocation of soldiery. Pallid mannequins loitering. At war or at peace, Beirut is a city of the strangest incongruities and juxtapositionings. These photographs are from a portfolio of work shot this summer by Morris Carpenter, one of two winners of the first Alan Harper Bursary, which is open to photographers under 25. The Pounds 5,000 bursary was set up in memory of Alan Harper, an FT photographer who was killed while on assignment in the Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991. For his project, Carpenter, who works for Zoom Photographic, concentrated on the rebuilding of Beirut, the protection of its historical buildings and archaeological sites - and the effects of redevelopment on the survivors of war.</p>

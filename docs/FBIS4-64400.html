This year will see a rise in the amounts ploughed back into  medium-sized companies for investment purposes but small and  large industry will continue to languish, pushing the overall  figure down by about 1.9 percent, said ISCO in its six-month  report.    This figure is fairly healthy when compared with the 13.5  percent drop chalked up in 1993, said ISCO, adding that the  average fall in investments last year across the European Union  stood at around 12 percent.    An ISCO poll showed that two-thirds of companies questioned  said that they planned to step up investments next year, with  large-sized firms leading the field.</p>

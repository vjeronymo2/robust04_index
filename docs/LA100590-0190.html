			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> MIAMI ONCE AGAIN MAY TAKE SPOILER'S ROLE AS BOWDEN SEEKS HIS 200TH VICTORY  </P> <P> The plot calls for one of football's most respected coaches to earn his 200th  career victory by beating a school that has twice denied him the national  championship.  </P> <P> Reviews are mixed.  </P> <P> Thumbs up, said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who will try for No. 200  Saturday against Miami.  </P> <P> Thumbs down, Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said.  </P> <P> "If he doesn't get it this game, I'm sure he'll get it some other game,"  Erickson said. "I'd prefer he wait a week or two."  </P> <P> The game didn't need the anticipation of a Bowden milestone to sell out the  Orange Bowl. With Florida State (4-0) ranked second and Miami (2-1) ranked  ninth, the hype would have been high anyway.  </P> <P> But the Seminoles say the chance to give Bowden No. 200 against his chief  tormentor is tantalizing.  </P> <P> Bowden, 60, is 6-10 against Miami; he's 193-62-3 against all other teams.  Losses to the Hurricanes cost him a No. 1 finish in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> The odds of reaching 200 against anybody are long. Ten major college coaches  have done it, and only one is active -- Penn State's Joe Paterno, who has 221  wins.  </P> <P> The odds of beating the Hurricanes are long, too. They have won 33 in a row in  the Orange Bowl. They haven't lost two games in one season since 1985.  </P> <P> "My biggest concern is stopping them," Bowden said. "They can get 50 points as  easily as they can get 25. It's a game of inches when you play them -- you miss  one inch, and they put it in the end zone."  </P> <P> A Florida State victory would strengthen its bid for a national title and move  the Seminoles into first place should top-ranked Notre Dame slip at home  against Stanford. The Cardinal gave the Irish (3-0) a tough game last year  before losing 27-17 and played 12th-ranked Colorado tough in its season-opener,  losing 21-17.  </P> <P> A loss probably would drop Florida State several spots in the rankings. No. 3  Michigan figures to have little trouble at Wisconsin and No. 4 Auburn should  roll at home against Louisiana Tech. No 5 Virginia and No. 6 Tennessee are  idle.  </P> <P> Other games involving Top Ten teams have No. 7 Oklahoma at Oklahoma State, No.  8 Nebraska at Kansas State and No. 10 Florida at home against Louisiana State.  </P> <P> "It gets you hyped up," Stacey Satterwhite, an Oklahoma State defensive tackle,  said of the game against the Cowboys' arch-rival, Oklahoma.  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Finland attacks EU farm demand Finland sharply criticised the European Union yesterday for demanding an immediate realignment of its farm producer prices as the entry ticket to the EU. A Finnish statement issued in Brussels said the demand would require the country's farmers to halve their prices to match EU levels, creating upheaval in the markets and putting at risk a Yes vote in a future referendum on EU membership. The Helsinki government's remarks jolted prevailing optimism at the end of a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. The meeting agreed on an EU negotiating position on regional aid, Nordic agriculture, and special assistance for farmers in Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway. Diplomats said the EU's common position, though ambiguous, kept hopes alive of an agreement with the applicant countries by the target date of March 1. 'It keeps the momentum going,' said one EU official, 'Now we are ready for the endgame.' Apart from the matter of how much each applicant pays into the EU budget, the farm and regional aid issues are the trickiest in the accession talks. Norway, however, faces a special problem in the fish negotiations and could easily miss the March 1 deadline. Finland's intervention was seen in some quarters as a tactical diversion aimed at impressing its domestic audience. But Helsinki was also caught flat-footed by the European Commission's insistence on a 'big bang' price alignment supported by national aid, rather than a slow transition favoured by the Brussels agriculture directorate. It also expressed concern about a ministerial position on Nordic agriculture which stated that the EU would consider 'national long-term aids' for regions which suffered low temperatures and short growing seasons. The ministers stressed, however, that this assistance should not be linked to production or distort competition. In the talks, Spain and Portugal blocked an offer of the most generous form of regional aid - known as Objective One - to the applicant countries. Their fear is that this could lead to competing claims to the biggest pot in the structural fund budget. Instead, ministers agreed on the principle of 'analogous treatment', leaving the number of areas to be negotiated over the next three weeks. The compromise provoked criticism from Sweden which pressed for special treatment of its northern provinces, called Norbotten. Austria also dug in its heels over its demand for special arrangements covering Alpine transit traffic. It wants a nine-year exemption from the common transport policy so as to protect against traffic pollution; but Brussels is offering only a three-year transition until 1998. Norway yesterday lodged a formal protest with the European Union over last week's implementation of minimum prices on six species of white fish and Atlantic salmon from non-EU countries and said talks on the move were planned for Friday, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. It also expressed disapproval to Paris and Brussels about 'an effective blockade' in France of fish from third party countries through rigid customs and veterinary practices. These, it argued, were in violation of the European economic agreement linking the EU and the European Free Trade Association.</p>

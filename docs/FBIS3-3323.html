			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Xu Changyin (1776 7022 6892)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton indicated in Washington today that the United States can  resolve its differences with China over certain issues.    Clinton made this remark when answering a question at a  joint  press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Asked a reporter: There is now a growing call on the United  States not to link U.S.-Chinese trade issues to the issue of  human rights. What is your opinion on this?    Clinton responded: "From a long-term point of view, I  believe we can resolve this problem, strengthen relations  between the United States and China, and stress our proposition  on human rights."    Clinton added: "We have spent, and will continue to spend, a  great deal of time on handling the issue of our relations with  China. Our policy will remain as it has always been, i.e. the  issue of human rights is important, while other issues are also  important."</p>

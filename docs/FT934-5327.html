			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gencor chief cool on prospects for Billiton deal A decision about the deal that would transform Gencor, the South African resources group, into one of the world's biggest international mining and metals businesses, will be made before the end of the year, but there is a 'less than 50 per cent chance' that it will go ahead, according to the group's chairman, Mr Brian Gilbertson. Gencor announced in May that it wanted to buy most of Billiton, the mining and metals operations within the Royal Dutch/Shell group - assets with a book value of Dollars 1.8bn. Mr Gilbertson makes clear that the price being asked is the key issue. He says: 'It is not in our interest to buy assets that are fully valued. We have to buy assets to which we can add value. Billiton has to offer us a good return.' Billiton is heavily involved in the aluminium industry and Mr Gilbertson says that negotiations have been complicated by the fact that a view has to be taken about aluminium prices, which are close to their all-time low in real terms. Gencor's 40 per cent-owned Alusaf associate is spending Dollars 2bn to build a 450,000-tonnes-a-year aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa. If this could be combined with Billiton's upstream operations, which produce bauxite and alumina (the raw materials for aluminium), a world-class business would emerge, ranking about fifth in the western world. Mr Gilbertson is enthusiastic about prospects for aluminium - he suggests the underlying annual growth in demand is between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. 'Remember the aluminium business is bigger than gold and to have a big stake in a business like that is attractive. And our best judgment is that it would be a very cost-competitive business, particularly when the price turns up,' he says. But a combination of Alusaf and Billiton would be by far the biggest part of Gencor, and it might want to take on a partner to share the risks. It has taken longer than expected to disentangle the Billiton assets from those of other Shell companies and to carry out an extensive 'due-diligence' survey, reports on which are now being drawn up. But Gencor has also used the time to sound out companies which have pre-emptive rights to some of Billiton's most desirable assets. Mr Gilbertson says that this will stop the pre-emptive process being long and drawn out. He expects some pre-emption - analysts suggest Minorco is likely to take up the rights to the Collahuasi copper project in Chile - but says this would not kill the deal with Shell. Mr Gilbertson, on his annual visit to London to meet UK investors, says that if the Billiton deal fell through it would be a big setback to Gencor's international ambitions. But Gencor is regularly offered mining and metals investment opportunities, and has net cash of more than R500m (Dollars 148.8m), should the right one present itself.</p>

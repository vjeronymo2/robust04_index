			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Military chief says CIS has no enemies: Under financial pressure, some republics plan to push arms exports THE CHIEF of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States said yesterday that, since the CIS had no enemies, it would defend itself against everyone. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov heads forces technically those of the Commonwealth but wholly paid for and increasingly disposed of by Russia  - as when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, proposed swingeing arms cuts last week without apparent reference to fellow CIS presidents. Marshal Shaposhnikov, in a statement to the mass circulation Komsomolskaya Pravda, defended Mr Yeltsin's proposals against charges of 'unilateralism,' saying hard bargaining on disarmament would start when Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, arrives in Moscow next week. 'As to potential enemies,' he said, 'we simply do not have them. Our (military) doctrine might be described as an all-round defence.' Before and during his trip to the US, Britain and Canada last week, Mr Yeltsin said these states had ceased to be seen as hostile. Nevertheless economic pressures facing Russia and other former Soviet states coupled with deep cuts in defence procurement are forcing arms manufacturers into the world market to try to sell what they can to keep production going. Mr Mikhail Malei, an adviser to President Yeltsin on military conversion, said in an interview with the Interfax news agency yesterday that the small Russian autonomous republic of Udmurtia, where defence enterprises make up 82 per cent of all production, would be a test bed for a new 'concept' which would downgrade conversion in favour of finding new markets for arms. He said Mr Yeltsin had approved a scheme under which the republic would retain 70 per cent of all hard currency receipts for weapons. Udmurtia production included chemical weapons as well as Kalashnikov rifles and other small arms, he said. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister for economic reform, said on Monday that Russia would continue sales of weapons abroad. The state of the defence industries was highlighted yesterday by Lieut Gen Vasili Vorobyev, head of the armed forces central finance department. In an interview with the armed forces newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Vorobyev said that expenditure on defence equipment of Rbs6.5bn in the first quarter of the year from a total defence allocation of Rbs50.4bn would leave defence industries 'in a grave financial situation.' Withdrawing the former Soviet army from the Baltic republics will cost an estimated Rbs6bn (Dollars 60m at the market rate) and no timetable will be set for the completion of the troop pullout, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a Russian deputy prime minister, said yesterday, reports Leyla Boulton from Moscow. Mr Shakhrai announced at the weekend that troops would begin pulling out of Lithuania this month and out of Latvia in March. But details had yet to be negotiated, he said yesterday. There wasno date for the start of the pullout from Estonia. The speed of the withdrawals will partly depend on the availability of housing and social benefits to officers back in Russia. He declined to say which and how many troops will be withdrawn to begin with, lending credence to speculation the start may be a purely token gesture in a process which could take years. He declined to give figures for the size of the military presence in the three republics, but said there were 40,000 officers there.</p>

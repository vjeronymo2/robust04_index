Among the reasons of discontent are the delay in the debate  and passing of the railway transportation bill, the persisting  economic blockage, and the compensation by the government of  railway tariffs.    Should their claims be disregarded, Elcatel promised  concerted strikes on 15 February, to be then extended to a  general strike on 17 February.</p>

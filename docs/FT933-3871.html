			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Forum seeks backing LONDON FORUM, the private-sector initiative launched earlier in the year to promote London, will ask ministers next month to back efforts to promote inward investment into the capital with government funds. A feasibility study on the potential for a 'First-Stop Shop' has been carried out for the City Corporation - the local authority for the City of London, the capital's business district - by Jones Lang Wootton, the estate agents. This found that other European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris have central organisations for promotion to inward investors, with budgets of several million pounds a year. Representatives of London Forum will meet Sir George Young, inner cities minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to discuss funding a First-Stop Shop which would provide a showcase for inward investors thinking of locating in London. The shop would provide information about all aspects of London, including office accommodation, transport and living conditions. The post of chief executive is likely to be advertised soon. Later this month the Corporation of London and the London Docklands Development Corporation will join forces for the first time in an effort to attract inward investment from the Far East to London. In the absence of a body to promote London abroad the two organisations have taken a stand at the Hong Kong World Property Market exhibition at the end of the month to set out the capital's attractions as a centre for business. Other UK cities will be separately represented. The City Corporation has promoted the First-Stop Shop concept with Westminster City Council and the LDDC, the quango responsible for the regeneration of a 22 sq km area of former docklands in East London. There is a reservoir of unlet commercial property in the capital. The City has 7m sq ft of empty office space, including Pounds 30m of properties owned by the corporation which are on its sales list. There is 4.9m sq ft to let in Docklands, including much of Canary Wharf, the prestige office development which is in administration under insolvency procedures. An early success in selling London abroad has come with the decision of the Polish trade mission to locate its west European office in the City. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources committee, said that he hoped other eastern bloc trade missions would follow suit. The Polish decision had been taken against competition from other European cities, in particular Frankfurt. Mr Cassidy said that while the terms had been keen, they were no different from those applying to other commercial lettings.</p>

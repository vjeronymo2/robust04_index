			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PEERY RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Canyon High tailback Chris Peery, who underwent emergency urological surgery  Tuesday night, was released Wednesday morning from Valley Presbyterian Hospital  in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Peery, the Cowboys' celebrated senior tailback, is expected to miss at least  the first four weeks of the season while recovering from what a hospital  spokeswoman said was a non-football injury.  </P> <P> "I'm a little sore," Peery said. "I'm not up to walking around yet."  </P> <P> Peery, however, said that there was "no doubt" he will play this season and  that he will attend Canyon's opener against Hart on Friday night at College of  the Canyons.  </P> <P> "In a week-and-a-half or two weeks I can start lifting weights," Peery said.  "But I still gotta talk to the doctor. He wants me to get a lot of rest. That's  more important than football right now." VINCE KOWALICK  </P></p>

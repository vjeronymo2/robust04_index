			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko article: "Yeltsin May Run in 1996 </F> Presidential Election"]    [Text] Your IZVESTIYA correspondent was told this  sensational news in confidence by the Kremlin on the evening of  30 March. And a day later when asked "Is Boris Yeltsin ruling  himself out of the election campaign?" Press Secretary V.  Kostikov unequivocally told journalists:    "I do not think that the president will leave the bridge  unless he is confident that the helm is in safe hands."    Your IZVESTIYA correspondent learned that the press  secretary  had a conversation with the president the day before to obtain  explanations ahead of his meeting with journalists regarding the  main problems worrying society today. Needless to say, they  included the subject of the presidential election campaign.  Here is a significant detail: The president's aides put around  a dozen newspapers on his desk every day. More often than not  he only looks at the headlines, the leads, because he does not  have time for anything else. But the president did want to read  in full the article published in IZVESTIYA 29 March entitled  "Boris Yeltsin Launches Election Campaign," since he did not  trust his services' reports and summaries. Here is his response  (according to his press secretary).    The first signs of political peace or at least truce have  emerged in society. The idea of a political accord among  various social forces is beginning to take shape. It would be  rash to turn Russia into a boxing ring. There are two years to  go until the presidential election. Election fever would fuel  the situation. A political breathing space is what is needed, a  moratorium on political battles.    V. Kostikov also hinted at a possible way of B. Yeltsin's  joining the election campaign. "Analysts forecasting Yeltsin's  departure from the political scene in 1996," he said, "are  formulating schemes based on the theoretical party structure in  Russia today. At the same time they are becoming distracted  from the most important thing -- the population, the voters.  Can we rule out the idea of large groups of Russians nominating  Yeltsin to stand for another term? In that case Yeltsin would  naturally have to make a decision. And that decision would  depend on his personal wishes, concept of duty, and political  responsibility...."    The press secretary did not shirk the question of a possible  presidential election victory for Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy. "The  very idea of that being possible dramatically reduces the  standard of political ethics in society," he said. "A whole  series of their statements are outside the law. Implementing  these appeals could be disastrous for the country and the  population. You cannot inure the population to the idea that a  man with the mentality and vocabulary of a street hooligan can  end up head of a great country. Yeltsin's team is confident  that the president will not surrender Russia to these people."    He dwelt in detail on the content of the Accord on Civil  Peace, which is being drafted and which the president is  consistently forcing through despite certain opposition forces'  skeptical attitude to it. According to the press secretary, the  eight-page text contains a preamble and the following sections:    -- the political life of society;    -- regional policy;    -- nationalities policy;    -- socioeconomic policy;    -- the security of citizens and the state;    -- integrity, ethics, morality, and culture;    -- the conditions and mechanisms for the fulfillment of the  agreement;    -- the responsibility of the signatories to the document.    Presidential aides G. Satarov and Yu. Baturin, as well as  representatives of the parliament, government, and public  organizations, have taken part in drafting the Accord on Civil  Peace. The press secretary stressed that the sides did not seek  compromises in the field of ideology because that is impossible.  The task was to highlight those points that would act as a  reliable base for cooperation among all forces in order to  ensure peace in the country. Efforts must be concentrated on  specific issues, for instance a contentious government decision  or the threat of wholesale strikes, etc. The document makes  provision for the creation of a conciliation commission. But  the president is not happy with the text at the moment. He  thinks it ponderous and reminiscent of a constitution. There  will be consultations over the next few days with the future  parties to the agreement.    It is already known that the president has had conversations  on this issue with V. Shumeyko, who voiced a positive opinion of  the draft document. Regrettably, the State Duma will probably  give it, if not a hostile reception, then at least a very  critical one. Nevertheless, no matter what the result of these  efforts, one thing is important. The whole range of political  views and party plans will be manifested during the  consultations.</p>

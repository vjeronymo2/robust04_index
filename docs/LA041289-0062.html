			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S OPINION OF CIA DECODED  </P> <P> Prosecutor John W. Keker added some humor Tuesday to the tense proceedings at  the Oliver L. North trial when asking North about a code word that he and  associate Richard V. Secord used for their CIA contacts.  </P> <P> North conceded that the word was "fools."  </P> <P> "But I certainly didn't think that about the director (the late William J.  Casey)," North added quickly.  </P> <P> "What about the rest of the CIA?" Keker asked.  </P> <P> "I think there probably are some people there that fit the category," the  defendant replied.  </P> <P> Keker asked if there was another code word and handed North a document obtained  from his files.  </P> <P> "It was a profanity I would not choose to use in the presence of ladies," North  said, bowing his head in a courtly manner. "It was male language used among  friends. If you want to use it in this courtroom, you may, Mr. Keker."  </P> <P> "Does it start with an 'a' "? Keker asked with a smile.  </P> <P> "Yes," said North.  </P> <P> "Does that describe what you thought of them?" Keker continued.  </P> <P> "At the time, yes," the retired Marine replied.  </P></p>

Attendants at the annual Williamsburg Conference  include representatives of Japan, China, Taiwan, Russia, South  Korea, the United States and other countries.    Organizers said the agenda includes such sensitive issues as  the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands, which are rich in  natural resources, whose ownership is claimed, either in whole  or in part, by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines  and Brunei.    The meeting is co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State  Cyrus Vance and former Japanese Ambassador to Washington Yoshio  Okawara and other officials. It marks the first time that  Vietnam has hosted such a large-scale unofficial conference.  The move followed the U.S. announcement February 3 to lift the  trade embargo against Vietnam.    The sovereignty of the Spratly Islands is so fiercely  contested that it triggered a brief naval battle in 1988 between  Vietnam and China. The conference follows an accord between the  two countries last December to reconcile their differences over  the issue.    The Williamsburg Conference was first called in 1971 in  Williamsburg, Virginia, under the initiative of John D.  Rockefeller III.</p>

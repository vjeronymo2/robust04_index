			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has proposed that the repatriation of  Laotian refugees be integrated into the comprehensive Geneva  plan for Indochinese refugees to allow a one-year extension of  the process under the present agreement which expires at the end  of this year, a reliable source said.    The proposal, which has received the UN High Commissioner  for  Refugees' (UNHCR's) blessing, also called for the setting up of  a reception center in Laos which would provide the returnees  with job training before they are integrated into Laotian  communities, according to the source who attended a meeting on  the subject yesterday.    At the tripartite meeting, Thailand and the UNHCR tried to  convince Laos to accept the proposal, which they believe would  be acceptable to the Geneva-based office, the source said.    Under a 1991 tripartite agreement, the remaining Laotian  refugees in Thailand must be sent back by the end of this year.  However, the agreement was not included in the UNHCR's  comprehensive plan of action, which stipulated that all  Indochinese refugees must return by the end of 1995.    Participants in the two-day technical meeting discussed the  problems and obstacles in the repatriation process and explored  ways to speed up the repatriation of approximately 12,000  mainly-highlander Laotians remaining in Thailand's last holding  camp in Ban Na Pho, Nakhon Phanom province.    The National Security Council (NSC) announced earlier this  year that it would close Ban Na Pho at the end of this year. Of  those remaining, only about 2,000 have expressed willingness to  repatriate. The rest, mostly Hmong hilltribe people, have  reportedly refused to return, wanting instead to resettle in a  third country.    Don Somvolachit, director of Laos' Department of Europe and  America, who headed the Laotian delegation, said Laos fears the  reception center would swell into a permanent resettlement site.    He said Laos prefers long-term rural development projects in  which both the returnees and current residents would benefit.  He said the projects could be agriculture-oriented and equipped  with public amenities.    "There must be land and housing ready, international funding  and they must resettle in areas provided for them and according  to the tripartite plans," Don said.    He said Vientiane is willing to take back all the remaining  refugees but it would be impossible without funding. He said  even if all 12,000 wanted to return, it "would not be easy. It  would require a large investment of money and time to  accommodate all of them."    He emphasized that Vientiane would only accept voluntary  returnees. "We want to help them return safely and with  integrity but they must also help themselves."    He categorized the potential refugees into three groups:  individual returnees, small groups of five to 10 families, and  groups of more than 10 families.    He said the individuals would readjust easily into society  because most have families in Laos. The small groups also would  integrate well into existing communities but they need the UNHCR  to provide basic facilities such as schools, hospitals, and  roads to counteract possible rejection from the local  population. The large groups would be more difficult to handle  because special sites must be provided for them as rural  development projects.    Don said a major problem is that most returnees want to live  in or near Vientiane or, in the case of the Hmong, in the  mountainous north.    Asked whether there should be legal guarantees for the  safety  of the returnees, Don said the tripartite agreement already  provided for their protection and that the early returnees could  counsel those who have not yet returned about the new life back  home.</p>

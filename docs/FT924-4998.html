			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Sport: The Dollars 1m birthday for a player bred to succeed  -Tennis IT WAS a majestic performance. Boris Becker's destruction of the world No 1 Jim Courier in last Sunday's final of the IBM/ATP Tour Championship in Frankfurt - a 6-4 6-3 7-5 drubbing that spanned 143 electrifying minutes - ranks in my mind alongside Lew Hoad's 6-2 6-1 6-2 execution of fellow Australian Ashley Cooper in the Wimbledon final of 1957. In full flight, the muscular Hoad was a formidable sight, a supreme athlete whose sheer physical presence dwarfed those around him. Even with a wooden racket, Hoad's strength of forearm and immaculate timing allowed him to flick his early winners with awesome arrogance. It is the same with Becker. In his thrilling semi-final against the Croatian left-hander Goran Ivanisevic that ended in a third set tie-break, his ability to return the cannonball service with interest turned a close match his way. The pace of shot from both men was quite exceptional and the lack of error remarkable. 'I don't think I can play any better than that,' was the winner's assessment. But he did, as Courier will confirm. Becker's spectacular victory on his 25th birthday earned him a handsome present of more than Dollars 1m (incidentally, Hoad's amateur prize was a silver trophy) but, more than that, it brought Boris the relief of a first big success on German soil. Watching the emotional scenes in the cavernous Festhalle - the ecstatic German supporters singing 'Happy Birthday To You', the smiling Boris holding arms aloft and turning to each corner of the arena to acknowledge the cheers, and then huffing and puffing over the candles on his huge birthday cake in the shape of a racket, then the champagne, the speeches, the awards. Watching all this, I could not help wondering if I would ever witness such scenes in Britain. It is a long time since Britain's men have given their country anything to cheer. Magnificent as Virginia Wade's Wimbledon success was in 1977, it does not compensate for the men's failure there since Fred Perry won the last of his three successive titles in 1936. No British man has won a Grand Slam title since that year. Roger Taylor was the last British man in the world's top 10 - he was ranked equal 10th in 1970 - the first to achieve that level since Michael Sangster in 1963. Why can the nation which runs the world's most successful tournament no longer produce any male players to challenge the world's best? The answer can be given in three words: cricket, golf and complacency. It is a problem peculiar to Britain and, to a lesser degree, Australia. In both countries cricket and golf are part of the fabric of society, as they were long before tennis made its appearance in the last quarter of the 19th century. In the period up to 1939, British and Australian players were the equals of their American and European cousins to whom the game was still relatively new. With the return to normal life in 1945 tennis in continental Europe embarked upon a period of expansion that was absent in Britain where the schools devoted their energies to cricket and the wealthy turned to golf. Club tennis limped along without any large investment in facilities. I grew up at The Hale, Mill Hill, a typical club of the 1950s where tennis was the poor relation of the cricket club. We shared a wooden pavilion built in the 1930s where there were no showers, and we played on the bumpy old grass courts or the dusty red shale. Meanwhile, Wimbledon was investing in the future, constantly upgrading its facilities to maintain its pre-eminence. With the continuing success of the Championships, the Lawn Tennis Association did nothing to promote the club game actively, beyond organising a series of county and national competitions. There was no awareness of the need to provide improved facilities or to promote the game against the claims of other leisure pursuits - particularly the well entrenched rivals - cricket and golf. In continental Europe, there was no cricket and hardly any golf. The wealthy invested their time, money and energy in building magnificent tennis clubs. It was the only ball game in town. While British tennis withered, continental tennis thrived. Here are the figures to prove it. In Britain, with a population of 59m, there are 2,426 tennis clubs with 225,000 active members and 35,000 'rated players' who compete in tournaments. There are 750,000 club cricketers and 2.5m regular golfers. In France (with almost no cricketers and only 214,000 golfers), the figures are: population, 57m; tennis clubs, 10,000; members, 1.34m; tournament players, 160,000. In Germany (no cricketers, 180,000 golfers) they are: population, 79m; 9,350 tennis clubs; and 2.1m members, most of whom compete in tournaments and matches. Even in the Netherlands with its 15m inhabitants there are 1,737 tennis clubs and 750,000 players. It is when you look at the indoor facilities that you begin to understand why tennis thrives on the continent. In Britain, the 500th indoor court has just opened. In France there are 4,000, in Germany 3,948 and in the Netherlands 3,500. Now you know why there are nine Frenchmen, seven Germans and four Dutchmen among the top 100 players in the world. If the England cricketers Ian Botham and Graham Gooch had been born in France or Germany they would probably have become tennis players. It is the only hand-eye co-ordination sport available. That is why the Lawn Tennis Association's initiative, announced this week, to invest Pounds 63m in facilities over the next five years to bring Britain level with the rest of Europe, is so welcome. When the base of the tennis pyramid widens significantly then the top standards will rise through the natural process of competition. The imminent appointment of a director of marketing to sell the game to the young people of Britain is another piece of welcome news. The moment a tough kid with the talent and competitive nature of a Daley Thompson decides to make tennis his chosen sport, then there is at least the chance that a champion will emerge to inspire a real tennis boom in Britain. Perhaps it is a little premature to reserve our seats at the Festhalle for the year 2,000 in anticipation of a British victory, but at least the prospect is within the realms of possibility.</p>

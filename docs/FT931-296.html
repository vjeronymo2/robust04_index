			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Decline in liquidations raises hopes of recovery HOPES of a recovery in the UK were buoyed yesterday by news that the number of companies being put into liquidation has fallen on a year-on-year basis for the first time in four years. The first three months of this year saw liquidations of 5,297 limited companies, compared with 5,603 in the corresponding period last year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information consultancy. The figures indicate that the business outlook for many relatively large companies which are limited by guarantee may be brightening, even though failures among smaller companies are likely to stay high for some time. Indications that growth may slowly be returning to the UK were supported by a report of increased confidence in the property market by Chesterton Financial, chartered surveyors, and a bullish forecast for manufacturing output from Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy. Optimism was tempered by the finding from Dun &amp; Bradstreet that total business failures in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, continued to rise in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis, although at a slower rate than last year. Total collapses include insolvencies of smaller companies, as well as liquidations. Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, said: 'It appears that larger companies have been making the necessary adjustments and painful cost-cutting measures to prepare for recovery, while the pain of bankruptcy will continue for the smaller firms for some time.' In the first quarter, 15,443 businesses of all types failed, 3.8 per cent up from 14,881 in the first three months of 1992. In the whole of last year, 22,938 limited companies went into liquidation, compared with 20,736 in 1991 and 13,936 the year before. Total business failures last year came to 62,767, after 47,567 in the previous year and 28,935 in 1990. Wales recorded 17 per cent fewer business collapses in the first quarter compared to the previous year, while north-west England, eastern England and the east Midlands saw failures drop by 10 per cent, 9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. London and the south-east saw falls on the same basis of 4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. In Scotland, the south-west, the west Midlands and north-east England the totals rose by 26, 9, 5 and 3 per cent respectively.</p>

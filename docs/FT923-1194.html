			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Unions attack BR station plans UNIONS yesterday attacked British Rail's plans to cut staff at most stations, claiming that danger to passengers from accidents and violence would increase. Leaders of the RMT and TSSA rail unions said information leaked by senior BR managers showed that fewer than 5 per cent of BR's 2,556 stations would be fully staffed within the next five years, as costs were cut ahead of privatisation. BR dismissed the unions' claims as 'probably highly speculative'.</p>

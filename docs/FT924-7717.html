			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips examines its options MR JAN Timmer, president of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, reaffirmed yesterday that he had no intention of selling off entire divisions in order to bolster the company's financial performance, saying that Philips would not choose the easy or quick option. Earlier this month, some analysts called on Philips to sell off businesses after the company posted a third-quarter loss of Fl 154m (Dollars 85m). They cited telecommunications and medical systems as possible candidates for divestment. Speaking at an annual investment conference Mr Timmer acknowledged that divesting entire divisions would help erase the company's debt, but he said such a move would also mean selling off future profits. Mr Timmer said the company was studying what measures were needed to lift its key consumer electronics business out of the red. Philips has already said it will be taking unspecified restructuring charges later this year in the consumer electronics and components divisions. Previously, Philips had expected to be able to return to the black in consumer electronics by end-1994 without further retrenchment, but earlier this month it indicated it would be taking 'tough measures' to cope with the industry-wide malaise. These may include factory closures and narrowing the products range. "We have had an enormous setback with all the problems in the consumer electronics industry - overcapacity, price wars and a decline in demand,' Mr Timmer said.</p>

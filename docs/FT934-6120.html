			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Savings on trade marks forecast Government proposals to reform trade-mark law should save British industry Pounds 60m in the first year of implementation and Pounds 30m a year subsequently, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, said yesterday, Robert Rice writes. He said the trade marks bill, published yesterday, would make it simpler and cheaper for businesses to protect their trade marks overseas and bring UK law into line with the rest of Europe. Half the savings in the first year would come from the UK's ratification of the Madrid Protocol on the international registration of marks. The remainder of the savings would come from the streamlining and de-regulation of procedures, and from making it easier for businesses to protect marks without having to bring expensive passing-off actions. There are also measures to tighten up the law on counterfeiting by closing a loophole exposed in a recent ruling in which the Law Lords said there could be no breach of intellectual property rights when a trader admitted that the goods were fakes.</p>

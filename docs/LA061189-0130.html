			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> T.A. FRANCOIS; RIGHTS LAWYER, EX-S.F. SUPERVISOR  </P> <P> Terry A. Francois, a civil rights lawyer who became the first black to sit on  the city's Board of Supervisors, died Friday of cancer. He was 67. Francois,  who died at his San Francisco home after a five-year battle against cancer,  served on the board for 14 years before resigning to return to private law  practice in 1978.  </P> <P> In addition to serving as a supervisor, Francois was known in the city for his  early activism, including his arrest on Sept. 15, 1963, along with 10 others  outside a real estate company during a sit-in protesting housing discrimination  against blacks.  </P> <P> As a lawyer for the local chapter of the NAACP, Francois also filed suits  against discrimination in housing, jobs and education and fought for the  appointment of blacks to political office. After only two years in practice,  Francois in 1952 sued the San Francisco Housing Authority, charging it admitted  only white and Asian families to a new city housing project.  </P> <P> In a later suit, he charged he was refused service in a local tavern because he  was black, and in 1955 he began filing complaints of police brutality. In 1956,  he toured the state on behalf of Republican presidential candidate Dwight D.  Eisenhower.  </P> <P> Francois' efforts in 1957, as a lawyer for the NAACP, led to creation of a fair  employment practices ordinance in San Francisco. "In San Francisco a Negro can  eat almost anywhere, but will have trouble finding a job to enable him to pay  for his meal," he said.  </P> <P> In 1961, he sued two realtors who prevented him from buying a house in St.  Francis Wood and then joined picketers in Forest Hill, another expensive  neighborhood. The man who demanded to be shown a home in that tract was an  unknown young black attorney, Willie Brown Jr., now state Assembly Speaker.  </P> <P> Francois was named to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1964 by Mayor  John Shelley, and in 1967 won election to a four-year term.  </P> <P> Born in New Orleans, Francois was a graduate of Xavier University there in 1940  and earned a master's degree in business at Atlanta University in Georgia.  After serving as a Marine platoon sergeant in World War II, Francois came to  San Francisco, where in 1949 he earned a law degree at the University of  California's Hastings Law School.  </P> <P> He was married in Oakland in 1947 to Marion Le Blanc, who survives him. Also  surviving are a daughter, four sons, two sisters and six grandchildren.  </P></p>

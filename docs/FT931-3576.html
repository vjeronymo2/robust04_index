			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Banks fail to face brave new world: Report says European banking is ill-prepared for Emu MOST European Community banks are dangerously unprepared for the business and technical changes required to adapt to monetary union. They have only a vague idea of when and how union will come about and only rough estimates of the time and cost of the changes - running as high as FFr1.5bn (Pounds 180m) per bank over at least two years, and possibly as many as five. There will be upheaval on the European currency markets immediately prior to the fixing of exchange rates. That will be followed by intense international competition, which will see weaker banks going out of business as corporate and private customers take advantage of the single currency to seek the keenest prices and best services across frontiers. Trading between European currencies will then tail off, to be succeeded by more active, and hence riskier, trading between the European currency, the dollar and the yen. That is the alarming picture in a study published today by the Paris office of KPMG Peat Marwick Consultants after interviews with more than 50 leading European Community banks - one of the most detailed assessments yet of the practical impact of monetary union. 'There is real danger of the banking industry being harmed if the uncertainty. . . continues,' warns the report, which calls on governments to agree a firm date for monetary union and decide how it is to come about. Most EC banks reckon that full monetary union will happen, but not until 1999 or later, in any case well after the Maastricht treaty timetable. They assume it will start with an inner core of countries, based on Germany, France and the Benelux trio and that national currencies will run in parallel with the single European currency for a while. This twin system will be more costly to banks, retailers and businesses than a straight switch. But bankers think politicians will want a twin-track transition with two currencies to reassure the public. Broadly, monetary union will sharply accelerate the greater integration of European banking and the cross-border alliances between banks already under way. In detail, banks' currency departments will be the hardest hit. Their revenues will fall sharply with the expected decline in trading between European currencies. Banks, including continental ones, expect a trend towards centralised currency trading in London in the aftermath of union. That is irrespective of whether or not Britain rejoins the EMS and is because of lower UK taxes and the relative ease with which underperforming traders can be fired, thanks to Britain's opt-out of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, says the survey. Retail banking will be the next hardest hit by increased competition, with a fall in profits as market inefficiencies are exposed. Banks are expecting to concentrate on selling existing products, especially plastic cards, to new foreign clients, rather than developing new products in this high-risk environment. Retail banks will lose income from the declining need for travellers' cheques and exchange services. They know heavy investment in cross-border payments for small transactions will be needed, but believe this will cut operating costs in the medium to long term, says the study. Competition will also intensify in corporate banking, where the ease with which customers will be able to compare pricing across Europe will make it harder for individual banks to persuade business customers that they offer special value. As in retail banking, customers will demand better international payment systems. One practical hurdle here is how to reconcile the high-speed payments systems practised in continental Europe, where data only is exchanged between banks, with the UK system where banks physically exchange payment instruments. Bankers say they want a single European payment mechanism for large commercial transactions, in contrast to the several that today exist alongside Swift, the dominant Belgian-based payment system. Investment banking will be less affected, since services such as mergers, buy-outs and project finance are more linked to general European integration than to the detail of monetary union. However, a successful and solid single European currency could help attract more cash to European equities. Monetary union will boost moves towards a single European equity trading system by making it easier for buyers and sellers to compare share prices in different community stock markets, says the study. European banks have not experienced an upheaval like this in recent memory, and are finding it hard to identify exactly where the main costs will arise. The biggest cost will probably be changing computer systems for handling payments, customer information, automatic cash machines and - for retailers  -redesigning point of sale terminals. Banks also expect to spend more on training. Beyond that, the nearest parallel is the upheaval British banks experienced with the introduction of decimal coinage in 1971. Barclays alone purchased Pounds 10.5m of bronze coins, weighing 3,500 tonnes and shifted them to 1,000 storage centres before distribution to branches on the change-over day. That exercise took two years. More recently UK banks took six months to phase in a new Pounds 10 note. European monetary union will be on an awesomely different scale.

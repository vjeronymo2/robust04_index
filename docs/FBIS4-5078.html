			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  denounce the recent publication of a "presidential statement" by  the UN Security Council [UNSC] urging the DPRK to accept an  additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  as a very wrong act contrary to the aim and principle of the UN  charter.    Stating that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is not a matter to  be  discussed by the UN Security Council, a news analyst of NODONG  SINMUN says:    The DPRK is in a special status after temporarily suspending  the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Accordingly, it is not obliged to  undergo routine and ad hoc inspections by the agency.    If the UN Security Council is willing to resolve the nuclear  issue of the Korean peninsula, it should take issue with the  United States that is laying hurdles in the way of the solution  of the nuclear issue and wrecking peace and security with a huge  quantity of nuclear weapons, and its underlings, the South  Korean authorities.    When it caviled at the DPRK, the UN Security Council showed  that it was applying a double standard and playing into the  hands of the United States in its policy of stifling the DPRK.    It must bear due responsibility for the consequences of its  illegal dealing with the DPRK's "nuclear issue" against the aim  and principle of the UN charter.    A news analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that when the United  States and its followers are further expanding their anti-DPRK  pressure kickup, taking the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the  international arena, the DPRK cannot but take an appropriate  measure.    It is the will and invariable stand of the DPRK to maintain  an independent policy and not to allow any unwarrantable  demands, declares the paper.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 28 May, Wuchang city was hit by a series of three  hailstorms. More than 510,000 mu of farmland in the city were  afflicted at varying degrees, creating direct economic losses  amounting to almost 10 million yuan. At present, peasants  across the city are taking steps to combat disaster and to  provide for and help themselves, and have decided to minimize  the losses caused by the disaster.    During these hailstorms, 23 townships and towns in Wuchang  city were affected, and the afflicted areas accounted for 21  percent of total cultivated land.    After the outbreak of disaster, the city leaders organized  relevant departments to go deep to the disaster areas in time to  help the masses formulate anti-disaster measures. At the same  time, they also helped the disaster areas to resolve the issue  of funds totalling 130,000 yuan, 50 tonnes of diesel oil, and  over 50,000 kg of early ripening crop seeds. All city-level  units responsible for helping the disaster areas also went deep  to townships and towns to help disaster-stricken masses resolve  the issue of goods badly needed for the people's production and  living. Activities of donating funds and articles are being  carried out. At present throughout the city, more than 500,000  mu of farm crops for reseeding and transplanting has been  destroyed.</p>

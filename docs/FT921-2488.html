			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: ABB unveils 3% advance as restructuring continues ASEA BROWN Boveri, Europe's biggest electrical engineering group, has announced a 2 per cent improvement, to Dollars 1.15bn, in 1991 pre-tax profits after financial items. It pledged to continue restructuring efforts this year. The result underlines the extent to which ABB is being tested by recessionary conditions in 60 per cent of its business. It had said at the half-year stage that full-year profits should at least match those of 1990. Operating earnings after depreciation rose 7 per cent, from Dollars 1.79bn to Dollars 1.91bn, while net income edged up 3 per cent from Dollars 590m to Dollars 609m. Orders received rose 1 per cent to Dollars 29.6bn, while revenues increased 8 per cent to Dollars 28.9bn. Mr Percy Barnevik, president, said the severity of the recession varied from 'light' in mainland European countries such as France, to 'fairly deep' in the Nordic countries, with the English-speaking countries in between. Growth in countries such as Germany, and in parts of Asia, had offset lower order intake in some recession-affected markets. In the UK, the group increased earnings, helped by a good performance in infrastructural business sectors, which are normally less affected by recession. On the outlook for 1992, Mr Barnevik said ABB expected a slow recovery in recession-affected markets. He also foresaw a further decline in demand and intensified pricing pressure. However, in most of its infrastructure-related business, accounting for the remaining 40 per cent of the group, the impact of the recession would be smaller, and demand in several developing countries was expected to remain high. Overall, therefore, earnings after financial items this year are expected to be about the same as this year. Net debt was cut by about Dollars 1bn last year, and ABB would continue balancing non-recurring restructuring costs with gains from asset sales. Earlier this month, the group announced it would try to sell its global instrumentation business, based in the UK. Mr Barnevik said a couple of other 'pieces' might be sold, but he did not foresee any huge divestitures.</p>

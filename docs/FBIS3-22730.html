The issue has resurfaced as the Pergau dam affair has put  British dealings with Malaysia under intense scrutiny. It could  complicate government attempts to remain on good terms with a  country sensitive to any perceived interference in relations  with fellow Islamic states.    Concern over Malaysia's Libyan connection was renewed  recently when the government auctioned eight steel reactor tanks  which had been returned from Singapore, where they were seized  last March on the orders of the Security Council's sanctions  committee. The buyer was a small local trading company whose  only contact is a mobile telephone number. The equipment left a  Malaysian customs warehouse a few weeks ago, though other  governments have been told it is in the country and will not be  permitted to reach Libya.    But one Western diplomat said: "We are not 100 per cent  happy, and won't be until we see this equipment in the hands of  a non- Libyan end-user who actually wants it."    Britain has co-ordinated efforts to keep the tanks out of  Libya since becoming aware in 1989 of Tripoli's attempts to  obtain them. It says the equipment could produce hundreds of  tons of mustard gas and nerve gases. Kuala Lumpur refused to  stop the first delivery attempt, saying they were for civilian  use.    The telephone number of the buyer, Wargamas Management, is  unobtainable, but investigators who have spoken to the company's  directors say they claim to be trying to sell the vessels to  Petronas, Malaysia's state oil company, or an American company.  Another source said the equipment had been tailor-made for  Tripoli and could not be adapted easily for other uses.    A spokesman for the Malaysian High Commission in London  declined to comment, saying he would have to check with Kuala  Lumpur.    Libya first tried in 1989 to order reactor vessels from a  British engineering company, APV, saying they would be used to  produce drilling mud for the oil industry. Western agencies  suspected that they would be used to make chemical weapons.  When the order was rejected, the Libyans turned to an obscure  Malaysian company, Pacificwide Management, which again has only  a mobile number. Pacificwide ordered the equipment from APV's  Malaysian subsidiary, APV Hill and Mills, and went to court to  obtain completion of the contract after the British-owned  company, having become aware of the destination of the vessels,  tried to back out.    With the Malaysian government refusing to intervene, Britain  went to the sanctions committee. The shipment was declared to  be a violation of the embargo imposed on Libya to force the  handover of two intelligence agents accused of the Lockerbie  bombing.</p>

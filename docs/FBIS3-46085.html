According to the BEIJING DAILY [BEIJING RIBAO], the 18 were  sentenced by the Beijing Intermediate Court on Monday in what is  believed to be one of the largest instances in Beijing of a  group of convicted criminals receiving death sentences in recent  memory.    Twelve of those sentenced will appeal while the other six  were executed immediately, the paper said.    Many of those sentenced were unemployed or outsiders who had  migrated to the capital, while five of the convicted were part  of a group which committed several armed robberies in 1991-92,  the paper said.</p>

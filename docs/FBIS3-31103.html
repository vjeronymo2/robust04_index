			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Skopje, 14 Feb (TANJUG) -- Kiro Gligorov,  president of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and  Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, said in  Skopje today that the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  former Yugoslavia should be resolved by political means.    This is what Churkin told reporters after his talks with  Gligorov. Churkin cautioned that any kind of escalation of war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina would have consequences for the entire  Yugoslav area and that the conflict might even spread beyond the  borders of the former Yugoslavia.    The special envoy of the Russian president, who is on a  one-day visit to Skopje, said that Russia was the first to  demand an end to the siege of Sarajevo but that Moscow continues  to maintain that action ought to be confined to the legal  framework of the UN Security Council, where clear and precise  stands could be adopted and then implemented by the parties to  the conflict. The means envisaged by UN documents should be  used in order to secure the implementation of the UN Security  Council's decisions, Churkin said.    The situation in Sarajevo is such that the demilitarization  of the city is needed as well as the lifting of the siege. If  the demilitarization and the lifting of the blockade are not  implemented, air strikes will follow, but that will also mean an  escalation of conflicts with unforeseeable consequences, the  special envoy pointed out.

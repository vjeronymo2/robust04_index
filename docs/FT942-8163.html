			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the aircraft components company that occupies the site near Southampton where Sunderland flying boats were built in the 1930s, is coming to the market with a capitalisation of Pounds 68.6m, writes David Blackwell. Shares in the company - subject of a Pounds 47.6m management buy-out from British Aerospace in 1990 - have been priced at 120p. Of the 33.33m ordinary shares on offer, 20.83m will be placed firmly with institutions by NM Rothschild. The rest will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The company is raising more than Pounds 26m net of expenses to be used alongside a Pounds 10m revolving credit facility to repay Pounds 35m of debt. Managers have put their experience of Japanese production techniques at Rover Group into practice at Hamble, lifting margins from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent. Pro-forma, pre-tax profits for last year are put at Pounds 5.6m on turnover of Pounds 70.4m. The company, chaired by Lord King, has in three years reduced the proportion of its sales to BAe from 93 per cent to 78 per cent. It has broadened its customer base, winning a big order for wing parts for the Boeing 737-700, and the issue looks to be priced realistically given the tough competition in the industry. The broker is Smith New Court. Intermediate Capital Group, formed in 1989, is coming to the market via a placing and intermediaries offer priced at 225p a share, writes Richard Gourlay. ICG provides loans for fund management buy-outs and buy-ins, acquisitions and development capital; and it enhances returns by receiving warrants or a redemption premium when investments are realised. Judging by the pricing, the company will not be assessed as an investment trust - the Pounds 105m market capitalisation values the group at a 19 per cent premium to net asset value. Viewed as a specialist lender, however, its notional gross dividend of 5.5 per cent for the year to January 1994 is only just covered by earnings from core interest income, dividends and management fees. This is hardly comfortable cover in conventional terms, but the group hopes to continue to realise capital gains through further sales of equity. Cazenove and James Capel are brokers to the issue, which closes on May 26. Denby Group, the stoneware pottery maker, has priced its placing and open offer at 130p a share, valuing the company at Pounds 43.3m, writes Peggy Hollinger. With pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m forecast for the year to September 30, the group is priced at a prospective multiple of 14 compared with about 17.5 for Portmeirion Potteries, its closes competitor. Given the recent glut of flotations, the rating seems about right. A final dividend of at least 1.4p and earnings of 9.2p are also forecast by the company for this year. The notional full year dividend would have been 3.1p, with a yield of 3 per cent. The broker is Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull and the offer closes on May 26.</p>

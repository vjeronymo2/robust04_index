			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: DAVE BARRY SLEPT HERE A SORT OF HISTORY OF THE UNITED  STATES BY DAVE BARRY (RANDOM HOUSE: $15.95; 180 PP.)  </P> <P> Columnist Dave Barry turns his formidable wit to the subject of American  history, with a result reminiscent of the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The  better you know the original, the funnier it gets.  </P> <P> Barry spoofs the dry-as-dust textbook style with such devices as "reconstructed  conversations," dates galore (for simplicity's sake, however, all dates are  given as October 8), absurd footnotes (the note for one quoted expert reads: "A  friend of ours. You don't know him.") and ridiculous discussion questions  ("Whatever happened to the Hessians anyway? You never see them around.") The  narrative is interrupted by an "Educational Advisory Alert" from the academic  powers that be, warning that unless women and minorities are represented, "this  book will not be approved for purchase by public school systems in absolutely  vast quantities." The text subsequently provides the typically obsequious but  utterly irrelevant asides on the contributions of minorities and women.  </P> <P> Imaginative though his skewed historical facts are, Barry's best moments depend  on his lampoons of today's gripes, conceits, silly euphemisms and fashions.  "Just when the Jamestown colonists were about to give up," he writes, "they  came up with a promising new product concept: tobacco." The colonists' taxation  problems turn on the complexity of the tax forms; the temporary British  solution is to offer toll-free passage to England to consult with Tax  Assistors. As the revolution approaches, the rebels are naturally referred to  as "freedom-loving colonists."  </P></p>

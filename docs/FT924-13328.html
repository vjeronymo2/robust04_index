			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Clashes follow Palestinian death Stone-throwing rioters clashed with police after hearing of the death of a Palestinian who had been fasting to demand better prison conditions, and protests continued yesterday with a strike, AP reports from Jerusalem. Police broke up several protests in Jerusalem following the announcement on Wednesday night of the death of Mr Hussein Nimr Assad, 26. Prison authorities said he died of a heart attack. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, called the death 'very tragic' and said it could undermine US-backed Middle East peace negotiations. Police Minister Moshe Shahal told Israel radio that an investigation has been launched to determine whether the death was related to the fast.</p>

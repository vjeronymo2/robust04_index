			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The phoenix that did not arise from NEDC ashes It is easier to destroy than to build.' This is the sort of Churchillianism that comes to mind when I hear of the government's decision to abolish the National Economic Development Council. So anyone expecting me to cheer from the rafters will be disappointed. NEDC consists of a council of ministers, business representatives, trade unionists and a few independents. It was meant to discuss economic strategy. The main work, however, was carried out by an independent office, which also serviced the 'Little Neddies' for specific industries. When the body was established by Harold Macmillan in 1962, French-style indicative planning was much in vogue. Not long afterwards it went out of fashion in France itself. The idea of ministers and the 'two sides of industry' fixing things around a table went out of fashion much later, basically with the failure of the 'social contract' of the 1974-1979 Labour government. Nevertheless there was still a useful role for the organisation. The National Economic Development Office's director-general, Walter Eltis, has just pointed out that in the 1980s the organisation shifted from grand macroeconomic strategy to what he calls 'supply-siding improvements' in specific industries. But there was an important macroeconomic element in NEDC in the early days. This was to press the Treasury and the Bank of England to boost demand sufficiently to secure an annual growth rate of 4 per cent. The Treasury dug in and said that 3 per cent was the maximum feasible. The emotion which that debate engendered was comparable with that which occurred later over 'shadowing' the D-Mark or joining the ERM. Charges flew back and forth and friendships were broken. This might all now seem to belong to another world. Few economists or economic commentators would argue with a straight face that government financial policies can determine whether the economy will grow on average by 4 or 3 per cent, or any other figure. Government intervention should be limited to improving the efficiency with which markets work. And yet there is a baby with the bath water. NEDC was set up in part to form a lobby for economic growth and efficiency. There are not that many other bodies committed to growth. Government departments have their own clientele with their own vested interests. That applies even to the Treasury. Its goal of holding back public spending may do more to help growth than spending ministers think; but the two goals are not identical. A short-lived experiment with an independent economic voice in government was the Department of Economic Affairs under the first Wilson government. There have also been departments attached to the prime minister or the Cabinet Office, such as Lord Rothschild's Central Policy Review Staff and the Number 10 Policy Unit now under Sarah Hogg. Although many of their members genuinely believe in growth, their first task is to serve the prime minister of the day. Ministers sometimes ask why independent forecasting centres like the National Institute or the London Business School cannot do the job. They forget that forecasting - of which they claim to be sceptical - is not the same as either lobbying for growth-centred policies or carrying out research into the obstacles to growth, research which often suggests making more use of markets and prices. As for the tripartite council: I have no doubt that ministers found it a boring talking shop. The frequency of council meetings had already been reduced in 1987. But there is still something to be said for keeping a permanent channel of communication between a Conservative government and trade unionists, and one that is not dependent on ministers saying: 'They can always ring up my office if they want to see me.' The best bet now for a source of advice and influence not bound by the cabinet line is an independent Bank of England. Whatever happens to the Maastricht Treaty, the momentum to increased collaboration among the Community central bankers - now under a Danish chairman - will continue to build up. The Bank of England will only be able to play its full part if it is independent but accountable. But I am not sure that a central bank completely meets the bill. My own preferred evolution of the Office part of NEDO would have been towards a US-style Council of Economic Advisers - at a slightly greater distance from government than is the case in America. Papers from an outside source in the chancellor's box would at least be a reminder of the variety of points of view. Ministers need to be reminded that, if you interpret growth as the growth of cash spending (nominal GDP), then it is not so absurd to put forward a growth target of 3 or 4 per cent per annum. This is low enough to put a lid on inflation but high enough to ensure that, if pay and prices are restrained, the results will not go to waste in loss of output, income and employment. (In the jargon there is a role for a nominal demand objective.) Indeed that is what monetarism is all about when shorn of the mystification and technicalities. It is also consistent with reconstructed Keynesianism. Some organisation may well be needed to press for some minimal demand growth even if that has to be promoted internationally - say at the level of the European Community or the Group of Seven. Such an objective will be particularly important if the economic challenge changes from one of inflation to one of deflation. If that occurs, it will not arrive neatly, with headline consumer price changes falling gradually to zero and then below. It has already been seen in commodity prices - where the fall has now levelled off - and in property prices, where the drop is still continuing. The Bank for International Settlements remarks in its annual report: 'Real estate price deflation, if that is what it should be called, might be considered to be a new phenomenon in the postwar economic history of the industrial countries . . . If not contained, it could not only have further repercussions on financial institutions in the countries concerned but also affect the prospects for full economic recovery.' Argument is likely to continue on whether declines in asset prices, when ordinary consumer prices are still rising, constitute deflation or not. Nearly all the great deflations with which we have been threatened since the second world war have been false alarms and only provided excuses for allowing inflation to regain momentum. Now, almost for the first time, it is worth looking out for a possible need to switch the direction of economic policy from the threat of rising prices to one of slump and falling prices. It would, however, be typically British to disband a potential pro-growth body when there is just a chance that there may be a need for it.</p>

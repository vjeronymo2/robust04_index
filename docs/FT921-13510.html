			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Algerian warning as soldier killed ALGERIA'S new leaders warned individuals and organisations yesterday that they would crush anyone using violence after a soldier was killed and bombs exploded, Reuter reports from Algiers. As troops and police hunted the soldier's killers, the gendarmerie command said its forces had arrested - for the first time - a preacher for using a mosque to 'incite citizens to revolt against institutions of the state'. The five-man collective presidency reminded Algerians it was responsible for preserving public order following the scrapping of the second round of the country's first multi-party general election which Moslem fundamentalists had been poised to win. 'The High Council of State ..solemnly reminds all those, individuals and organisations, authors, provocators and their accomplices, it will use all the state's means for strict and total application of the law,'' it said in a statement. The Islamic Salvation Front, which warns of an 'explosion', has reported more than 500 arrests since last Tuesday. It says those detained include members of its ruling council, the Majlis Echoura, and fundamentalists elected in first-round voting.</p>

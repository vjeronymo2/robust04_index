			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S SCHEDULE FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival opens today  for two weeks at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas. Here is today's  schedule:  </P> <P> 'The Yen Family'  </P> <P> Japan, 1988, 113 minutes  </P> <P>  8:25 p.m.  </P> <P>  Yojiro Takita's hilarious satire on a suburban family so money-grubbing that  it runs a newspaper distributorship and a catering service -- both exploiting  the elderly -- right out of the kitchen (where the mother is also operating her  erotic wake-up service while she prepares breakfast). As the film becomes  increasingly outrageous it develops considerable complexity, and its indictment  of materialism, Japanese-style, is often ironic and paradoxical. Like Takita's  earlier "Comic Magazine," a corrosive satire on the excesses of the media, "The  Yen Family" is a swift, satisfying treat. RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

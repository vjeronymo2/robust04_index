			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> FRANCESA STIRS FIFTH-DOWN DEBATE AGAIN  </P> <P> Like a nagging cold or a persistent salesman, the fifth-down controversy just  won't go away.  </P> <P> The uproar over Colorado's disputed 33-31 victory over Missouri started to fade  a few weeks after the Oct. 6 game. But CBS commentator Mike Francesa is  stirring it up again.  </P> <P> Francesa, one of 60 voters in the Associated Press college football poll, is  troubled by the fact that Colorado scored the winning touchdown on what proved  to be an illegal extra down. So troubled that the second-ranked Buffaloes might  not get his vote as national champion even if they beat No. 1 Notre Dame in the  Orange Bowl.  </P> <P> "If it's a close situation, that (fifth-down) game could be a factor," Francesa  says.  </P> <P> And what's a close situation? Francesa says that if Colorado barely beats Notre  Dame and third-ranked Miami or No. 4 Georgia Tech rout their bowl opponents, he  might vote the Hurricanes or Yellow Jackets No. 1.  </P> <P> "Think about it," Francesa says. "If that happens, you'd be talking about an  unbeaten Tech team vs. a Colorado team with one loss, one tie and one shadowy  game."  </P> <P> Francesa recently infuriated Colorado fans by making similar remarks on a  Denver radio station.  </P> <P> "He's not going to win any popularity contests out here," says Dave Plati, the  school's sports information director.  </P> <P> Like other Colorado defenders, Plati points out that the Buffaloes  intentionally spiked the ball on the next-to-last play because they thought it  was third down. It actually was the fourth down, but a mixup by the officials  gave Colorado another play, which turned out to be the winning 1-yard sneak by  Charles Johnson.  </P> <P> Plati says the Buffaloes wouldn't have spiked the ball had they known it was  the fourth down.  </P> <P> "Doesn't he (Francesa) know the facts?" Plati says. "Why should we be punished  for playing under the guidelines we were given? People think we're the villain  because they think we cheated. And that's just not true."  </P> <P> Francesa considers the victory tainted even though it was upheld by the Big  Eight.  </P> <P> Despite his reservations about the fifth-down game, Francesa says he would vote  the Buffaloes No. 1 if they win impressively on New Year's Day and no other  team makes a convincing case for the national championship.  </P></p>

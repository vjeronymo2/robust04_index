			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TEXTILE POLICY IS NO BARGAIN;  </P> <P> HOW A CRAZY QUILT OF PROTECTIONIST LAWS DRIVES UP THE PRICE OF CLOTHING  </P> <P> Once again ugly protectionist sentiments that could wreck attempts to put new  order to world trade are emerging in Washington. If myopic legislators have  their way, consumers will wind up paying more for clothes and shoes while U.S.  textile and apparel makers will get fat, happy and complacent because of less  competition from imports.  </P> <P> That's unfair, uncompetitive and unrealistic given today's global marketplace.  Nevertheless, the House is expected to pass a textile bill that would further  restrict imports of textiles, apparel and footwear. The Senate already has  overwhelmingly approved a similar measure that would limit the growth of such  imports to 1% a year. The Bush Administration has threatened to veto the  ill-conceived bill -- and rightly so.  </P> <P> Legislators are alarmingly persistent when it comes to protecting textile and  apparel makers. Two earlier textile bills were killed by presidential vetoes.  The textile and apparel industries already are heavily protected by 1,000  quotas established under 38 bilateral agreements and negotiated under the  international Multifiber Agreement.  </P> <P> The new bill not only would abrogate these agreements but would jeopardize the  current international trade talks where the Bush Administration has proposed  global textile quotas. The plan would phase down the hodgepodge of current  quotas over a 10-year period to allow adequate transition time to more normal  textiles- and apparel-trading arrangements.  </P> <P> Notably, the American Apparel Manufacturers Assn. is backing the  Administration. And its neutral stance on the textile bill is a big departure  from its usual knee-jerk support of U.S. textile interests. Perhaps apparel  makers see the potential in opening more overseas markets: U.S. clothing  exports rose 38% in 1989 and were up 22% in the first quarter of this year.  </P> <P> It's hard to justify expanded protection for the textile industry. Mills are  operating at a better utilization rate than the U.S. manufacturing sector as a  whole, and shipments are up. Unemployment in the major textile states has been  generally lower than the national unemployment average.  </P> <P> Ultimately, consumers would wind up paying the costs of the textile bill --  $160 billion in the first five years. Current quotas and tariffs, for example,  already add $2,100 to the annual clothing costs of a family of four. That would  rise to $2,600 in five years under the bill. Low-income shoppers would suffer  the most.  </P> <P> California would, too. If our trading partners import less cotton (the state's  No. 1 agricultural export) because we won't take their finished cloth products,  fewer goods are likely to wend through the ports of Los Angeles, where the  garment center is second only to New York. The textile bill is a no-win  proposition. The House should dump it.  </P></p>

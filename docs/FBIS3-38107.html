The Walloon Socialist senator Guy Mathot, who was one of the  three ministers accused of being involved in the bribery, has  revealed a document in which the present foreign affairs  minister, Willy Claes, was mentioned.    At the time of the Agusta deal Claes was minister of  economic  affairs. The document says that five years ago the minister had  a meeting with the dismissed Agusta manager, Rafael Otetti. The  meeting is said to have taken place in January 1989. On that  date, Otteti had just been removed as president of the board of  directors of Agusta. Meanwile, the man is on the run in South  America.    One day after the meeting with Minister Claes a new Agusta  president was appointed.    Senator Guy Mathot also denies the incriminating statement  of  the former Liege (?unionist) [name indistinct]. A few days ago  [name indistinct] said the relationship between Guy Mathot and  the murdered Walloon Socialist leader Andre Cools had reached an  absolute low after the controversial Agusta contract was signed.  Mathot now says this is untrue. The murder of Andre Cools is  said to be linked to the Agusta bribery scandal.    Meanwhile, the commission of the Walloon region, in its  turn,  has proposed to lift partially the parliamentary immunity of Guy  Mathot, Guy Spitaels, and Alain Von den Beest. The Senate has  already done so for Mathot and Spitaels.</p>

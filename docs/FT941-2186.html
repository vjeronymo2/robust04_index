			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche to expand contract production Porsche is to branch out further from its speciality niche as a luxury sports carmaker and tap new profit sources by building cars for other manufacturers, it emerged yesterday. 'Great efforts' are to be made to build small-volume contract manufacturing operations into 'a strategic business sector', according to a rights issue prospectus. Negotiations are under way to add to Porsche's existing manufacturing contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Audi, the Volkswagen group's quality car division. Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche chairman, said recently his new negotiating partners were 'not necessarily' German. The contract with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, under which Porsche makes the Mercedes 500E series, is due to expire later this year. However, the company has recently started production of the Audi Avant RS2, a high-performance estate car. According to information released ahead of today's opening of the subscription period for the company's one-for-four rights issue to raise DM200m (Dollars 118.3m), Porsche expects to build 16,000 of its own cars this year and 2,000 for third parties. Orders had already been booked for 560 Audi RS2s. It also emerged that the Porsche and Piech families, which own all Porsche's voting stock, recently reduced their holdings of preference shares. Some family members had sold part or all of their non-voting stock to cover the cost of their entitlement to new ordinary shares, an official said. He did not know how many of the preference shares - previously estimated at 40 per cent of the 875,000 outstanding - remained in family hands. Half-year figures showed the company made a DM114m loss in the period to the end of January, despite a 20 per cent rise in turnover, to DM980m.</p>

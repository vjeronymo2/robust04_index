			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Balladur presses ahead on jobs Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, went on television yesterday to stress that his government will press ahead with its five-year employment law despite being forced to retract plans to allow apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage. Under the new measure, companies will receive a subsidy of FFr1,000 (Pounds 114.54) for each employee under 18 to whom they give a first job. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, said decrees on tax credits for apprenticeships and job training and measures to promote part-time working would be promulgated soon.</p>

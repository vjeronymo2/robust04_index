			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 16 May (KNA) -- The minister for foreign  affairs and international cooperation, Mr. Stephen K. Musyoka,  today said that the second session of the formal discussions on  the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development  [IGADD] peace initiative on southern Sudan have been rescheduled  for tomorrow, 17th May 1994, and not today as anticipated. In a  signed statement issued this evening, Mr. Musyoka said: "The  standing committee of IGADD foreign affairs ministers met on  Monday, 16th May 1994 for the second negotiation session of the  Sudan peace talks. The ministers held consultations concerning  the procedures on the conduct of the negotiations, whose agenda  was agreed on 23rd March 1994.    The Sudanese Government and the Sudanese People's Liberation  Movement/Army [SPLM/A]-United delegations are already in Nairobi  for the talks. However, the SPLM/A faction could not arrive as  was anticipated due to logistical problems. For this reason,  the formal discussions have been rescheduled to begin on  Tuesday, 17th May, 1994, instead of today, as earlier agreed."</p>

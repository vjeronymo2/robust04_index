He  said that Zhuhai has followed a course featuring a high starting  point and a high level and has taken into account both long-term  and immediate developments in city planning and economic  construction, adding that Zhuhai has rosy prospects.    Accompanied by Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Politburo  member and Guangdong CPC Committee secretary; Liang Guangda,  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee member,  Zhuhai City CPC Committee secretary, and Zhuhai mayor; and  others, Chairman Li visited the terminal which can handle 20,000  tonnes of cargo at Zhuhai port in western Zhuhai; a coal  terminal under construction, which can handle 100,000 tonnes of  coal; Zhuhai airport; Doumen County; and the construction site  of the Qiao bridge, which is the advance project of the  Lingdingyang bridge. He also toured the city.    While at Zhuhai port, after listening to a report on  development of the port, Chairman Li inquired in detail about  the plan and construction of support facilities for the port.  Standing in Gaolan Island and looking at the natural haven  hemmed in by mountains on three sides, he said happily: You  built a port and turned a deserted beach into a treasured place,  killing two birds with one stone.    At the Zhuhai airport, after listening to an account of the  development of the airport, Chairman Li was concerned about the  support facilities at the airport and asked whether aviation and  ground management could meet the demands of emergency take off  and landing. Xie Fei added: The construction of the Zhuhai  airport provided new experiences in many respects. Guangzhou  will follow the example of Zhuhai if it decides to build more  airports.    At the construction site of the Qiao bridge, Mayor Liang  Guangda briefed Chairman Li on the planning and preparations for  the building of the bridge spanning the sea and on the social  benefits and experiences which will be created from real estate  development following the completion of the bridge.    While in Zhuhai, Chairman Li also heard reports on work done  by the city party committee and government. He fully affirmed  the unusual courage displayed by Zhuhai in carrying out the  reform and opening policy and in making experiments as well as  the achievements made by Zhuhai in city planning, economic  development, environmental protection, and birth control. Based  on thorough investigations, the chairman said: Zhuhai has  acquitted itself splendidly and has a broad vision in planning.  Zhuhai not only took into account its own development, but also  put itself in economic relationships with South China and even  Southeast Asia, so it could forge far-sighted plans for its city  construction. It really deserves praise for its excellent  performance. Major projects in coordination with the city  construction, such as Zhuhai port, Zhuhai airport, and the  Zhuhai bridge have got under way in succession and the patterns  of a major port and large-scale industry have been outlined. In  a few years' time, Zhuhai's development will make it difficult  for other cities in the country to bear comparison. Chairman Li  was very appreciative of the way land had been developed, used,  and managed in Zhuhai. He said: Since the reform and open  policy were introduced, many cities in the country have been  exploring means of land development, but Zhuhai's experiments  have proven most successful. Zhuhai displayed boldness in  making huge investments in infrastructural development with the  result that land values have been raised. The government has  made money through land development and has in turn used the  money to expand construction, thus enabling economic growth to  follow a steady upward course. In addition, the government  formulated a complete set of laws and regulations for  management. Zhuhai's experience is worth learning from.  Chairman Li fully affirmed a course featuring a high starting  point and a high level followed by Zhuhai in economic  development. He said: Zhuhai's policy-makers had their eyes on  the next 10 or 20 years rather than on setting up an additional  one or two enterprises in planning economic development, so  their major construction projects had high starting points and  were of a fundamental nature. This allowed Zhuhai to catch its  rivals at an advantage in future competition. He also  maintained: Economic development should be promoted in line  with local conditions. Given necessary conditions, some places  should press ahead faster. We must not impose rigid uniformity.</p>

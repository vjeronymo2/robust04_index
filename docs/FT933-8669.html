			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Mexico promises to increase minimum wage PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday instructed the labour ministry to raise Mexico's minimum wage of 13 pesos (Pounds 2.80) a day by national average productivity increases. He announced the move in a national television broadcast celebrating the end of negotiations on side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The comments appeared to have been intended as much for the US as Mexico. In the US Congress, fears that factories will move to Mexico to take advantage of low Mexican wages have underlined much of the opposition to the trade pact. The purchasing power of Mexico's minimum wage has steadily fallen over the past decade, a result of inflation, low economic growth, and a deliberate government policy. However, few Mexicans earn the minimum wage, and the new policy is expected to have a limited impact. While US officials had heralded President Salinas's speech an important development, a spokesman for Mr Salinas categorically denied that any deal had been done with the US administration over wages. 'There is nothing new in this,' he said. The broadcast came after Mexico made concessions over the labour and environmental side agreements, accommodating US demands that the agreements should have 'teeth'. The rally in Mexico's stockmarket, which closed 3.8 per cent ahead yesterday, indicates why the government was willing to make the concessions. Nafta is expected by investors to boost Mexico's short term economic growth, accelerate its integration with the industrialised world, and lock in current economic policies for the foreseeable future. For these reasons President Salinas has been willing to turn his back on Mexico's traditional definition of national sovereignty. It is almost inconceivable that any previous Mexican president would have negotiated Nafta, let alone willingly submitted Mexico to transnational adjudication in environmental matters. Given the lengthy and complicated process involved in punishing violators of environmental laws, the side agreement on environment is unlikely to have any immediate impact. Mexico's lack of funds, inexperience in environmental enforcement, and unwillingness to close factories where under-employment and poverty exist all mean enforcement in Mexico will probably lag behind that in the US and Canada for some time. Mexico made few significant concessions on labour, agreed to share information with a tri-national commission but not to be bound by any of its recommendations. The US had been nervous about pressing for a labour commission with wide powers, for reasons of its own national sovereignty.</p>

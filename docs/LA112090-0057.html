			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES PRESS HUNT FOR MORE POT BUNKERS  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies, following up the discovery under the Antelope Valley desert  of the most sophisticated marijuana farms ever found in Los Angeles County,  pressed the hunt Monday for more of the subterranean plantations.  </P> <P> As two men arrested at one of the farms were charged with possession and  cultivation of the drug, deputies looking for evidence of additional growing  sites served search warrants at "several locations" in the Antelope Valley,  said Stephen L. Cooley, head of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's  office.  </P> <P> No arrests were made, but Cooley said new arrests and raids on additional  plantations were possible.  </P> <P> Authorities also conducted searches Sunday in Barstow and Palm Desert but found  no farms, said Sheriff's Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the narcotics bureau.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lancaster Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant set bail at $1 million for  Ronald Podratz and Calvin James, two men described as caretakers at an estate  east of Lancaster where deputies Thursday confiscated 6,000 marijuana plants  and high-technology growing equipment from an underground bunker.  </P> <P> The arraignment of Podratz and James was continued until Nov. 27 at the request  of their court-appointed attorneys. The two face up to three years in prison if  convicted of charges of possession and cultivation of marijuana for sale.  </P> <P> Prosecutors will decide today whether to charge a third suspect being held in  Lancaster, Richard Yerger Jr., Cooley said. Documents indicate that Yerger, who  surrendered in Long Beach Saturday, owns the property containing the marijuana  farm near Lancaster, but prosecutors said they were looking for further  evidence.  </P> <P> Yerger's father, Richard E. Yerger, was still being sought for questioning,  deputies said. Documents show the elder Yerger, owner of a Lancaster  contracting firm, owns a house in the desert community of Llano where a raid  Friday turned up a second marijuana plantation that was smaller but more  sophisticated than the first, authorities said. The farms are about 20 miles  apart.  </P> <P> The Yergers and Frank Gegax, a Lancaster contractor in federal custody in Los  Angeles, are believed to have played "high-level" roles in the operation, a  federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent said Monday. Gegax, owner of KMG  Construction Inc. in Lancaster, surrendered to deputies Thursday and was  charged in Phoenix Friday with conspiracy to possess marijuana for sale.  </P> <P> The DEA agent, who declined to be identified, said investigators believe the  Yergers and Gegax financed the plantations, which authorities say cost about $1  million to construct and produced a harvest worth between $75 million and $150  million on the street.  </P> <P> Cooley would not comment on that description. He said investigators are still  trying to determine the scope of the case, which also involves two additional  underground marijuana farms in Arizona.  </P> <P> Federal agents in Phoenix are holding six suspects after an Oct. 30 raid on  those sites, which DEA agent John Albano described Monday as the DEA's largest  seizure ever at an underground operation.  </P> <P> Prosecutors in Lancaster said both Gegax and the Yergers had the construction  expertise needed to build the elaborate plantations. The Lancaster plantation  appeared to have been in operation for at least two years, authorities said.  </P> <P> Authorities also noted that Richard Yerger Inc. was the general contractor and  KMG was a subcontractor on a Lancaster senior citizen housing complex under  construction that was destroyed in a $4-million fire in November, 1987. Arson  investigators suspected that the fire was deliberately set but no arrests were  made.  </P> <P> Authorities said the arson investigation may be reopened as a result of the  arrests of Gegax and the younger Yerger, who reportedly worked in his father's  firm.  </P> <P> In an interview Monday, Richard Yerger Jr.'s brother-in-law -- Alfred Brand of  Sebastopol in Northern California -- said the construction firm has been in  difficult financial straits for the past three years as a result of the 1987  fire and expensive litigation that ensued.  </P> <P> "They were essentially shut down because of the arson," Brand said. Brand said  he found it hard to believe that the Yergers could take part in the expensive  marijuana production operation because of their financial problems.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Chandler contributed to this story.  </P></p>

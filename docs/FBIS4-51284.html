			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation (MFN)  trading status is conducive to the improvement and development  of Sino-U.S. relations, especially the enhancement of bilateral  trade and economic co-operation, said a spokesman for the  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-Operation  (MFTEC) here today.    On may 26 President Clinton announced his decision to extend  China's MFN status for 1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN  reviews from the human rights issue.    "We welcome President Clinton's decision, which accords with  the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples," the  spokesman said.    He said that the MFN treatment that China and the United  States grant to each other is a reciprocal and mutually  beneficial arrangement. It is the core of bilateral trade  agreements and serves as the foundation stone for bilateral  trade relations.    China has consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade  issues or attaching conditions or requirements, said the  spokesman.    The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to  Sino-U.S. trade relations, and it has made major efforts for the  maintenance, improvement and growth of such relations, he said.    The actions the U.S. side has taken in the past few years in  connection with the MFN issue has done harm to bilateral trade  and the overall relations between the two countries, and the  peoples of the two countries. U.S. entrepreneurs and a great  number of consumers especially have expressed their concerns and  worries, the spokesman said.    "We welcome the positive efforts that the U.S. side made to  change this situation " said the spokesman.    "But," he said, "we have to point out with great regret [shi  fen yi han 0577 0433 6695 2013] that, while announcing the  renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side stated that the  existing sanctions against China would be maintained."    The spokesman expressed the hope that the U.S. Government  would, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the two  countries and peoples, remove all sanctions against China, so  that Sino-U.S. trade relations can enjoy smooth and healthy  progress.    He pointed out that the current situation offers a  historical  opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations,  especially bilateral trade relations.    "We believe that so long as both sides, on the basis of  mutual respect equality, and mutual benefit, adopt positive  measures and eliminate the artificially imposed obstacles, the  trade relations between China the U.S. will be further  developed," the spokesman said.</p>

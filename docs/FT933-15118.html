			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Summiteers vs speculators JUST AT the point when economic summitry was assumed to have passed irretrievably beyond its natural shelf life, events in Tokyo have conspired to defer the post-mortem. True, the much-trumpeted tariff-cutting deal was the work of ministers from the 'Quad' group of countries - the US, the EC, Japan and Canada - rather than the seven summit countries. But the endorsement of the Group of Seven will add to the pressure to complete the stalled Uruguay trade round. Nor is the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) Russia fund a negligible piece of economic diplomacy at a time when the G7 nations apart from Japan are under tight fiscal constraints. The ready promises of fiscal and monetary virtue in yesterday's communique are another matter. But at least there was no row; and while the trade deal on access for manufactured products is just one step on an arduous path that has yet to address the thorny issue of farm trade, it runs pleasingly counter to expectations in a world economy that is increasingly marred by echoes of the economic frictions of the 1930s. That, indeed, is just what high-level economic diplomacy is meant to be about. The mere process of establishing a summit agenda puts pressure on world leaders to address difficult issues in a forum that helps them rise above bureaucratic and political constraints. In the mid-to-late 1970s relatively informal gatherings actually achieved something by preventing a more rapid slide towards protection after the first oil crisis. It was only when summits became more formal and ambitious, with attempts at global demand management and co-operative exchange rate agreements, that they became nugatory. Bitter memory That is one reason to feel more cheerful about trade after the Tokyo meetings than about the promises to bring down European interest rates and to cut the US budget deficit. The Bundesbank was not represented at the summit; and its officials retain a bitter collective memory of the inflationary consequences of the 1978 summit, which required Germany to act as a locomotive for the world economy. Nor is the US Congress a soft touch on the budget. A better trade deal might have been done, notably over textiles, were it not for President Clinton's worries about pushing through his tax bill. As for the Japanese, if they deliver on their promise to stimulate demand further, it will be because they perceive it to be in their domestic interest to do so. The other reason to be sceptical about the aspirations of the summiteers on the monetary front is that they are a much less potent force in today's world economy than the speculators. These appear to be offering an alternative, quicker solution to the problem of deficient demand in continental Europe by putting the French franc to the test. Yesterday the franc moved perilously close to its floor within the ERM as money flooded into the D-Mark, largely in response to a worsening official forecast of the shrinkage in French GDP this year, together with a prediction that unemployment would rise from 11.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent by December. Politically untenable Clearly the money men scent that the high level of French real interest rates in a deepening recession is becoming politically as well as economically untenable. French monetary policy is in the hands of the Bundesbank, which still has to cope with inflation of more than 4 per cent, money supply growing at above its target and worries about D-Mark weakness against the dollar and the yen. Unless German interest rates come down further and faster than the Bundesbank has so far allowed, the pressure on the franc can only increase. But unemployment, which was a more pressing concern for the summit participants this week than inflation, is not solely attributable to deficient demand. In Europe, whose five largest economies have an average unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent, it has a disproportionately large structural component. And here a report agreed by the G7 finance ministers shifted from previous summits' emphasis on deregulation to active public policies, including measures on education and training. This followed President Clinton's call for a ministerial summit to consider the causes of structural unemployment and potential remedies. Whether a global meeting makes sense when the structural features of labour markets in the US, Europe and Japan are so obviously different is a moot point. The pressing problem is Europe, which suffers from real wage rigidity, low mobility and high non-wage employment costs. These are already the subject of an initiative by Mr Jacques Delors within the European Community. And the OECD is conducting a wider review, which covers the G7 and most of the developed world. At first sight, there may seem little harm in duplicating the effort in a summit talk shop. But if the talk focuses on the export of jobs from the developed world to Asia, the risk is that protection could come back on to the agenda via the back door - an outcome that should be stoutly resisted.</p>

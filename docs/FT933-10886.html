			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Surprise as King Baudouin is succeeded by his brother and produced surprise over the choice of his successor. The 62-year-old king, a devout Catholic who briefly abdicated in 1990 rather than sign Belgium's law legalising abortion, died from a heart attack on Saturday while on holiday in Spain with his Spanish-born wife, Queen Fabiola. After a cabinet meeting to discuss funeral and succession arrangements, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, yesterday flew to Spain to accompany the king's body back to Brussels. Last night, the government announced that the king's 59-year-old brother Prince Albert of Liege would succeed to the throne and become the sixth king of the Belgians. Until the last minute the succession was open. Prince Albert is next in line for the throne but had been widely expected to renounce his right in favour of his 33-year-old son, Prince Philippe. Philippe had been groomed as the heir apparent, but he is shy and unmarried. Talk that the throne might pass to his married sister, Astrid, was prompted by the 1991 change to the Belgian constitution allowing a woman to become monarch. Belgium's proportional voting system and linguistic divide between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemish give its monarchs more than just a figurehead role. Belgian elections seldom throw up a clear winner, and it falls to the monarch to decide which party leader should try to form a coalition government. This must be linguistically as well as politically balanced. King Baudouin played this role in an exemplary fashion. With the growing tendency of his countrymen to identify themselves as primarily Walloons or Flemish, or indeed Bruxellois, the bilingual monarch often came to be seen as the only real Belgian left holding the country together. He was concerned at the outset about reforms which in recent years have devolved much political and economic power to the country's two regions - Flanders and Wallonia - and to its capital of Brussels. However, the king praised in his National Day address on July 21 this year 'the democratic and peaceful way' in which Belgium had become a federal state. He went on to argue forcefully for 'a federal Europe', and his championing of European integration was yesterday praised by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. But the tall, stooping, bespectacled Baudouin was often dubbed the 'sad king' in a reign that got off to a shaky start. The standing of his father, Leopold III, never recovered from his controversial decision to stay with his people in May 1940 and surrender to the Germans, against the advice of his government which escaped to London. Faced with strikes and riots in Belgium, Leopold abdicated in 1951 in favour of his 21-year-old son. Nine years later, Baudouin married Fabiola, a Spanish aristocrat, avoiding as his ancestors had done Belgium's linguistic jealousies by wedding a foreigner. But Fabiola suffered three miscarriages and they never had children. In 1990, he said he could not in conscience sign a bill legalising abortion. To his critics, mainly on the left, who argued that the king had a duty to sign any bill which the parliament had passed, he wrote in an anguished letter to the parliament: 'Does freedom of conscience apply to everyone except the king?' In the event, the Belgian government allowed him to step down for a day so that the abortion bill could pass into law without his approv al. At the time, it was said the king's abdication-for-a-day would weaken permanently the monarchy's position. But most Belgians even those who did not share his views on abortion, seemed to appreciate the king more after his moral gesture.</p>

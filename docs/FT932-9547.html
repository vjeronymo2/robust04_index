			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Body Shop At least Body Shop International is now fighting back. Whether the company will succeed in re-establishing its brand position in the UK is another matter. The problem is not only doubt over whether the fashion for environmentally friendly cosmetics is passe and over Body Shop's ability to attract older customers. It is also one of whether margins can be recaptured, given the competition from Boots and others. Body Shop will try very hard to convince consumers that its products are of superior quality, but persuading them to pay premium prices could prove an uphill struggle in an age where customers appear more concerned with value than brand image. Without a solid base in the UK, international expansion, which is seen as the main engine of growth, would be all the harder. Like for like sales growth of 6 per cent in overseas markets outside the US is encouraging, and US operating profits more than doubled after stripping out the cost of moving the head office to North Carolina. But competition in the US is growing. While Body Shop is not doomed to fail, it is not doomed to succeed either. Given that uncertainty, an historic multiple of nearly 28 looks stretched. Perhaps that is why Body Shop is touting the interest in its shares which has surfaced in the US. Its new ADR facility could prove a source of demand, although US investors are every bit as fickle as the British buyers of pineapple facial wash.</p>

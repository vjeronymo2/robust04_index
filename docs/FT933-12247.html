			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Figures show decline in car output JAPANESE car output figures for the first half of the year indicate that production from January to June fell 7.2 per cent from the same period last year. Car production in Japan slumped to 5.9m units in the six months to June, falling below the 6m level for the first time in almost eight years, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The fall means the Japanese car industry has suffered its fifth consecutive half-year decline. Jama said it did not expect demand to recover significantly in the second half of this year. Continued weakness in the Japanese market makes it possible that output for the year will fall below 12m units for the first time since 1984, Jama said. Among car makers Mazda suffered the largest fall, of 18.6 per cent, followed by Nissan, which saw a decline of 14.6 per cent. Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, fell 3.8 per cent. The weakness of domestic demand is likely to put pressure on Japanese car makers to step up exports. However, US car makers have shown increasingly protectionist tendencies, with the Big Three calling for reduced Japanese imports and claiming Japanese car makers have dumped mini-vans in the US market. The west European market is also extremely weak and Japan faces pressure from the European Community to reduce the number of car imports allowed into the EC, in a monitoring agreement it has with the Community. At the same time, the yen's surge against the dollar this year has eroded Japanese makers' competitiveness in world markets.</p>

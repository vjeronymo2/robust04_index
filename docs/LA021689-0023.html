			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUFFY TO LET GRAND JURY REVIEW JAIL DEATHS; SAYS DEPARTMENT IS VINDICATED  </P> <P> A day after the decision by federal authorities not to prosecute sheriff's  deputies for alleged beatings in the county's jails, San Diego County Sheriff  John Duffy revealed a new policy that will transfer authority to investigate  jail deaths from his department to the County Grand Jury.  </P> <P> During a lengthy interview in his office Wednesday, Duffy also responded to the  decision not to prosecute deputies in 70 cases of alleged civil rights  violations at the county jails, saying it was a vindication of his department  and provided "a feeling of uplifting after all this sagging."  </P> <P> The FBI and U. S. attorney's office announced Tuesday that there was  insufficient evidence to prosecute deputies and jail personnel in dozens of  incidents in which inmates were reportedly beaten or died in custody. The FBI  began its probe in May after scores of inmates and former inmates complained of  harsh treatment at the facilities and were the subject of many stories in the  press.  </P> <P> Duffy, who has been sheriff since 1971, never acknowledged that his decision to  let the Grand Jury investigate jail deaths was prompted by criticism of the  department's management of the jails.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Sensible Review'  </P> <P> "I intend to turn every jail death to the Grand Jury from here on, every single  one. That, in my mind, is a sensible review," Duffy said. However, he quickly  added that he does not expect the new policy to silence his critics.  </P> <P> "When the Grand Jury reviews the death of an inmate, and they don't find that  the deputies were sadistic, somebody will complain about that. . . . You're not  going to satisfy the critics, no matter what you do," he said.  </P> <P> Under the old policy, deaths were investigated by sheriff's homicide  detectives, which critics, including San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding,  likened to the fox guarding the chicken coop.  </P> <P> Although the federal probe cleared the Sheriff's Department in 70 cases, U. S.  Atty. William Braniff said authorities are still reviewing two other cases to  determine if prosecutions are warranted. Duffy said the cases still under  review involve the death of Albert Manuel Varela, who died at the downtown  jail, and John McDougall, a Vista man who charged that he was handcuffed and  beaten by a deputy who responded to his emergency call for help.  </P> <P> "The federal grand jury is still looking at the Varela and McDougall cases.  I've been told that there is no evidence in either of the cases of a criminal  conspiracy. I'm told that the maximum would be misdemeanor charges issued in  these two cases as a result of the grand jury investigation. They haven't found  civil rights violations," Duffy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prosecution Unwarranted  </P> <P> Braniff declined to confirm or deny that the federal Grand Jury is still  investigating the two cases. Instead, he said that, in every case that was  reviewed, "prosecution was not warranted."  </P> <P> The sheriff blamed the news media for the massive FBI probe, which he said  resulted from "an orchestrated campaign on the part of the San Diego  Union-Tribune." According to Duffy, reporters from the two papers "have told us  that they've been assigned to write something negative every single day" about  him and the department. He claimed that editors at the two papers "don't like  the fact that I'm independent."  </P> <P> Tribune Editor Neil Morgan reacted with humor to Duffy's comments, responding  that "we have no programmed reporters."  </P> <P> "John is a consummate politician," Morgan said. "Like some politicians, he  needs to clear his lungs. Too bad we can't clear his head, too. I'd box him if  it were up to me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Indulging in Paranoia'  </P> <P> Union Editor Gerald Warren said that Duffy was "indulging himself in a little  paranoia."  </P> <P> "We reported legitimate complaints about treatment at the jail," Warren said.  "The FBI is not saying that the beatings did not take place. They're saying  that they didn't have evidence, except in two cases, to recommend prosecution."  </P> <P> Duffy acknowledged that there have been instances of deputies using excessive  force at the jail and on the street.  </P> <P> "I've disciplined 52 deputies for using excessive force in the past five years.  . . . If you mistreat people, you're going to answer for it. Nine of these  deputies were referred to the district attorney's office for prosecution,"  Duffy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Problems at Facilities  </P> <P> With the exception of crowding at the jails, Duffy said, he found few problems  at the facilities. Duffy candidly remarked that incarceration at the El Cajon  and South Bay facilities amount to "cruel and unusual punishment." He said  that, on Wednesday, the El Cajon jail, which was designed to hold 120 inmates,  had 689, and the South Bay jail, which was designed to hold 192 inmates, had  794.  </P> <P> Federal officials said they are forwarding the results of the FBI investigation  to the County Grand Jury, which is conducting an administrative review of the  Sheriff's Department. Duffy said he expects a critical report from the Grand  Jury, but added that some of the criticisms directed at him and the department  will be unwarranted.  </P> <P> "My best guess is that the Grand Jury is going to make findings of a lot of  inadequacies. Some will be mine, but some will be totally out of my control. .  . . They will find failures in supervision and middle management, and they will  find inadequate training, I'm sure," Duffy said.  </P></p>

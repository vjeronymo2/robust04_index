			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: Uncle Silas - Theatre How 'richly compostly loamishly sad were those Victorian days,' wrote Stevie Smith in Novel on Yellow Paper '. . . always someone dies, someone weeps, in tune with the laurels dripping . . . and the dim gas flickering greenly in the damp conservatory.' Mike Alfreds' production of Uncle Silas for the Cambridge Theatre Company, currently at the Lyric, Hammersmith, understands not just the eerieness of something nasty in the shrubbery but the melancholy as well; not just death stalking the over-upholstered drawing-rooms, honoured with cultish ritual and jet trimmings, but that house-guest the Victorians preferred not to acknowledge: sex. Sheridan Le Fanu's novel belongs, like Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White, to the genre of the abused and deluded heiress driven almost mad with terror before being rescued from nefarious plotters. Alfreds is fond of the Gothic tale, as witness his National Theatre production of that old chiller, The Wandering Jew. Paul Dart's designs, all black foliage and sable swags on walls that slide silently into place, evokes the requisite spookiness. Other elements include the grotesque menace of the sinister French governess: Sam Cox plays her with unabashed, raw-boned masculinity and an accent that verges on parody ('eet ees your turn to suffair'). The production shows the affectionate mockery of style characteristic of confident story-tellers, combined with absolute respect for the substance. But if the style looks back to Struwwelpeter's eruption of the nightmarish into the almost comically prosaic, it also looks forward: to the thriller of atmosphere, unvoiced suspicion, half-understood fears, as cumulative as a Hitchcock film, as internalised as Henry James' Turn of the Screw, where the reader is unsure whether the ghosts are real or products of hysteria. Did James unconsciously remember Silas's maid Mary Quince when he created the spectral manservant, Peter Quint?. Here the production's bumpiness tells against the smooth spinning of a mood of ambiguity. As practically nothing really frightening happens before the interval, mood is all-important. The director's own adaptation pares the narration down to a series of short, sometimes elliptical scenes. One feels something is missing. Once the orphaned Maud (Anne Marie Duff, looking every inch the tremulously courageous - and foolish - Victorian heroine) has taken up residence with her mysterious Uncle Silas (Terence Wilton in a white mane, looking like Liszt) the yarn is spun more clearly but also more slowly. If the pace and rhythm can be evened out there will be much to enjoy, including often ingenious doubling. Sam Cox abandons his Gallic governess for a brutal northern peasant; Mary Roscoe has the Dickensian gift of being funny and touching; and Carolyn Jones splendidly differentiates between a snarling crone below-stairs and the natural good-heartedness of the British aristocracy. The production unwaveringly captures the sense of cruelty and danger that a child sometimes feels when regarding the incomprehensible world which, in this respect at least, resembles the grimmest of fairy-tales.</p>

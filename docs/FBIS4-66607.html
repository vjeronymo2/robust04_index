			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Janata Dal [JD] affairs took  a curious turn today with the party president, Mr. S.R. Bommai  announcing his decision to quit the post. The former Prime  Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, now convalescing in London, was  nominated by the national executive of the Dal to head the  party. A resolution to this effect was passed by the executive.    However, Mr. Singh's consent is still awaited, despite  claims  from sections that the former Prime Minister had agreed to take  over the reins of the party. Until such time Mr. Singh expresses  his opinion, Mr. Bommai will continue to lead the party. A new  president will have to be elected by the general body of the  party within six months from now, according to the Dal  constitution.    Sources within the party described today's development as  `part of a concerted move to oust Mr. Bommai and install Mr. Ram  Vilas Paswan as party president'. According to them, Mr. Singh  is expected to decline the post and hoist his confidant in place  of Mr. Bommai.    Taken by surprise: Though today's development was  more or less on expected lines, with powerful sections within  the Dal gunning for Mr. Bommai, his decision to quit today  appears to have taken his supporters in the national executive  by surprise. Speculations are rife of a further split in the  party, which is already witnessing exodus at local levels.    Today's national executive was preceded by a meeting of the  Political Affairs Committee, where the demand for Mr. Bommai's  ouster was raised by members, led by the Bihar Chief Minister,  Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav. Mr. Bommai's announcement to step down  was essentially a fallout of this, said partymen.    Those who opposed Mr. Bommai's ouster include the Dal  vice-president, Mr. George Fernandes, and the entire `socialist  camp' within the party. This camp was closeted in a meeting  immediately after the executive meeting. The executive is slated  to continue its deliberations tomorrow, when the Dal's rout in  the recent elections is expected to come up.    Apart from Dal leaders leaving the party to join Mr. Mulayam  Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, a similar movement of Dal men,  including some MPs, joining the Congress(I) seem to be on the  cards. Confirming such an eventuality, a Dal MP from Bihar today  said "we cannot remain party to this decision and do not intend  to continue with them."    Mr. Bommai told the press that he had offered to quit as  party president on consideration that Mr. Singh alone was  capable of retrieving the Dal from the dumps that it is in  today. "I am a satisfied and contented man today," said Mr.  Bommai.    Though the meeting was slated to discuss a score of issues,  including the `merger of Dal factions which was initiated at  Ghazaibad in September 1993', the only business transacted today  was Mr. Bommai's stepping down. In fact, demands by Orissa Chief  Minister, Mr. Biju Patnaik, and others that Mr. V.P. Singh's  consent be obtained before resolving the issue of party  presidentship, was turned down by vocal sections.    Apart from Mr. Patnaik, the move was resented by Mr.  Ramakrishna Hegde and many others from the southern States. This  demand, sources said, was `violently' turned down by sections  led by Mr. Laloo Prasad.    `Consent': According to Mr. Bommai, Mr. Laloo  Prasad claimed that he had spoken to Mr. V.P. Singh on the  proposal to which he had agreed to. As if to endorse this, Mr.  Bommai added that he too had expressed such a view to Mr. Singh,  before his departure to London and "Mr. Singh did not say no."</p>

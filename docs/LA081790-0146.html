			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS: SMART CASH REGISTERS AND DUMB PEOPLE  </P> <P> There seems to be some concern that as cash registers get smarter, the people  behind them get less so.  </P> <P> Consumers complain that clerks can't add up even two or three purchases without  a register. A newspaper columnist writes of his encounter with a salesclerk who  couldn't "do 10%" of $28.86 in her head.  </P> <P> And a Los Angeles lawyer named George Schulman had to fight a McDonald's clerk  and her manager over the proper charge for two "Happy Meals" with milkshakes  substituted for the provided drinks. It was computed several times, with  different results. "Maybe the register can't ring up something that's not  already in the computer," says Schulman, "or maybe they were just unable to  explain what they were doing."  </P> <P> The sagging capability of American workers is neither news nor limited to  retail counters. Overall, "the rate of increase in productivity has dropped  dramatically" in this country since the 1970s, said the recent report of the  Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce. The commissioners, from  both industry and government, blamed, among other things, the poor education  and training of front-line workers, and the fact that management would rather  turn to machines or offshore workers than train them.  </P> <P> Our math skills in particular have been slipping. It has been reported that a  quarter of American 13-year-olds don't understand basic math principles, that  American eighth-graders scored 13th among 17 nations in math and that the  average Japanese 12th-grader is better at math than the top 5% of American  12th-graders.  </P> <P> The wonderful abilities of the machines further depress the operators'  abilities. As Emerson wrote in 1841, "The civilized man has built a coach, but  has lost the use of his feet."  </P> <P> Plain old cash registers are often computer terminals connected to a company's  mainframe. They do everything from registering sales to keeping track of  inventory, leaving it to the employee just to punch in the item number, price,  and amount tendered. Most machines even announce the correct change. "You don't  need math to operate the machine," says Jim Cortese, spokesman for NCR  (formerly National Cash Register) in Dayton, Ohio, "but you still have to count  out the change."  </P> <P> Many machines don't even demand item number and price. Fast-food stores with  limited menus may have machines with buttons describing each item, which  automatically ring up the price when pushed. Big stores with a wide range of  goods have scanners which read a bar code; again, the machine supplies the  price.  </P> <P> With such machines, why should salespeople know math? Why, indeed, should  children learn math procedures, wrote a New York math teacher (a teacher!) to  Time magazine, "when a $4.95 calculator will do it more quickly and  accurately?"  </P> <P> Cortese's answer: "The issue is larger -- it's what learning those skills does  to your brain, which needs software in it."  </P> <P> Obviously, these machines have real advantages, having been developed not to  depress everyone's math skills but to automate retail sales procedure.  </P> <P> "They enable us to take care of customers a lot quicker, which improves the  level of service," says Rob Rohde, director of human resource planning and  development for Sears Merchandise Group.  </P> <P> Salespeople can spend more time helping customers on the sales floor.  </P> <P> Machines also free people from the need to master certain skills. Many retail  counter jobs are now open to the young, untrained, and uneducated. Fast-food  restaurants, supermarkets and big merchandisers generally require neither proof  nor exercise of arithmetic skills and in return, pay little.  </P> <P> Presumably, employees are freed to develop their abilities elsewhere, if still  sales-directed.  </P> <P> "We used to spend half a day on the arithmetic part of it -- how to figure out  a discount, how to compute sales tax," says Jack Fraser, vice president for  human resources at the National Retail Federation in New York. "Now retailers  can spend it on customer service."  </P> <P> "The register does everything now," says Aileen Gorman, spokesman for  Boston-based Bradlees discount stores, which is installing scanners, along with  a formal course in customer service for salespeople.  </P> <P> "They don't have to do much thinking, but they do have to smile, to listen  actively, to treat the customer with courtesy."  </P> <P> Such civility training seems a limited enough goal, but even that is hardly  widespread. Few managements even seem to be thinking of the new automation as  offering benefits beyond better, faster sales processing.  </P> <P> It's hard to find retailers using this freed-up time to train low-wage  employees in anything.  </P> <P> "Only a handful of our companies invest in training," said the Commission on  the Skills of the American Workforce report, so low-paid workers are trapped in  low-paid jobs.  </P> <P> It's hard even to find retailers providing more customer service out on the  floor: most just install computerized registers, cut their staffing, and save  money.  </P> <P> Better machines make a better world, right?  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Under a new policy, University of California students face discipline, ranging  up to dismissal from school, if they use derogatory racial or sexual epithets  to harass another person on campus. UC President David Gardner announced that  the new rule on so-called "fighting words" was in response to several incidents  of racial antagonism in recent years on UC campuses and other schools around  the nation. He said the policy is not intended to limit free speech, but that  it recognizes "that words can be used in such a way that they no longer express  an idea, but rather are used to injure and intimidate, thus undermining the  ability of individuals to participate fully in the university community."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb April 18 TASS -- Russian envoy to former  Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin failed to talk Bosnian Serbs into  ceasing their offensive on Gorazde and warned them that attempts  to seize the city would trigger mass bloodshed.    "My only hope is that fire will no longer be opened on the  town. It would be a huge catastrophe to try and seize it -- this  would result in an immense bloodshed", he told reporters before  leaving for Moscow Monday. Churkin arrived in Zagreb from  Sarajevo.    The situation around the Muslim enclave in Bosnia "is poorly  manageable and completely unexplainable in any reasonable and  logical terms", he stressed.    During his eight-day trip Churkin tried to ensure "a serious  agreement on ceasing hostilities along the whole of the  Serbian-Muslim front and proceed to a political settlement and,  what was always important for the Serbs, to a practical  beginning of the lifting of sanctions".    "Only one thing was demanded from the Serbs in the given  situation -- to stop their offensive on Gorazde", Churkin said  and added "unfortunately, they failed to do that".    "Defence of Gorazde has collapsed. It is surrounded by  Serbs. We worried all day yesterday whether they would open  fire. Luckily they fired only four mines. The situation was  very tense when three tanks approached the city. Had they  fired, NATO could have resumed air strikes", he said.    According to Churkin, Serbs have reportedly agreed to allow  the evacuation of the sick from Gorazde, "but for the time being  we are afraid to do that as the arrival of helicopters can cause  panic among refugees".    Churkin refused to predict further developments in Gorazde.  He only said that "if they get out of this humanitarian deadend  we shall see how the developments go".</p>

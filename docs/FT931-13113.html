			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Gerber earnings decline 10% GERBER Products, the US consumer products and services group, reported third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 26.5m, or 36 cents a share. This compared with Dollars 14.5m, or 19 cents, a year earlier, but this was after an after-tax charge of Dollars 16m, or 21 cents, to restructure the company's apparel operations, Reuter reports from Fremont. The group, which raised baby food prices in October, blamed the 10 per cent profits fall, excluding the charge, on a drop in orders due to higher price competition and a declining US birth-rate.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Recovery in sales of new cars continues REGISTRATIONS of new cars in the first 20 days of August jumped by 12.1 per cent to 325,792 from 290,551 in the same period last year. August is the most hectic period of the year for the retail motor industry and is a key test of new-car demand. It has accounted for 23 per cent of total annual new-car sales in each of the past two years. The 20-day figures released to carmakers yesterday confirm that the recovery in sales shown in the first 10 days of the month has been sustained and have led some manufacturers to revise upwards their forecasts for the full month. Ford, the leader of the UK new-car market, said that it had raised its forecast for the whole of August from 400-405,000 to 415,000, indicating a jump of about 11 per cent from sales of 374,000 last August. During the first 20 days of August the biggest gains in the UK market have been achieved by Renault and Citroen, the French carmakers, and by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US. New-car sales have been higher than a year ago in 13 of the past 16 months, and registrations in the first seven months of the year rose by 9.1 per cent to 874,411. The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where sales are growing, albeit from a depressed level after three years of recession. The falling demand in continental Europe is already hitting car production at producers in the UK, in particular Vauxhall, Peugeot and Ford, which have imposed some short-time working this year. UK car production in the first seven months was still 6.6 per cent higher than in the same period a year before thanks to the build-up of output from Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In July production fell, reversing 18 months of almost uninterrupted growth. Renault merger near, Page 21</p>

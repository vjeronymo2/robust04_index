			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB rises on talk of takeover TSB outshone a generally weak banking sector as the market ignored continuing worries about bad debts and today's one-day strike by the staff in protest against job losses, and concentrated on another burst of takeover speculation and rumours of asset disposals. Shares in TSB have been restrained in recent sessions as strike worries built up. But yesterday saw a bout of heavy buying in the stock which took it to 161 1/2 p at one point, with marketmakers reporting speculation that the bank could be about to announce the sale of its Hill Samuel merchant bank - possibly to a European buyer - for around Pounds 200m. TSB launched a bid for Hill Samuel just before the great crash in October 1987 and eventually paid more than Pounds 770m for the merchant bank. It subsequently suffered heavy losses. At the close TSB was 6 higher at 158p after turnover of 11m shares. The takeover stories, which have surrounded TSB for a couple of years, erupted again yesterday, with Lloyds Bank, unsuccessful in its attempt at gaining control of Midland Bank last year, again put forward as a potential predator. Abbey National was also mentioned as a possible suitor. Banking analysts, however, said it was more likely that marketmakers had been caught short of TSB stock after some string buying by income funds anxious to lock in the TSB dividend ahead of the preliminary results, expected on January 14. Lloyds Bank lost 8 to 534p, albeit in relatively thin trading, while Abbey National, still said to be feeling the effects of a recent profits downgrade, fell 7 to 371p on 5.2m traded. Unigate active Takeover talk swirled around Unigate, one of the stock market's favourite bid rumour targets, with French dairy products group BSN once again said to be considering a courtship. Most analysts were dismissive, however, arguing that while BSN wants to concentrate on developing specific product lines - which Unigate's St Ivel subsidiary would provide - it is unlikely to tackle such a large dairy combine. The French group, which issued a denial yesterday, has a history of non-hostile acquisitions. However, according to analysts, the main source of the rumour appears to have come from a meeting of the St Ivel board, which was called unexpectedly to discuss restructuring, rather than a BSN bid. This did not stop speculators clambering aboard in early hectic trading and the Unigate shares closed at 329p, up 19. Burton steadies Tougher than expected rationalisation moves at Burton inspired more positive comments on the group's recovery potential and saw analysts move quickly to upgrade profits forecasts. Burton believes its sweeping redundancy package will be repaid within a year and that the full cost savings of Pounds 20m will be felt in the 1993-94 accounting year. Most analysts left 1992-93 predictions untouched, but for the following year, new forecasts ranged from Pounds 50m to Pounds 75m as the full extent of the savings were counted in. Mr Steve Oldfield at Smith New Court said Burton was becoming 'one of the market's most interesting recovery stories' and that short-term investors were likely to be rewarded in the near term. However, the large volumes traded in recent days against a relatively slow upward price move demonstrated that some investors are continuing to bale out. Yesterday, the shares added 1 1/2 at 80p on turnover of 23m. Standard Chartered, one of the market's best performers in recent months, came under renewed selling pressure, closing 13 cheaper at 586p, as a number of institutions took profits in the stock, which rejoined the FT-SE 100 at the start of this year. There was big turnover - 4.5m - in Bank of Scotland amid talk of a hefty profits downgrade, with the shares settling 1 1/2 easier at 122p. Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, held steady at 52p after Newton Investment Management said it had bought another large chunk of the company's shares, increasing its stake by more than 1 percentage point to 16.64 per cent. The investment company said no one individual client held a stake of more than 3 per cent. Royal Insurance continued to lead the composite sector higher, the shares closing 7 dearer at 291p after turnover of 2.8m. Burmah Castrol was a notable casualty in an otherwise sedate oil sector, with the shares sliding amid wild and subsequently denied rumours that the group was about to launch a rights issue and embark on a counter-bid for Evode, the chemicals group currently facing interest from Wassall and Laporte. Burmah's denials to brokers triggered a mild recovery for the shares but they still ended a volatile session sharply lower on balance. The stock closed a net 22 off at 710p, having been as low as 705p at one point. Turnover came to 1.4m shares. Highly geared Rank Organisation softened 2 to 704p as the old rumours of rights issues returned, although they found little credence with analysts. More likely, it is suggested, is Stakis, whose results at the end of the month are expected to be another positive step on the group's road to recovery. With high debts the hotel group is expected to announce either a cash call, or the disposal of its casinos or nursing homes, or both. The shares put on 3 at 44p. Embattled Owners Abroad gained 2 at 122p after widespread suggestions that it will need a higher bid from rival Airtours to win the day. Shares in the latter weakened 11 to 291p. Food distributor Booker jumped 26 to 434p as the company hosted a series of meetings with institutions. Investors were said to have been reassured over prospects for the dividend, which was thought to be under pressure, and other aspects of the group's business. Kleinwort Benson was also reported to have been positive on the stock. Kwik Save's announcement at the agm of its sales increase was already in the price and the shares slipped 3 to 800p. Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers remained strong, helped by a buy note from Kleinwort Benson. There was also talk of stake-building by Mr George Soros, the private investor, whose Quantum Fund vehicle is said to have taken a 2.75 per cent holding. The shares rose 4 to 97p. Renewed strong support for Cray Electronics was triggered by news of a Pounds 4.5m contract to supply turnkeys for satellite image processing, and suggestions that a number of leading brokers are about to lift their current year profits forecasts from around Pounds 15m to Pounds 17m, and those for next year from some Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 25m. The shares, already at their highest level for around 2 1/2 years, advanced 10 1/2 to 126 1/2 p on turnover of 5.5m. Delta surged 13 to 431p, with analysts taking the view that the company offers all the strengths of BICC but without the drawbacks of property/ construction exposure. Dealers drew encouragement from the latest figures for new car sales and marked motor distributor shares sharply higher. Appleyard Group moved forward 10 to 95p, Evans Halshaw 5 to 243p, Lookers 7 to 115p and Henlys 9 to 96p. Reg Vardy, however, lost 8 to 125p after the 9 per cent fall in profits. A Williams de Broe recommendation to switch out of Johnson Matthey and into Charter Consolidated, coupled with vague takeover stories, drove Charter shares sharply higher. They closed a net 37 up at 655p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (183).

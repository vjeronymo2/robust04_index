			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Moscow missiles offer to Pretoria RUSSIA will this week invite South African officials to Moscow for formal talks on supplying Pretoria with converted SS-20 intermediate-range missiles to launch nine space satellites. Moscow has informally offered to launch South African observation satellites at one quarter the price of a western launch. A formal offer is likely to heighten concerns among US and European companies in the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year commercial launch business that they could be priced out of the market by the Russian space industry. Mr Yuri Milov, deputy director of the Russian Space Agency, said the design bureau for the missiles, which are due to be eliminated under the INF (Intermediate Nuclear Forces) disarmament treaty, had already elaborated plans to convert them to civilian uses. But Russian authorities were anxious to put South African inquiries on an official footing, to avoid accusations of improper dealings with a nation that still faced western arms sanctions. 'Otherwise, the next thing we know the Americans will be screaming we are proposing to supply South Africa with strategic weapons,' he said, recalling recent US attempts to block Russia's sale of rocket engines to India for satellite-launching. Informal Moscow-Pretoria contacts have already come through the Bonn office of the South Africa Foundation, a private-sector lobby group. Moscow had offered launches at Dollars 10m each on SS-20s, Mr Rudolf Gruber of the SA Foundation said. Similar launches cost Dollars 40m in the west. The Ukrainian design bureau, which produced the much larger SS-18 long-range missiles, due to be eliminated under the Start-2 treaty, was also trying to find civilian customers. The SS-18 multiple warhead technology meant all nine satellites could be launched together.</p>

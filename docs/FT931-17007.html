			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Besnier's 8% stake in Bel fuels takeover speculation BESNIER, the acquisitive French cheese group, has been building a stake in Bel, the maker of one of France's best known soft cheeses, fuelling speculation that it might eventually try to take control of the company. The French cheese industry is in the throes of restructuring chiefly due to the expansion of Besnier, a family firm led by Mr Michel Besnier which recently bought les Caves de Roquefort after the Perrier takeover saga, and Bongrain, its chief competitor. These companies have been steadily increasing their interests by buying up the smaller cheese makers that are finding it increasingly difficult to compete in the European market, now dominated by multinational groups, notably Nestle and the hypermarket groups. Besnier, which now makes annualised sales of FFr22bn (Dollars 4bn), disclosed this week that it has bought 8.1 per cent of Bel including 5 per cent of the voting stock. Bel is a publicly quoted company but controlled by the Fievet family. However Mr Robert Fievet, chairman, is 84. Rumours of his retirement have fuelled speculation about the future ownership of Bel.</p>

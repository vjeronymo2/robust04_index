			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will inform the  United States that it will accept in principle its draft  sanctions against North Korea to be presented to the U.N.  Security Council over the nuclear crisis, government officials  said.    "On the whole, (the proposed sanctions) are close to what  Japan thinks proper, so we will in principle accept them,"  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told reporters after attending an  emergency meeting of government leaders on the nuclear standoff.    The United States plans to propose a sanctions resolution to  the Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by  North Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) checks of its suspected nuclear arms development  program.    Japanese U.N. Ambassador Hisashi Owada will inform his U.S.  counterpart of Japan's acceptance of the draft early Thursday  [16 June], the officials said.    They declined to disclose, however, if the draft sanctions  would include an order to halt bank remittances of cash from  pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in Japan to North Korea. Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai only said the sanctions would  "not be easy" for North Korea.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata discussed the nuclear crisis  with  Kakizawa, Kumagai and senior foreign ministry officers in the  meeting at his official residence. In the meeting, Hata said  there are three principles on which Japan should act in dealing  with the sanctions, the officials said. These are imposing  sanctions step by step as a means of maintaining dialogue with  the North, keeping close contact with the U.S., South Korea and  other permanent Security Council members, and doing whatever is  possible within the framework of the Constitution.    Also present at the emergency talks were Vice Foreign  Minister Kunihiko Saito and the ministry's director-general of  the Foreign Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai. The Foreign Ministry  officials were quoted as saying there is a feeling even among  the 10 nonpermanent Security Council members that the nuclear  issue cannot be left as it is.    The Security Council consists of five permanent members --  Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- as well as the 10  nonpermanent members.</p>

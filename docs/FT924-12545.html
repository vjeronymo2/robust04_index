			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / French summer output stagnates FRANCE'S industrial output flattened out in July and August, making opposition parties nervous about the bleak economic legacy they might inherit if they win legislative elections next spring. Publishing figures for both July and August, Insee, the government statistics office, said industrial output stagnated over the two months. This overall figure masked falls in manufacturing production and construction of 1.2 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively, from their June levels, which were offset by a 4.7 per cent rise in energy output. This evidence that French industry, at best, marked time during the summer months casts serious doubt on Insee's earlier predictions of a 0.9 per cent increase in industrial output and a 0.6 per cent rise in gross domestic product in the third quarter. Over the weekend, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF, said one reason he thought opposition parties should be wary of forming a government, even if they win a parliamentary majority next March, is that they would find the situation too bad to be redressed before the next presidential election, due in 1995. The current opinion polls give the UDF and its electoral ally in the legislative elections, the neo-Gaullist RPR party, a 2:1 majority over the ruling Socialists. Mr Giscard d'Estaing said the two parties should be satisfied of three conditions before again agreeing to 'cohabit' in government with Mr Mitterrand as they did in 1986-88. These were that the economic situation should not be too serious, that a centre-right government should be assured of enough time to improve it, and that the president should at least be neutral and preferably should support any government economic policy.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Embarrassment for President-elect Clinton Next week's inaugural celebrations lost a party yesterday and left President-elect Bill Clinton somewhat embarrassed. A planned Sunday gala honouring Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary-designate, and Democrat party chairman for four years, was cancelled over controversy about corporate funding for the event. He has come under attack for his Washington lobbying business, including representing foreign companies, and for the severance terms he has arranged from his law firm. This probably does not threaten his nomination, but news of the gala, with a US subsidiary of Sony of Japan covering some costs, appeared to compound suspicions of conflicts of interest.</p>

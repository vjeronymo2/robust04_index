			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 3112) and Hsu </F> Tung-hai (1776 2639 3189): "Russian Prime Minister Will Discuss  Economic Relations, Trade, and Illegal Immigration During  Forthcoming Visit to Beijing; Jiang Zemin Will Visit Russia and  Meet With Yeltsin"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (LIEN HO PAO) -- The Chinese  mainland's military, diplomatic, and economic cooperative  relations with Russia have become closer and closer. Russian  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is soon to visit Beijing, and  mainland president Jiang Zemin will also visit Moscow and meet  with Russian President Yeltsin in the second half of this year.    It has been many years since any Soviet Union or Russian  prime minister visited the Chinese mainland. Both sides,  therefore, value this visit very much. It is learned that on  his forthcoming visit to Beijing, Chernomyrdin will mainly  discuss with the Chinese mainland economic and trade issues as  well as the problem of illegal immigration.    Last year, trade volume between the Chinese mainland and  Russia reached a record high of $7 billion. At the moment, the  Chinese mainland is Russia's second biggest trade partner, after  Germany. But there are so many trade obstacles between the two  sides that demand immediate removal. The most serious problems  are to do with settlement of exchange and transportation.    Though the Chinese mainland declared last year that it  acknowledges free exchange between the ruble and the renminbi,  the two sides have not yet worked out a specific way to conduct  settlement through banks. Businessmen from the two sides often  have to carry sacks of banknotes with them to make purchases in  the other country. Besides, despite the dramatic expansion of  Sino-Russian border trade, inadequate transportation capacity in  border areas has brought great difficulty to the cross-border  barter trade.    In recent years, large numbers of Chinese mainland residents  have illegally settled in Russia. According to one estimate,  there are at least 100,000 Chinese people in greater Moscow. A  Russian official survey indicates that the population of illegal  immigrants from the Chinese mainland in Moscow proper is 50,000.  As a Russian diplomat put it, one can hear Chinese spoken any  time at underground railway stations and on sidewalks. Illegal  immigration has brought many security problems to Russia,  causing a headache for the country. On his forthcoming visit to  Beijing, Chernomyrdin will discuss with Beijing authorities ways  to block illegal immigration.    Military cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Russia  has caused much concern among the international community.  Though it is still unknown whether or not it will be among the  topics of the prime minister's meetings, there is nevertheless  information indicating that Beijing is carrying on a number of  military technical cooperation projects with Russia, and  negotiations on weapon purchase are still underway.    Last year, on his visit to Moscow, Liu Huaqing, vice  chairman  of the CPC Central Military Commission, gave Russia a long  shopping list of weapons, including Sukov-27K fighter planes,  missiles, tanks, and submarines. Negotiations on this  purchasing plan are still continuing. In addition, the two  sides are also continuing to implement plans for reciprocal  military personnel training and technical transfers.    A high-level Russian diplomat put it straightforwardly that  military cooperation is an important part of Russia's relations  with the Chinese mainland, which is conducive to the Russian  economy. He said: Russia's defense industry is facing enormous  difficulties. To find a way out, the defense industry must try  to open up the international market.    This official pointed out: Standardization was lacking in  the past when Russia sold weapons to the Chinese mainland, and  ordnance companies could export weapons on their own. But now  the Russian Government has set up a "Weaponry and Equipment  Corporation," through which the center could keep centralized  control on the export of weapons. He said: Russia's arms sale  policy toward the Chinese mainland is no different than that  toward any other country, as regional balance will be taken into  consideration and Beijing will not be privileged. Commenting on  the rumor that Russia may export aircraft carriers to the  mainland, this official said: "It does not have much ground."    It is learned that though Russia badly needs to make money  by  exporting weapons, it is unlikely that it will export to the  Chinese mainland such weapons as aircraft carriers that may pose  a threat to Russia itself.</p>

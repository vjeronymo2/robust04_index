			<p>CSO     [Text] For the first time in the history of the Ministry of  Defense, a Defense Council that will play the role of adviser to  the defense minister is planned. The council will be constituted  by both active and retired military officers, diplomats, experts  in international affairs, and university professors. The  establishment of the Defense Council is envisioned in a bill  that will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval.  According to information our newspaper has received, the  council's exclusive responsibility will be planning the  ministry's strategy, not only in times of crisis, but also under  normal circumstances. The council will also elaborate proposals  on weapons issues.    Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is seeking the  agreement of all political parties. To this end, he will soon  invite to the ministry the various party representatives, who  will present their views on the council's field of competence  and the choice of council members. The same bill, which aims at  giving a more civilian configuration to the ministry of defense,  creates the position of secretary general, which will be  occupied by a civilian.    If the bill is approved by the Chamber of Deputies under its  present form, it will be the second time that a secretariat  general is established at the Ministry of Defense. The first  time was in 1985, but the position did not function properly  because the responsibilities of the secretary general were  constantly clashing with those of the chief of the general  staff. Finally, the bill envisions the upgrading of the role of  the chief of the general staff, who would henceforth play the  role of a "field marshal," since his responsibilities would  include the coordination of the three branches of the service in  wartime as well as in peacetime.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE PREVAILS  </P> <P> As you rightly state in "Justice Prevails," by Philip Hager (Aug. 13), the  removal of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, Justice Joseph R. Grodin and  Justice Cruz Reynoso from the state Supreme Court in 1986 was caused by a  well-financed campaign led by Gov. Deukmejian and supported by reactionaries  throughout California.  </P> <P> Almost three years have gone by since that election, and the state Supreme  Court with its conservative majority has not allowed one execution. We have  lost three outstanding justices because the people of this state were duped by  falsehoods and distortions. Executions were not the issue for the governor and  his followers. The three jurists just were too liberal.  </P> <P> HENRY L. PALMER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

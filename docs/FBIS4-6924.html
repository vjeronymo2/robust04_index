			<p>BFN     [Text] Due to the pluralism in the political world,  including the emergence of many political parties, businessmen  think that politicians should not interfere with the personnel  matters of bureaucratic organizations, though they do expect  bureaucrats to play more important roles than before. This was  revealed by a poll Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] conducted on 22 April. It seems businessmen hold  severe views about politicians.    The poll was conducted from approximately 1,500 executives  and managers from firms belonging to Keidanren; 37.2 percent of  them responded.    When asked "if bureaucrats will have more chances to display  their abilities" because of the collapse of the long-lasting  Liberal Democratic Party administration and other factors, 55.4  percent of the respondents answered "yes."    As a reason for answering "yes," a managing director of a  major supermarket said: "There are not many lawmakers who can  claim the title of good politician; bureaucrats are more  competent than politicians." A department chief of an  information industry said: "It is easy for bureaucrats to take  the leadership when there is confusion in political circles."  This view was shared by many respondents.    A question was asked "if politics should be given an  advantage over bureaucratic organizations in personnel matters"  to prevent bureaucrats from having their own way. Only 27.2  percent of the respondents agreed. According to an executive of  a medical company, as a reason for opposing political  intervention in the personnel affairs of bureaucratic  organizations, some of the respondents said "it is a problem  because ministers are replaced every several months, and it is  questionable if politicians have adequate knowledge of or study  enough about what they are required to know."    Moreover, as areas where they expect the bureaucrats to  fulfill their roles in the future, many of the respondents  enumerated such areas as disaster prevention, protection of the  global environment, and national security. Areas such as  overall agricultural policy, monetary exchange control, and  promotion of regional economic buildup were mentioned by only a  few respondents.</p>

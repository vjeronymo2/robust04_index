			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Taiwan expects 6% growth rate Taiwan's annual economic growth is expected to slow to an average 6 per cent in the five years up to 1997 as the island's export-led boom cools down, according to the government's Bureau of Statistics, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'Slower growth will be mainly due to curbs on government spending, which is expected to show zero growth in real terms, compared with an average 8.9 per cent in the previous five years,' a bureau official said yesterday. Gross national product expanded at an annual rate of 10 per cent in 1983-87 and 6.7 per cent in 1988-92. Between 1952 and 1990 it grew at an average of nearly 9 per cent.</p>

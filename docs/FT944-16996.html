			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Financial market opinion influenced interest rate rise: Bank was more concerned on inflation than Clarke The attitude of financial markets played an important role in the decision to raise base rates last month, according to the minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. Base rates were increased from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent five days after the meeting. In the minutes, the chancellor noted that financial markets were expecting interest rates to be raised sooner rather than later. If those expectations were not realised, the markets could become more volatile and the eventual rise in rates might need to be larger. An increase in interest rates now would be an act of prudent economic management. Mr Clarke added that moving then would keep the authorities in control, rather than being driven by financial markets. The chancellor also recognised that delaying would run a risk of an adverse market reaction. Mr George, who proposed the increase in rates, also cited the financial markets as an important factor. There were arguments for waiting a little longer but the dangers - including the financial market dangers given present international uncertainties - increased the greater the delay. The governor warned the chancellor that if the decision were delayed, they might need to return to the issue before the next monthly meeting. After a two-day pause Mr Clarke agreed to the rise. The minutes show that the governor was more enthusiastic about a rate rise than the chancellor. Mr George based his case on data, such as second-quarter gross domestic product growth, which showed that the economy had been growing faster than previously appeared and above its trend rate. The governor also pointed to concerns about inflation which, he said, stemmed from business surveys and anecdotal evidence. He concluded that the risks to the inflation objective further ahead had increased since the last meeting. Mr Clarke agreed that growth was strong but cited 11 separate reasons why the inflationary indicators were not causing concern. The chancellor said the UK was not on the verge of a take-off in inflation. Nevertheless he added that the authorities had a duty to raise interest rates when necessary to prevent inflation accelerating. Although Labour was careful not to attack the decision to raise rates at the time, sources close to Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday criticised the decision-making process, and the emphasis placed on the financial markets. An aide said: 'Kenneth Clarke has become a chancellor who at best dithers about important decisions and at worst lacks confidence in the government's economic strategy.'</p>

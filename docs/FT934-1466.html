			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Expiry of the December contract on the FT-SE 100 futures drove the underlying cash market forward as dealers fought to close out their positions by the 10.30am deadline, writes Peter John. Position-taking saw the cash index soar nearly 40 points by the time the contract started to expire at 10.10 am. The contract itself was very volatile, see-sawing between a discount of three points to the cash and a premium of six points. There was an attempt to force cash and the futures up to a meeting point of 3,350 but during the 20 minutes in which an average expiry price is calculated the underlying market was forced back down by 10 points and final expiry was set at 3,345. Many dealers had to use the cash market to square their books because of the very high premium of the March contract. By the close of official dealing March was at 3,355 with some 18,700 lots traded. Traded options turnover was high at 53,187 lots.</p>

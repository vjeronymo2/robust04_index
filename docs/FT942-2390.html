			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Performance pay backed Almost half the average pay increase is linked to how well staff perform at work, says a survey of more than 1,000 managers by the Industrial Society, the advisory and training organisation. The survey acknowledged that performance-related pay has had a relatively bad public image recently, attributing this to suspicion that companies used it to cut pay bills rather than as an integrated part of company strategy. A report about to be published by Superboss, a consultancy in Windsor, will claim that PRP is rarely effective. The Industrial Society survey also covered the more general area of 'performance management' where appraisal may not necessarily be linked to pay. Half the organisations surveyed linked the results of appraisal to individuals' pay. A majority of managers favoured a link between pay and the outcome of appraisal, but a majority also lacked confidence that their organisation had got this link right so far. The financial sector appeared to have embraced PRP most enthusiastically. Overall 43 per cent of the average pay increase was linked to individual performance but in finance this rose to 61 per cent. In the public sector the share was 26 per cent. Rises were 100 per cent determined by performance in fewer than one in five organisations nationwide but in almost one in three financial sector companies. Managing Best Practice No 2.

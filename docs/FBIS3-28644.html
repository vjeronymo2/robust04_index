			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean  Information Minister O In-hwan says that the second phase of  President Kim Yong-sam's reforms calls for a resolute drive to  internationalize Korea. After the first reform phase, which was  aimed at rationalizing and normalizing the political, social and  economic sectors, O said South Korea must boost its competitive  strength through internationalization.    Speaking at a meeting of heads of South Korean overseas  information services in the United States, O said, "We have to  awaken the potential capacity and possibility of every field and  deploy all our energy so that we can mount a challenge on the  world stage."    "Heightening the image of our country by letting the world  know about the dynamic reforms of our civilian government and  cultural tradition is the way to raise the status of the country  and strengthen competitiveness," he said.    In order to achieve this goal, O said the government plans  to  build up a joint official and private promotion system, partly  by channeling publicity functions that are scattered among  various ministries.    The heads of the overseas information services heard reports  on internationalization and the country's competitiveness, and  exchanged views at the meeting.    Prior to coming to Washington, O presided over similar  meetings in Tokyo and Paris. He is scheduled to return home via  New York on Sunday.</p>

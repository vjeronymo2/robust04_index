These statutory provisions are codified at 10 U.S.C. 1079 (a) (2), (8), and (13). This final rule consolidates the comments and the changes based on comments of three proposed rule amendments to implement sections 701 and 702 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510), and to revise requirements for coverage and reimbursement of services of physicians in teaching settings. The publication of the final rule amendments was delayed as a result of the Presidential moratorium on regulation changes. This final rule completes the action required to amend this part as outlined in the three previously published proposed rules. The proposed rules provided specific coverage requirements, screening frequencies, payment limitations and provider certification requirements, for mammography and PAP tests, removed the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and family therapists and required all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full. Additionally, in FR Doc. 91&hyph;28934, appearing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 10, 1991 (56 FR 64491), the Office of Secretary of Defense also published for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the comprehensive CHAMPUS regulation, DoD 6010.8&hyph;R, pertaining to basic CHAMPUS benefits to better define the specific requirements for coverage and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians and physicians in training. We refer the reader to the proposed rules for a more detailed explanation of this change. We provided a 30-day comment period on each of the proposed amendments to the CHAMPUS regulation. The following summarizes the comments received following publication of each proposed rule amendment, and the actions taken based on these comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments for <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Screening Mammographies and PAP Smears <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received two (2) public comments and one (1) comment from the government agencies which by law we are required to consult with during the rulemaking process in response to the proposed rule regarding CHAMPUS coverage for screening mammography and papanicolaou (PAP) tests related to the proposed screening frequencies for mammography and PAP testing. A summary of the comments and our responses to them are listed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The coverage limitations for screening mammography set out in section II of the proposed rule are virtually identical to the Medicare requirement. However, we wish to point out that the American College of Radiology and other groups including the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, American Medical Association, and other physician organizations recommend that women 65 years of age or older have mammograms on an annual basis. We recommend adopting the position of national professional organizations over Medicare current coverage policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have found your argument persuasive and have amended the language in the Final Rule to follow the expert opinion and recommendation of national professional organizations. The amended language will allow annual screening for women 65 years of age or older. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department of Defense has proposed adopting current Medicare regulations for use in the CHAMPUS program. Under these regulations, screening mammography would be allowed only once every two years for ``asymptomatic women over the age of 65.'' Mammography is the only screening device currently available that detects breast cancers before they become palpable. Diagnosed in the early stages, breast cancer is more amenable to less invasive medical therapies. This translates into money saved as a result of fewer and shorter hospitalizations, less radical and more inexpensive treatments, and a lower recurrence rate. This organization believes that all women over the age of 50 should undergo annual screening mammography and clinical breast examination as part of their overall preventive health-care plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

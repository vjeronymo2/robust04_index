			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Japanese commercial land prices still falling JAPANESE commercial land prices fell an average 11.4 per cent last year, the first time there have been two consecutive years of decline, the National Land Agency said yesterday. The continuing fall reflects the pressure on Japanese banks, much of whose bad loan burden arises from lending to property developers or their acceptance of over-priced property as collateral. Commercial property values slipped by as much as 24.2 per cent in the area around Osaka, Japan's second largest city, where prices surged above those of Tokyo in the late 1980s during the so-called 'bubble era'. Residential prices fell by an average 8.7 per cent nationally, with the largest fall of 22.9 per cent also in the Osaka area, where speculative building of apartments peaked just after the asset price collapse began in early 1990. The agency said the fall in prices appears to be continuing, although in some residential areas of Tokyo buyers have re-emerged in recent months, believing that prices are near their bottom. Commercial prices are particularly weak, as developers have continued with projects in the hope that the market would improve, creating an ever larger glut of office space in areas of Tokyo and Osaka. Japanese banks are hoping that the property market will be stimulated by the work of their Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), which was established in January and yesterday began buying banks' non-performing loans and assessing property collateral. In coming days, CCPC is expected to release a list of deals done and assessed property values, which the banking industry would like to use as a floor for still falling prices. However, it is expected that the company will be reluctant to assess properties too harshly for fear of prompting further price falls.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Japan renews attack on US over yen rise THE Japanese government yesterday renewed its criticisms of US policy on trade and exchange rates as the yen rose to a record high of Y107 to the dollar in Tokyo. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, criticised the US for linking its aim to reduce the US trade deficit with an appreciation of the yen. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade and industry minister, warned the US that yen's rise threatened to choke Japanese growth. Their comments indicate the difficulties Japan has faced in co-ordinating international moves to stem the yen's advance. The renewed friction over the rise also casts doubts on the substance of the communique issued after an April meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised countries which called for exchange rate stability. The Japanese authorities are keen to deflect criticism from exporters hit by the yen's rise by blaming the Clinton administration for talking up the yen. The US dollar has lost about 3 per cent of its value against the yen in the last week in the wake of a US treasury department report which suggested a yen appreciation might reduce the Japanese trade surplus. The government has been powerless to stem the yen's rise from about Y125 at the turn of the year despite repeated interventions by the Bank of Japan. It is thought the Bank of Japan has bought more than Dollars 10bn in the foreign exchange market since April in an attempt to cap the yen. Japan's foreign reserves increased by Dollars 2.53bn in May from the month before to Dollars 79.46bn, according to finance ministry figures published yesterday. The economic planning agency warned that the yen's rise might stall the timid economic recovery expected in the late autumn on the basis of the official index of leading indicators. The March index stood at 79.2 per cent, the third consecutive month in which it has been above 50 per cent. Readings above 50 per cent are taken as a leading indicator of growth between three and six months ahead. EPA officials warned the recent rise in the index might be because of a temporary surge in business activity before the end of the 1992 financial year. Automobile sales in May were 12.9 per cent down on the same month last year. It was the second consecutive fall after a 1.7 per cent rise in sales in March had promoted optimism that a sales recovery was starting.</p>

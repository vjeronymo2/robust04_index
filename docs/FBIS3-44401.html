The paper quoted head of the government administration  Vladimir Kvsov as saying that the first to move to the building  were the Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and all of his deputies.    Chernomyrdin has taken over the office of former Parliament  Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was arrested for organizing a  violent confrontation with the government of President Boris  Yeltsin in October last year.    Kvasov added that the office of former Vice President  Aleksandr Rutskoy, also arrested after the confrontation, was  occupied by an ordinary government department.    The third floor of the "White House" is ready for Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and his staff, Kvasov said, explaining  that this is necessary "for a closer contact of the president  with the government."    However, the main office of the president and his  administration remain in the Kremlin, Kvasov noted.    He said that the government staff will be reduced by 20  percent. "today it can be definitely stated that those  departments will be abolished which are outdated in the present  economic conditions," he pointed out without elaborating.    The "White House" was initially built as the headquarters of  the government of Russia when it was a Soviet republic. The  building became the headquarters of Yeltsin during the "August  19" event in 1991.    After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian  government moved to the premises of the former central committee  of the Soviet Communist Party in Staraya Square in Moscow, while  the parliament remained in the "White House."    On October 4, 1993, Yeltsin ordered tanks to pound the  "White  House" to suppress the headquarters of the armed opposition  headed by Rutskoy and Khasbulatov.    Soon after the event Yeltsin ordered the government to move  to the building and provided two other buildings for the new  legislature elected on December 12.    For the time being the newly-elected parliament is to work  in  the former COMECON (or the Council of Mutual Economic  Assistance) buiding and in the house of the Russian press.    However, a special building will be constructed for the new  legislature, Kvasov said.</p>

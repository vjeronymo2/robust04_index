			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (8): Phone-based industries buck trend - Emergence of a new breed of skilled office workers A NEW type of skilled office worker is emerging in Leeds. She or, not infrequently, he, is familiar with computers and how databases work, finds keyboard work easy, has a good telephone manner and an ability to relate quickly to customers on the phone, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. Most of these office workers are young and adaptable, with women in the majority, though plenty of men are also to be found in the offices concerned. They are not so much selling as servicing. Jobs created are already in the thousands, so a large pool of experienced labour with transferable skills is growing. The companies involved all run telephone-based service operations and three in particular - First Direct, National Breakdown and Club 24 - stand out for bucking the UK's recession in the last two years. But why in Leeds? Mr Kevin Newman, head of First Direct, the 24-hour, direct access telephone banking subsidiary of Midland Bank, says there was a very good reason for setting up the UK's first such operation in Leeds - the way that local people talk. A study of dialect showed that the Leeds accent offends no one. It is not strong 'Yorkshire' and sounds neither northern nor southern, nor Midlands, nor Scottish. This is an important marketing consideration if Scots are likely to be put off by Cockneys or everyone may possibly be discomfited by Brummies or Scousers. 'We also needed a large conurbation with a large labour force, where people were familiar with the financial services sector,' Mr Newman adds. 'The other factor was an immediately available single-storey building of 50,000 sq ft. Leeds had one.' First Direct's decision seems to have been vindicated by sheer speed of growth. That the company hit the right spot in the market is shown by 360,000 people opening accounts in the first three years. Customers are able to do all of their banking transactions by phone, at any time. New accounts are rolling in at a rate of 10,000 a month, but the Leeds labour market seems easily to have met the recruitment demands this has created. Jobs have gone from zero to more than 1,000 now, and Mr Newman expects to take on another 300 people this year. The company soon outgrew its 50,000 sq ft and took on 20,000 sq ft more. More expansion is envisaged. Very similar skills are needed by workers at National Breakdown, the Leeds-based vehicle recovery and roadside servicing business. Its chairman is Mr Ernest Smith, an indefatigable 46-year-old who has been putting competitive pressure on the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club for the past 20 years. Unlike the AA and RAC, National Breakdown does not employ its own patrolling repair and vehicle recovery staff. Instead, it uses a 1,500-strong network of independent garages throughout the UK. It relies on computerised databases and the telephone to operate. The company has been extraordinarily successful: sales were Pounds 12,500 in 1973, but are Pounds 70m now; it employs 550 in Leeds, and won the race against the AA and RAC to achieve the BS5750 quality assurance standard. There is a perpetual waiting list of would-be agents, so none can afford complacency . National Car Parks bought out Mr Smith's two partners in 1984 but he remains at the helm as a minority shareholder. He has just brought in Mr Tim Ward from Visa - another business relying on telephones and computers - as managing director. Mr Ward will run the UK business while Mr Smith concentrates on Europe, where he is building a similar network of agent garages, running the operation from Strasbourg. In Leeds, National Breakdown now handles a third of British Telecom's telephone paging calls. This uses the same type of office skills as those needed by National Breakdown and First Direct. This use of National Breakdown's skills to process other companies' business is known as 'outsourcing' - and nowhere is there a better example of it as a growth industry than at Club 24, near Leeds city centre. Club 24 started more than 20 years ago managing customers' budget accounts in-house for Hepworth and Burtons, the mid-range men's tailors. By the mid-1970s, it had developed into a financial services business and was incorporated as Club 24 in a joint venture with Forward Trust. The name came from the formula for calculating credit limits - 24 times the monthly sum any customer was prepared to pay. In 1985, Hepworth took full control and three years later - when Hepworth had become Next - Club 24 had expanded, operating in-store credit for several high street store chains and handling 2.3m accounts. The business ran into trouble as recession bit because of the exposure involved in Next carrying Club 24's debt on its balance sheet. To survive, Club 24 has dropped out of financial services but has turned itself into an outsourcing bureau - managing credit or any other type of high-volume, telephone-based operation for other companies, but not carrying the risk of any debt involved on its own books. Thus, Cellnet uses Club 24 as sole supplier of support administration systems for its drive into consumer mobile telephone markets; Kingfisher to manage its credit business; and the Co-operative Bank to process the fixed term loans it sells through retail outlets. New business includes one-third of British Telecom's radio paging and credit management for Yorkshire Electricity. Debt collection - for other people - is also a growing business. The effect on jobs has been dramatic. When Next was in trouble and Club 24 with it, more than 200 jobs were shed and another 300 were threatened. There are more than 600 jobs now and numbers are growing. All three companies have therefore enabled the Leeds labour market to make a telling point about its capacity for training and flexibility with modern technology. Jobs have gone for ever in the now-empty warehouses where Hepworth suits were made up but, in less than a generation, a substantial part of the labour market has adjusted to a different type of demand. The social and economic processes involved could well repay serious study with lessons for elsewhere.</p>

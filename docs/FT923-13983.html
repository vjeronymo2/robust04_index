			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television Soap fans need to be on sucrose tablets and benzedrine inhalers on Fridays: 5.10 Home And Away on ITV, 5.35 Neighbours on BBC1, 7.00 Eldorado on BBC1, 7.30 Coronation Street on ITV, 8.00 Brookside on C4. And only a short time ago the more intelligent foreign tourists were marvelling at the sort of material you could find on peak time television in Britain. Look at the schedule on C4, the 'minority' channel, the 'be-different' channel. From 6.00 the list goes: American comedy, sport, news, five minutes of opinion, soap, game show, sport, American comedy, British comedy, satire, old American movie, old American sci-fi TV. That last offering, The Twilight Zone, is one of the three programmes I want to watch, and luckily it is at 1.10 in the morning. The other two clash. I shall watch the Athletics from Crystal Palace (8.00 ITV) in the hope of seeing Steve Backley regain his world javelin record so impressively smashed by Zelezny last week, and tape The Crescent And The Star (8.00 BBC2), an engrossing series about the rapid re-establishment of Islam as the dominant social code of central Asia, now that communism has collapsed.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Construction shaken by Taylor Woodrow SHARE PRICES of construction companies dived yesterday after Taylor Woodrow, one of the biggest companies in the sector, warned that dividends would be reduced considerably this year due to lower-than-expected profits. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, speaking at the group's annual meeting, said that there was no sign of the deep recession ending in the UK housing and commercial property market. He warned that cashflow remained under pressure. Borrowings as a result were likely to increase during the rest of this year. In an attempt to generate cash the company was planning to sell Greenham Construction Materials, a small aggregates business. It would also be looking to make further reductions in staff as well as cutting other overheads. Taylor Woodrow's shares fell 10p to 94p following the warning. The price compares with an issue price of 200p in April last year when the company raised Pounds 162.4m in a rights issue. It was the second time this week that a chairman of a large construction group had issued a profits warning. On Tuesday Sir Eric Pountain, chairman of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder and a large building materials group, warned the group could have made a loss in the first half of this year. Tarmac's share price yesterday fell 5p to 115p as other construction stocks took fright from Taylor Woodrow's warning. Costain fell 5p to 52p while of John Mowlem was down 9p to 120p. Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst at SG Warburg who attended yesterday's annual meeting, said: 'Trading conditions are even worse than we had thought. A number of contractors are likely to be under severe pressure to cut dividends this year. There is a strong possibility that company share prices will fall even further. 'We had been forecasting Taylor Woodrow would make about Pounds 37m pre-tax profit this year. Clearly it is now going to be less than that,' he said, adding that forecasts were likely to be downgraded for other construction companies. At the time of the rights Taylor Woodrow said it needed the cash to take advantage of opportunities provided by the recession to acquire housing and commercial property assets at favourable prices. Since then its fortunes have slipped. The group last year made pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.7m after exceptional provisions of Pounds 46.5m to cover potential losses on construction contracts and write-downs of property assets. Three months ago Mr Parsons, previously head of Taylor Woodrow's Canadian operations replaced Mr Peter Drew as chairman. Mr Parsons told shareholders yesterday that one of his first tasks had been to 'carry out a number of changes at board level to clarify decision making process and provide a clear allocation of responsibility.'

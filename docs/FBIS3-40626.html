			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rajeshwari Prasad Singh: " Dunkel Proposal: A </F> Conspiracy to Impoverish the Nation"]    [Text] Forty-six years after independence, when a series of  events are taking place very rapidly around the world, India  appears to be directionless and stuck in a whirlpool of problems  trying to stay above water. India is standing there dumbfounded  by these problems such as increasing population; reemergence of  ethnic and caste-related prejudices in human relations; control  over government, communication, education, and economic  structure by one-fourth of the population; arrival of the  American dragons--the multi-national companies--to devour our  culture and national identity; the society stuck in the  quicksand of myopia caused by the lose of self-confidence while  battling the standards of consumerism; loss of selfhood because  of self-doubts, indecisiveness; and helplessness of major  leaders engrossed in power and divided among themselves.    The spineless people hiding behind their seats of power are  giving very weak reasons in support of the GATT proposals. Even  a scholarly member of the Parliament Manishanker Ayyer has gone  to extremes and supported the signing of this agreement. He  said, "Since India had signed the original GATT proposals in  1948, it should sign those now." Mr. Ayyer and such ineffectual  thinkers should see why France, European nations, Australia, and  Japan are so interested in forwarding their interests in pacts  signed in Brussels to Geneva. Many of these countries had sang  the songs of praise when GATT was born in 1948. What special  place did India get at the international platform? GATT is a  sacrificial alter and the Dunkel is the sword. Geneva is the  place where they sacrifice developing countries to satisfy the  U.S. thirst for riches and for other developed nations, and  Peter Southerland is Shiva. The only way to establish Ramrajya  [ideal government] is to stop Meghnath's yagna.    The various varieties of carnivorous plants representing the  U.S. ambitions born out of the rubble of communist regimes are  dazzling us and pulling at us. The U.S. President, the secretary  of state, and groups of senators and officials are roaming the  world. The U.S. hunger for power has used the rungs of APAC,  ASEAN, and NAFTA to reach the treasure of GATT. From among 116  countries only 20 or 22 countries are involved in the nominal  tug-of-war of vested interests against the United States. Mickey  Cantor, the U.S. representative, and Sir Leo Briton, who is  representing the 12 European nations, are moving the pawns of  their interests very carefully. The United States is forced to  make changes in the agreement for the European interests. Even a  country like Belgium is proudly announcing that it can boot the  American proposals and GATT out in the context of issues related  to television and films, because protecting culture is more  important than the business interests. The Cannes Trade Group, a  group of 14 nations under the leadership of Australia, can  create new problems. South Korea may be forced to open doors to  import rice, but the Japanese Prime Minister Hata is keeping  Geneva at bay from Tokyo.    Japan is in the process of taking a plebiscite over the GATT  proposals. Dr. Mahatir, prime minster of Malaysia, has boycotted  APAC and shown the courage to call it a vehicle to protect U.S.  interests. France has got its stand on giving subsidy to the  farmers approved, and still is arguing about the issues related  to film and airplane industries. Some African nations have  started to make noise about their products--coffee and  cocoa--becoming cheaper. President Clinton himself sat on the  negotiation table to show respect for China and with great  respect offered the gift of supercomputers to China. Only then  APAC could be formed. The central theme of the NAFTA is  exploiting cheap Mexican labor. The strategy to tie down India  with the same fate as Argentina, Brazil, Latin American  countries, and the Philippines has been very important.    India is an untapped market. The warmth of over 100,000  [rupees] per annum income earned by 200 million upper middle  class people is pushing us towards consumerism and luxuries. The  remaining 700 million people have no alternative but to carry  these 200 million wealthy people on their shoulders.    The Indian government has neither a vision nor the ability  to  unite and nor the life-giving source of popular support. We  should have our share in GATT based on our need to survive. The  fate of every citizen is tied to signing the GATT proposals.  Very fine points of the Trips (Trade Related intellectual rights  and biotechnology], Trims [trade related investment measures]),  questions over MFN [most favored nation], and patents laws  should have been discussed at the levels of universities and  vidhan sabhas [state aeemblies]. The government should have  received a mandate from the people and kept the nation's  philosophy in its mind. If the United States is stubbornly  trying to keep the restrictions on garment imports for 15 years  instead of for 10 years, then our government should kick that  stubbornness away. Make these Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola and Colgate  people scram from here.    The 900 million Indian people have tolerated a lot. The  multi-national companies are showing up here to exploit India's  cheap labor, ample energy sources, and abundant raw materials  and efforts are being made to bind India into the GATT trap. The  pitcher is fraught with the sins of conspiracies of foreigners,  particularly Americans such as the trick of not organizing the  G-7 nations meeting along with the G-15 nations meeting, Mallot,  Clinton, and Robin Raphael's tactics over Kashmir, interference  in the cryogenic engine deal, spewing poison over the humans  rights issue, improper pressure to sign the "shylock-type" NPT,  intrusion into the kitchens of the people to sell their  products, and first offering the tent of economic incentives and  then putting on a military umbrella to protect their interests.    Vodka and wine from Russia is obtained and sold here, and  the  Russian companies are minting money by sending food and even  pumpkins to Russia in exchange. Many foreign companies are  processing mushrooms and making sea food for export. Pepsi has  taken the lead in making profit by increasing the production of  tomatoes. A company called Coopen Ritgeld is making agreements  with farmers to grow cucumbers. The ITC has made an agreement  with Geneva about developing seeds. It is the major export  hordes, in whose laps these politicians born of the poor  peoples' votes prosper, who are in a hurry to have the GATT  agreement signed.    Where can an average man stand in this equation of political  leaders, stock brokers, black marketeers, corrupt officials,  intellectuals who are the slaves of multi-national companies,  the CIA, journalists, and experts? Unemployment and prices of  necessary items, illiteracy, and poverty are on the rise, and  the value of humans is decreasing. In this situation, stop and  think about what GATT will give you! What will it take back in  return? What is this open market? These are the efforts to steal  our literature, tradition, sciences, herbs, living organisms,  knowledge, and trying to loot us by making the patent laws. We  have been using the neem tree for thousands of years before  America was discovered. Now, in the name of patents and  intellectual properties, the neem in our backyard will become a  U.S. property. What worse form of slavery is there?</p>

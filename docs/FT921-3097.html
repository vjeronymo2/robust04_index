			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rural growth helps lift Hindustan Lever HINDUSTAN Lever, India's largest foreign-owned group, has reported sharply increased profit and turnover for 1990-1991 despite political upheaval and the slowdown in economic growth during the year. Hindustan Lever, a subsidiary of Unilever with interests in soap, detergents, toilet goods and chemicals, said gross sales had grown 22 per cent to Rs17.7bn (Dollars 648.6m), with pre-tax profits rising 24 per cent to Rs1.3bn. The company said profit growth had come from core products, including soaps, detergents and toilet products. All had benefited from the introduction of new brand names. Strong growth in rural demand thanks to good monsoons and the rise in rural incomes has also proved a boon for the group. In some products, rural demand now accounts for a half of sales. Hindustan Lever's performance was above market expectations in a year that included the assassination or Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, and probably negative industrial growth. However, the trend among other companies to have reported 1990-91 earnings is also better than expected. According to the Economic Times research bureau, the first 64 companies to report showed a 22 per cent rise in sales and a 25 per cent increase in profits before tax and depreciation charges. Hindustan Lever says its higher profits included financial savings, reflecting its low debt burden. But the deep indebtedness of most companies was reflected in a 65 per cent increase in interest charges among the first 64 companies to report.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Small and medium-sized companies should not invest  in Burma at the moment, but a large company unhampered by  financial and other constraints could go in to enlarge its  regional presence, say British Chamber of Commerce members who  visited the country recently.    Deciding whether to invest in Burma "depends on who you are  and what you want to do," said Ken Key, resident director of  Chillington Tool Co Ltd.    The attitude of the delegation, as noted at a Chamber  meeting  yesterday, seems to have shifted from dismissing Burma as a  basket case to looking on it as a venue for good long-term  investment with the payoff depending on the political outcome.    "We would like to have our foot in the door," said Sandy  Flockhart, country manager for Thailand of the Hong Kong and  Shanghai Banking Corp, which has applied for a licence to set up  a representative office there.    Opinion was almost unanimous that the "way to deal with  oppressive regimes is not by head-on confrontation with them but  by communication, probably through free trade," said Adrian  Topham, managing director of Thai British Security Printing  Limited.    Countries such as Singapore seem to have adopted this  principle. Six Singaporean banks have gone into Burma, and 17  hotel projects involving Singaporean investment are coming up.    Singapore is a large source of foreign direct investment in  the country and is set to outpace Thailand which is now the  largest investor in Burma. The figure for Chinese investment is  small but business with that country is large, most of it going  unrecorded.    "There is a market for basic products. Most of this is now  available through the black market or obtained through barter  trade," said Mr Key.    The military government has monopolies in timber and gems.  It also controls telecommunications, mining and logging.    "However, it is possible to get into joint ventures with  state entities or with Burmese citizens," said Mr Key.    Products have to be chosen with care. A problem arises in  the case of manufacturing units that base their production on  imported raw material.    "It is a Catch-22 situation -- there is a need for hard  currency to import raw material but there has to be some export  first to fund these purchases," explained Mr Key.    Investment in power-intensive industries is also best  avoided. There are some attractive features -- the low entry  cost and the low wage rate, unofficially US$8 per month.    But investors have to deal with a two-tier exchange rate:  officially there are six kyat to the US dollar but the  unofficial rate is 20 times that.    Until the dual-rate system is scrapped, Burma will not get  assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World  Bank. The prevailing junta does not want to do this and lose  face.    "Banking is basic," said Mr Flockhart. "In terms of trade,  letters of credit are difficult to get, the smaller private  banks cannot deal in foreign currency."    Lack of reliable data on the country also makes it difficult  to make commercial decisions. The regime's figures often are  exaggerated.    Peter Snell, managing director of Asia Market Intelligence,  who derived his own statistics relating to Burma based on  available information, put the growth rate at 1.2 percent and  not the 5.9 percent the government claims. Inflation, 31.8  percent in 1993, is expected to increase to 45 percent in 1994.</p>

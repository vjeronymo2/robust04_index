			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The true price of going Dutch - Investing in . . . the Netherlands INVEST in the Netherlands and you expose yourself to the US economy. In spite of its small size in both area and population, the Dutch tradition as a trading nation means that it still exerts a disproportionate influence on the world stage. As the graph below shows, this also makes it by far the most sensitive European market to the movements of the American market and economy. Richard Harding, European fund manager with Henderson, says: 'There are those who argue that Holland is the last state of the USA.' This goes a long way to explaining its continuing popularity with British fund managers, particularly of European funds - for example Henderson has a 12 per cent weighting compared to a benchmark index rating of 10 per cent. It has a very liquid market compared to some continental European rivals, and is regarded by some as 'just like trading in London'. The Dutch trading spirit has also ensured the growth of several massive companies with a worldwide influence which is again disproportionate to the size of their home country - for example Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world's biggest oil companies, Unilever, the consumer products conglomerate, and Philips electronics. These three alone represent almost 40 per cent of the main Netherlands index, but there is a clutch of slightly smaller companies which are still worldwide household names, and which trade in heavy volumes popular with investors - for instance KLM, Heineken, Fokker, Daf and Elsevier. Harding adds that Dutch accounting policies allow for the most transparent figures available in continental Europe. The awesome linguistic ability of many Dutch people further eases the job of investing for foreigners. However, the Netherlands is still at the heart of the move towards European union, and like other economies on the continent it is sensitive to events in Germany. According to Paul Loos, a fund manager with the Amsterdam-based company Kooijman Capital Markets, which manages a Benelux fund for Clerical Medical International among others, more than 25 per cent of Dutch exports are to Germany. The Dutch guilder is tied tightly to the D-mark via the exchange rate mechanism which, in turn, ensures that short-term interest rates are high. This has not been good for the economy. However, Kooijman detects signs of a tentative recovery. Industrial production rose a seasonally corrected 3 per cent in April, following a meagre 0.6 per cent rise for the first three months. It also notes that consumer optimism has increased considerably since the end of last year, according to official figures. Kooijman has also cut its predictions for unemployment which it now expects to remain stable this year at 320,000, compared with a previous estimate of 350,000. Opinions vary on the best sectors to invest in at present. Loos is concentrating on the oil business and food, both of which are viewed as defensive sectors. He, like Harding is also keen to buy American exposure, as he sees room for recovery in the US, and this means Elsevier, a publishing group based in Holland which does most of its business elsewhere in the world. Harding sees opportunities to profit from falling interest rates via a holding in ABN Amro. This is a big bank formed by a merger, and its stock market valuation still seems to reflect adverse sentiment at the time of the deal. It is trading on a 6.8 per cent yield, and a p/e ratio of 7.5. At these levels, Harding believes it is a cheap way to buy into the likely resurgence when interest rates come down. Kooijman is interested in life insurers such as Aegon. The Netherlands is also the dominant market within Benelux, which is often treated as a homogenous economic area. Belgium falls much more under the influence of Germany, according to Loos, and lacks the vast companies which make Holland so attractive. It is also not as liquid. However, it does have cyclical stocks which would be helped by a German recovery, and most methods of buying into the Netherlands allow ease of access to Belgium. It is as well not to get too excited about the Netherlands - exposure to the US may not be wholly welcome at present, and there is also room for doubt about whether Germany has yet reached the bottom. But few European markets offer such ease or simplicity to investors, and no others of equivalent size present such an array of strong international companies.  --------------------------------------------------------- FACTFILE: THE NETHERLANDS  --------------------------------------------------------- Population:                                       15.0m Gross Domestic product:                  Pounds 162.3bn Market capitalisation:                    Pounds 90.4bn Inflation rate:                           4.22 per cent Three-month Interbank Rate:               9.49 per cent Currency and Exchange Rate:  Pounds 1 = 3.2525 guilders  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

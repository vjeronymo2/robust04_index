			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Beidh named to lead new Yemeni state South Yemen's political leaders continued to defy northern ruler General Ali Abdullah Saleh by announcing the formation of a new five-man presidential council yesterday. The council proceeded to elect the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, president of the new state. Drawing on a broad spectrum of political persuasions, the new council is an obvious attempt to consolidate southern efforts at separating from the north and at establishing an autonomous state. Gen Saleh, reversing promises not to bomb the south, has meanwhile resumed missile attacks on Aden, stronghold of the southern forces, vowing to capture it at any cost. The planning minister, Mr Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, told Reuters that with the secession 'the continuation of the war has become inevitable.' The north said its troops yesterday captured the southeastern Shabwa province and its regional capital Ataq, including its airfield. With members selected from five of South Yemen's six provinces, the aim of the new presidential council is to achieve cohesion against northern efforts to prevent any separatist movements. But the new council also brings together old political rivals in a show of non-partisan support for the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the new state announced on Saturday by Mr al-Beidh. Apart from Mr al-Beidh, leader of the Yemen Socialist party, other members of the council include the deputy leader of the YSP, Mr Salem Saleh Mohammed, the head of the Sons of Yemen League, Mr Abdul Rahman Ali al-Jifri, the head of the Federation for the Liberation of South Yemen, Mr Abdul Kawi Makawi, and Mr Suleiman Nasser Masoud, a member of the Ali Nasser Mohammed wing of the YSP. Western observers noted that members of the new council had all fought against the British occupation of Aden in the 1960s and that several had struggled against one another in the run-up to South Yemen's independence in 1967. The new council is therefore seen as an attempt to transcend long- standing political rivalries in the face of the more urgent threat to southern autonomy posed by Gen Saleh.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Superdrug may take scent battle to Brussels: MMC says 'complex monopoly' is not against the public interest SUPERDRUG, the UK discount drugstore chain, threatened yesterday to take its campaign to sell cut-price fragrances to Brussels, after UK competition authorities rejected the com-pany's complaint that perfume manufacturers were unfairly refusing to supply it. A Monopolies and Mergers Commission report said although a 'complex monopoly' existed among the perfume houses, it did not operate against the public interest. The report said only small changes were needed to ensure free competition in the UK market, worth Pounds 230m at wholesale prices last year. The report was welcomed by perfume manufacturers and some retailers, including Boots, the biggest outlet for perfumes in the UK. However, the decision was criticised by one perfume house, consumer organisations, Superdrug and other retailers. 'The MMC has swallowed the perfume companies' arguments hook, line and sinker,' the Consumers' Association said. Asda, the supermarket chain which also sells cut-price fragrances, expressed 'amazement and anger' and accused the commission of yielding to special pleading by perfume houses. Worth Fragrances, a small perfume manufacturer which recently agreed to supply Superdrug, said it was unhappy with the decision. It said consumers should not be made to pay inflated prices, which could only damage the perfume industry. Superdrug, part of the Kingfisher retail group, said the report failed to address its central objections to the perfume houses' marketing methods. The company said it was considering renewing its complaints with the European Commission, which has recently approved arrangements which allow perfume manufacturers to sell their products only through designated wholesalers and retailers. Although the MMC concluded that manufacturers had not used these arrangements to keep prices artificially high, Superdrug said stronger policing was needed to ensure that the rules were applied fairly. Superdrug sells a limited range of fragrances at discounts of about 30 per cent in 60 of its stores. Because leading manufacturers have refused to supply it directly, the company has been forced to buy all its products from unauthorised sources on the 'grey' market. It said yesterday that it would continue discount sales, but the MMC's decision meant it could not obtain enough supplies to sell perfumes at all its stores. The MMC report said the perfume industry was a 'complex monopoly' because all the leading manufacturers restricted supplies to authorised retailers and recommended resale prices. However, it found no evidence that these arrangements operated against the public interest. The MMC accepted manufacturers' arguments that the commercial success of perfumes depended on heavy marketing investments and high prices to create an aura of exclusivity and snob value. It suggested the perfume houses should establish an independent arbitration scheme to deal with complaints from retailers.

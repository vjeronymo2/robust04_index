			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Rattling the Keys -- "The good news in the Budget is that  there is little really bad news," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on 24-30 June  on  page 28. "This budget is designed to please the 'golden  triangle' of business, labour and the state." "In balancing the  need for social spending against the demand for fiscal  discipline" Keys has "set solid standards for the future." "If  there is nothing dramatically stimulatory in the Budget, there  is nothing particularly dampening either. By lowering the basic  corporation tax rate while doing nothing to alleviate the tax  burden of individuals" it "favors investment at the expense of  consumption." "Some more details on how Budget planning fits in  with the RDP [Research and Development Program] would have been  helpful, not only to hesitant foreign investors but to those who  are monitoring the programme to see if it will really deliver on  its promises."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   New Budget -- There is no doubt that the Budget will be  assessed on its "commitment to the priorities identified in the  Reconstruction and Development Programme" as the RDP is the  "flagship of the new government," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 24 June on page 8.  However, "it needs to be said from the outset that the budget  was disappointing in the extreme, in that it did not go far  enough in addressing the plight of the country's estimated  16-million poor citizens." VAT [value added tax] was not  mentioned, nor were basic foodstuffs "zero-rated," which means  "millions of unemployed" pay the "same VAT as the affluent  suburban elite." And the lower corporate taxation "should not  be allowed to benefit the corporate sector alone" and "we hope  that the government's decision to lower company taxation is  interpreted" as a "desire to see greater job creation in the  business sector." "We see no logic" in the decision to allocate  "at least 13 percent more to defense expenditure" as "we are  committed to moving into a reconciliation mode" when "spending  on safety and security has increased only 6.5 percent." And the  "deficiencies in the tax collection system" must be addressed  and overhauled with "urgency."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Budget To Test Keys' Credibility -- "The Budget has met with  widespread approval and a great deal of relief," begins the  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 June in a page-12  editorial. "But Finance Minister Derek Keys knows that the new  government is on trial. The real judgment on its performance  will come next March, when Keys tells Parliament how close he  came to fulfilling the expectations he raised." "Keys showed  with his first Budget that the intends to keep his promises. If  he can do the same with his second under far more difficult  circumstances, he will have laid the basis for the economic  transformation he seeks. It will not be easy. Keys has a  roomful of Cabinet colleagues all itching to spend more than  they have been allocated." In conclusion the BUSINESS DAY  writes that "Keys has exceptional credibility for a politician,  but he is about to be tested. If the new government is to be  believed in the years ahead, by the businessmen and investors on  whom depend the growth, jobs and tax revenues essential for  prosperity and peace, he must ensure the whole Cabinet keeps his  promises."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Budget Balances Needs of Haves/Have-nots -- "Finance  Minister  Mr Derek Keys had to satisfy three major constituencies in his  Budget and he has done just that," begins the Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 24 June in a page-12 editorial. "Keys has  carefully balanced the needs of the have-nots, of investors and  the fears of many white South Africans." The money set aside  for the Reconstruction and Development Program's "special  projects" "does not seem to be much. But the truth is the  Government has paid some attention to the needs of the underdog.  The test the Government must face now is how efficiently it can  deliver the promises of the RDP to the people who put them in  power."</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TWO BIG WINS GIVE JETS CONFIDENCE  </P> <P> The Winnipeg Jets enter the new year with a lot of confidence after victories  over two of their Smythe Division rivals.  </P> <P> Doug Smail scored the winning goal at 9:32 of the third period Sunday at  Winnipeg as the Jets followed an 2-1 overtime victory over the Calgary Flames  two nights earlier with a 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P> "It was a big win for us in Calgary and it would have been a shame to come back  here and lose to another team that we're chasing," said defenseman Dave Ellett,  who scored in the second period. "It was a big confidence builder."  </P> <P> Dale Hawerchuk also scored for the Jets, who won their third straight to climb  to within three points of the third-place Kings.  </P> <P> Edmonton was outshot, 31-27, and showed the effects of having to play two games  in less than 24 hours.  </P> <P> The Oilers beat Montreal, 6-2, just 18 hours earlier in Edmonton.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi scored 20  seconds apart late in the third period at Madison Square Garden to extend the  Rangers' winless streak to 11 games.  </P> <P> Lemieux tied the game at 14:10 with a 10-foot wrist shot past Bob Froese.  Recchi tapped in Dan Quinn's pass at 14:30, extending the Rangers' winless  skein to 0-8-3, their longest since 1965.  </P> <P> The Penguins capitalized on a Ranger mistake for the tying goal. New York  failed to place a man in the penalty box when Kris King received a major for  slashing at 8:42. The Rangers were unable to get a stoppage of play after the  penalty expired and were still a skater short when Lemieux scored.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 4, Buffalo 2 -- Pat LaFontaine scored three times, extending  his goal-scoring streak to seven games, to lead the Islanders at Buffalo.  </P> <P> LaFontaine, who took over the league lead with 33 goals, has 12 goals in his  last seven games, during which the Islanders are 6-1.  </P> <P> Detroit 6, New Jersey 4 -- Rick Zombo, Marc Habscheid and Lee Norwood had goals  during a 2:19 span as the Red Wings scored five times in the third period at  Detroit.  </P> <P> Detroit, which was 1-19-2 when trailing after two periods, scored four goals  within a 7 1/2-minute span early in the third period to overcome a pair of  two-goal deficits and snap a four-game winless streak.  </P> <P> Minnesota 2, St. Louis 1 -- Dave Gagner stole the puck from Rob Brind'Amour and  beat goaltender Vincent Riendeau 1:14 into overtime at Bloomington, Minn.  </P> <P> The North Stars, who were 2-11-2 in December, snapped winless streaks of six  games overall and five at home. Since it had the NHL's best record (15-8-1) on  Nov. 24, Minnesota is 3-12-2.  </P> <P> Brett Hull of the Blues sent the game into overtime with 8:21 left in  regulation with his 33rd goal.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 2, Vancouver 2 -- The tie at Vancouver gave the Flyers sole  possession of first place in the Patrick Division, one point ahead of New  Jersey and Washington.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Environment moves up the agenda Trade policymakers this week bowed to environmentalist demands for the Uruguay Round to address directly potential clashes between environmental and free trade priorities. A confidential draft proposal for a work programme to identify links between trade measures and environmental priorities, and to recommend how multilateral trade rules should be modified, has been tabled by European Union, Indian and Brazilian negotiators. Recommendations would be adopted at a ministerial conference in April next year, convened to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement. The proposal marks a significant shift for Gatt negotiators, who had insisted environmental issues be tackled once the Uruguay Round deal was completed. It falls short of demands from the US, Switzerland and some Nordic countries for the trade deal, due to be completed next week, to include a firm commitment to setting up a Gatt committee on trade and environment. The US yesterday remained firmly opposed to the compromise, but seemed isolated. Officials acknowledged developing-country worries about industrial-country environmental policies being used as trade weapons. US calls for environmental lobby groups to be able to submit briefs in trade disputes, or observe or comment in dispute panels, continue to be resisted. Most Gatt members argue governments should be the only bodies with direct access to Gatt disputes. As a compromise, Gatt suggests non-confidential summaries of submissions to Gatt panels be made available to lobbyists, with the panels able to appoint expert groups for technical advice. Among US environmental lobbyists arriving in Geneva, Mr Jim Marston of the Environmental Defence Fund said: 'The question is, what assurance will we have that these recommendations will be incorporated into Gatt. We are trying to be flexible, but need more hard assurances'. The confidential draft, approved on Tuesday by all developing countries involved, notes: 'There should not be any policy contradiction between upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, and acting for the protection of the environment and promotion of sustainable development'. While calling for closer co-ordination between trade and environmental policies, the proposal warns against exceeding the competence of Gatt, which is limited to trade policies and 'those trade-related aspects of environment policies which may result in significant trade effects'.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ahold buys US stores group from Promodes Ahold, the Dutch-based supermarket group which already ranks among the 10 largest food retailers in the US, is to bolster its position in the south-eastern US by acquiring Red Food Stores from Promodes, the French retailing group. Red Food Stores, with annual sales of Dollars 585m, operates 55 grocery stores in eastern Tennessee and Georgia. When the deal is completed in late April, it will mark Ahold's sixth acquisition of a US supermarket chain since it entered the US market in 1977. The latest purchase will lift its annual US turnover by almost 9 per cent to about Fl 7.25bn (Dollars 3.75bn), representing slightly more than half of Ahold's total sales. Ahold declined to give financial details but said the purchase would be financed out of 'available resources'. In May the company, which has long been seeking a new US acquisition, raised roughly Fl 450m through a 1-for-10 rights issue. Away from the US, Ahold has been concentrating its expansion in recent years on Portugal, where it has bought several grocery and hypermarket chains, and the Czech Republic, where it is slowly building up the Mana chain. The acquisition of Red Food Stores fits the pattern of Ahold's earlier US growth, which has relied on buying supermarkets in contiguous regions to promote partnerships between its chains and to spread the Dutch company's presence across the eastern US. 'We see new opportunities for synergy, benefiting both our customers as well as the bottom line,' Mr Robert Zwartendijk, president of Ahold USA, said. Red Food Stores' base in Tennessee and Georgia is close to that of Ahold's Bi-Lo chain, which operates 187 supermarkets in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Ahold's four other US chains cover the eastern US from Virginia to Massachusetts.</p>

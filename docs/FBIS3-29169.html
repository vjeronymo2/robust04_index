The discolored rice was found in six 50-kilogram bags of the  rice with the tainted rice occupying only a small part of each  bag, the agency's Gifu office said.    Officials suggested that the rice may have become wet during  its transport to Japan, adding they plan to check the rest of  the rice stored in Gifu.    It is the first case in Japan of mold being found in the  imported California rice.    The rice is part of a shipment of 7,200 tons from California  that arrived in Kobe last December 13. A total of 850 tons of  that rice was delivered to Gifu and 238 tons was sold to  wholesalers on February 10.    Denshiro Kugo of the agency office said that it is likely  the  mold developed during the shipping since the mold was already  dried out.    "We want to do our best to check the quality of the rice in  storage as soon as possible so consumers can feel at ease," Kugo  said.</p>

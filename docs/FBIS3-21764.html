This was reported  today at a news conference by participants in a just ended  seminar on the problems of drug abuse control, organized by the  Ministry of Science and Education and the Council of Europe.    According to Franco Marciale, director of the European Youth  Centre in Strasbourg, Bulgaria should avoid the mistakes of  other countries with a long history of drug abuse. Attention  should be focused on the high-risk groups and the factors  leading to drug addiction, Mr. Marciale believes. He emphasized  that teaching a healthy way of life should be a central task for  both family and school.    Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three  years ago. Even though the country was a transshipment point  for the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe, few cases of  narcotics dealing were detected inside Bulgaria until then.  Over the last few years, drug dealing in this country has been  on the rise. The number of drug addicts on record has gone up  from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000, recent statistics  show. 25 percent of pupils in Sofia have tried or are taking  drugs now, Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov told the National  Assembly some time ago. According to a survey conducted by the  Institute of Forensic Research and Criminology with the Interior  Ministry, 21.2 percent of juvenile delinquents are substance  abusers, and 16.5 percent are drug addicts.    The cases of drugs trafficking and drug-pushing are  investigated by a specialized department with the National  Investigative Service (NIS). According to its head Vladimir  Stoykov, drug-traffickers and pushers can hardly be convicted as  the law criminalizes offenses involving expensive goods while  the prices of drugs in Bulgaria, which have not been updated for  five years, are low in comparison with those in the West: a  kilogram of narcotic costs 260,000 leva (about $7,000) if impure  and twice as much if pure. A 0.25 g. dose of narcotic sells at  450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov says.</p>

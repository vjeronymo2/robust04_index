			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WELCH, ARMSTRONG ARE ALL-STAR GAME STARTERS  </P> <P> Bob Welch of the Oakland Athletics will start for the American League against  Jack Armstrong of the Cincinnati Reds in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.  </P> <P> National League Manager Roger Craig of San Francisco and AL Manager Tony  LaRussa of Oakland announced their lineups today at a news conference in  Chicago before the All-Star workouts.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson of the A's will bat first for the AL and play left field, and  Boston third baseman Wade Boggs will bat second.  </P> <P> Oakland's Jose Canseco, who missed the news conference, will bat third and play  right field, followed by Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken.  </P> <P> Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. will bat fifth, and Oakland third  baseman Mark McGwire will bat sixth.  </P> <P> Sandy Alomar Jr., the Cleveland Indians catcher, will hit seventh, followed by  New York Yankees second baseman Steve Sax and Welch.  </P> <P> Len Dykstra of the Philadelphia Phillies will lead off for the NL and play  center field. Chicago second baseman Ryne Sandberg will bat second, followed by  San Francisco first baseman Will Clark and Giants left fielder Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson of the Cubs will bat fifth and play right field, and Cincinnati  third baseman Chris Sabo will hit sixth.  </P> <P> Los Angeles catcher Mike Scioscia will bat seventh, followed by St. Louis  Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith and Armstrong.  </P> <P> The weatherman says it will rain. Maybe thunder, too.  </P> <P> "There's a chance, no, make that likely, there will be showers and  thunderstorms during the game," Bob Somrek of the U.S. Weather Service in  nearby Rosemont, Ill., said today. "I would bring an umbrella."  </P> <P> And for those fans sitting in the bleachers, don't bother bringing a glove,  said fellow meteorologist Larry Hildrebrand.  </P> <P> "It will be a pitcher's day," he said. "The wind will be blowing in from center  field, about 10 to 15 m.p.h."  </P> <P> Somrek could not predict how long the rain would last. The All-Star game never  has been completely rained out, although it was shortened to five innings in  1961 and postponed for a day in 1969.  </P></p>

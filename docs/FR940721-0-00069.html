			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Toyota stated that it believes that ``blanket certifications'' should be authorized for use where a supplier's parts contain no U.S./Canadian content and where the country of origin of the equipment is indicated in ordinary business records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments concerning requirements for suppliers, NHTSA has decided to specify specific requirements concerning the information suppliers must provide manufacturers and allied suppliers, but with some changes from the proposal. First, the agency is persuaded by AAMA's comment that suppliers should only be required to provide content data on those items of equipment requested by a manufacturer or its allied supplier. NHTSA is therefore specifying that manufacturers must request the specified information from their suppliers for relevant motor vehicle equipment, and that the suppliers must provide the specified information in response to such request (or a request from an allied supplier). The agency believes that this approach offers two primary advantages: (1) Suppliers will not be required to provide unnecessary information, i.e., information that would not be used for parts content calculations, and (2) suppliers are less likely to have compliance problems from not knowing about the requirements of 49 CFR part 583 than in a situation where they did not receive a specific request for the required information. NHTSA also believes that, as a practical matter, manufacturers would in any event need to be contacting suppliers concerning such things as where to send the required information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is also persuaded that it is unnecessary to specify any specific calendar dates for suppliers to provide the information. The agency is simply specifying that manufacturers must request the information in time to enable them to calculate the information required on the label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the agency believes that it is generally appropriate to permit manufacturers and suppliers to work out timing and other details among themselves, it believes that a few simple requirements are necessary for the benefit of outside suppliers. Specifically, the agency is specifying the following requirements with respect to manufacturer and allied supplier requests for content information from outside suppliers: (1) The requester must indicate that the request is being made pursuant to 49 CFR part 583, and that the regulation is administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, (2) the requester must indicate that 49 CFR part 583 requires outside suppliers to provide specified information upon the request of a manufacturer or allied supplier to which it supplies passenger motor vehicle equipment and that, to the best of the requester's knowledge, the outside supplier is required to provide the requested information, (3) if any information other than that required by 49 CFR part 583 is requested, the requester must indicate which information is required by 49 CFR part 583 and which is not, and (4) the requester must indicate that 49 CFR part 583 specifies that while information may be requested by an earlier date, the outside supplier is not required to provide the information until the date specified by the requester or the date 45 days after receipt of the request, whichever is later. The agency is not specifying the specific language by which requesters must provide this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since compliance by an outside supplier with 49 CFR part 583 is based upon providing information in response to a request from a manufacturer or allied supplier, the agency believes these requirements are necessary to protect outside suppliers. The requirements ensure that an outside supplier is aware that it is required by Federal regulation to provide the requested information, and that it knows the citation for the regulation and the agency which administers it. The requirements also ensure that outside suppliers will, in the event they receive requests for more information than that required by 49 CFR part 583, know which information is required by the regulation and which is not. Finally, the requirements ensure that outside suppliers will have adequate time to respond to the request. NHTSA notes that APMA recommended that the regulation specify notice of at least 90 days. However, that organization did not justify that amount of time. The agency believes that 45 days provides ample time, since today's final rule puts outside suppliers on notice that, from now on, they must provide the specified content information in response to requests from manufacturers and allied suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that similar requirements are unnecessary to protect allied suppliers, given that allied suppliers are wholly owned by vehicle manufacturers. Also, any specific timing requirements as to when allied suppliers must provide requested information would be more complicated, since allied suppliers may need to request information of outside suppliers in order to provide the requested information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to AAMA's comment that certifications should be optional for allied suppliers, NHTSA notes that section 210(d) specifies that regulations ``shall include provisions applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign * * *.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion to make certifications optional. NHTSA also observes that while allied suppliers are owned by manufacturers, they are nonetheless separate entities with independent legal obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this statutory provision, the agency also cannot permit the use of ordinary business records instead of specific certifications from suppliers, as recommended by Toyota. The agency notes, however, that a certification can cover multiple items of equipment and can be part of documents containing other information. Suppliers may be able to incorporate the certification into other business records that they provide manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency does not accept AAMA's suggestion that supplier estimates of price, content and origin for unique type of equipment not be based on a period of time generally corresponding to the model year for which content calculations are to be made. Estimates that are based on current production or on the start of production might be very different from what the supplier anticipates for the model year as a whole. For example, a supplier might plan to manufacture a part in both the United States and overseas, and to begin production in one place slightly before the other place. In such an instance, an estimate based on start of production would not be meaningful. In order to ensure meaningful label information, NHTSA believes that estimates must be for an overall production period that corresponds to the relevant model year. The agency emphasizes, however, that suppliers are only required to provide good faith estimates and are not prevented from making subsequent changes in price, content and origin for their equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

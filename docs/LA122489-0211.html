			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: NORTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> DRUNK-DRIVING CRACKDOWN NETS 39  </P> <P> A first-ever coordinated drunk-driving crackdown in North Orange County  resulted in 39 arrests Friday night and early Saturday morning. About 70 police  officers in Buena Park, Fullerton, La Habra, Brea and Placentia were assigned  to search for drunk drivers. The officers covered about 85 square miles of the  county north of the Riverside Freeway. La Habra police arrested 11 people  suspected of driving drunk, the highest number among the five departments. Brea  police arrested 10 of 3,096 motorists stopped at a sobriety checkpoint.  Fullerton police arrested four people, less than a typical holiday weekend  night, Sgt. Douglas Cave said Saturday. "We look at this as a success," Cave  said. "The people obviously got the word and stayed off the streets." Before  the crackdown, police distributed 2,500 flyers to bars, restaurants and  shopping centers warning of the special police effort. Fullerton made one of  the earliest arrests, Lt. Bud Lathrop said. Police arrested a man at noon  Friday who apparently had left a holiday office party, he said. "He got an  early start," Lathrop said. "His driving was so alarming, people were calling  us . . . from pay phones and car phones. It didn't take any clever police work  to catch him." In addition to the arrests resulting from the crackdown, four of  the nine traffic collisions in the North County area Friday night and Saturday  morning ended with a driver being arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, Cave  said.  </P></p>

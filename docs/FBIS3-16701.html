Niyazov Ready </F> To Replace His Government Unless the Consumer Market Is Put in  Order"]    [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] -- It is a long time since  viewers tuning into the Turkmenistan news have seen the kind of  dressing down given by President S. Niyazov to ministry and  department leaders over the abominable state of the consumer  market. Calling his adjutants [zampred] to attention, the  Turkmenbashi told them: "All of our slogans and promises are  worth nothing if store shelves remain empty. People are  becoming exasperated -- and rightly so. How much longer are you  going to trade commodities from state resources at market  prices?!"    Store shelves that have been stripped bare and on which you  will not even find toothpaste, shoe polish, matches, or soap;  soaring prices at state trade outlets -- not to mention  commercial kiosks and markets -- even by comparison with those  in Russia; the despondent faces of people gloomily wandering  around the stores with the now-worthless manat -- this,  IZVESTIYA wrote 18 February -- this is the situation in  Turkmenistan's cities, even in the capital. Nor has it changed  one iota today. The lack of the essential range of commodities  conntinues, with the very same wildly inflated prices at state  retail outlets.    How can you live if you earn 200-250 manats while a kg of  meat at the market costs between 35 and 40 manats, a kg of  potatoes is 10 manats, and a pack of cigarettes anything from 20  to 30 manats? Who controls all of this here in the Republic?  Indeed, is it under control? In the final analysis, who  regulates prices? These questions were quite rightly asked at  the Cabinet of Ministers session.    Prices are one thing, but the absence of commodities in the  stores, even those which are produced in Turkmenistan, is  another problem dogging the consumer market. "Why is it that,  despite the availability of raw materials and labor, production  of these goods is not increasing?" S. Niyazov exclaimed  indignantly, turning to his adjutants. "Who sanctions market  prices for state resources?"    By the way, he put these questions to them some five months  ago, when the manat was being introduced and when, taking  advantage of the Turkmenbashi's absence from Turkmenistan,  departments pushed up prices for goods and foodstuffs so that  people ended up wandering around the stores as if they were in a  museum. In those early October days a major dressing down was  also delivered, but everything was quickly forgotten, and that  is why today, when returning home from a trip to Moscow, people  from Turkmenistan cram all their free luggage space with  sausage, cheese, fresh eggs, jam, confectionery, and fruit in  the Russian capital, because they will not find any such thing  at state trade outlets in Turkmenistan. Those who cannot fly to  Moscow do "the next best thing": On weekends, thousands of  people from Krasnovodsk, Tashauz, and Mary come to Ashkhabad on  the local trains and clear out the already impoverished stores,  despite the exorbitant prices.    Giving his adjutants a 10-day breathing space before what is  left of confidence in the government runs out, the Turkmenistan  president demanded from it concrete, vigorous action to improve  the consumer market situation and the supply to the population  first and foremost of foodstuffs, medicines, and vital  commodities.</p>

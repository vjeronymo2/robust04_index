			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Observer: Newsance The Times' decision to sink its cover price by a third makes the life of John Dux, managing director of News International but also chairman of the Newspaper Publishers Association's anti-VAT committee, a little harder. In the latter position, where of course he speaks for the entire industry, Dux will have to remain nimble on his feet if he is to persuade the chancellor that an imposition of up to 17.5 per cent value added tax on the press at the next budget would be detrimental to circulation when one newspaper can afford to cut 33 per cent in the race to discomfort the opposition.</p>

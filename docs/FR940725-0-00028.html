A QBU changing functional currency must make the adjustments described in &sect;1.985&hyph;5 if the year of change (as defined in &sect;1.481&hyph;1(a)(1)) begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in &sect;1.985&hyph;6 if the year of change begins in 1987. The adjustments described in &sect;1.985&hyph;5 must be included in income in the taxable year prior to the year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change unless that prior taxable year is closed. In that case, the adjustments must be included in income in the year of change. No adjustments under section 481 are required solely because of a change in functional currency described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

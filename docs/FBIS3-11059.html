			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de Las Casas, </F> Chiapas; from the "Acir Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] Indian and peasant organizations concluded a meeting  in San Cristobal de Las Casas and announced an agreement to  block roads, occupy government agency buildings related to  agricultural and livestock production, and take over the Chamber  of Deputies and congressional headquarters. Jorge Arturo Luna,  a leader of the Independent Peasants Central Organization [CCI],  reported that the peasant demand for greater participation in  agricultural issues should be reinforced with enhanced grain  crop yield and land tenure protection controls. Therefore, they  say, Article 27 of the Constitution should be reformed. They  added that Article 4 should also be changed to give Indian  communities more rights and greater recognition of their worth  and political participation nationwide. The peasant  organizations announced that another national meeting will be  held on 22 March in Mexico City. Agricultural and Indian  organizations from all over the country will participate in this  meeting.    The important thing now, though, is that the Catholic Church  is said to be justifying the recent land invasions. We spoke  with Father Joel Padron, parish priest of Simon Jovel, which is  a community about three and one half hours away from San  Cristobal de Las Casas. It is noteworthy that Fr. Joel Padron  said that the hunger, poverty, and destitution among Indians and  peasants is high and explained that this is why they are seeking  some way to support their families. He added that the church  has no part in the issue of land invasion or the armed movement  of last January. He went on to say that the church is not to  blame for the hunger and, especially, for the deaths of  thousands of children, or for the indigence of thousands of  Indians. Joel Padron also said that the church must also change  is attitude, because it -- along with the political parties --  has been left behind by society in general and by a community  that has organized itself to struggle in defense of its rights.    [Begin Padron recording] The civilian population is  awakening  with the events in Chiapas and claiming its rightful place. I  believe the political parties must feel left behind by the  civilian society. They have new challenges at every turn. How  can they offer these discontented groups, who have been rejected  for so long any truly dependable solutions? How can they  respond to the civilian population? The community is capable of  making a more constructive contribution to the peace process. I  believe the civilian population, as such, which goes beyond any  political party, does not respond to any specific group interest  or any political interest. It is more interested in creating a  new Mexico. [end recording]    He said that a new Chiapas should rise from the movement  that  began in January. It should become a new state where justice is  pure; deprivation is left behind; peasants are given their  rights, especially their right to speak out, because they were  never allowed to do so.    Joel Padron added that one guarantee that must be secured in  order to attain peace in this state is that the community in  general be allowed to participate in the peace process. The  church cannot remove itself from this process and must become a  true promoter of peace, and never extricate itself. He  responded to those critics who are calling for Monsignor Samuel  Ruiz and himself to resign. Those demanding this are mistaken,  because the church does not promote violence. Violence has  appeared because of the hunger and poverty of thousands of  people who are seeking some way to support their families.</p>

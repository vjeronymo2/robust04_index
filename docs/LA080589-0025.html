			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IRREGULARITIES IN OFFICIATING COST HARPER  </P> <P> We've noticed in the past years certain irregularities in the officials'  decisions at Saugus race track but none so blatantly flaunted and so criminal  as the one July 22 involving Will Harper. Harper drove a beautiful 100-lap  race! He led for 92 laps until he was turned down on by another driver he was  lapping. His car spun into the infield, he recovered fast enough to slide into  second place and did not disturb any continuity in the pack.  </P> <P> He was yellow flagged when it was obvious he could continue racing and possibly  recapture first place, while during the previous races and during the same race  other cars were allowed to sit in the infield for two laps or bring out a  yellow flag and return to their previous position in the pack.  </P> <P> I was especially upset to see this type of unsportsmanlike conduct by the  officials. We've looked at many other poor decisions in the past and considered  it a possible error in judgment.  </P> <P> We cannot call this an error in judgment! This was so deliberate, I've been  unable to sleep until I wrote this letter to someone who has the ability to  publicly voice my outrage.  </P> <P> I feel it's time some fans start objecting to this type of conduct.  </P> <P> SHELLEY DUNCAN  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

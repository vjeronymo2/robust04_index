			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 50 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS STAGE PROTEST AT INS  OFFICE  </P> <P> About 50 illegal immigrants demonstrated Tuesday in front of an Immigration and  Naturalization Service office in the Pico-Union district to protest the  agency's alleged out-of-hand dismissal of hundreds of late amnesty  applications.  </P> <P> The rally, organized by the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los  Angeles, protested the agency's insistence on what organizers said is an  extraordinary amount of documentation to support late applications.  </P> <P> The demonstrators also called for the dismissal of INS official Debra Perez,  head of the Pico-Union office.  </P> <P> "We have to force the INS to deal with these aliens fairly," said attorney and  protest organizer Cesar Noriega-Pena. "They aren't right now."  </P> <P> In 1988, a federal judge ordered the INS to accept applications beyond the  original sign-up deadline from immigrants who had been told they were  ineligible because they either improperly used visas to return to the United  States during the initial sign-up period or left this country without INS  permission. Mary Ellen Elwood, INS associate director for legalization in the  western states, said the Pico-Union office has been properly reviewing late  applications.  </P> <P> She said the rejection rate of the late applications has hovered near 90%  because of the extensive use of fraudulent documents.  </P> <P> The late-application program, believed to affect about 40,000 aliens in Los  Angeles, has been a source of irritation between the INS and immigrant-rights  advocates. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony recently accused the INS of "bad faith"  for rejecting many of the late applications.  </P> <P> "As for Debra Perez, she's been in charge of the training sessions there (for  late amnesty) and we've been in full compliance with the court order," Elwood  said.  </P></p>

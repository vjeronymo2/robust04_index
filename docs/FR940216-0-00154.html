			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Auditor Qualifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed specific criteria for determining the independence and technical capability of the auditor (and where applicable, the auditor's organization and/or certain persons working with or for the auditor). A few commenters suggested minor changes in the proposed criteria as discussed in the RIA, and some of these recommendations are incorporated in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also proposed that the auditor retained by a refiner or importer may also have developed the baseline for the same refiner or importer as long as all other auditor qualification requirements were met. Several commenters who addressed this issue agreed that the auditor should be allowed to also be the baseline preparer, mostly from a cost savings point-of-view. Other commenters pointed out that the independence of the review would be lost. While this may diminish to some extent the value of an independent audit, the cost and time savings are relevant considerations. In balancing these concerns, EPA is allowing the auditor to also have prepared the baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Auditor Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed two options by which potential auditors could be approved by EPA as qualified to audit baselines. One option involved precertification by EPA; under this option, a statement of the auditor's qualifications would be submitted to EPA. EPA would officially certify an auditor, or if no comment were received from EPA within a specified time, the auditor would be considered certified by default. The other option required the refiner or importer to ensure that the auditor is qualified, and to provide a qualification statement for the auditor with the baseline submission. In this case, the auditor would not be pre-certified by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters agreed with allowing both options. One commenter thought that EPA should notify auditors of approval rather than letting them be certified by default, and that they should be pre-certified. EPA believes that, in most cases, it will respond in some form, not necessarily approval or disapproval, prior to the end of the allowable time period. In the proposal, EPA allowed the auditor to be certified by default after 30 days. However, EPA now believes that it should not allow an auditor to be certified by default until 45 days after application or today's date, whichever is later, because of possible delays, e.g., mail delivery, in receiving an auditor's qualification statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA had also proposed that within thirty (30) days of hiring a baseline auditor or today's date, whichever is later, each refiner and importer must inform EPA of the name, organization address and telephone number of the auditor hired. EPA now believes this information is not critical and thus is eliminating this requirement. This information is only required in the baseline submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Auditor Responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major issues raised by commenters concerning auditor responsibilities was whether the auditor was to verify the baseline determination or recalculate the baseline itself. EPA agrees that the auditor should independently verify the baseline determination, and is not required to develop a second baseline determination. However, the auditor must take whatever action is necessary to ensure that all baseline submission requirements are fulfilled. EPA is also requiring that a refiner's baseline submission include a statement prepared and signed by the primary analyst stating that, to the best of its knowledge, it has thoroughly reviewed the sampling methodology and baseline calculations, and that they meet the requirements and intentions of the rulemaking, and that it agrees with the final baseline parameter and emission values listed in the baseline submission. EPA is not requiring auditors to submit (to EPA) an audit plan prior to beginning the baseline verification process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Baseline Submission and Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Few comments were received concerning the timing of baseline submissions, and EPA is promulgating its requirements that baselines be submitted to EPA within 6 months of today's date and that baselines determined using data collected after today be submitted to EPA by September 1, 1994. EPA will consider petitions for an extension of these deadlines, however, submitters should take note that late submissions could cause delays in receiving EPA decisions on approval of their baselines. EPA is promulgating such timing requirements in order to give the industry sufficient time to generate and audit individual baselines. EPA is well aware of the need for expeditious review of submitted baselines, and encourages submission of baselines as soon as possible after today.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

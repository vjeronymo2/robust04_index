			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  carries an article entitled "Radical Democrats Have Created  Their Own Party. Gaidar Hopes To Win Support of President  Yeltsin and Major Financial Groups", which says that "evidently,  by holding a news conference devoted to the final stage of the  creation of the "Russia's Choice" party Gaydar and his allies,  Anatoliy Chubays, Anatoliy Pristavkin and Sergey Kovalev,  intended not only to convince all those interested of bright  prospects of this organisation, but show its present powerful  organisational and intellectual potential. This has been  demonstrated by a statement made by founders of the party and  circulated at a news conference on Thursday, which was signed by  over a hundred prominent public figures.    The newspaper carries an interview with chairman of the  Georgian temporary committee for emergency situations, Jaba  Ioseliani, who declared that "Abkhazian claims to create an  independent state do not conform to existing realities. It is  unnatural that 20,000 Abkhazians dictate their will to the  predominantly Georgian population numbering around 500,000.  This is not the right basis for building up a state, all the  more so, because 5 million more Georgians are residing in the  neighbouring state. This is absurd... The results of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict which led to a bloody war suit no  one today. Naturally, Georgia is not satisfied either... I  repeat what I said many times before: Georgia's enemies cannot  be Russia' patriots, they are its enemies ..., destroying what  was created over centuries for the sake of present-day  advantages. These people are "temporary", Ioseliani said.    The results of an election campaign in subjects of the  Russian Federation are published on the front page of the  ROSSIYSKIE VESTI Newspaper. The newspaper Says that "elections  held in Russia's regions on March 27, showed several tendencies.  An opinion was confirmed that public and political forces  centered in Moscow did not show a profound interest in these  elections. In fact, the struggle for regions between political  parties has not begun yet," the newspaper said.    The TRUD daily carries an article by an academician of the  Russian Academy of Education, Igor Bestuzhev-Lada, who says that  "now and then, both branches of the executive power tell us that  the situation is under control and whatever happens is for the  better in the best of these worlds. However, we see for  ourselves that the situation continues to deteriorate and there  are no real signs of improvement or even stabilisation or  deterrence of collapse in the foreseeable future. In my  opinion, civic accord must begin not from a 'non-attack treaty'  (since politicians who cease to attack each other are no longer  politicians), but from real political programmes which could  unite broad enough circles of the population and party forces,  reflecting their interests," Bestuzhev-Lada said.    The VECHERNIY PETERSBURG newspaper writes that a  coordinative  council for fighting drug mafia and drug business was set up at  the St. Petersburg mayor's office. The council was established  because St. Petersburg is turning into one of European centers  of drug business since its location is convenient for transit of  drugs from Asia to Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states.  The actual number of drug addicts in St. Petersburg varies from  80,000 to 250,000, interior officials said.    The newspaper ST. PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI reports that a  regional branch strike committee was established at a meeting of  St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region trade union leaders to  coordinate mass actions of the working people in defence of  their rights. The first action taken by the committee,  addressed to the Federal Assembly, the president and the  government, is a demand to change the course of reforms in the  interests of economic growth of the country and give a realistic  figure of the minimum subsistence level of the population.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Property: Convert to a life of affordable luxury - Gerald Cadogan celebrates countryside architecture BARNS boomed in the 1980s. As the supply of manors, farmhouses and rectories diminished, many were sold for Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 for conversion into houses. Barns alone seemed to offer the ambience of traditional country life that Britons, from the Prince of Wales downwards, have long sought for the house they want to make home. The results, however, were sometimes architecturally disastrous. If they were in open country, planning authorities frequently tried to stop conversions. But, while Nicholas Ridley was environment secretary, local planners knew his inspectors would probably reverse their refusals on appeal. English Heritage eventually led a counter-attack to defend listed barns and the countryside as a whole. But they did so just as the property market - and with it the demand for barns - was subsiding. Barn prices have now come down more than have other houses'. The result is there is no longer any need to live in a converted barn to experience country life - not unless you particularly want to. Rectories, manors and farmhouses are back on the market. If it is a barn you want, there are now many for sale at fair prices, whether already converted or, as the estate agents say, ripe for conversion. The difference now is that district councils, which control planning, are tougher than four years ago. This means we should see better and more appropriate conversions. And, in answer to this need, English Heritage has produced a useful pamphlet, The Conversion of Historic Farm Buildings. Barns unconverted are lovable buildings, forming part of British economic and social history. In the past, ownership of one symbolised wealth and power. Generally better built because of their importance to the life of a community, many have stood for centuries while farm houses and cottages have risen and fallen around them. They kept the harvest, the hay and the wagons. The animals wintered there. Men hid in them from press gangs or from the enemy during the Civil War. And, being dry, they provided the best space for celebrations and dances - or for a tumble in the hay. But barns were never places in which to live. This continues to influence planning authorities' present attitudes. If there is to be a conversion, they would prefer the barn to be used for light industrial purposes - as a workshop, warehouse, office, or packing plant - rather than as as house and home. Planners' first question is: Has the barn really become redundant for farm use? Or is the owner merely saying it has? Is he motivated by a desire to collect a one-off payment for the sale - rather than let it at a low business rental? Keeping the barn commercial may also provide employment and preserve the airy, open-plan character of the building. A house, on the other hand, usually entails subdivision - to answer the need for privacy sought by all but the most eccentric. To English Heritage and the planners, converting a barn into even a concert hall, theatre, conference centre or restaurant (as has happened with many barns and National Trust houses) is preferable to turning it into a home. If a house is the only solution, the planners will be zealous in ensuring that you respect the character of the building, especially its doors and windows. If it has long, slit windows, like arrow loops, you are unlikely to be allowed to enlarge them, though you will probably be allowed to open up blocked windows and doors. But the barn will have to retain the aspect of long, uninterrupted slabs of wall which, as in a factory, shows it is a working building, not a domestic one. An imaginative architect is, therefore, essential - one who will enjoy the challenge and who may be able to convince the planners to allow a few windows in the walls. Faced with the big problem of barn doors, can he do better than the standard long strips of glass and wood? If he keeps the original large wooden doors, can he cunningly devise a system of skylights to let in daylight? Can the interior be so designed that part of the house stretches up to the roof to glory in the barn's height, while alongside stands an upper floor gallery? A proposed barn conversion in open countryside has a poorer chance of approval than one in a village. The typical council decision is that a domestic conversion will have an adverse impact and should be refused since the barn is outside the village. In this, the council will usually get the support of the Environment Department. Mention a possible swimming pool or tennis court and you will not improve your chances of planning approval. In a village, planners are more relaxed about allowing dormers and chimneys. But these can change the character of the building so much that, if it is listed, English Heritage may recommend its delisting. The brick, flint and timber Hoe Barn at Flansham, West Sussex, provides an example of what can be done and what is available. Set on three floors to emphasize its timber framing, and with its skylights cleverly arranged in a random pattern, it is on offer from Humberts (0273-478828) at Pounds 350,000. On the edge of Godalming lies a 16th century tithe barn on two levels - the cattle were kept on the lower - with a magnificent timbered hall/drawing room, which Browns (0483-31166) are offering at Pounds 650,000. Several barns, cottages, stables and a coach house are ready for customers' conversions on the Gullet Farm estate close to the sea at South Pool, south Devon. Savills (0225-444622) and Luscombe &amp; May are auctioning them on October 2. Lot 3 comprises two barns at Halwell Farm, built of traditional Devon stone and cob (earth mixed with dung). They come with 2 acres, including some woodland, and private access to a creek and the foreshore. The guide price is Pounds 75,000, roughly half of what it would have been four years ago. If the hurdles before a barn conversion are considerable, the results can be splendid. Barn shells have the advantage of sharing the building style of the country around them and, if sensitively converted, will fit the landscape.</p>

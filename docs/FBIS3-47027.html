			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khamla Keophithoun, economic attache of the </F> Embassy of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in the PRC, by  an unidentified reporter in Beijing; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] How are you, Mr. Khamla? First of  all, we would like to thank you for granting us an interview.  In 1993, China and Laos have continued to carry out  restructuring and have made satisfactory achievements.  Therefore, as the old year is ending and the new year  approaching, could you please brief us on achievements of Laos  in restructuring and in economic development in the past year?    [Khamla] [passage omitted] According to the announced  figures, the GDP has increased by six percent. The total  production of each sector can be categorized as follows: food  supply production was 1,448,900 metric tons; agricultural  production increased by 4.5 percent; industrial and handicraft  production increased by 9.2 percent; electricity output  increased by 17 percent; processed industrial products increased  by 10 percent; and services increased by 6.9 percent. [passage  omitted]    Goods transportion by land, water, air, and sea has been  developed. The number of private enterprises and partnerships  has increased rapidly, thus making the distribution of goods  into every part of the country possible. The volume of goods  transported has increased by eight percent, while the volume of  goods in circulation increased by 10 percent compared to 1992.  [passage omitted]    On the trade balance, in the past year the volume of goods  in  circulation in the local market increased by 10 percent. The  total value of goods exported was U.S. $220 million. This  represents a 34-percent increase from 1992 and four percent  above the year's target. Total imports were valued at U.S. $385  million, an increase of 13 percent.    Banking has been efficiently managed and the government was  able to keep the amount of loans under control. At the same  time, the exchange rates between the Lao kip currency and  foreign currencies were stable.    A new mechanism have been introduced to finance.  Specifically, efforts were made to clearly separate the two  roles in management thus making the state financial system  unified and centralized. This has contributed to the  implementation of a mechanism that is in line with the open-door  policy, the setting of a balanced budget, the establishment of a  national treasury, and the improvement of tax collection  methods. A number of major rules and regulations have been laid  out to make the finance and budget managements gradually conform  with the new mechanism. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] In 1993, China and Laos exchanged more  friendship visits than in previous years, while economic and  trade cooperation increased noticeably. Therefore, could you  please brief us on this issue? What do think about economic and  trade cooperation in the future?    [Khamla] We can say that both China and Laos in 1993  exchanged more friendship visits than in any previous year.  This is because Laos and China are close neighbors; the peoples  of the two countries have enjoyed the traditional solidarity,  friendship, and good relations since ancient times; their  mountains, forests, and rivers are linked to each other; their  weather and natural resources are also similar. All these are  favorable factors for ties and cooperation. [passage omitted]    Over the past four to five years, economic and trade  cooperation as well as border trade, have increased  considerably. Trading has increased from only a few kinds of  goods in the past to more than 300 at present. Two-way trade  volume has increased from only US$5 million to US$6 million per  annum in the past to US$30 million a year at present.    There have been economic, and science and technology  cooperation projects carried out in various ways and means and  participated in by several economic sectors. The process of  cooperation involved the provision of gratis aid, interest-free  or low-interest loans for construction of hydropower electric  plants, or the development of agriculture, forestry, and the  rural economy.    On cooperation in the expansion of industry or in mining  exploration, many Chinese companies have been awarded contracts  for the construction of roads, airfields, hydropower electric  plants in the northern, central, and southern regions of Laos,  with a combined total cost of more than US$60 million.    Over the past four years, the PRC has invested a total of  US$21,914,000 in 34 projects in Laos. In 1993, the PRC invested  in 17 projects worth more than US$13 million.    To enhance future economic and trade relations and  cooperation, although both countries have had similar  experiences, I believe each country has some unique qualities  and different conditions and levels of development. Despite  differences, both have similarities in many aspects, such as  geographically, in natural resources, in labor, funding, science  and technology, and in the lessons of socioeconomic development  and other fields.    I believe that along with the relations and cooperation  between the potential markets, Laos and China will be able to  find basic sectors, projects, forms, and methods of cooperaton  that can serve as strategies and key factors for firm and  lasting cooperation. I believe both countries are jointly  considering basic, lasting, and key cooperation projects in  several fields. These are integrated agriculture; forestry;  processing industry for export; hydropower; mining; geology;  construction materials; communications and land, water and air  transportation; and tourism. [passage omitted]    Our country is the country of peace, stability, and social  order. Its location is important as the international community  is interested in development projects in this region, some of  which are the Golden Quadrangle development project; the project  to link Asian transportation routes -- roads, railways,  waterways; the Mekong River waterways transportation project  from the watershed in Tibet to Vietnam. [passage omitted]    Trade and the economy have very important roles for  Lao-Chinese ties and cooperation. In this regard, all concerned  agencies of each side will have to make efforts not only to  increase production but also to consider the natural resources  of each country, as well as the trade balance. They will also  have to take into account various main strategic projects, ways  to increase prosperity, and international competition. For  example, border provinces may cooperate in agricultural  cultivation, animal husbandry, logging and timber processing,  reforestation, mining, the expansion of processing industries,  the renovation of transportation routes, and tourism development  through various ways and means. Regarding capital, they may  discuss loan procurement from different places for established  projects so that they can be completed within a suitable  time-frame.    With this concept, I fervently hope the organizations  concerned, PRC businessmen and investors, as well as those from  other friendly countries will intensify their cooperation with  the LPDR to bring about real benefits and glorious success to  all sides.

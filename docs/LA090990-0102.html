			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT LOSS;  </P> <P> TITANS: AFTER JUMPING TO A 31-3 HALFTIME LEAD, THIRD-RANKED AUBURN IS GIVEN A  GAME, 38-17.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton flies home from Auburn today with its $250,000 guarantee  check and an unexpected piece of carry-on luggage -- a big bag of respect.  </P> <P> The Titans didn't exactly put fear into the hearts of 77,500 fans in  Jordan-Hare Stadium, but they did give the third-ranked Tigers a decent game  before losing, 38-17, a score not nearly as lopsided as most anticipated.  </P> <P> Fullerton outscored Auburn, 14-0, in the third quarter, their second touchdown  coming on a play reminiscent of Pittsburgh Steeler running back Franco Harris'  Immaculate Reception, to turn a 31-3 deficit into a 31-17 game.  </P> <P> The Titans forced a punt on Auburn's next possession and would have had good  field position had return man Greg West not fumbled the ball away at the Titan  41-yard line. The Tigers later scored on Stan White's 13-yard pass to Greg  Taylor -- the redshirt freshman quarterback's fourth touchdown pass of the game  -- to make it 38-17 with 11:18 remaining.  </P> <P> "We didn't win, but it was a big, big moral victory for us," Fullerton kicker  Phil Nevin said. "I think people were expecting a Long Beach-Clemson type score  (59-0 last week), but they're going to look at this and say, 'Wow, they gave  them a ballgame.' We played a hell of a second half, and their first team was  in there most of the time."  </P> <P> To Fullerton's credit, the Titans' offensive success didn't come against the  Tigers' third- and fourth-string players. Auburn Coach Pat Dye shuffled  reserves in and out of the game but never pulled entire starting units.  </P> <P> Fullerton quarterback Paul Schulte, going against a defense many consider to be  among the nation's best, completed 17 of 28 passes for 235 yards and two  touchdowns.  </P> <P> "If you would have told me before the game that (preseason All-American  defensive tackle) David Rocker and (All-American offensive guard) Ed King would  be in there at the end, I would have thought there was something the matter  with you," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But our kids played very hard the  whole game. Auburn was flat, and justifiably so, but they weren't playing  against air, either."  </P> <P> It only seemed that way in the first half when the Tigers scored on five of  their six possessions. White had plenty of time to carve up the Titan  secondary, completing 14 of 22 first-half attempts for 241 yards and three  touchdowns.  </P> <P> "You bet we were wide-eyed at the start of the game," Murphy said. "To say  anything else would be lying. Our most inexperienced players are on offense,  and it took us time to get in the flow. But we gained more confidence in the  second half once we found out we could move the football."  </P> <P> Fullerton finally found the end zone late in the third quarter when Schulte  completed four of four passes on a 49-yard drive, the last a five-yarder to  J.J. Celestine to make it 31-10 with 2:42 left in the third.  </P> <P> Two minutes later, from the Titan 34, Schulte threw to Celestine up the left  sideline. Celestine and Tiger cornerback Mike Pina went up for the ball, and  Pina tipped it in the air. The players collided and fell, but Celestine managed  to kick the ball to teammate Reggie Yarbrough, who snared the deflection at the  Fullerton 47 and raced into the end zone for a 66-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Fullerton defensive back Terry Tramble suffered a broken arm in the first half  and might be out for the season. . . . The Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Enquirer, in  its prediction for the game in Saturday morning's paper, said it would be  "Auburn by two. By two minutes, it will be over." Added a Ledger-Enquirer  columnist: "The Tigers don't really start the season until next week at Ole  Miss. Auburn invited 75,000 or 85,000 of its fans to Jordan-Hare Stadium for a  scrimmage."  </P></p>

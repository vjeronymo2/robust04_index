The acknowledgement that Britain had bowed to U.S. and  French  pressure came as Conservative MPs voiced deep concern that the  threat of NATO air strikes might draw the West into greater  military involvement in Bosnia.    After a meeting with senior ministers, the MPs said they  would push for an immediate withdrawal of the 2,500 British  troops in the former Yugoslav province if the 10-day ultimatum  brought an escalation in the conflict.    But as the government temporarily suspended its aid convoys  in Bosnia for fear of retaliation by Serbian forces, ministers  admitted that the choice had been between supporting the NATO  plan and a damaging rift with the U.S.    It is understood that in a telephone call on Wednesday,  President Bill Clinton warned Mr John Major that if Britain  blocked the strategy it might seriously undermine the U.S.  commitment to NATO. Senior ministers said President Clinton had  made clear that failure to act would strengthen the hand of  those in Washington arguing for a much faster and bigger  disengagement of US forces from Europe.    A shift in the French position in favour of the air strikes  also seriously undercut Mr Major's position that such action  posed too serious a threat to the troops on the ground. France  has committed more troops than Britain to Bosnia.    One senior minister said that in such circumstances it would  have been "disastrous" for the future of the alliance to oppose  the ultimatum.    Mr Major, whose government was seriously at odds with  President Clinton over the admission to the U.S. this month of  Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, judged that Britain could  not afford another damaging breach. Significant tensions still  remained within the cabinet before the decision to go along with  the U.S. was taken.    The ministers said the cabinet had agreed to the ultimatum  only after military commanders on the ground said limited use of  air power was feasible and that the risk to British troops could  be contained. It was also agreed that if air strikes failed in  their objective, there would be no further escalation in British  military involvement.    In a Commons statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign  secretary, alluded repeatedly to the tensions within the Western  alliance when he said there was a need to present a united front  within NATO. The government had backed the ultimatum because  "there is a strong British interest in maintaining the strength  and solidarity of NATO."    He also emphasised hopes that the demilitarisation of  Sarajevo would speed the process towards a political settlement  in Bosnia. But he admitted: "No one would pretend that this was  an easy decision."    Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence  secretary, in an attempt to calm Tory backbench fears at a  hastily convened meeting last night. The two ministers stressed  that contingency plans had been made to secure the safety of  British troops and, if necessary, to withdraw them.    The ministers stressed also the advantages of the new U.S.  commitment to more active involvement in the search for a  peaceful settlement. Washington had made it clear it is still  opposed to the involvement of U.S. troops, but British ministers  hope the Bosnian Moslems will be persuaded that the U.S. can no  longer be relied on as a "secret ally."</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The trials of learning to love the hated Beattie: How the nice guys at British Telecom made everything come right in the end I wonder why British Telecom is Britain's most hated company. Its business is not harmful in any way; so far as I am aware it has never been the cause of any life threatening industrial accidents; its profits are not derived from the corruption of minors, nor the hunting or skinning of animals; it does not pollute our rivers, while its despoiliation of the countryside is far less unsightly than, for example, that resulting from the gigantic pylons which the electricity supply industry positively gloats over in its television advertisements. And yet, everybody seems to hate British Telecom. Is it because it makes profits of Pounds 100 a second? This seems rather an irrelevant measure. Perhaps it is because the company makes a rate of return of almost 75 per cent on national calls, and not far short of 45 per cent return on local calls. But these figures, while doubtless a national disgrace, are not, I suspect, known to more than a very small percentage of those who moan and complain about British Telecom. Besides, I recall a few years ago attending a press conference at which the then chairman of British Petroleum, Sir Peter Walters, was being castigated for putting up the price of petrol too much and too often. Sir Peter robustly answered that if people thought that BP was making an extortionate return they should stop moaning and buy his shares. This argument is even more applicable to British Telecom: many of its customers did buy the shares when they were floated not once but twice on the stock market, and they have probably grown accustomed to the plop of a dividend cheque on their front door mats. That, after all, was the main, if slightly disreputable, reason for privatising British Telecom as a near monopoly. I have rehearsed these arguments to myself over the past week, as an exercise to reduce my blood pressure. You see, Doctor, I had begun to hate the people at British Telecom, too. First, they had overcharged me on my old London telephone number. Then they came to remove two telephones at our new London address, omitting to bring the two new telephones that we ordered. Then, when they did bring the two new lines, they installed them in such a way that each interfered with the other's reception. We were told that to have the lines more than two inches apart would be 'complicated'. Then we were cut off on our number in the country. Our fault really, we stupidly went on honeymoon without telling British Telecom, and in a four week period three bills, blue, red and final, arrived, and we were disconnected for non-payment of a bill of Pounds 65, much of it in the inimitable manner of British Telecom rental in advance. On Monday I paid the bill and rang up the BT disconnection unit in Bristol, to ask when we would be reconnected. 'When we have your cheque in the system.' 'How long will that take?', I enquired. 'It's all done by computer.' 'When your computer accepts my cheque, will I be reconnected?' 'No. Then we have to get the engineers. It's not a simple business.' 'It was simple enough to cut us off. How long will it take the engineers to put our number back into operation?' 'I don't know.' At this point I disconnected the BT office in Bristol, and rang the BT Press Office in London. They were wonderfully understanding, gentle and sympathetic. Within a couple of days, we were reconnected in the country, and in London, British Telecom engineers speedily returned to put the two new lines where they should have been all along. And now I really can't think why everybody hates British Telecom so much. Such charming people - if you know the right ones. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

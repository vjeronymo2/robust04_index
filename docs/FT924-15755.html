			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / TI makes Pounds 87m provisions for Dowty TI Group, the engineering and aerospace company, yesterday said it has set up provisions of Pounds 87.1m to cover integration costs and asset write-downs following the Pounds 525m acquisition of Dowty three months ago. The announcement was welcomed in the City where TI's acquisition accounting policies have been criticised in the past. The detailed breakdown and relatively modest level of fair value adjustments helped push TI's shares 12p higher to 282p. TI says it has found no significant surprises in a detailed review of Dowty's operations. The only changes since the bid was launched are that the aerospace business is likely to remain more depressed for longer and global economic recovery has receded further than anticipated. Mr Michael Garner, finance director, described the level of provisions as 'totally within our range of expectations'. More than half the provisions are cash items, rather than asset write-downs, and seen by the company as productive investment. TI's write-offs mean that net shareholders' funds will have increased by only Pounds 100m, to Pounds 345m, as a result of the acquisition in spite of the Pounds 525m price tag on Dowty. TI argues that this small increase is a result of building a knowledge and service-based business where assets such as the team of sales engineers are intangible. Gross shareholders' funds - a measure of the assets which includes goodwill  -rise from Pounds 715m to Pounds 1.23bn as a result of the Dowty acquisition. 'We are buying earnings streams, cash-flow streams and market position and only peripherally the hard edged assets represented by the Pounds 100m addition to shareholders funds after write-offs,' Mr Garner said. TI says its decision to take Dowty back to its old and well-respected international aerospace roots has been well received by its customers. Dowty has already taken a Pounds 25m write-off to cover closure of the Cognito paging business; the information technology business, another digression from Dowty's core aerospace business, has already been sold to Cray Electronics. TI confirmed that it believed the Dowty acquisition would not dilute earnings materially in 1993. Background, Page 28</p>

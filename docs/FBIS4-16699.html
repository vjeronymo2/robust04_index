			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Pentagon Asks Airmen in Iraq to </F> Be Less Aggressive"]    [Excerpts] The 26 people on board the two U.S. helicopters  downed by U.S. fighters over Northern Iraq probably died as the  result of a mistake by the fighter pilots or technical faults.  They were the victims of Washington's intransigent anti-Iraqi  policy.    The two Black Hawk helicopters with U.S., British, French,  and Turkish officers from the UN mission on board were flying to  a meeting with the Kurdish insurgent leader Salakhaddin when  they were shot down in broad daylight by two missiles fired from  the two F-15 fighters. [passage omitted]    The war against Iraq ended in 1991, but Washington's policy  toward Iraq remains warlike in tone and is marked by an  unconcealed hostility toward Baghdad. It is patently obvious  that the U.S. airmen, who were monitoring the safe haven in  northern Iraq which was created soon after the Persian Gulf  campaign to prevent Iraqi air raids on Kurdish camps, were  influenced by the mood of official Washington. It is no  coincidence that the Pentagon has issued several orders aimed at  "curbing the aggressiveness" of the U.S. airmen serving in the  safe havens in south and north Iraq and in Bosnia.</p>

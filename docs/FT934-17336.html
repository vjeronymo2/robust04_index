			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Observer: Shrink rapt Now we know; resisting Boris Yeltsin is sheer madness. So says a group of Russian psychiatrists, specialists at the Psychiatric Research Institute under the leadership of Viktor Khanykov. The shrinks publish their diagnosis of Yeltsin's parliamentary opponents on the front page of one of Moscow's best-selling dailies, Komsomolskaya Pravda. They say that each of the leaders of the besieged Russian parliament provides 'a clear illustration of psychopathic behaviour, with the predominance of hysterical and paranoid tendencies'. 'Long before the 'Yeltsin putsch' ', they charge, the opposition was out to stir up an atmosphere of suspicion, alarm and panic in the Supreme Soviet and throughout the land. The doctors go on to prescribe a course of therapy, although they admit that 'it is unlikely they will voluntarily submit themselves to treatment'. With people in such a state, both force and negotiation are utterly useless, they say. Instead, the authorities must 'sympathise with them' and gradually influence them by using calm persuasion and psychotherapy. The psychiatrists exhort that the new election laws have written into them the requirement that candidates take a psychological test and submit to a psychological examination - since 'for our country, sensible authorities are of the utmost importance'.</p>

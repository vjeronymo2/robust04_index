			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sets up Dollars 12m Angola oil facility BANKERS Trust has structured and arranged a Dollars 12m facility which provides protection against fluctuations in the price of crude oil for Sonangol UEE, Angola's national oil company. Sonangol has already drawn about 10 per cent of the one-year facility, which will finance the installation of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel so that two previously-drilled oil wells can be brought on stream. Bankers Trust has provided a hedge for about 2m barrels of crude oil. Mr Ted Giletti, managing director of Energy Merchant Bank, part of Bankers Trust, said the hedging mechanism was necessary because of the size of the facility relative to the projected oil flow rate. The two wells are situated in Block 4/26, an offshore oilfield off the coast of Angola. Block 4/26 is expected to produce between 7,000 b/d and 9,000 b/d and recoverable reserves are estimated at between 9m and 14m barrels. Since the mid-1980s, Angola has become the second-largest oil producer in sub-Sahara Africa, after Nigeria. Bankers Trust said that further development programmes are expected to boost Angola's crude oil production from current levels of 500,000 b/d to about 700,000 b/d by 1997.</p>

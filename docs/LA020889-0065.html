			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADOPTION AT SEA REVEALS THE SECRET LIFE OF OTTERS  </P> <P> It began as a chance encounter on a January morning last year, when marine  biologists heard the penetrating, distinctive screech of a baby sea otter  somewhere in a kelp bed just offshore near Monterey.  </P> <P> By the time it ended about three weeks later, however, scientists from the  Monterey Bay Aquarium had found evidence of something no one had previously  suspected: Under certain circumstances, the California sea otter makes an  excellent adoptive parent.  </P> <P> Of itself, this new observation -- described by a research biologist in a  scientific paper released by the aquarium this week -- is unlikely to affect  the future of the otter as a species or influence the political battle that has  grown up around attempts to keep the otter from extinction.  </P> <P> There are now thought to be a little more than 1,500 adult otters and about 220  pups in California waters, with the population showing modest increases each  year.  </P> <P> But to Marianne Riedman, the research biologist who reported the new findings,  the facility of the sea otter for adoptive parenting is an observation of  scientific note and emotional reassurance.  </P> <P> The Jan. 20 screeching in the kelp bed, Riedman said, was quickly investigated  by aquarium personnel. Using binoculars and a telescope, they observed a pup --  about 4 months old -- swimming about in desperation and hunger.  </P> <P> The pup's behavior quickly identified it as an orphan. It approached first one  female otter and then another, only to be rejected with a snarl by each -- what  was then thought to be normal otter behavior, Riedman said. At first, the  options appeared to be a human rescue or acceptance that the pup would die.  </P> <P> But then the pup swam up to an older female researchers had observed on and off  for at least four years. She had been caught once and given a distinctive tag  that identified her as Otter 203.  </P> <P> Otter 203 had given birth a few weeks earlier, the scientists thought, but  apparently had lost her pup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adaptation to Mothering  </P> <P> This chance circumstance was to save the orphaned pup. Apparently because her  hormonal system was still attuned to mothering, 203 quickly accepted her new  charge and treated the little one as her own.  </P> <P> They swam together in the vicinity of Lover's Point, near the aquarium on  Cannery Row. The pup nursed and 203 dove to bring back prey, adjusting her own  diet from mussels to kelp crabs and purple sea urchins -- an apparently  instinctive alteration of nutritional intake appropriate to nursing.  </P> <P> At one point, biologists netted both animals offshore to give each a health  check and tag the newly discovered pup, which turned out to be female and  somewhat underweight. She was given tag 555.  </P> <P> For three weeks, the observation continued. The last sighting, Riedman said,  was on Feb. 4 of last year, when pup 555 was seen nursing just after 5 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Does This Happen Often?  </P> <P> Riedman, for one, thinks such adoptions occur more frequently than scientists  have realized. "I think female otters are probably primed to take care of  orphans after they've given birth and if they have lost their pups."  </P> <P> Granted, the odds are long. An orphaned pup would have to be in a section of  the open ocean, and would have to encounter a female otter who had recently  lost her young, all in a period of days before the pup died of starvation.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Riedman said, the bond between 203 and the pup 555 ended sadly.  Four days after the two were last observed, the pup was found dead, washed up  on Monterey State Beach. An autopsy was inconclusive, but Riedman speculated  the pup may have gotten separated from 203 and been unable to find enough food.  </P> <P> Then, about four months later, 203 died -- apparently the victim of the effects  of old age. She was about 15 -- old enough in otter years to be her adoptive  pup's grandmother.  </P></p>

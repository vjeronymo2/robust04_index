			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LENDL NAMED 1990 WORLD CHAMP  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl scored a surprise victory over Stefan Edberg today when the  International Tennis Federation named him its men's world champion for 1990.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf was named women's world champion for the fourth year in a row.  </P> <P> Although Edberg ends the year as world-ranked No. 1, the ITF said it gave the  title to Lendl, who is ranked third, because of his consistent form in the four  Grand Slam tournaments.  </P> <P> The Swede's first-round loss in the Grand Slam Cup last week also weighed  against him, the ITF said.  </P> <P> Both players matched each other for Grand Slam triumphs, Lendl taking the  Australian Open title and Edberg winning at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> But the ITF nominating panel of former champions Fred Perry, Frank Sedgeman and  Tony Trabert, said Lendl, who missed the French Open to concentrate on  preparing on grass for Wimbledon, was more consistent overall.  </P> <P> He won 16 matches in three Grand Slam events while Edberg won 13 in four.  Although Edberg finished second in Australia, he was beaten in the first round  at both the French and U.S. Opens.  </P></p>

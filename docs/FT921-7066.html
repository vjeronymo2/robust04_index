			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European side limits fall at Low &amp; Bonar to 4% LOW &amp; BONAR yesterday announced a slight fall in profits and a maintained dividend, as UK and North American operations were affected by recession. The Dundee-based packaging and plastics company reported a 4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.3m for the year to November 30. Turnover dipped to Pounds 307.7m (Pounds 310.9m). Mr Roland Jarvis, managing director, said that most divisions performed well in the second half. Cost-cutting, still underway, and investment in capacity should allow 'reasonable' profits growth this year, he said. Operations in continental Europe, started in 1985, lifted profits and margins. The Continent accounted for 32 per cent of total operating profits, up from 27.8 per cent last time. European margins improved to 11.2 per cent (10.8 per cent) and both Germany and Belgium remained strong. Directors are recommending a final dividend of 6.4p for an unchanged total of 9.1p. Earnings per share fell to 18.82p (19.71p), partly reflecting a higher tax charge. In the UK, operating profits from packaging fell slightly to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 7.9m), due to declines in the retail bag market. But specialist materials, which includes Flotex floor coverings, maintained operating profits at Pounds 3.7m. The company is looking at three acquisitions on the Continent. Net borrowings have fallen to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 14.3m) while gearing has dropped to 10.2 per cent. The shares yesterday rose 8p to 259p. COMMENT These are respectable figures from Low &amp; Bonar, which is coping with recession through cost-cutting and improved margins. The company's forecast of a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits this year assumes no increase in sales, which augurs well for when the economic upturn arrives in the US and the UK. But after rising nearly 30 per cent in the last 12 months, partly in sympathy with the rest of the sector, the shares are no longer cheap. James Capel, the stockbroker, has increased its forecast for this year to Pounds 26.5m pre-tax, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 12.8. Given the company's history of false dawns, investors would be forgiven for waiting for another set of results before giving it the re-rating it believes it deserves.</p>

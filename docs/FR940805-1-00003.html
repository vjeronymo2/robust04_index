			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Send questions or comments regarding these burdens or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA is proposing several amendments to pre-loan regulations affecting both insured and guaranteed loans. These amendments are intended to enhance the delivery of customer service by facilitating the application process for borrowers, and reducing administrative costs to the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Loan Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first of the proposed amendments would lengthen the allowable loan period to 4 years for both insured and guaranteed loans for the construction of distribution and transmission facilities and for improvements to generation facilities. The loan period, sometimes referred to as the financing period, means the period of time during which the facilities included in a loan application will be constructed. Currently loans to distribution borrowers are limited to a 2 year loan period, and loans to power supply borrowers are limited to a 3 year period. Some borrowers must apply for loans every 2 or 3 years in order to meet their financing needs. REA believes that allowing a longer loan period will, in the long run, significantly reduce loan application costs to Agency customers, including REA borrowers and supplemental lenders, as well as loan processing costs to the Government. Borrowers would still have the option of applying for loans for a shorter period, if they so desire, and REA reserves the right to limit loans to a period of less than 4 years under certain circumstances (&sect;1710.106).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To accomplish this policy change, REA is proposing to amend the definition of ``loan period'' (&sect;&sect;1710.2 and 1710.106) and the construction period required to be covered by the borrower's REA construction work plan (&sect;1710.251). On December 20, 1993, at 58 FR 66260, REA published a rule setting forth policies and procedures for municipal rate loans pursuant to the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993. This regulation at 7 CFR 1714.6(a)(2) allows not more than 6 advances of funds on any municipal rate loans. To provide flexibility to borrowers, REA proposes increasing this number to 8 advances if the loan period is longer than 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conjunction with lengthening the allowable loan period, REA proposes amendments to the requirements for automatic termination of the Government's obligation to advance funds from insured loans. Current regulations at 7 CFR 1785 subpart A, provide that funds from insured loans approved on or after June 1, 1984, may be advanced for a period of no more than 4 years from the date of the loan contract as amended unless the borrower applies for, and the Administrator approves an extension of the Government's obligation. Subpart A of part 1785 was originally published May 29, 1984, at 49 FR 22266. As stated in its preamble, the rule was intended to help assure that REA's loan funds are used effectively and efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allow borrowers to complete construction projects based on a loan period of more than 2 years, REA proposes, in &sect;1714.56, that funds from insured loans approved on or after the effective date of the rule proposed today may be advanced for a period of 1 year longer than the loan period, provided that the fund advance period may not be shorter than 4 years. For example, if the loan period is 2 or 3 years, the period during which funds may be advanced would terminate after 4 years; if the loan period is 4 years, the fund advance period would terminate after 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide borrowers with a fixed date for automatic termination, REA is proposing that the date of the automatic termination be computed from the date of the loan note, rather than the date of the loan contract. On April 7, 1993, at 58 FR 18043, REA published a proposed amendment to part 1785 that would, in effect, redesignate 7 CFR 1785 subpart A as 7 CFR 1785 subpart F. Since automatic termination of insured electric loans is more closely related to the subject matter of part 1714 than of part 1785, REA has determined that setting out the requirements in detail in part 1714 would better serve the public. It is, therefore, proposed that existing subpart A (proposed subpart F) of part 1785 be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Supplemental Financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

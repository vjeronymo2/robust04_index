The  deputy prime minister said that the BN would monitor every move  of the Sabah Government to ensure there would be no malpractices  and deviation.    "If there is any sign of victimisation of any ethnic group  or  community, we will fight all out," he told reporters after  presenting books on Islam to 15 Muslim organisations at the  Tabung Haji headquarters before the breaking of fast. Anwar, who  is UMNO [United Malays National Organization] deputy president,  said that the increase in the number of seats won by the BN in  Sabah two days ago compared to those during the 1990 elections  was clear proof that the BN strength in Sabah could not be  belittled.    Thanking all the voters and workers who had supported the BN  during the elections, Anwar said that he was moved by the strong  support from the people in Sabah for UMNO. Anwar had spearheaded  the BN's campaign in the elections. PBS [Parti Bersatu Sabah or  Sabah United Party] won 25 seats to BN's 23 to secure a simple  majority in the 48 seat State Legislative Assembly. "With this,  the suggestion that certain leaders like Tun Mustapha would  obstruct the emergence of UMNO was baseless," he said.    He said the results of the elections also showed that  Muslims  and the bumiputeras [indigeneous races] in Sabah rejected  leaders who did not support the BN. "I would like to thank the  people as in evaluating the results of the elections, it is  clear that non-Muslim bumiputeras, Kadazan Christians from  certain areas as well as the Chinese also gave their support to  the BN," he added. He said the BN could not penetrate remote  areas and the influence of the Kadazan Christians because of the  propaganda and the strong enmity instilled in the people.  "However, our early achievement proves that UMNO and BN have the  support of part of the people of Sabah," he said.    He called on the Parti Bersatu Sabah Government to stop its  divide-and-rule politics and concentrate on helping the poor who  had been neglected.    Asked how the results would influence the BN role in Sabah,  Anwar said that the BN achievement in the elections was  extraordinary. "If the elections were held one or two weeks  later, the results could have been different," he said. Asked  whether he would describe the BN achievement in the elections as  beyond expectation, Anwar said in any election, the BN would  certainly want to win.    "Looking at the results in 1990 and those of 1994, it is  extraordinary. It was the first time the BN was seen as having  contested in the real sense of the word," he said.    Anwar later met Sabah BN representatives. They are scheduled  to meet Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed tomorrow.  At the meeting with Sabah BN Assemblymen at the Legend Hotel  here, Anwar said that the Sabah BN would uphold the principles  of democracy and not resort to the tactics adopted by former  Sabah chief minister Tun Datu Mustapa Datu Harun in 1985. He  said the BN would face PBS as a responsible opposition.    Twenty-two of the 23 assemblymen who won in the elections  were present. Also present were Selangor Menteri Besar [Chief  Minister] and UMNO Vice President Tan Sri Mohamed Mohamed Taib,  Gaya MP Philip Yong, Tawau MP Geoffrey Yee, and Pensiangan MP  Taimin Lumaing.    In his speech earlier, Anwar called on Islamic bodies and  scholars to initiate the translation of more Islamic books of  high quality into Bahasa Malaysia. He hoped to see at least 100  of such books translated in two years.    In Johor Baru, UMNO Vice President Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin  said today the BN, particularly UMNO had scored a moral victory  in the elections despite losing out narrowly to PBS. He said  despite its infancy in Sabah, UMNO did better than expected.</p>

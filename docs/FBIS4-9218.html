			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO--Former Czechoslovakian  Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said Friday [22 April] he is  opposed to giving Russia a membership to the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) as a  factor that could threaten European security.    "We cannot add a (politically) unstable country to (those  multi-national organizations)," Dienstbier said in an interview  with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Russia, if it becomes a member of those organizations, will  not work as reinforcing security in Europe, but rather will  become a disturbing factor, he said.    Dienstbier is in Japan to attend a symposium cosponsored by  the United Nations University and a non-governmental  organization.    Pointing out that there is danger of a revival of a policy  favoring great powers in Russia, the Czech Republic will  continue monitoring movements toward democracy under the regime  of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became  independent  states with the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia  Federation in January 1993 following the collapse of the former  Soviet Union in 1991.    The former Warsaw Pact nations led by the former Soviet  Union  invaded the Czechoslovakian capital of Prague in 1968 to crush a  reform movement there.    In August 1993, Yeltsin flew to Prague, now the Czech  capital, to sign friendship treaties with Czech and Slovak  counterparts, but neither of treaty includes a direct apology  for the 1968 invasion.    Dienstbier served as foreign minister for the former  Czechoslovakia from December 1989 to June 1992.    He said the republic will keep a close watch on how Russia  will establish relations with other former Soviet republics as a  test case to see its policy toward the middle European nations.    On Czech politics, he predicted that people will voice  opposition to the present government led by Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus in the expected election of the upper senate  chamber within this year.    On relations with the Slovak Republic, he said it is  possible  for the two republics to unite again in line with expansion of a  unification of European nations.</p>

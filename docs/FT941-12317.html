			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: Aiming low Granada is resorting to some hard-hitting copy in its battle to take control of LWT. Its latest circular contains '10 facts LWT would rather you didn't know. . . '. That's the kind of editorial trick Kelvin Mackenzie used to pull when he was editing The Sun, Britain's raciest daily tabloid. Come to think of it isn't Mackenzie in the Granada camp these days by virtue of his new job managing British Sky Broadcasting, partly-owned by Granada? Granada insists that the 10 facts about LWT were all its own work and not a straight lift from The Sun's editorial style book. Fortunately for LWT, Granada's knocking copy is bound by the rules of the Takeover Panel rather than the Press Complaints Commission.</p>

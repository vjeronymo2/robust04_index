			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Industry warned on foreign rivals A research centre to help industries close performance gaps with foreign companies was launched yesterday by Cardiff Business School. Professor Daniel Jones, director, warned that most UK companies must at least double productivity and sharply improve quality if they are to survive against competition, particularly from from south-east Asia. The centre and partners Andersen Consulting have embarked on a benchmarking exercise between 75 UK and Japanese companies following a similar exercise which compared the UK and Japanese motor components industries. That found Japanese companies on average to be twice as productive as UK counterparts, and 100 times better on quality.</p>

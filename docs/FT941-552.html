			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels challenges Bonn over telecoms The European Commission has increased pressure on Bonn to stop dealing bilaterally with the US on the opening of the German telecommunications market, by formally challenging Germany's legal compliance with the EU's directive on public procurement. The challenge is spelled out in a letter sent last week to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the trade and internal market commissioners. The letter questions whether the four-year-old directive has been fully enacted in German law and asks Mr Rexrodt for swift clarification. Brussels officials said that if they received no satisfactory reply by early next month, they would consider starting legal action against Germany for failure to meet EU obligations. Economics ministry officials in Bonn said they hoped to settle amicably their differences with the commission. These were sparked when the US dropped trade sanctions against Germany last month, after Bonn indicated it would not apply Article 29 of the EU public procurement directive. This gives European bidders for public contracts a 3 per cent price preference and allows tenders with less than 50 per cent local content to be ignored. The US and Germany say the directive is overridden by a 1954 'friendship agreement' between them. but Brussels suspects Washington of using the issue to undermine EU cohesion. The Commission's tougher stance coincides with growing signs that the fate of separate US and EU negotiations on liberalising public procurement may hinge on talks at next month's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh. Though talks in Washington last week achieved some progress, stalemate persists over EU demands that the US repeal Buy American laws in exchange for opening European telecommunications and power equipment markets fully to US bidders. Nonetheless, there appears to be growing optimism in Brussels that the EU has wrested the initiative in the negotiations - and some useful concessions  -from the US, where trade officials sound increasingly defensive. Among the concessions is an offer by Washington to raise from 24 to 36 the number of states ready to open public procurement to international competition. 'The EU has been waging this continued attack on the whole range of US preference programmes,' a US trade negotiator said yesterday. EU confidence has also been buoyed by US acceptance of a recent jointly-commissioned study by consultants Touche Ross. It found, contrary to earlier US claims, that the dollar value of the two sides' offers to liberalise procurement markets is broadly in balance. The bilateral talks are due to resume in Brussels next week.</p>

The agreement was reached at a meeting of six  representatives from the two parties on legislation of an  omnibus election law.    Under the agreement, the presidential election will be held  on the first Thursday from 70 days before the expiration of the  term for the incumbent president.    The general elections and elections for local autonomous  legislature and for chiefs of local governing bodies will be  held on the first Thursday from 50 days before the expiration of  the incumbents.    According to current laws, elections for local autonomous  legislature and chiefs of local autonomous administrations  should be carried out between Feb. 27, 1995 and May 21, 1995.

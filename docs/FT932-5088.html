			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines on profit-taking POSITION adjustment ahead of the weekend, institutional profit-taking and arbitrage selling weighed on the market. The Nikkei average fell below the 21,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed down 193.76 at 20,882.24, barely changed on the week, after arbitrage buying had pushed it to a day's high of 21,222.77 in the morning session. But late profit-taking and index-linked selling depressed prices to a low of 20,841.68. Volume totaled 564m shares against 609m. Losers led gainers by 565 to 471 with 155 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell for the first time in four trading days, losing 4.43 to 1,671.70; in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.64 to 1271.21. Traders noted light buying of steel issues by foreign investors. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y5 to Y411, while NKK gained Y2 to Y340. Tokyo Steel rose Y180 to Y2,840 on reports of a rise in steel bar prices. Electrical issues, which gained prominence recently on buying by US pension funds, lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y15 to Y796 and NEC lost Y20 to Y1,040. Ricoh rose for the fourth consecutive day, gaining Y20 to Y821, a new high for the year. Investors were encouraged by the company's development of a digital copy and facsimile machine which can also be connected to personal computers. Reports that some industrialists were in favour of redenominating the yen to boost the economy, helped printing companies and paper and pulp makers. Sakata Inx, a printing ink manufacturer, advanced Y48 to Y798 and Tokai Pulp rose Y20 to Y740. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 2.99 to 23,372.23 in volume of 33.3m shares. Roundup ACTIVITY was generally muted among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG found no support from the talks between Britain and China on the new airport, which ended inconclusively. However, the Hang Seng index recovered from early losses late in the session to close up 2.20 at 7,157.49, down 3.2 per cent on the week. Turnover declined to HKDollars 4.65bn compared with Thursday's HKDollars 5.15bn. Among the actives Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 27.50 while its affiliate Hutchison, the day's most active stock, saw shares worth HKDollars 226.4m traded, but closed unchanged at HKDollars 20.90. HSBC Holdings fell 50 cents to HKDollars 72.00. TAIWAN was supported by activity in newly listed stocks as the weighted index rose 48.77 to 4,391.50, a week's gain of 0.8 per cent. Turnover climbed to TDollars 24.3bn from Thursday's TDollars 16.8bn. Plastic, construction and electrical sectors were the biggest gainers on the day. Among newly listed stocks BES Engineering rose by the daily permissible limit of almost 7 per cent, up TDollars 3.00 at TDollars 50.50. SEOUL eased on profit-taking, the composite index shedding 3.0 to 760.15, a 3.1 per cent rise on the week, in turnover of Won1,130bn. There was some selling of car groups, with Ssangyong Motor off Won400 at Won15,500 and Asia Motors down Won500 at Won16,800. SINGAPORE ended 1.8 per cent lower on the week, the Straits Times Industrial closing 1.40 higher at 1,870.88. AUSTRALIA's golds stood out in an otherwise flat market, the sub-index rising 28.6 to 1,866.3 as the All Ordinaries closed unchanged at 1,741.0, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index advanced to its highest level in almost three years at 1,656.53, up 7.02 on the day but only 0.4 per cent on the week. BOMBAY rose sharply in new account trade. In trading restricted to one hour by an impending lunar eclipse, the BSE index rose 83.24 to 2,336.62, up 7.9 per cent on the week.</p>

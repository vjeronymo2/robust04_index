			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Riding the rails past the ruins of Russia: First it was the nobility, then the party bosses. Today, western tourists are the priviligentsia ENSCONCED in their berths of polished mahogany and brass, lounging in the bar, or snuffling up delicacies in one of three decorated dining cars, the new priviligentsia stared out at the bleak Russian landscape. Towns and villages presented the same derelict face: cracked apartment blocks and crumbling factories, roads rutted and strewn with abandoned concrete piles and coils of rusty wire. Only the painted wooden cottages inside their picket fences revealed these places to be habitations of human beings. At each halt, through windows locked shut for security, the travellers met the gazes of the disinherited proletariat on the platform outside. Children waved, the adults merely stared. Their stares conveyed nothing, neither amusement, wonder nor resentment. Once, it was the languid aristocracy who travelled like this, commuting between their palaces in St Petersburg or Moscow and their country estates. Then came the bureaucracy, the peasant-workers of the politburo, preaching sacrifice in public but pampering themselves in private. Now, it is the turn of the foreign capitalist plutocracy, bearing bundles of the only commodity of value in Russia today: US dollars. The Bolshoi Express is half a mile of luxurious rolling stock built during the 1950s to trundle senior apparatchiks round the Soviet empire for their urgent meeting-and-drinking engagements. Krushchev probably slept here. The train has been assembled as a private joint venture by astute freelancing servants of the Russian railway and a British tour operator. Its itinerary could be described in various ways: as a romantic ride through history, from St Petersburg on the Baltic to Tashkent in central Asia, from one end of the tsars' empire to the other; or as an expensive way to smuggle free-spending westerners safely through a collapsing country. On the second night in St Petersburg, passengers on the inaugural run were bussed (no walking after dark) to the Shuvalov palace on Nevsky Prospekt for a reception and banquet under chandeliers. Champanski, wine and vodka flowed and a plump coloratura from the Kirov sang Tchaikovsky love songs. But for the guests' couture clothes and county accents, it might have been a routine communist bacchanal. Later, at the five-star Hotel Astoria, reality intruded. Two men - one young, one old, both drunk - lurched in off the street and made for the bar. 'I say, you're drunk,' observed an Englishman, who was pretty drunk himself. The young man replied by opening his jacket, pulling a gun from his waist-band and pointing it at his interlocutor's midriff. 'What's that for? Put it away,' expostulated the Englishman. The old man intervened, motioning to the other to comply. 'Is for my son protection,' he explained, thickly. 'He is security man. Afghan veteran.' Russia is an 'emerging destination' according to the suave Old Etonian responsible for piloting this first cargo safely through the criminal shoals. Moscow Life, an English-language sheet, was more explicit. 'It's heartening to report that fewer crimes have been committed against foreign nationals in Moscow,' it said. 'All sizeable criminal syndicates are pre-occupied with sorting out relations between themselves.' It went on to itemise the haul of weapons in recent traffic checks in the city: 'Over 40 sub-machine guns, three grenade launchers and 17 hand grenades, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition and 11 home-made bombs.' Bussed hither and thither to museums, palaces and churches, dropped briefly at photographic vantage points chosen for them by their guide, the passengers of the Bolshoi Express were shielded from the worst. Unless they struck out on their own, they were unlikely to encounter anything more alarming than a few begging urchins and gipsies. Yes, Russia is an emerging destination. Recently, a South African paper manufacturer took 400 prospective clients on a wining and dining weekend to St Petersburg, a city with a freeze-dried, classical face now rotting away like an old crone's behind her face powder. Among the principal attractions of this tour were two dozen security guards supplied by Group 4, a British company which, some months ago, won a contract to escort prisoners in the UK  -and promptly lost several. A complete reversal of values has taken place. Visitors to the Soviet Union in the bad old days were, of course, permitted to see the Hermitage museum in Leningrad and the Kremlin churches in Moscow. But their Intourist guides discouraged too heartfelt an admiration of the past. ('What is that church over there?' 'Is not church. Is museum of atheism'). Instead, they were invited to applaud health institutes, nursery schools, war memorials and palaces of culture. Privileged visitors were taken to locomotive works, power stations and collective farms - champions of socialist emulation - where they were smothered in statistics before being sat down to a gargantuan banquet. 'To peace]' the party cadres would cry, their eyes moist with sentiment and vodka. 'To peace and brotherhood]' But movement was restricted severely and there were no plugs in the hotel basins. Today, there are mixer taps and bathrobes in the foreigners' hotels and the Intourist guides have gone freelance. There is no more talk of housing starts and irrigation schemes, only of tsars. Teenagers are free to skateboard in front of the Winter Palace, the frozen baby mammoth is on a fund-raising tour of the US, and the tourist is free to travel where he will  -or dares. The band played as the party embarked on the train. A girl with a pale, Mongol face looked out from the adjacent train and turned quickly away. The champagne was broken out, the steam locomotive admired, the whistle blew and everyone went to dress for dinner. 'In the evening,' the dress code said, 'gentlemen are requested to wear jackets and ties for dinner, although black tie is not necessary.' There were fresh flowers in each sleeping compartment and a Daily Telegraph map of the former Soviet Union; in the carpeted lavatories, copies of The Spectator, Vanity Fair and Hello] magazine. Dinner was announced and the party assembled, as elegant and out-of-place as Agatha Christie's characters in Death on the Nile. The girlish blue eyes of the Historical Novelist had been left undimmed by the sight of sweating heaps of humanity at the railway station. The Tax Exile appeared, nattily-dressed as ever, and coolly oblivious of the poverty he had seen. Their friend, the Belgravia Doctor, drank the night away with nary a glance at the world outside the window. The solitary figure reputed to be The Man From The Times clung close to his fellows: knowledgeable about the past, he seemed strangely bewildered by the present. The Rugby Player - apparently some sort of businessman - grunted laconically. The Prawn King from Tyneside retained his Geordie humour throughout - until he was mugged by gipsy children on his way home through Moscow. The Ballerina added a final touch of other-worldliness. Natalia Makarova, former prima ballerina of the Kirov, had been invited to join the train along with her Lebanese-American businessman husband and their 15-year-old son, Andrusha. She was followed at every step by a BBC cameraman, a producer-director and a girl with a clipboard, while she packed and unpacked, ate and drank, and talked about how it felt to revisit the country from which she absconded in 1970. The fare-paying passengers thus found themselves unwilling extras in a three-dimensional travelogue: looking at themselves being filmed looking at Makarova while she looked at Russia. If the ballerina was shocked by what she saw, her companions were more shocked by what they had to pay. The Soviet Union was never cheap for westerners, if only because of an artificially inflated rate of exchange which demanded sterling-rouble parity. In each city where foreigners were permitted, there was a hard-currency hotel and bar. Today the rouble, debauched by Russia's central bank, is worth about a 10th of one American cent. Soviet citizens formerly had money to spend but nothing much to spend it on. Thanks to the black market racketeers, they can now buy most things - even bananas - but they cannot afford them. In the two-tier economy that has emerged, foreigners must pay international prices if they wish to inhabit the first tier. One couple from the Bolshoi Express, more enterprising than the rest, discovered the remnants of the rouble economy and managed a day-long excursion into the countryside on 260 roubles (about 25p). The others gagged when offered chips at the Slavjanskaya, a business hotel in Moscow, for Dollars 6 a plate. 'But that's a teacher's weekly wage here]' they protested. A young woman in one of the new private-sector souvenir shops admitted that she earned in three days what it had taken her a month to earn before as a teacher. Standing before rows of matrioshka dolls - the population of which has exploded - she confessed that her sights were raised higher still. 'I would like a foreign husband,' she said, gaily. Wasn't she married? 'Yes. But no good,' she laughed. In the scramble for dollars, everyone has to be on the make. Military bandsmen go busking and children play truant from school to wheedle dollars at the places where the coaches stop. Books bought for roubles in the shops during the week go on sale on the street for dollars at the weekend. Every trader is paying protection money to someone. The 'protectors' are identified easily: they wear expensive and flashy clothes and lounge on street corners with mobile telephones to their ears. They also control the prostitutes who now haunt the foreigners' hotels routinely. A couple of listless teenagers with dyed-blonde hair and leather mini-skirts sat in the bar of the Astoria, watching a television game show called First Love. It was a pygmy version of Blind Date in which precocious munchkins (some of them also wearing mini-skirts) won prizes and applause for cute comments about pre-teen romance. The Bolshoi Express chugged southwards. The Old Etonian began to breathe more easily: his Russian barman had been persuaded to serve gin and tonics in one glass instead of two, the passengers had begun to form into discrete gossip groups and were, happily, looking out their desert wardrobes. At Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, where Hitler suffered his first defeat at the hands of the Red Army in the battle that changed the course of the second world war, this passenger turned for home. The local airport is a rickety affair standing above the monstrous, grey city. The woman behind the counter pulled a face. 'Moscow?' she said. 'Flight is full up.' Shown a ticket, booked and confirmed, she smiled, pityingly. At that moment, two preppy young Americans came bounding into the foreigners' lounge. They joked in fluent Russian with the clerk, who seemed to know them. They were officials of the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, going home on leave after long months privatising the city of Volgograd. 'Don't worry,' they advised. 'She always says that.' The woman pretended to make a telephone call, shuffled some papers, stamped the ticket, looked up and said boldly: 'One dollar.' It was the final squeeze.                            *      *      * THE Bolshoi Express runs from St Petersburg to Tashkent, and vice versa, stopping at Moscow, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Urgench (for Khiva), Bokhara and Samarkand.

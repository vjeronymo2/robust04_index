			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Building societies Yesterday's UK Treasury document on building societies smacks of regulatory capture. Though the aim is to solicit opinion about future regulation, the tone suggests support for further liberalisation with only token gestures on accountability. The paper is quick to point, for example, to the need to bar 'obstructive' member-nominated directors. Doubtless society boards would like freedom without more responsibility, but one must also ask why the debate about deregulation has arisen in the first place. The market in which societies operate is no longer just concerned with housing finance. What was once their main activity has been subsumed into a broader retail financial services industry in which the societies compete with banks. In the interest of fair competition it would make sense for all players to come under the same regulatory framework. That might involve lifting restrictions on building societies, so that they can make syndicated loans to housing associations. But it then becomes hard to justify a corporate structure which exempts them from paying dividends to their owners and makes them almost immune to outside takeover. One step towards improved accountability would be to require society boards to be elected by a general meeting with members' votes weighted by size of deposit and length of association. Another would be to insist that hostile takeovers are communicated to members immediately, not simply 'at the next general meeting' as the government is proposing. Alliance &amp; Leicester already owns a bank. It would be unsatisfactory if Lloyds Bank proved with its bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester that banks are in effect barred from owning a society.</p>

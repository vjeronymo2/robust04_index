			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  National Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong) called a  press conference in Seoul on February 2 and demanded that the  "government" punish those who walked away demonstrators against  agricultural market opening on February 1 and compensate to  them, according to a radio report from Seoul.    Recalling that the indiscreet crackdown upon the peaceful  demonstrators by the combat police touched off the anger of  peasants and students and led them to counterattack, Chonnong  said the puppet government authorities were to blame for the  collision in the demonstration of peasants and students against  the agricultural market opening.    Chonnong warned that if the authorities countered a future  demonstration of peasants by force, it would respond with a  corresponding stiff struggle.</p>

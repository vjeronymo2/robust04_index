			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Indira Dunayeva, under the "Party Movement" </F> rubric: "Economic Freedom Party Congress Held. Borovoy and  Comrades Keep Secrets"]    [Text] The Economic Freedom Party [PES] yesterday held a  congress at which it evaluated the results of party activity,  above all its participation in the parliamentary elections.  Journalists were not allowed to attend the congress, but, as an  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told the day before the  congress, changes in party leadership were to be made there:  Instead of Konstantin Borovoy, its cochairmen would be Arkadiy  Ankovskiy (Novosibirsk), Leonid Nekrasov (Yekaterinburg), and  Oleg Tarasenko (Lipetsk). The party's general secretary (State  Duma deputy Irina Khakamada) intended to become a cochairwoman  with special status--the work of the general secretary involves  material liability, and because of her status as a deputy,  Khakamada cannot perform it. Ms. Khakamada, who was elected to  the Duma as an independent deputy, thinks that she should have  full independence as party cochairwoman.    As Irina Khakamada told a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent,  "Konstantin Borovoy at the congress declared the need for stiff  opposition to the president and the government, but I, as an  independent candidate, am interested in constructive dialogue  and not political squabbling." Khakamada stated that while  working in parliament she would maintain close contacts with  regional divisions of the PES and lobby for draft laws needed by  Russian entrepreneurs, but she would have nothing to do with the  political statements of the party leadership. In her opinion,  the party must work more with regional divisions and not get  involved with the individual declarations of its leader.    The Yekaterinburg division of PES issued a statement in  which  responsibility for the party's loss in the parliamentary  elections was placed largely on the party leadership.</p>

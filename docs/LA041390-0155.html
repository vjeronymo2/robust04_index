			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $8.9-MILLION LOSS BY KARCHER BLAMED ON LAG IN PHOENIX  </P> <P> Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said Thursday that it lost $8.9 million in the  fourth quarter largely due to the establishment of a reserve to pay for the  restructuring of its struggling Arizona operations.  </P> <P> The company set aside $14.5 million in the three-month period ended Jan. 29 for  the restructuring, which could involve the sale, closing or franchising of its  40 Carl's Jr. outlets in Arizona.  </P> <P> "It has become apparent that the Arizona market does not make economic sense  for corporate operations," said Donald F. Karcher, the company's president and  chief operating officer. "The future investment required would be prohibitive  in view of the expected return."  </P> <P> The fourth-quarter loss on revenues of $118 million compared to net earnings of  $4.2 million on revenues of $111.3 million for the same period a year ago. For  the year, the company's earnings slumped to $5.6 million on revenues of $511.3  million from $20.8 million on revenues of $445.9 million a year ago.  </P> <P> Company officials attributed the fourth-quarter loss to the soft Arizona  economy, which is depressed because of a real estate slump and failure of many  local financial institutions. The firm also cited strong competition,  discounting and higher food prices as contributors.  </P> <P> Karcher, which entered the Arizona market in 1983, said that operations in  Arizona, particularly in the Phoenix area, have been a drain on earnings. The  fast-food firm estimated that it lost $5 million in the state last year.  </P> <P> Karcher said the company wants to redirect into stronger markets, which include  California, Nevada and Oregon. The company is also trying to expand its  international presence with restaurants in Japan and those planned for western  Canada and Asia.  </P> <P> "We will now focus our resources on our other proven markets," Karcher said in  a prepared statement.  </P> <P> The company's stock closed at $9, down 25 cents in trading Thursday on the New  York Stock Exchange. But industry analysts viewed Karcher's decision to  reorganize, and possibly abandon Arizona, as a good one.  </P> <P> Steven A. Rockwell, a fast-food industry analyst for Alexander Brown and Sons  in Baltimore, said the company was sound but was not willing to withstand  losses for several years in a depressed market.  </P> <P> "Carl's just said, 'enough is enough.' "  </P> <P> Karcher officials said the chain, which has 553 company-owned and franchised  restaurants that carry its distinctive Happy Star logo, has faced a series of  obstacles ever since entering the Phoenix market.  </P> <P> Robert W. Wisely, Karcher's group vice president for marketing, said that some  of the best locations and opportunities for reasonably priced leases had been  grabbed by competitors by the time the first Carl's Jr. restaurants were being  established in Phoenix.  </P> <P> In the less-developed Tucson market, however, Karcher has prospered enough that  it was able to buy out eight former Wendy's locations to give it a total of 14  Carl's Jr. stores. Wisely said that the restaurants in Tucson, which is viewed  as a separate media market from Phoenix and is not as sprawling, have  approached an average of $19,000 in weekly sales, compared to $23,000 in the  average Carl's Jr. restaurant in California.  </P> <P> Though the market remains lucrative, Wisely said that the Tucson operations  would become too unwieldy to manage from afar if the Phoenix restaurants are  sold off or franchised. A Flagstaff outlet is already franchised.  </P> <P> Despite the financial problems in Arizona, Loren Pannier, Karcher's chief  financial officer, said the company is still growth-minded in its proven  markets but is "taking a more cautious approach" in its expansion plans.  </P> <P> He said the company opened 52 restaurants in the previous fiscal year but is  scaling down its expansion to 30 company-owned stores in the present year, with  another 15 being introduced by franchisees.  </P> <P> "You can see we had a disappointment on the earnings side," he said in  explaining the slowdown in expansion. "You want to grow on the revenue side,  but you must bring more to the bottom line."  </P> <P> KARCHER ENTERPRISES RESULTS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> In millions of dollars  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 511.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 445.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 118.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 111.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Profit (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (8.9)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Fiscal year ends Jan. 29, 1990  </P> <P> EMPLOYEES: 15,110 restaurant workers and 650 in the executive office.  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS: 553 company and franchise units, including 30 opened last year.  </P> <P> LOCATIONS: 233 units in Southern California, 144 in Northern California and 29  in Arizona.*  </P> <P> AVG.

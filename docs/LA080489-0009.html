			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The Miramar Naval Air Station has extended its airfield hours past the normal  midnight curfew to accommodate extra nighttime training, the Navy reported  Thursday.  </P> <P> Squadrons of E-2 Sea Hawkeyes and F-14 Tomcats last week began a refresher  course in nighttime maneuvers such as takeoffs and landings, said Chief Petty  Officer Bobbie Carleton. Because of the large number of air crews and aircraft  involved, the training sessions are ending as late as 2 or 3 a.m., Carleton  said.  </P> <P> Daylight savings time also pushes back the start time for the training  sessions, Carleton said. The late night training is expected to continue until  Aug. 17.  </P></p>

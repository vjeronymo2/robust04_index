			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALENCIA ROUTS FULLERTON IN BATTLE OF THE UNBEATEN  </P> <P> Both Valencia and Fullerton high schools came into Friday night's game  undefeated, but the suspense came out of the game in a hurry.  </P> <P> Valencia's Ryan Roskelly took the opening kickoff back 71 yards, setting up  quarterback Marc O'Brien's four-yard touchdown run. Valencia scored on its  first four possessions en route to a 35-0 rout at Bradford Stadium.  </P> <P> "We're fortunate that we've got a lot of backs that can run and some linemen  who can block," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said.  </P> <P> Valencia (5-0) has outscored its opponents, 185-31, this season.  </P> <P> O'Brien moved Valencia 91 yards in 12 plays on its second drive of the first  quarter, then he capped the march with a one-yard scoring plunge over the  middle.  </P> <P> It took O'Brien six plays to find the end zone again after Valencia's Dave  Sanchez intercepted a Daniel Chacon pass at the Fullerton 32-yard line. O'Brien  scored his third touchdown of the night on a three-yard sneak with 9 minutes 56  seconds left in the first half.  </P> <P> Then it was Roskelly's turn. With 5:23 left in the half, the junior tailback  went around left end 22 yards for a touchdown and a 28-0 Valencia lead.  </P> <P> Roskelly finished the scoring early in the third quarter, snaking into the end  zone from six yards out.  </P> <P> Roskelly carried only six times for 64 yards. Valencia also got 67 yards in 17  carries from halfback John Fewell, and 46 yards in eight attempts from tailback  Willie Barnes, but Marrujo pulled most of his starters from the game with two  minutes left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> This time around, the Chacon twins were unable to bring Fullerton (4-1) back  from the brink. Daniel Chacon was held to 94 yards passing, and brother David  gained only 14 yards rushing and 56 receiving.  </P> <P> Fullerton fullback D.C. Olsen was held to 23 yards.  </P></p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: SEC suit threatens NY Post deal THE FATE of the New York Post appears to be once more in the balance following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued the tabloid's prospective new publisher, Mr Steven Hoffenberg. The SEC suit, against Mr Hoffenberg and his Towers Financial factoring and accounts receivable business, alleges Towers misled investors about its financial health. It also charges that Towers fraudulently sold Dollars 215m of unregistered securities to over 2,800 investors. Mr Hoffenberg, who signed a contract to buy the paper this weekend, expects final approval of ownership by February 19, but there was speculation yesterday that the SEC move could block Mr Hoffenberg's plans to buy the Post. The SEC motion, which will be heard on February 24, seeks to freeze Mr Hoffenberg's and Towers' assets and to appoint a trustee and an independent accountant to manage and audit Towers. It would also prohibit Mr Hoffenberg from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The revelations come only weeks after Mr Hoffenberg was hailed as the Post's guardian angel after he agreed to provide Dollars 300,000 and to guarantee the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. The paper's survival has been in danger since January, when its bankers refused to extend a line of credit that had jumped to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m. The newspaper's deficit is estimated at about Dollars 5m for last year. Even before yesterday's SEC suit, Mr Hoffenberg was considered a dubious white knight, with a history of abortive takeovers. The paper has seen a string of defections by editors to its rival, the Daily News, recently rescued by Mr Mortimer Zuckerman. In a story in yesterday's Post, the editor said Towers had been under investigation by the SEC for six years. But the prospect of a court room debacle has not cooled Mr Hoffenberg's enthusiasm. In a separate article he told readers 'Get ready, New York. You're getting a street-fighting publisher and I'm going to work directly for you.'</p>

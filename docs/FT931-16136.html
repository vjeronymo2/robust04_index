			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lilley debts total more than Pounds 80m - Receivers hope to save jobs by selling most of collapsed group's businesses RECEIVERS hope to preserve jobs by selling most of the businesses in Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group which has collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 80m, of which Pounds 20m are off-balance sheet. Price Waterhouse, who were appointed as receivers yesterday, said management forecasts suggested that losses caused mainly by property writedowns and losses on disposals would have reduced the group's net assets from Pounds 47m at the end of 1991 to net liabilities of Pounds 13m by the end of 1992. At yesterday's share suspension price of 7 3/4 p, Lilley had a market capitalisation of only Pounds 16m. There was also an urgent need for cash, which management had concluded might amount to as much as Pounds 16m. It was this requirement for new funds which proved too much for two of Lilley's six banks - Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of National Australia Bank, and Hill Samuel, the merchant bank subsidiary of TSB. Mr Iain Bennet, of Price Waterhouse, said Lilley's financial difficulties stemmed from a very substantial loss of value on a number of major property developments which were acquired at the height of the property boom. He added: 'The group's divisions comprise many well-known and respected construction businesses. We very much hope that these can be saved through successful receivership sales. With this in mind we have already contacted a number of potential purchasers.' Lilley employs a total of 2,800 people, more than half of them in Scotland. There are 1,200 on staff, with the rest working on sites throughout the UK. Robison and Davidson, a building and construction subsidiary in Dumfries, which employs 750 of the group's total, is not in receivership. The receivers appointed to its parent are hopeful of selling the shares of the company within the next few weeks. Lilley also owns Harrison Western Corporation, based in Denver, Colorado, which owns and leases five tunnel-boring machines. This company is not in receivership or subject to any other insolvency procedure. Lilley (Construction) Services Ltd. of Long Stratton, Norfolk, has no connection with the Lilley group and is unaffected by the receivership.</p>

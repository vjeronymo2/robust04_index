			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 13 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian Administration  and the opposition parties are clashing over the control  mechanisms for the general elections that will be held next  year. The two parties are charging each other with intolerance  and irresponsibility.    The clash began on 12 April when the Congressional  Constituent Committee cast a tie vote on the opposition's  proposal for a fourth set of voting records in addition to the  three sets of records that the officials who oversee the  balloting normally keep.    The fourth set of voting records would not be given to the  voting officials or the Armed Forces, which are entrusted by law  with keeping all voting records. According to the opposition,  this fourth set of records will help oversee the elections and  prevent fraud.    The opposition also objected to Constituent Committee  Chairman Carlos Torres' vote that broke the tie after he had  promised to abstain. Incidents cropped up and insults were  exchanged in the corridors of the congressional building.    Torres said that had the proposal to have a fourth set of  records been accepted, "it would have made the electoral process  chaotic. What would happen if this fourth set of records  revealed something totally different from the other three? Can  you imagine the problems this would create?"    The opposition threatened to bring charges against Congress  Chairman Jaime Yoshiyama for not calling a plenary meeting  because the legislative year should have started on 1 April. The  opposition also asked Yoshiyama to attend because he has been  absent from all seven Congressional Executive Board meetings  held so far this year.    With one year to go before the general elections in April  1995, nobody knows at this point what organization or  organizations will be in charge of organizing and coordinating  the elections, which will be held within the framework of the  new Constitution.    Congress is embroiled in a pointless debate, constantly  changing its course that leads nowhere. On the contrary, the  disagreements between the pro-government majority and the  opposition are getting worse all the time.    The core of the problem is the new electoral system outlined  in the new Constitution that was ratified by referendum in  October 1993.    Under the new Constitution, the National Electoral Board has  been divided into three separate organizations. It will require  a long and complicated process to get these three organizations  up and running, and there is little time left for this.    The opposition wants the National Electoral Board to handle  the 1995 elections as it has done with the three previous  elections held in Peru under President Alberto Fujimori's  administration. The various opposition parties also disagree  among themselves on what steps should be taken to achieve their  objective.    The Constituent Committee has approved a bill from the  Peruvian Bar Association according to which the Constitution  does not have to be amended for the National Electoral Court in  order to coordinate the 1995 elections. The bill has to be  approved by a plenary meeting, which has not been called yet.    Experts agree that if the constitutional provisions are  followed to the letter there will be no time to set up the  appropriate organizations. Certain news organizations have  warned that the elections may have to be postponed.    The new electoral system is made up of the National  Electoral  Board, which will establish the rules and regulations; the  National Office for Electoral Procedures (ONPE) [Oficina  Nacional de Procesos Electorales], which will organize the  elections; and the National Identity and Marital Status  Registry, which will provide the list of voters.    The National Council of Magistrates has to appoint the ONPE  head, and this council has not been assembled yet. The election  of council members will require a lengthy process that will only  further delay the establishment of the new identity registry.</p>

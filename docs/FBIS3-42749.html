			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Mikhaylovich Postolatiy, director of </F> the Institute of Energy of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova,  doctor of technical sciences, and corresponding member of the  Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova, by Gennadiy  Valentik; place and date not given: "Problems of Science. A  Passion for...Energy"]    [Text]    [Valentik] Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the subject of our  discussion is the present and probable future of Moldovan energy  engineering. But first--about the conflict between you and the  institute's scientific council, which has been given  unjustifiably broad publicity. You are accused of abuse of  power, protectionism, incorrect use of funds allotted to the  institute, and other sins. With the exception of the one article  in MOLODEZH MOLDOVY, from the other publications the readers  received essentially one-sided information about the essence of  the conflict. And your silence in this situation seems somewhat  strange.    [Postolatiy] I admit that among the accusations that have  been hurled at me there are some that are fair. But in the flow  of fabrications, squabbles, and fact juggling they make up too  small a part to cause us to believe that my opponents are really  concerned about affairs of the institute and the development of  energy engineering in Moldova.    I have nothing against sweeping the garbage out of the hut  and placing it in the garbage can. But my colleagues and  subordinates have spread it out in the street for everyone to  see, brought in garbage from the outside, and they shout: "Look  at how neat and clean we are!" It seemed to me that my  differences with that part of them, namely the part of the  scholarly council, was a matter for within the institute.  Therefore, if you will, out of delicacy I did not make a  statement in response. Then, when the mass attack against me was  turned into a witch hunt it was not easy to find a publication  that would publish the arguments of the other side in spite of  the relatively well-developed public opinion.    [Valentik] Well, you have found such a publication. So what  is the essence of the conflict?    [Postolatiy] Last year the Ministry of the National Economy  allotted us less money than was anticipated. I raised the  question of its distribution at the scholarly council of the  institute, which on 5 May adopted a decision regarding this  issue. In particular, it decided to freeze certain work under  the state order. And the job of dealing with the workers  discharged in this was magnanimously assigned to the director.  There was only one solution: to reduce the number of workers by  25-30 percent. But for our recently created institute it would  be a great mistake to lose skilled personnel even in such an  extreme situation. The general meeting of institute workers  convened on my initiative arrived at the same opinion. Moreover,  note, there was not a single objection. They started pouring  down when on 31 May I issued an order for redistribution of  budget funds taking the real situation into account. Certain  members of the scholarly council regarded this as the director's  disrespect for the decision they had adopted previously and they  declared war on me.    [Valentik] So first the scholarly council decided to reveal  the truth by a majority of votes and then they decided to  clarify it by an even larger majority.    [Postolatiy] I set a more modest task for myself--to  preserve  the collective and fulfill the plan for scientific research work  as completely as possible.    [Valentik] As I understand it, the council is created in  order to advise the director, and not to make decisions for him.  You are the leader but, excuse me, not God's dandelion blown by  the breath of others' opinions. Were you not motivated by a  desire to share with the council the responsibility for the  institute's affairs.    [Postolatiy] Whatever the advice from the scholarly council  may be, the responsibility is placed squarely on the shoulders  of the director. In this case I did not want to make a decision  that was not in keeping with the interests of the matter. After  that it went like this...the Ministry of Economics granted us  the right to change the volume of work. As a result of  adjustments that were made the financial situation in the  institute improved somewhat. Moreover, in conjunction with the  scholarly council, we managed to decide the fate of the workers  who had been left without wages. Now it was possible to adopt  the council's previous recommendations of 5 May. I made this  compromise for the sake of the cause. But not all the members of  the scholarly council were satisfied with this outcome of the  matter. As they say, give them an inch and they will take a  mile. And they began an even more vicious attack on the  director. August and September were a time when the institute  was overwhelmed with full inspections. Defamatory statements,  anonymous letters, and other charming things like this came  pouring in. But not a single proposal about improving the  institute's work was received from our opponents. There followed  a resolution according to which the laboratory headed by the  director was left essentially without funds.    [Valentik] In that case you could sooner be accused of  inability to wield power than abuse of it. As far as I know,  even your irreconcilable enemies are not accusing you of  incompetence or of violating the law either. The presidium of  the Academy of Sciences considered you worthy of heading the  institute in the future. And you probably cannot be held to  blame for the thoughtlessness of members of the presidium. Why  are your opponents still unable to make peace? What are they  trying to achieve?    [Postolatiy] Some of them want anyone at all to be the  director as long as it is not me.    [Valentik] But since you are the director, let us get down  to  business. In my view, something strange is happening with  Moldova's energy potential now. The republic ships in almost all  its fuel (98 percent) from other countries. It ships in less  each year: in 1991--13 million tonnes of conventional fuel, in  1992--11.6 million. The output of electric energy is dropping  correspondingly: from 13.2 billion kilowatt-hours in 1991 to  11.1 billion in 1992. In 1990 we produced 16 billion  kilowatt-hours of electric energy. It was sufficient, but no  more than that. Now the deficit is being felt in all spheres of  the republic's life. The population has been deprived of hot  water. The heating batteries are not heated to their full  capacity. In order to avoid paying outrageous prices for  electric energy, pensioners use stearine candles. Yet Moldova  exports electric energy abroad. Particularly to Romania and  Bulgaria.    [Postolatiy] Our institute has nothing to do with the  redistribution of fuel and electric energy. But do not forget  that commercial structures now have the right to purchase energy  sources and produce energy from them. They use some of it at  their own discretion. As for the state sector, here the  situation is different: Because of the sharp decline in  production a kind of reserve of energy capacity has been created.    [Valentik] So perhaps my colleague from the newspaper TSARA  is right when, referring to the opinion of experts, he writes  that "If we had an energy system with high-voltage lines in the  countries of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Turkey) we could export  electric energy at advantageous prices and at the same time  obtain a profit of approximately $50-70 million.    [Postolatiy] In the first place, as one can see from his  article, your colleague is confusing kilowatts with kilovolts;  in the second place, apparently, he met his match in the  experts. If you build a high-voltage transmission line, the  immediate reason for doing so lies not in Turkey or Bulgaria,  but in Moldova--with the prospect of entering the unified  European energy system. As for the reserves of electric energy  that have now been formed, this is a temporary, ephemeral  phenomenon. The predictions of real specialists tell us that the  consumption of fuel and energy resources by 1995 in our country  will reach the 1990 level and will grow in accordance with the  increase in production volumes. Here it is necessary to take  into account that the proportional expenditure of energy  resources on the manufacture of a unit of output in our country  exceeds world indicators by 1.5-2 times. And our industry can  hardly count on utilizing advanced energy-saving  technologies--at least in the next decade.    The situation now is such that our energy sector is being  finished off as they try to skim of the good parts. And this is  at a time when 44 percent of the republic's energy equipment has  outlived its service life and needs to be replaced. We are  "burning" our fixed capital, which is in need of modernization  and development, for the sake of momentary advantage.    We have an immense deficit in the financing of energy  deliveries. The handling capacity of the republic's external  electrical communications with our neighbors, especially  Romania, is clearly inadequate. The schedule for loading in the  energy system is not uniform--the fluctuations reach 30-40  percent of the maximum. In the next few years the situation  could develop in such a way that energy engineering in Moldova  will not be in a condition to provide the economy with  electricity and heat in a balanced way. And they are talking to  us about tens of millions in profit for exported electric energy!    The basis of the strategic development of energy engineering  is the provision of a self-balance of electric and thermal  capacities. Calculations show that it will always be more  advantageous to buy fuel resources than to import pure energy.  This means that the development of generating capacities must  become one of the most important areas in the development of  energy engineering.    [Valentik] In such an alarming situation, why are the funds  received from the sale of electric energy abroad by the state  sector not invested in the development of the republic's energy  engineering? That would be only fair.    [Postolatiy] That is necessary. But that question is not for  me but for the republic government.    [Valentik] Let us say that I asked it of the government.  Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the demand: "Give us what we need--today!"  is the curse of all basic sciences. Your science, perhaps more  than others, can be regarded as an applied science. What can  your Institute do for Moldovan energy engineering today?    [Postolatiy] Practical return is very important. But without  basic research we would have nothing to give. The work of all 11  of the institute's laboratories encompasses problems of energy  engineering almost to a maximum. They include modelling the  development of energy systems and conditions for their  operation; reliability of energy supply; controlled electricity  distribution; microprocessor control systems; diagnostics of  energy equipment; electro-physics and high voltage technology;  controlled electric energy accumulators; economics, energy  saving, automation, the application of computer equipment, etc.    Along with other organizations we have drawn up a draft  program for the development of energy engineering of Moldova up  to the year 2010 and submitted it to the republic government.  Speaking on the whole, the main direction of the institute's  activity is to increase the effectiveness of energy systems and  energy supply systems.    [Valentik] It is known that you assign a significant role in  the development of Moldovan energy engineering to extensive  introduction of USVL (controlled self-compensating high voltage  electric power transmission lines) and varieties of them--SVL  [self-compensating high voltage power transmission lines] and  VLSF [expansion not identified]. But some members of your  institute's scholarly council have their doubts about the  effectiveness of these lines and certain specialists from  similar departments think that their introduction into practice  is unpromising. Essentially the same conclusion was reached by  the commission of the republic's Academy of Sciences.    [Postolatiy] At the beginning of our discussion you  correctly  noted that it is impossible to establish the truth by a majority  of votes. So I am convinced that the USVL and varieties of it  are the immediate future for Moldovan energy engineering, and  not just Moldovan. This is also shown by experience with their  practical utilization.    It would take us 10 years to convince specialists that,  particularly with respect to power transmission lines with a  voltage of 10 kilovolts, it would be possible to place  high-voltage supports every 90-100 meters instead of 60-70. Now  we will probably have to--God forbid that this will take 10  years too--convince many of my colleagues of the need to use  USVL. And yet these lines provide for considerably greater  reliability of electric power supply. Their application reduces  the number of power failures by 30 percent, it reduces  expenditures on servicing, transmission, and distribution of  electric energy, it reduces losses of it by 2-4 percent, it  increases the handling capacity by 15-40 percent, and it  significantly reduces the impact on the environment.    Among the opponents of the USVL are specialists--true, not  many of them--who simply cannot understand that the future lies  with these lines. That is, because of certain considerations  they do not want to understand. I am prepared to discuss all  issues with them under the condition that they not be guided by  a desire to prove that they are right by any means but  exclusively by the interests of the matter.    [Valentik] Apparently the World Bank will grant Moldova  credit in the amount of $30 million for the development of  energy engineering with a rate of 7.5 percent. How, in your  view, should this money be used?    [Postolatiy] For transportation for the delivery of fuel and  for storage facilities. This will be recouped 100-fold. For  increasing the effectiveness of the processing and utilization  of fuel. To do this it is necessary to update and reconstruct  equipment. For reinforcement of energy ties with our neighbors,  that is, the construction of high-voltage power transmission  lines that link us to energy systems of Russia, Ukraine,  Romania, Bulgaria, etc. For reinforcement of connections among  energy systems inside the republic.    Russia is proposing a joint project for the assimilation of  the Yamal gas deposit and the deposits of Western Siberia. I  think that it is simply necessary for Moldova to participate in  them. Along with this it is necessary to study the possibility  of obtaining fuel resources from other countries.    [Valentik] We shall hope that we will not spread out the  American credit among the various ministries and departments  and...well, I wish success to your institute and to you, its  leader.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PR PUSH IS ON FOR VODKA  </P> <P> The guest of honor was being treated to a party at the China Club, L.A.'s new  chi-chi night spot, with celebrity guests, balloons, kleig lights and a price  tag of $50,000.  </P> <P> The guest of honor was a bottle of vodka.  </P> <P> Tanqueray introduced its new Sterling vodka with such a party recently, hosted  by Movietime on-air personality Katie Wagner and saluting the "trend-setters of  the 1980s." The company commissioned a painting from artist/songwriter Allee  Willis (an eclectic work prominently featuring Tanqueray Sterling bottles),  served a chocolate cake in the shape of a Tanqueray Sterling bottle and invited  actresses Justine Bateman, Katey Sagal and Lesley Ann Warren.  </P> <P> While product launch parties are hardly new to the social scene, the party  circuit has become crowded in recent months with events hosted, underwritten or  having some tie-in to imported vodkas.  </P> <P> An increasingly competitive market may be the reason. While hard liquor sales  have dropped to the lowest point since the industry began surveying sales in  1970, sales of imported vodkas have risen (although the imports still represent  a small share of the U.S. vodka market). Last year, the sale of Absolut vodka  from Sweden increased by 34%.  </P> <P> Two of the newest entries to the field of imported vodkas are Great Britain's  Tanqueray Sterling and Icy Vodka from Iceland. Absolut dominates the market,  with the Soviet Union's Stolichnaya, Finlandia from Finland and Denaka from  Denmark.  </P> <P> Since all vodkas are flavorless, persuading consumers that one brand is  superior to another in this crowded field is in good part a matter of image and  has sparked marketing creativity, highlighted by eye-popping ads (Absolut's  series of unusual bottles is one) and moving in on the glamorous social scene.  </P> <P> Advertising can only go so far -- especially when hard liquor companies are  restricted to print ads and while other pricey luxury items like perfumes and  cosmetics offer sample cards in magazines, vodka can hardly follow suit.  </P> <P> What better way to get consumers to sample their products than by offering them  at glamorous social scenes?  </P> <P> Companies have devised various ways of promoting their products on the party  scene from underwriting charity events to donating bottles of their vodka at  events to hosting theme parties that feature only their brand.  </P> <P> Just how prominently the product is featured at events varies from company to  company and party to party. Icy supplied several bottles of its vodka at a  private dinner for patrons of the Los Angeles opera. The drink was served  during the first course, with waiters pouring from sleek bottles perched on  trays -- hardly a hard-sell.  </P> <P> The sell began the following day when a reporter was contacted by the company's  publicity firm, asking if the product was going to be mentioned in the party  write-up (it was not), and if the publicist could call when Icy was served at  subsequent parties to see if the same could be done.  </P> <P> Carillon Importers, which distributes Absolut, has a West Coast publicist who  often shows up at parties in traffic-stopping one-of-a-kind Absolut dresses  designed by Seventh Avenue's finest, including Stephen Sprouse, Perry  Ellis-label designer Marc Jacobs and Carmello Pomodoro.  </P> <P> "Schieffelin &amp; Somerset (Sterling's distributor) has traditionally relied  on public relations activities like sponsoring American Ballet Theatre or other  charitable events to be one of the main engines to market a brand," says Clint  Rodenberg, the company's senior vice president of marketing. Glamorous,  celebrity-filled parties are a way to associate the product with the affluent,  upscale market the vodka companies are after. "Our primary audience," says  Rodenberg, "are young professional adults, 25 to 35, who make over $35,000 a  year and live in metropolitan areas. If people associate Tanqueray Sterling  vodka with Ally (Sheedy) and Katie (Wagner) and that young, affluent crowd,  it's a very favorable association for us."  </P> <P> "The hardest sell is the first one," says Bill Creason, senior brand manager  for new products at Brown-Forman, the Louisville-based company that distributes  Icy vodka.  </P> <P> It is word-of-mouth that Icy -- which is going after the same yupscale market  as the other premium vodka brands -- relies upon.  </P> <P> "For trend-setters to adopt the product, it starts the word-of-mouth going,"  says Creason. "When that works in combination with advertising and in-store  promotions and having it available at bars and restaurants, then people will  see it and remember it."  </P> <P> Tricia Barroll found "unchartered territory" when Carillon Importers made her  its West Coast publicist to promote Absolut through parties. "Basically I make  sure our product is in all the appropriate parties, where we can get good  exposure to the right people, and I try to get press for us" she says. "The big  thrust right now is tasting. We've done lots of tie-ins with L. A. Style  magazine because that's a good crowd for us."  </P> <P> The relationship between Absolut and L.A. Style is a mutually beneficial one.  </P> <P> "What makes our magazine go 'round from a business point of view is  advertising," says L.A. Style publisher Karen Fund. "We understand that the  advertiser is looking for a certain kind of buyer, not just someone who is  discerning, but a trend-setter in the community. With an advertiser we can say  not only can we run an ad for you, but we can get the customer much closer to  you than that with an event . . . and we can get them to taste your product."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma  intends to submit to deputies the following amendment to the  provisional standing orders:    A deputy who undermines the dignity of the State Duma  through  his speeches or actions will -- by the decision of the chamber  -- be banned from participating in 10 of its sittings.    The faction has made this decision because on 13 January  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,  used his speech from the podium to insult and directly threaten  deputies.    The Russia's Choice amendment also states that if a deputy  banned from participating in the chamber's sittings does not  obey the decision, the chairman will be able to summon help from  the security services.</p>

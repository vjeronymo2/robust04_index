			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "ESPRIT: The Final Judgement"] </F>   [Text] The EC Court of Auditors' special report no 6/93 is  to be welcomed as a timely assessment of the European Union's  information technology research programme, ESPRIT. A searching  audit of the programme by the EU's hard-nosed financial  watchdog, coming towards the end of the ESPRIT's current  life-cycle, is a positive move which might have usefully been  carried out in the programme's earlier days.    The views of this lesser-known EU institution, charged with  the job of ensuring accountability, must be implemented as the  new information technology programme unfolds under the Fourth  Framework programme.    Yet there is not all that much new in what the Court of  Auditors had to say. Most of the sharp-edged and incisive  points they make about ESPRIT have been made many times before  -- some almost from the programme's inception. Many of these  points have been reiterated over and over in this very editorial  column.    The Court of Auditors' Report is like the summing-up of a  judge at the end of a lengthy trial, a summing up that takes  account of evidence and opinions garnered over many years.    One issue that stands out is that of precompetitive  research.  The ESPRIT programme early on developed an ideological  attachment to this, which suggested that the exploitation of  research results would be an act of dangerous intervention.  That this issue still has to be questioned after all this time  is hard to believe.    However, it has to be acknowledged that progress has been  made. The transfer from DG XIII to DG III ended ESPRIT's  experience of existing in an isolated empire, opening the  programme up to broader economic, industrial and other  considerations.    With the approach of the Fourth Framework, it is to be hoped  that the summing-up of the eminent judges in Luxembourg will  prove final and that the programme under its new name can start  a new life without making the same mistakes over again!  <H5>  Single Market Strategy </H5>   As mentioned in the last issue of the Eurotech Forum, the EC  Commission has devised an elaborate framework to consolidate and  to regulate the Single Market. This is known as "Making the  Most of the Internal Market": Strategic Programme.    According to the Commission, it decided "to prepare a  strategic programme for the completion, the management and the  future development of the internal market, which can serve as a  guide to the main priorities of the Community in this area and  as a means of measuring the progress of the Community towards  its objectives."    They also add that "an overall plan for the implementation"  of the internal market is desirable. The Commission wants to  see this come about by an endorsement from the Council of the  general orientation provided in the strategic programme and by a  firm undertaking by the Council to accelerate discussion on the  seventeen legislative proposals from the 1985 White Paper that  are still before it, with a view to their final adoption before  the end of 1994.    The strategic programme is divided into specific categories.  Section A, which is the completion of the basic legal framework  calls for the adoption of the legislative proposals that still  have to be agreed so that the basic legal infrastructure for the  single market can be established and which will serve to expose  regulated sectors to competition.    This includes the adoption of the outstanding measures from  the 1985 White Paper, in the areas of company law, taxation and  intellectual and industrial property. Action to ensure the free  movement of persons as well as measures to introduce competition  into the regulated sectors of energy, telecommunications and  postal services are envisaged.    Section B deals with managing the single market. This aspect  of the strategy is about the need to ensure conformity and  transparency in the transposition of Community directives into  national law and the need to ensure quality in enforcement.  Measures will be introduced to support administrative  cooperation, including proposals on the development of a  communication and data exchange network for Union administration.    Means of redress, such as providing access to justice and  judicial cooperation, will be developed, as will the importance  of evaluating Community rules. The "practical performance of  the legislation" and "the broader business and economic impact"  will be assessed. In this context, existing networks will be  used.    A major study on the economic effects of the internal market  will get underway in 1994 with likely publication in 1996.  Improvements to the INTRASTAT system are also envisaged.    Section C is about developing the single market. This will  take steps to ensure transparency and the application of the  principle of proportionality in preparing new Community  legislation. Regarding communication and information measures,  the Commission will devise "a coherent strategy involving  Community institutions, national administrations and  non-governmental organisations in a systematic and coordinated  way."    Moves to improve the business environment will deal with the  application of competition policy, improving cross-border  payments, further proposals on transport, promotion of  Union-wide protection of intellectual and industrial property,  improving company law, the creation of a favourable tax regime  for business, covering action on both direct and indirect  taxation, the upgrading of European standardization and  conformity assessment and quality systems.    Further improving the environment for the consumer and the  relationship between sustainable development and the internal  market as also included, as is the establishment of  trans-European networks. The strategic programme points to the  convergence of interests and coordination and action designed to  stimulate private investment and to ensure technical  interoperability, and proposals on the "early development of  telematic networks between administrations."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- North Korea accused Japan  on Tuesday of preparing to dispatch Self Defense Force (SDF)  troops to the Korean Peninsula under the guise of "collective  security measures" according to a report from Pyongyang  monitored in Tokyo.    The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) dispatch said that an  analyst for NODONG SINMUN, the Korean Workers' Party newspaper,  accused Japan of zealously joining the United States in its  efforts to force North Korea to agree to international  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The analyst warned that if international sanctions were  imposed on North Korea, Japan would dispatch SDF personnel to  the Korean peninsula. "This indicates Japan's hostile policy  (toward North Korea) is reaching the extreme," the analyst said.    The KCNA report was monitored by the Korea News Service, a  Tokyo-based agency watching developments on the peninsula.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (5): An era of global alliances - Companies must join forces to ensure survival THE past few years have witnessed a rash of alliances between information technology companies worldwide as they seek greater economies of scale, more effective methods of product distribution and better ways to defray the ever increasing costs of research and development. For European IT companies, such alliances are an essential element of their efforts to remain in contention with their US and Japanese rivals. Most of the technological building bricks of the IT revolution are not of European origin. Personal computer microprocessor technology is the province of the US companies Intel and Motorola. With the exception of Inmos, a subsidiary of SGS-Thomson, no European company has developed a commercial reduced instruction set computing (risc) chip, the heart of high performance workstations. The Inmos chip, the transputer, is now being considered by IBM for certain functions in the personal computers and workstations. Operating software is developed by US companies including Microsoft (MS/DOS; NT/Windows) and Apple. European companies have been involved, however, in moves to create a standard operating system based on AT&amp;T's Unix. Logica, the UK computing services company, was involved in the Santa Cruz Operation's version of Unix; Siemens of Germany and Groupe Bull of France are founder members of the Open Software Foundation, formed to develop open systems products and technologies. European IT companies are small, insular and tied to their home markets. Global alliances offer them access to technologies and markets that would be otherwise expensive or unattainable. Siemens, for example, a company with excellent technological skills, is working with International Business Machines, to develop the next generation of high density semiconductor memory which will compress 64m bytes of storage on a single chip. Olivetti has long maintained a close working relationship with Intel and with Microsoft which has enabled the Italian company to enter the market quickly with, for example, advanced workstation technology. Now all serious computer companies understand the importance of maintaining an alliance with the key chip manufacturers, in order to keep the technological leading edge and to share research and development costs. IBM, for example, has formed an alliance with Apple Computers and Motorola to develop new microchips, based on IBM designs, which could form the heart of the next generation of personal computer and workstations. Groupe Bull has in the past two months signed a far-reaching technology agreement with IBM, part of which provides for the French company to take part in the joint chip development programme. Bull will be much more than a customer for the new chips, according to Mr Bob Dies, director general for products and systems at IBM Europe. It will be intimately involved in the design and will take much of the responsibility for developing a multi-user versions of the chips, a technology known as 'symmetrical multiprocessing' in which Bull has profound expertise. The most dramatic example in recent years of a global alliance involving a European information technology company has been the merger between ICL of the UK and Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer manufacturer. The relationship between the two companies stretches back to 1981 when ICL, struggling to return to profitability, signed an agreement with the Japanese company, giving it access to technology which it could not afford to develop on its own. Since then, a careful market focus and sound housekeeping have resulted in ICL remaining Europe's only consistently profitable computer manufacturer. The takeover by Fujitsu - the Japanese company holds 80 per cent of ICL's stock - was nevertheless essential to provide ICL with long term credibility in an increasingly hostile market place. The purchase of the computing interests of the Nokia Group of Finland, financed by ICL from its own resources, was further evidence of ICL's rising star - the 'halo effect' as Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, describes it. ICL has become part of Fujitsu's worldwide family of wholly owned and partly owned companies which include Amdahl, the US mainframe manufacturer, Poqet, a US maker of handheld computers, and Hal, a US specialist in advanced computing technologies. Since the takeover ICL has: Provided Fujitsu with workstations and personal computers for sale in both Japan and worldwide markets; Begun to work on some elements of the technology for Fujitsu's mainframe computers - as Fujitsu is regarded as the world's best mainframe designer, this is an indication of the regard in which the UK company is held; Formed three new companies with Fujitsu, in two of which it will be majority shareholder and senior partner. In the US, for example, both companies are strong in retail systems. The new joint company, Fujitsu-ICL systems, will have about 2,000 employees and sales of Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). It will be third to IBM and NCR in the US retail market. Alliances are not confined to the computing hardware business. Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest and most successful computing services company, last year signed a wide ranging agreement with Daimler Benz, the German industrial group, worth FFr2.4bn (Dollars 406m) through which Daimler Benz will take a 34 per cent stake in Sogeti, CGS holding company. The idea is that the two companies will cooperate, at first in Germany, but later elsewhere in Europe, the US and the Far East as a method of helping both companies broaden their product ranges and expand their computing services. Late last month, CGS announced a wide ranging cooperative deal with Volmac, a Netherlands-based services group in which it already held a small stake. The new holding group will be two thirds owned by CGS and one third by the World Software Group, Volmac's holding company. CGS has been involved in some 20 acquisitions in recent years. Further consolidation and cross border alliances seem inevitable as the computer industry becomes increasingly a commodity business where volume sales will be essential to adequate profit margins and where services will increasingly be the principal way of adding value.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  MAIN MERGER-ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1986  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Date       Acquirer               Target Company 1986       Burroughs (US)         Sperry (US) 1987       Memorex (US)           Telex (US)            Bull (France)          Honeywell Info.

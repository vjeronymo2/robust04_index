			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Clark pays former directors Pounds 0.57m C&amp;J Clark, the family owned shoe company which last year rejected an invited bid from Berisford International, paid Pounds 567,000 in compensation to departing directors, including the former chairman. The largest payment was Pounds 427,000 to Mr Patrick Farmer, who joined the board as an executive director following the Pounds 15m buy-out, backed by Clark, in 1984 of the Farmer retailing chain. Mr Walter Dickson, the chairman who sparked a shareholder rebellion by proposing to sell Clark to resolve the disputes which had wracked the company for years, received Pounds 140,000. This represented the balance of his Pounds 286,000 annual salary which was outstanding upon his departure in July. Mr Roger Pedder, who replaced Mr Dickson in November, said Clark would this year review steps towards flotation, the compromise which helped to thwart the Berisford bid. He also announced a substantial increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 121,000 to Pounds 20.8m for the year to January 31. Sales were 5 per cent higher at Pounds 655.3m. Mr Pedder was pleased with the performance because it was 'better than the outlook on which the Berisford offer was based, justifying the decision by shareholders to retain their investment'.</p>

He described the incident  as strange to Sudanese society, particularly in view of the  hideous nature of the crime. His Excellency did not rule out  the involvement of foreign quarters, despite the fact that the  statements of the criminals did not indicate this in the initial  stage of the inquiry. During his meeting today with media  leaders, al-Bashir commended the security organs for arresting  the criminals and said the accused would be given a just trial  immediately after the completion of investigations. He said  Sudan's doors would remain open to anyone who wants to live with  us in security and peace.    During his meeting today with media leaders, the president  also said that decrees would be signed next week providing for  the formation of the new states and the appointment of their  governors, deputy governors and other members of their  governments. He said in this connection that strong and  trustworthy individuals with leadership capabilities would be  chosen in accordance with the revolution's method of appointing  political and executive leaders.    Lieutenant General al-Bashir also declared Sudan's readiness  to send forces to preserve security and stability in Bosnia  under the auspices of the United Nations. He appealed to  Islamic states to send forces to put an end to the conspiracy  being hatched against the Muslim Bosnian people.</p>

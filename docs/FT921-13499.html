			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: BAe plans India link-up BRITISH AEROSPACE of the UK plans to set up a production line in India for the ATP, its regional turboprop aircraft, Daniel Green reports. The company hopes the move will trigger local sales. It is negotiating with Hindustan Aeronautics, based in Bangalore, which would make the aircraft as a subcontractor, the UK trade magazine Flight International says. The deal would make BAe the second biggest western aircraft maker to seek to cut costs by manufacturing in Asia. In November, McDonnell-Douglas revealed plans to manufacture in Taiwan. BAe makes 15 ATPs a year in Manchester.</p>

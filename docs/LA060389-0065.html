			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGGED-ODOMETER INVESTIGATION HAS 'HIT THE JACKPOT'  </P> <P> The lead investigator in what has been termed the largest recent  odometer-tampering scandal in Southern California said Friday that search  warrants served last weekend "have hit the jackpot."  </P> <P> "We have an enormous amount of original documentation," said Phil Chlopek, an  investigator with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> Chlopek said that some of the seized sales and ownership documents appear to  show that original mileage figures for some out-of-state pickup trucks brought  into California had been deleted or covered over. New mileage figures appear to  have been written in, he said.  </P> <P> In other cases, documents that had been signed under penalty of perjury show  nothing in the space where mileage is supposed to be recorded, he said. "It is  blank."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 400 Buyers Affected  </P> <P> Hundreds of documents were seized over the Memorial Day weekend in an  investigation that officials say defrauded up to 400 consumers out of an  estimated $500,000 -- money they would have saved had the true mileage been  posted. The customers bought trucks whose odometers had been rolled back,  Chlopek said.  </P> <P> Investigators said the multistate investigation involved a sophisticated ring  that purchased late-model, high-mileage trucks in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and  other Western states, brought them to California, falsified paper work on them,  tampered with the odometers, spruced them up and sold them to 44 dealers,  mostly in Southern California.  </P> <P> In one sale cited in the search warrants, a 1985 Ford pickup with 166,985 miles  on it showed 48,371 miles on the odometer when it was sold to a Lancaster  dealer.  </P> <P> Odometer-tampering is a federal offense with a possible prison term of two  years. Chlopek said the investigation, which he conducted with colleague  Charlene Arp, will eventually be turned over to the U.S. attorney for  prosecution. No indictments have been issued and none are expected for months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seized Papers  </P> <P> The investigator said the papers seized during the weekend have opened so many  new leads that the investigation may be broadened.  </P> <P> "The initial analysis is that we have hit the jackpot," Chlopek said.  </P> <P> Another factor that will delay completion of the investigation is that some  documents require time-consuming analysis.  </P> <P> In particular, papers that appear to have been falsified will be sent to  experts who will "try to remove white-out and black felt-tip pen markings,"  Chlopek said. "That will take time."  </P> <P> The search warrants were served on some organizations that are targets in the  investigation, but Chlopek said two businesses whose records were seized are  not under suspicion -- Elvia Zapien's VIP Registration Service in Pico Rivera  and Auction Express Title Service in Placentia.  </P> <P> "'VIP and Auction Express have been cooperating," Chlopek said. "I don't think  they had any criminal involvement in it at all. It is just that they had the  records and that is what we needed. At this point in time, they are not  suspects."  </P> <P> "We are cooperating with the DMV," said Zapien, whose firm expedites and  processes vehicle transfer documents. "We have an impeccable reputation. We  worked many years to establish that reputation. Any inference that we are  involved in an odometer-rigging scheme is absurd and in error."  </P> <P> Also named in the search warrants were Truck Auto Sales in Ontario, owner C .P.  Mercer and his wife, Mattie Aline Mercer, their home in Chino, Mercer's son,  Phillip of Bristow, Okla., and Yiser Dean Dabbs of Fullerton.  </P></p>

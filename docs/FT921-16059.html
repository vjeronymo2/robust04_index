			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When British is best The British banks, subject to much criticism for their treatment of small firms in recent months, score better than their German counterparts in a new comparison of bank charges in the two countries. The British banks won by four points to three in a survey carried out by Small Business Perspective, a new bi-monthly newsletter.* Most British banks publish their tariffs while in Germany, tariffs are generally only made known to private, but not to business customers, the newsletter notes. The situation in Germany is beginning to change, however. The British banks also do well on deposit account rates, offering instant access accounts with interest rates varying between 6.75 per cent and 7.625 per cent for sums over Pounds 5,000. The German banks offer only 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent on deposits of DM20,000 (Pounds 7,000) and more. All rates were calculated at the beginning of December. In two other areas, German banks rate more highly. Their standing charges are usually lower, generally less than DM2.90 (Pounds 1) compared with Pounds 2.50 to Pounds 5 from most UK banks. Their charges for credit entries and cheques are also lower at 35pfg to 60pfg per item (12p to 20p), compared with 60p to 74p in the UK. In a separate survey of banking services in France, Germany and the UK, carried out by Bossard Consultants and reported in the newsletter, German companies emerged as having longer term relationships with their banks. Fewer German firms had ended a banking relationship in the past three years than was the case in the UK or France. Thirty per cent of British companies had a business relationship with a subsidiary of a foreign bank compared with 23 per cent in France and 17 per cent in Germany. *From Graham Bannock and Partners, 53 Clarewood Court, Crawford Street, London W1E 1AL.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Oil, Energy, and  Mine Subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, has endorsed the  increase in gasoline prices, saying it is no longer possible to  continue registering losses in the profit margin of the oil  sector. Convergence Senator Luis Ramon Matos did not agree,  saying this is not the opportune time to announce an increase.  He has said the country is experiencing a devaluation of the  bolivar, a rise in speculation, price increases, and a  deterioration in the mass transit system, all of which make  difficult the acceptance of this decision.    According to Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce and  Services] President Berend Roosen, the reduction in the price of  the dollar does not entail a reduction in products of mass  consumption, because most of the raw materials have already been  imported. He has added a study is being conducted on suggested  top retail prices to achieve stability between merchants and  customers. Roosen has recalled that due to the dollar's  stability, the internal market has been restocked.</p>

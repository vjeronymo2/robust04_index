			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): Selling soft soap to the Soviets MOSCOW MEETS MADISON AVENUE by Gary Burandt Harper Business Dollars 22.50, 222 pages IN THE pre-Yeltsin days, before uncertain freedoms replaced unpleasant certainties, political jokes in the former Soviet Union had an edge. One told of an American and a Russian debating which was preferable, capitalism or communism. Uncle Sam says 'under capitalism, man exploits man.' Vladimir pooh-poohs such immorality: 'in Russia the situation is quite the reverse.' Gary Burandt, 'with Nancy Giges', has (unintentionally, I suspect) written a peach of a book, a perfect illustration of some of the unpalatable truth lying beneath the old chestnut. Currently chief executive officer with the Dentsu wing of the US advertising agency Young and Rubicam, Burandt went to the Soviet Union in 1988 to open its first advertising agency. Burandt's experiences are not particularly interesting in themselves, but they unwittingly testify to that warm bath of self-obsession without which many advertising people are miserable. Young and Rubicam must be proud; Burandt scarcely lifted his attention beyond a single horizon - the selling of clients' products. Burandt and his colleagues are constantly infuriated with the inadequate resources, the petty corruption, the apparently endless hindrances which dogged their working days. But the inadvertent delight is the unconscious manner in which Burandt betrays the paucity of the devoted advertising person's life, fixated with preaching the virtues of hamburgers, toothpaste, soap powder and so on. Thus, while all around him an empire and an ideology are on the verge of collapse, Burandt reveals a personal crowning achievement at a trade fair, where he manages to manipulate Mikhail Gorbachev into a commercially useful event: 'We had the Colgate representative also prepped (prepared) for a 'photo op' with a giant tube of Colgate 'Big Red' toothpaste, the biggest we had. It worked. He shook Gorbachev's hand and handed him the toothpaste. As the Big Red box changed hands, a hundred camera shutters clicked as one. One of the photos would be in the Colgate boardroom in just a few days.' Yahoo] Young and Rubicam and all the other western advertising agencies which have since gone east were shoving hard at open doors. Starved of life's material comforts for so long, former Soviet citizens have always embraced with gusto anything which brightened up awful lives. Now, at least, they have the ads, if not the cash to buy those goods the ads promote.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with U.S. Ambassador to Armenia Harry Gilmore by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] Yerevan, 29/01/94 ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" daily-NOYAN  TAPAN) -- Interview with the Ambassador of the United States of  America in the Republic of Armenia Harry Gilmore.    [Correspondent] Mr. Gilmore, could you please inform us on  humanitarian aid which U.S. Government is providing to Armenia?  I am in particularly interested in problems with delivery of  kerosene. What is causing the delay?    [Gilmore] The first two loads of kerosene, more than 10,000  tons are in Batumi from December. First load of 5,000 tons is  also in Batumi from December 21, the second part of kerosene for  Armenia was delivered to Batumi at the end of December. Our  partner in realization of this operation is the American  organization Fund of Democracy and Development. We are also  working with agency on transportation of cargoes, which in turn  is collaborating with Georgian railway in order to deliver  kerosene to Armenia. Unfortunately we were not able to resolve  all delivery problems but we are working in this direction, and  I am sure the kerosene will be delivered soon. I am afraid in  trying to guess the date of delivery, as I am unable to tell  when the trains from Georgia will arrive. I may also add, that  the Fund of Democracy and Development purchased another batch of  kerosene, which is now in Rotterdam and Heife. This batch will  be delivered to Batumi at the end of January.    [Correspondent] Could you please give some details, what are  the delivery problems?    [Gilmore] I may only say, that the Fund itself is signing  contracts with the agency of cargo transportation, and the  latter in ?turn with the administration of Georgian railway.  The delay was most probably caused by change of transportation  tariffs, and this change wasn't ?he fault of the Georgian side,  since such change of tariffs was carried out in all CIS  countries. But I need to stress, that the U.S. Government is  not participating in negotiations directly, and thus it is not  responsible for development?of any specific transportation  conditions.    [Correspondent] Do you mean, that U.S. Government is not  responsible for transportation?    [Gilmore] My answer is neither "yes" nor "no", the question  is rather complex. U.S. Government is financing the  transportation of kerosene. 15 million dollars were allocated  for this program, another 1 million was allocated by Japan.  These money were paid to American firms, which are directly  responsible for signing contracts. Therefore U.S. Government is  responsible for the program in whole, but for the separate  topics of the contract.    [Correspondent] Nowadays people need trust most of all, and  our government along with other governments of former USSR  countries are not trusted too much. I am sorry for we are  loosing the trust in receiving aid from the USA. What do you  think in this regard?    [Gilmore] Yes, I understand. I have to feel it on myself,  but I am sure that all kerosene cargo for Armenia will be  delivered to the place. Increase of prices in Georgia forced  transportation companies to revise the contracts and to develop  new ones. We didn't expect such delays, and I thought, the  first cargo will be delivered at the end of December.    [Correspondent] And you were unable to influence on these  processes?    [Gilmore] No, since we don't understand all the details.  One of those is the price increase in CIS; the other is the  terrible condition of Georgian railways: they are extremely  overloaded. In addition to this transportation companies had  problems on holidays (New Year and Georgian Christmas), when it  was in fact impossible to find a representative of Georgian  Railway Administration, in order to work on the contract. The  other problem is shortage of electricity in Batumi: there was  no electricity even for the functioning of electric trains. But  I am not trying to justify myself. We hope now, that the first  batch will be here soon, we cannot delay anymore. It could be  worse.    Meanwhile, and you probably know this, we purchased kerosene  here in Armenia in order to make sure we can start the  distribution to several groups of population, who live in  extremely severe conditions. This was done in accordance and  collaboration with Armenian Government.    [Correspondent] There are gossips, that kerosene was  purchased from Azerbaijan, is this true?    [Gilmore] This is absurd, nonsense, if not to say stronger.  Kerosene was purchased from one of Armenian companies well known  both to the Armenian Government and to us, and later the  kerosene was delivered to Arm?nia. Money for this deal entered  the Armenian bank.    [Correspondent] During the recent briefing you mentioned  another program -- program of food distribution. What was this  program, who was it dedicated for, and did its realization start?    [Gilmore] Indeed, we are going to purchase potatoes and to  distribute it among the families where children are deprived  from one of the parents. Realization of the program already  s?arted, though there were delays caused by gasoline purchase.  The idea was in purchasing gasoline for the dedicated amount of  dollars and to pay thus to the farmers from which we were going  to purchase potatoes. This potatoes will be packed in 10- and  20-kg bags and distributed among families with deprived  children. This aid is particularly for this group since it's  receiving the most little aid compared with others.    [Correspondent] Who is going to deal with distribution of  this aid?    [Gilmore] Armenian Apostolic Church in New York headed by  the  Archbishop Barsamyan, and the Fund of Aid to Armenia. We are  collaborating with them and with the organization CARE. Money  will be paid to the church, which in turn transferred to the  partners dealing with gasoline trade. Delivery of potatoes has  already started, and I believe, the distribution will start this  week.    [Correspondent] Could you tell something on the aid programs  you planned?    [Gilmore] I have already mentioned that 15 million dollars  were allocated for kerosene, 25 thousands dollars were dedicated  for purchasing gasoline and potatoes; we should also remember  the additional $7400. $250,000 was allocated by CARE for 10-  and 20-kg food parcels, which will be distributed among those in  need. $673,000 was dedicated by CARE for helping pensioners and  lonely, also to the inhabitants of Gyumri and Vanadzor: during  the period from November ?o April everyone will receive three  parcels of 14 kg each; 20,000 tons of agriculture products such  as wheat, rice and beans were dedicated by the Agriculture  Department of the USA. All the mentioned aid is organized by  the CARE program, the Fund of Aid to Armenia and the Armenian  Apostolic Church in New York. Another 20,000 tons are allocated  to Armenia by the program "Food for Progress". There are a few  additional programs in the sphere of medicine, approximately 5  million dollars worth. This program is dedicated to help young  mothers and those women who are expecting a child. $650,000 are  dedicated for the program of teaching doctors and business  specialists.    In nearest future we are going to deliver sowing grain to  Armenia to be distributed among farmers. This is also a program  of U.S. Government, where will be also participating private  organizations and Armenian Ministry of Agriculture.  Approximately 7 million dollars will be dedicated to this  program. We also planned special programs worth no less than  500,000 dollars -- such as distribution of food parcels for the  inhabitants of the earthquake zone, and an another small but  important project to help commercial banks in the conditions of  changes to the market economy.    [Correspondent] I am most of all interested in this last  aid,  the aid for the economical development of Armenia.    [Gilmore] We are currently working with the Ministry of  Economy in order to prepare technical aid to Armenian commercial  banks. We include here also the training of bank employees in  the conditions of the new system, i.e. during the period of  changing to the market economy.    [Correspondent] How much did you spent for this program?    [Gilmore] I have no precise data in this regard, but the  expenses will be lower than the sums dedicated for kerosene or  grain. This program is planning to carry out seminars for bank  employees in Armenia, and possibly, some of them will be invited  to the USA for special training on a higher level. Thus the  expenses for this program may be calculated only when it is  finished. But even now we may estimate, that it will make tens  of thousands dollars.    [Correspondent] What about possible allocation of money for  stabilization of the Armenian national currency?    [Gilmore] The problem of giving Armenia money for  stabilization of the dram rate is very complicated, and this is  not the problem which may be solved by the U.S. Government  alone. One of the main rules for such institutes as  International Currency [Monetary] Fund and International Bank of  Reconstruction and Development, is not to allocate credits to  countries which are involved in a conflict. USA is one of the  countries who founded these organizations. And our policy in  this regard is to work with these organizations.    [Correspondent] But could USA help Armenia separately,  without participation of these organizations?    [Gilmore] Theoretically this is possible. Direct aid could  be given by the United States and by the 7 countries. But here  again the USA should work with the World Bank and the  International Currency Fund. Unfortunately I cannot get into  details. I may only say, that currently the Armenian government  is carrying negotiations with these structures, and U.S.  Government is also participating in these negotiations. There  have been such negotiations recently, by the way, and we  couldn't reach a "breakthrough", but there is progress anyway,  and I would stress that the progress was reached by the Armenian  Government. Whatever your Government is, it is facing the same  difficulties during negotiations with International Currency  Fund and the World Bank. Armenian Government is doing its best.    [Correspondent] So you mean, that our Government may be  successful in this problem?    [Gilmore] I'd say, that Armenian Government is doing its  best  in order to find a formula acceptable for International Currency  Fund and the World Bank. This is not easy to do, since the  rules of these institutions are not created especially for  Armenia. But I believe that Armenia will be successful in this  problem. I wouldn't like to tell anything in this regard, I can  just say, that your Government is working very hard.    [Correspondent] The reason why am I asking the details of  this problem is that, as far as I know, several Eastern European  countries, Poland in particular, received such aid from Western  countries.    [Gilmore] True. There were several cases, when Western  countries and the USA in particular have given aid not only via  international organizations, but also on a bilateral basis by  means of so-called currency stabilization funds. One of such  examples is Poland. But we didn't reach the necessary point in  the case with Armenia yet. The reason is the same -- being  involved in a conflict. I wouldn't like to talk on how long may  such a situation last. It is the task of the Government of  Armenia to report on this. But I must say, that the Armenian  Government is taking active efforts. Particularly, there were  several visits to Washington recently, and there were high level  visits on the level of International Currency Fund and the World  Bank. All I could add to this would be a guess.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS PROTEST CITY'S AMENDED HOLLYWOODLAND GROWTH PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS ARE ANGRY OVER OMISSION OF A REVIEW BOARD TO MAINTAIN  ARCHITECTURAL STYLE.  </P> <P> By the hundreds, Hollywoodland homeowners are protesting what they say are  efforts by city planners to dilute to the point of ineffectiveness their  proposed specific plan for controlled local development.  </P> <P> More than 400 residents who live in the area below the Hollywood sign have sent  signed copies of a protest letter to Mayor Tom Bradley and other city  officials, according to the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> And more than 100 residents turned out at a public meeting last Thursday to  oppose the specific plan as amended and proposed by the city for Hollywoodland  development.  </P> <P> The residents and Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the area, say the  elimination of safeguards included in a specific plan that the homeowners'  association drafted and submitted to the city in July, 1989, makes the city's  proposal too weak. The homeowners' group spent more than $10,000 on its plan in  hopes of preventing careless development and maintaining the integrity of the  "Old-World European-style" architecture common throughout Hollywoodland.  </P> <P> "The essentials that we have asked for have been ripped out of the plan," said  Bruce Mahler, planning and zoning committee chairman for the homeowners'  association. "We have not been fortunate enough to see who did that or why, but  we have indicated our deepest concerns and hopes that our version of the plan,  which we feel will protect us, is restored."  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the neighborhood group's plan, eliminated from the city's  proposal, is a design review board that would review building proposals on the  about 195 vacant lots and 530 existing homes in Hollywoodland.  </P> <P> Although advisory in nature, the board would aim to ensure that development is  "compatible in scale and character" with existing architecture, which has  defined the area since its establishment as one of Los Angeles' first planned  communities in 1923, according to Mahler and other association officials.  </P> <P> The city plan also eased requirements in the groups' plan for setbacks from the  street to assure easier firefighting access through the steep and narrow  hillside streets, and for tougher height and density limits on homes. The city  plan also eliminated the neighborhood association's proposal to place  underground all utility lines for new construction, as well as a height  limitation on walls and fences.  </P> <P> At last week's hearing at Cheremoya Avenue School, nearly every homeowner who  spoke was in favor of having planners include the tougher neighborhood plan  provisions in their final draft to be sent to the city Planning Commission  April 15.  </P> <P> Mahler told the crowd that the city's proposal is "so diluted, through massive  deletions and revisions, so drastically watered down, that it has been  essentially modified into ineffectiveness."  </P> <P> City planners disagree. "I think we're trying to achieve the same goals as they  are," said Daniel Scott, a city Planning Department hearing examiner.  </P> <P> Scott, who is developing the specific plan, attended last week's meeting and  said he is considering the changes supported by residents. He said the plan  still has several hurdles to clear, including approval by Planning Commission  and the City Council, and could be changed significantly before it is  officially adopted.  </P> <P> Scott did say, however, that city planners oppose the design review board as an  "inappropriate mechanism" for regulating development. Instead, city planners  are considering having the area designated as a "historic preservation overlay  zone."  </P> <P> If the area warrants such protection, approval of development would require  approval of the city Planning and Cultural Heritage commissions, with the City  Council hearing appeals, Scott said.  </P> <P> Whether or not the area deserves such protection due to uniqueness and  uniformity of architecture has been called into question, because recent  development may have altered the area too much, Scott said.  </P> <P> Bob Crane, a Hollywoodland association member, favors the group's plan and says  opposition has been limited to developers, who he said favor the less-stringent  city plan and oppose the design review board.  </P> <P> But, Kurt Meyer, an architect who lives and works in Hollywoodland, is one  association member who opposes the design review board as an unwarranted  governmental intrusion in an area that should be left unregulated. He said he  supports stringent development standards on issues relating to public safety.  </P> <P> As in many city areas, high land values and dwindling room to develop has  prompted a sharp increase in construction proposals in Hollywoodland. Many  homes are perched on stilts overhanging steep ravines, and residents say much  of the new development is being done on lots that are too steep or unstable.  </P> <P> Hollywoodland development currently is governed by an association-backed  interim control ordinance approved in June, 1988, which imposed restrictions on  such things as height, setback and roof configuration. The association, hoping  to speed the process of adopting a more stringent and permanent specific plan,  set about developing its own proposal to protect the area.  </P> <P> By last year, association members began complaining that developers were  rushing to get their projects in before adoption of a specific plan and that  they sometimes abused the interim ordinance while the overburdened city  planning staff did nothing.  </P> <P> Then, in November, the neighborhood association was shocked to find that city  planners had left their proposal sitting idle on a desk instead of moving it  through the approval process. Last December, city Planning Director Kenneth  Topping sent them a letter apologizing "for the miscommunications and delays,  which have characterized our department's response in the past."  </P> <P> Action on the specific plan came only after Woo and Council President John  Ferraro, who also represents the area, began meeting with city planners.  Ferraro has not taken a position yet on the city proposal, said his planning  deputy, Renee Weitzer.  </P> <P> Woosaid he favors the tougher plan drafted by the association, although he is  undecided on whether a design review board is necessary.  </P> <P> At last week's meeting, Woo committed himself to supporting a stronger specific  plan. He said this week that he wants stronger language limiting the density  and height of homes on the steep slopes, limits on the height of fences and  setbacks, and requiring utility lines to be placed underground.  </P></p>

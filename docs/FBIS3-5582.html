			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Should Consider and Champion the Fate of </F> Bosnians"]    [Excerpts] What was the reason behind the global  community's previous assistance to Africa when it encountered  famine? It was because the mass media, particularly worldwide  television coverage, carried daily reports and screened footage  of Africans -- infants, children, and old people -- reduced to  skeletal forms and left hopeless without any future. [passage  omitted]    Yet another episode also has been witnessed through the mass  media to a global audience over the last 22 months, particularly  via television: scenes of the ethnic war in Bosnia linked to  religion and which pose as a grim reminder with regard to the  future of mankind.    No accomplishment is derived from the ongoing trend of  conflicts and tragedies. Every time one forgets such incidents,  he or she is again jolted by what is aired over the television.  The situation in Bosnia indicates a totally different and  horrific kind of tragedy. Every time a tragic incident occurs,  it proves to be more terrifying than the previous ones occuring  several weeks before. [passage omitted]    Take for example the latest incidents. The latest brutality  occurred after the NATO alliance announced its ultimatum that it  would bomb Serbian mortar positions if they did not withdraw  their troops by the 20 February deadline.    It comes as no surprise that there is a discrepancy. The  victims of brutality have, in fact, called for effective action.  On the one hand, there are brutalities that have claimed lives.  On the other, we see a failure to take effective decisions.  Indecision has in turn brought about views and evaluations  about the existence of double standards as well as ethnic and  religious discrimination.    The problem is not as simple as we might think. We have  constantly heard about hilly regions, the responsibility of the  democratic governments, and national interests. Viewing the  complexity of the problem and its considerations, we will  definitely not be able to get rid of the views that the practise  of double standards was employed by the Western nations in  facing the war in the former Yugoslavia. At least, the Western  nations do not act as effectively as when facing other issues,  for example Iraq. Geographically, Bosnia is distant but  psychologically nearer to several developing nations, including  Indonesia. Our society has witnessed the brutality through mass  media on numerous occasions.    Our society is also affected by the discrepancy, that is the  discrepancy concerning the factual reality with regard to the  brutality and the ambigious and indecisive attitude which all  point to the practice of double standards.    We are disappointed and frustrated from humanitarian and  religious angles and we are making a contribution in the form of  a concrete action. This gave rise to the recent registration of  volunteers to fight in Bosnia. Motivation, enthusiasm, and the  background should be given prior consideration before any  further action is undertaken.    At least a concrete solidarity statement should be drawn up  to further consolidate and mobilize public opinion and global  solidarity for the Bosnians' fate and a strong call toward  ending the Bosnian conflict in a just procedure. Indonesia's  permanent representative reported our concerns to the world body  while waiting for the order for NATO air strikes from UN  headquarters in New York. As the chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement, Indonesia is taking an initiative on the possibility  of holding a conference on the issue of Bosnia. The move by the  Indonesian representative was a follow-up to the views presented  by President Suharto during his recent meeting with Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic in Jakarta.    Diplomatic measures will be time-consuming. Such measures  are considered important because they form a realization of  political attitudes and welfare. The mobilization of public  opinion and effective solidarity is imperative in the effort  toward seeking a just settlement to the Bosnian problem and the  strife against ethnic-cleansing -- whether such an action has to  be undertaken through diplomatic or military envdeavors.  Therefore, it is appropriate for Indonesia, as the leader of the  Nonaligned Movement, to utilize such a platform in its effort to  end the Bosnian conflict. Such efforts and measures are  imperative. The Bosnian problem can never be solved even with  the Serbian withdrawal from their mortar bases.</p>

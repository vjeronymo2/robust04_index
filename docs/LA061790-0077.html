			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHANCE TO SEE THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF 'OZ';  </P> <P> THE 'ROAD TO OZ' DISPLAY AT THE FRANCES HOWARD GOLDWYN BRANCH LIBRARY IN  HOLLYWOOD ACQUAINTS VISITORS WITH THE LIFE AND WORKS OF AUTHOR L. FRANK BAUM  </P> <P> Hollywood seems an indelicate place to house a history of something as sweet as  the works of L. Frank Baum. The neighborhood of the handsome Frances Howard  Goldwyn branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, where "The Road to Oz: The  Life of L. Frank Baum" is on display, is pretty well inhabited by the same  types of struggling souls regularly seen sleeping on the stars of nearby  Hollywood Boulevard.  </P> <P> And yet, in a way, it would seem inappropriate to place such an exhibit  anywhere else. Baum, after all, spent the last 10 years of his life in  Hollywood, at a beloved home he called "Ozcot." Hollywood itself is nearly as  much of a myth as Oz is, and as for struggling souls, well, Baum -- prolific  author, newspaper editor, salesman of axle grease and castor oil, motion  picture studio head, lifelong victim of a frail heart -- knew his share of  bankruptcy and strife.  </P> <P> "Nobody really knows very much about Frank Baum," said exhibit director-curator  Carroll Hodge, a free-lance documentary filmmaker and member of the film school  faculty at USC. "In fact, I didn't really know who Frank Baum was. I did not  read the Oz books when I was a child. I discovered them in doing this project."  </P> <P> Hodge is an exemplary case of what she hopes will happen to everyone who tours  the Baum exhibit (running through Aug. 31) -- that they will come to understand  that Lyman Frank Baum was not, as popular assumption goes, just a nice old  fellow who wrote a children's story.  </P> <P> "I found that the books were quite a bit different from the 1939 film," said  Hodge, who was charged to assemble the exhibit by the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation  as part of an ongoing effort to honor writers who lived in Los Angeles ("And,"  said senior librarian John Holliman, "to promote reading!") "I found that Frank  Baum's stories had a sly humor and the whole philosophical bent of not giving  too much power away. I thought that was very contemporary. We all go looking  for the wizard, and when he's a humbug, he reminds us that we already had that  power within us. I like Baum's very full, coherent philosophy, and it's played  out in wonderful characters, and that appealed to me a lot as an adult."  </P> <P> The wonderful characters are all at the exhibit in the form of charming,  life-sized cutout paintings done by designer Deni Wohlgemuth Ponty. Upstairs,  General Jinjur -- Baum's parody of a suffragist (the author favored equality  for women, but could not suffer any form of militancy -- watches over a portion  of the children's section. Prof. H.M. (Highly Magnified) Wogglebug, T.E.  (Thoroughly Educated) -- Baum's sendup of academic snobbery -- stands pompously  near a Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide. Downstairs, entrants  are greeted with an imitation "Yellow Brick Road," one of Oz's crabby apple  trees, the Cowardly Lion, "the Most Intelligent Beast in Oz;" the Tin Woodman,  "the Kindliest Man in Oz"; the Scarecrow, "the Wisest Man in All of Oz"; and  other faces familiar in the Emerald City -- notably, of course, that of Dorothy  Gale, stalwart survivor of cyclones and witches' spells.  </P> <P> "I have several theories as to why Baum had a girl for a central character in  the Oz books," said Hodge, "but it probably would be safe to say that he always  wanted a little girl and didn't have one. I think he created a girl character  who appealed to boys also; a girl heroine who was adventuresome and courageous  and yet girlish. What did she want? She wanted to go home. And also on the  subject of heroines, not only is Dorothy an important character, but all the  rulers of Oz are women. Once the wizard is sort of dethroned, Ozma and Glinda  the Good Witch take over."  </P> <P> The "Road" in "The Road to Oz" is a well-researched, detailed time line history  of Baum's life, complete with mementos and photos (provided by Baum descendants  and Oz devotees). Visitors are invited to follow the author's career in 19  stops throughout the library, punctuated by more of Ponty's renderings of the  various citizens of Munchkinland and Winkie Country. "I was surprised," Hodge  said, "at how many people stop to read every word."  </P> <P> A 25-minute video documentary featuring choice samplings of Baum's own highly  surreal movie versions of his stories, done in 1914 by his Oz Film  Manufacturing Co., runs continuously downstairs, with narration by admitted  Oz-buff Charlton Heston. Norman Rockwell's painting of Judy Garland as Dorothy,  commissioned by Gregory Peck, hangs on an upstairs wall; a replica of a 1914  toy Woozy, a magical wooden beast, made by Baum's great-grandson, Robert, is  encased in glass; a stubby old pencil mounted and framed is captioned in Baum's  own script, "With this pencil, I wrote the Ms. of 'The Emerald City' (later  changed to "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"), Oct. 9, 1899."  </P> <P> Aside from the humble pencil that yielded what many say is America's greatest  fairy tale, perhaps two other features of the exhibit stand out most; one, an  excerpted letter in which author John Steinbeck asks President Kennedy if he  could be appointed U.S. Ambassador to Oz ("There is only one great danger that  I can think of," wrote Steinbeck. "In Oz they have a wizard who openly admits  that he is a fake. Can you think what that principle would do to New York  politics alone?") and two, "the Gump." Right, the sofa-bed-and-elk's-head  creature that, after a sprinkling of the Magic Powder of Life, spirited the  Scarecrow and his companions away from the clutches of General Jinjur.  </P> <P> "One of the exhibit's physical objects that I am actually most fond of is the  Gump," Hodge said. "There's a little story by a Baum niece that when she stayed  overnight with her Uncle Frank and Aunt Maud, they pushed the couch to the  wall, and made a little bed for her, and it was very much in the spirit of fun  kids have always had in pushing furniture together and making something  imaginative from it. I feel like that Gump couch (upstairs in the children's  section) is kind of a physical 3-D element that lets kids connect with Frank  Baum's imagination on a very immediate kind of way. They can climb in and read  books, and they can enjoy the fact that the Gump was a character that came to  life. And if they want to imagine they can fly away in it, that would be fine,  too."  </P> <P> There were times in Baum's own life when he perhaps wished to fly away on a  magic couch -- perhaps, most surprisingly, to escape from Oz itself. A  compulsive writer of more than 60 books -- including many adventure tales  written under pen names such as Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald and Suzanne Metcalf -- he  tried to end the Oz series with "The Emerald City" in 1910 (he made the place  invisible to the outside world). He vowed to not pen another word about Oz  until "a thousand little children write a thousand little letters." Within a  few months, they had, and Baum was to grind out eight more adventures in the  "merry old land" before his death in 1919. One of the post-"thousand little  letter" books was "The Patchwork Girl of Oz" -- which happens to be the  favorite Oz work of Baum's only living grandchild, Ozma Baum Mantele.  </P> <P> "Patchwork Girl" appealed to me so much that I changed my name to Scraps, and  everybody started calling me Scraps," said Mantele, speaking from her home in  Downey. "With my name, Ozma, I never knew who were my friends and who weren't.  I had a hard time with my name when I was younger."  </P> <P> Named after the gentle princess of Oz, Mantele was cherished by Baum, the  father of four sons. Her memories of grandfather consist only of "flashes" from  the age of 3, but to this day she wears a diamond and gold locket inscribed  with her name presented by her grandfather upon her birth. She does have  favorite Baum tales, though, passed down by her grandmother, Maud Gage Baum.  Among them: that Baum was especially proud of a letter from a New York polio  clinic saying that his books went hand-in-hand with a thermometer; that once a  child touched him because "he wanted to know what the wizard felt like"; and,  while visiting Egypt, he was deeply moved by a little girl who, while moving to  Cairo with her family, had crossed the desert on camelback with only a doll and  an Oz book -- which he promptly autographed. Mantele, who helped Hodge with  research, heartily approves of "The Road to Oz."  </P> <P> "I like this exhibit because it shows that he was very multitalented and wrote  many more things besides the 'Wizard,' " said Mantele, who has long given slide  presentations on her grandfather's life. "He was very multifaceted, actually.  And he also raised chrysanthemums, and got cups for those -- anything he put  his hand to, he could do. And I also like the video with Heston's narration  because it showed my grandfather's studio, and all the innovations. He was way  ahead of his time as far as motion picture special effects are concerned."  </P> <P> Indeed, "The Patchwork Girl of Oz" movie from 1914 -- clips of which may be  seen in Hodge's video -- includes underwater effects, flying scenes and a  startling moment in which Mombi the Witch is temporarily beheaded. Among Baum's  other multitudinous facets: publishing the Saturday Pioneer newspaper in South  Dakota in 1890, where he first made his mark as a satirist; touring as a  Shakespearean actor in 1881 under the name of George Brooks; receiving national  acclaim for his play, "The Maid of Arran" in 1882; selling axle grease and  castor oil in 1891 to bring in money after his first of several bankruptcies.  </P> <P> "This man had struggled for years to get published -- maybe five years, or so,"  Hodge said. "And how often he went bankrupt, or his publishers went bankrupt,  or his film company went bankrupt! He weathered many hard times -- he had a  heart attack at the age of 12 -- and I think he had a certain buoyancy, and a  certain outlook on life that just kept him going."  </P> <P> To say nothing of a certain place.  </P> <P> "The Road to Oz: The Life of L. Frank Baum"  </P> <P> At the Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Public Library, 1623 Ivar Ave., (213)  467-1821  </P> <P> Open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday; to 5:30 p.m. Friday and  Saturday.  </P></p>

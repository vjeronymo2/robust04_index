			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: Pinocchio - Pantomime Thank heaven for stories and storytelling; and for theatre and theatricality. The New Adventures of Pinocchio, with which the Mermaid Theatre has just reopened, has virtually nothing going for it except that it tells a story its audience (average age 2-10) wants to follow, and tells it in a way that could only be achieved by live theatre. No adult should go unless accompanied by at least one child; but, for those that do, there is some delight to be had in studying the way it works upon the tinies. The staging, directed for Parasol Theatre by Richard Gill, makes blunder upon blunder. When the puppets 'speak', it is obvious that 'their' voices are spoken by adults - both amplified and muffled to boot. One actor hollers his lines - a bore, but audible. Another fails to project hers: prettily inaudible. A third speaks his in a fake Italian accent so thick that even the grown-ups have to do some deciphering. Several of the lines are too literary to make sense to the kids. Pinocchio is said to be a puppet without strings, but we see both strings and puppeteer. These mistakes puzzles the children and their attention wanders. Yet never for long, because they want to know what will happen next; or, rather, they want to know that the story will work out the way they have been told it works out. Also because, though the characters have been far better depicted by Disney and in books, there is innocent fun to be had in watching how live theatre brings off such things as Pinocchio's nose growing or shrinking; or the sea-voyage out from Naples harbour; or Pinocchio and Pa battling in the waves. Not to mention how the whole tale is told by a cast of five, with puppets, dance, mime, and the staple panto routines of 'Be-hind you]' and 'Oh-yes-you-are]' I would like nonetheless to say there must be better things than this in the West End for young children this Christmas. But are there? True pantomime these days only occurs outside the centre of our capital. I worry about this, for Christmas is a perfect time in which to introduce kids to live theatre in all its multi-layered fun. Suitable fare for kids should be more widely on offer in town. But if you feel that your child is too young for rock musicals or Roald Dahl, and unsuited to the sublime theatrical fantasy of ballet, then Pinocchio it will have to be. At the Mermaid Theatre, EC4, 071-410-0000. Until January 8</p>

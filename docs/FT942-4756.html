			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Observer: Beating time Observer hears mixed reviews of the Geoffrey Burgon number - First Was The World - which has been commissioned specially for the Bank of England tercentenary and gets its world premiere tonight. A setting of a poem by Marvell, it involves several sharp lurches in tempo and requires the 140-strong choir to do much lengthy and noisy humming. However, the conductor, Sir David Willcocks, seems to have got the measure of tonight's star-studded audience of more than 150 central bank governors. He has reminded the choir performing the tricky number that the audience 'probably won't know that much about music. But they can count'.</p>

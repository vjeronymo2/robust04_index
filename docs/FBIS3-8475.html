Moslems thus violated the ceasefire which they had agreed  with Croats on February 25, warned a statement by the defence  ministry of the Bosnian Croat state of Herceg-Bosna in the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zagreb-based  Croatian Radio said.    The radio also said that Moslem forces were bringing in  reinforcements and regrouping their troops around Uskolje  (former Gornji Vakuf) in central Bosnia.    Heavy clashes between local Moslems and Croats, former  allies  in their war against Bosnian Serbs, have been underway in  central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina for over a year. The  clashes have not ceased even after the two sides agreed to form  a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement  was signed by representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats in  Washington on March 1, under strong pressure from the United  States.    Moslem forces opened strong infantry and artillery fire on  Serb villages and positions in the area of Mt. Ozren, northern  Bosnia, on Monday and Tuesday, Bosnian Serb military sources  said.    The army of the Serb republic repulsed a Moslem combined  artillery-infantry attack in the region of this mountain, the  sources said.    Strong Moslem infantry attacks were also repulsed in the  valley of the River Trebava and around Maglaj in northern Bosnia.    Moslem forces used helicopters to scout Bosnian Serb army  positions in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the United  Nations resolution on a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

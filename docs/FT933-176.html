			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: Oddball 'Cinderella' - Ballet We can forget the pumpkin and the mice. And the Fairy Godmother. We can, indeed, forget any earlier Cinderellas: Christopher Gable's new staging for his Northern Ballet Theatre is an exercise in de-mystification, decorated with Freudian hang-ups. The production, with design by Tim Hatley and a new score by Philip Feeney, had its first performance on Tuesday night in Sheffield's prettily refurbished Lyceum Theatre. Gable, with Rachel Lopez de la Nieta as 'choreographic assistant', has opted for the heavily dramatic - not to say melodramatic - manner he has sought to give to many of the stagings offered by NBT, of which troupe he is director. So, in the first act, we see the deaths of Cinderella's brother and mother during a Ruritanian apple-harvest, events whose dramatic impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the dear departed haunt the rest of the action as singularly busy ghosts. The brother occupies himself doing Cinders' housework; the mother acts as a spectral modiste, producing frocks from The Beyond. Stepmother and Stepsisters are the traditionally nasty lot, ready to inflict punishment, to tear dresses and passions to tatters, and to brand our heroine with a poker. That the stepmother eventually chops off one daughter's toes so that the shoe shall fit, is by the way. Cinderella's father takes to the bottle, and during a waltz makes a pass at his daughter. This, unsurprisingly, freezes her emotions - it didn't do much for mine, either - and when the Prince becomes attentive at the last of the action's three big dances (Gable has seriously over-balled the tale) Cinderella is less than enraptured. But, although now seen in vest and braces, the Prince wins the waif, and a flock of obliging ravens peck out the eyes of the stepmother and her brood. Nearly three hours are passed in the company of this anxious affair. Gable's policy for NBT is much concerned with the staging of full-length dance spectacles, in which dance seems the weaker partner. In an earlier Romeo and Juliet, dramatic vivacity was taken to almost hysterical lengths. The company's revision of Swan Lake was manic. The positive benefits of Gable's style were, though, clear to see in the recent Christmas Carol, where Dickens' strong plotting, as well as his sentimentality, provided an ideal armature for a production nearer music-theatre than dance. In each of these, a recognisable title was a significant factor in attracting an audience. This Cinderella will not, I hazard, alarm NBT's faithful, though it may take ballet-lovers, gently reared on Ashton or on Russian versions - where the classic dance is dominant - by surprise. Philip Feeney's music is eclectic, veering from the abrasive to the sweet, but interestingly scored. Tim Hatley's basic set is a dimly reflecting box, in which panels rise and fall to allow changes of location. It is clever, somewhat claustrophobic, a bit grim. Costuming I found uniformly unattractive and, like the staging, heavy-handed. What Gable and Miss Lopez de la Nieta propose as choreography is what one might expect: dramatic structure is more deftly done than steps, and, curiously, the characterisations look sketchy. Jayne Regan has attractive, delicate moments as the heroine; other roles are more like received ideas than personalities. The staging is over-run with birds: one flock obligingly pick rice from the kitchen ashes; cockerels fight as cabaret at a ball; doves behave dove-ishly and ravens are retributive. The sum effect is very odd: but the piece itself is an oddity in its resistance to the idea (which Gable knows well from dancing in such works as The Invitation or Romeo and Juliet or The Two Pigeons) of classic choreography as an art able to express the most intense emotion. And as a presentation of an enduring myth, which is the sub-text to the staging, this Cinderella lacks that mysterious joy which we know it can have in dance and the theatre. Northern Ballet Theatre's regional tour lasts until January 1994 and is sponsored by British Telecom</p>

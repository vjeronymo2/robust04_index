			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SQUABBLE OVER AIRLINE MOVIE  </P> <P> It was with amazement and disgust that I read of Steve Sun's dispute with  United Airlines over the use of his personal headset to listen to an in-flight  movie without paying the $4 fee (Metro, Nov. 10). It is unbelievable that he  actually thought the fee charged by the airline was to "rent" the headset when  it is so obvious that the fee is to "listen" to the movie.  </P> <P> And why, after being so informed, did he continue to listen to the movie  without paying the $4 fee?  </P> <P> If he is intelligent enough to know "what you can and can't do on an airplane,"  why did he choose to so blatantly disregard this rule? Does Sun believe that he  should be accorded special privileges as a result of his occupation as  evidenced by his statement "I'm a lawyer and if anything happened on the  ground, I would file a suit"?  </P> <P> As an educated member in our society, Sun has a duty to conduct his life in a  responsible manner. Whatever his intent -- whether it be for exposure in The  Times, to save $4 or to beat the system -- Sun's behavior is a disgrace to the  legal profession. Unfortunately, this is a standard we have come to expect from  that "profession."  </P> <P> M.D. NIKORA, Los Angeles  </P></p>

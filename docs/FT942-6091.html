			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Orders 'robust' at BTR Nylex Mr Alan Jackson, chairman of BTR Nylex, the Asia-Pacific arm of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that orders and sales performance in the first four months of 1994 had been robust. 'Apart from isolated exceptions, the vast majority of our companies in these markets are well ahead of prior-year orders and sales, although not all these companies are yet achieving commensurate profit drop-through performance', he told shareholders at the annual meeting in Melbourne. Mr Jackson added that the company's Taiwan Polymer businesses were benefiting from more favourable pricing, and operating profits for that sector were substantially up on those of the equivalent period of 1993. He expected 'substantial' gains for the company overall in 1994.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Midland ahead in second half: Shares rise as payout announced. Bad debt charges at Pounds 903m MIDLAND Group yesterday bucked the trend of recent bank results by disclosing a sharp improvement in profits in the second half of 1991. It confounded City of London analysts' forecasts by paying a dividend, though it is maintaining the payment at the 1.7p level paid in the latter half of 1990, when it made a heavy cut. As a result, Midland's share price rose 21p to 260p, adding Pounds 165m to the value of the bank. Midland was the last of the big banks to report its results. Although it has made progress, the scale of its charges to cover the risk of bad debts - at Pounds 903m - provided final confirmation that 1991 was the worst year since the 1930s for UK banks. Collectively the four banks - Midland, National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds - have suffered loan losses of Pounds 5.6bn. Midland's bad debt charge was far lower than analysts had been expecting. But on one important measure, it suffered worse loan loss problems than rivals. Its bad debt charge was the biggest of the clearers if measured as a proportion of its UK loans - though it was the smallest in absolute terms. Separately, Mr Brian Pearse, the chief executive, responded to City speculation that it was about to merge with another bank by saying he had no desire to do such a deal. 'It is not clear what advantages it would bring', he said. But he said he had no doubt that rivals would be considering whether to make a takeover offer for Midland, because Midland's share price was so much lower than the value of its net assets. He added that he was sure Midland would be changed beyond recognition in the coming few years, perhaps by combining with another bank, because he is convinced there are 'too many' financial institutions in the UK and worldwide. However, Midland's pre-tax profits grew in 1991 from Pounds 11m to Pounds 36m. The recovery was particularly striking between the two halves of the year. It made Pounds 107m before tax in the second six months - more than National Westminster Bank, which is twice its size - having made a Pounds 71m loss in the first half. The main contributor to the second-half recovery was a decline in the bad debt charge to Pounds 373m from Pounds 530m. An analysis of the full-year result highlights other trends described as encouraging by Midland's chairman, Sir Peter Walters. Overheads were unchanged, due in large part to a reduction of 4,900 in staff numbers during the past 18 months. There was also a 7 per cent rise in interest income, twice as fast as that achieved by any of its rivals. Sir Peter said he was optimistic that Midland would continue to buck economic conditions by increasing its income. He added that he expected the bad debt rate in 1992 to run at the reduced rate experienced in the latter half of 1991. One respect in which Midland remains weaker than its English peers is in the strength of its balance sheet, as measured by its tier 1 or core capital, which is the internationally accepted measure. Midland's tier 1 capital is equivalent to 5.5 per cent of its assets, the same ratio as NatWest's and far higher than many foreign banks. However, Barclays has a 5.9 per cent ratio and Lloyds has 6.2 per cent. But Mr Pearse said that he had no desire to raise money through a rights issue. Lex, Page 18 Background, Page 20</p>

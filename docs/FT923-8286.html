			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: WHOdunnit Staff at the World Health Organisation's Geneva headquarters have an unsolved murder on their hands - the decapitation of a Japanese carp, long-time resident of the restaurant's ornamental pool. Could this be the work of disaffected officials who want Hiroshi Nakajima, the Japanese director-general, out of the UN agency's top job? He is being challenged by Mohammed Abdelmoumene of Algeria, who was removed last month from his post as deputy director-general. Nevertheless, Abdelmoumene's campaign to take over from Nakajima when his present term expires in July 1993, seems to be gaining momentum. France and the US have declared their support and other European Community members look likely to follow suit. Nakajima has been criticised for lack of clear leadership at a time when the WHO has a key role to play, for instance in the worldwide battle against Aids, and for his authoritarian management style.</p>

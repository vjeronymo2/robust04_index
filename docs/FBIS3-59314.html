			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Qin Pinduan (4440 0756 4551) of Anhui University </F> Population Institute: "Chinese Population Control: Adjustments  Under Market Economy"]    [Excerpt] With the development of the market economy and  the deepening of China's rural structural economic reform,  China's overall birth rate increased from 17.82 per thousand in  1979 to 22.28 per thousand in 1982. During the same period the  natural growth rate increased from 11.61 per thousand to 15.68  per thousand. The rural population birth rate increased from  18.43 per thousand to 22.97 per thousand and the natural growth  rate from 12.04 per thousand to 15.97 per thousand during this  period. This had a huge impact on population control in China.    First impact: Economic. With the rise of market economy in  the villages, the rural economy will take off quickly. And the  villagers' misunderstanding of family planning cadres' work will  increase further as will the difficulties of that work.  Moreover, the growth of the rural economy will weaken the  effectiveness of economic penalties for excessive births. The  wealthy do not fear penalties, and even less do the poor,  thereby rendering almost nil the control function of economic  penalties.    Second impact: Regional disparities will increase further.  With the development of the market economy, economic disparities  between the coastal and inland regions will increase further.  Unbalanced attitudes brought about by poverty and prosperity  will be exacerbated, and difficulties controlling the population  in impoverished areas will also increase. The vicious circle of  "the poorer the more births, the more births the poorer" will be  further exacerbated.    Third impact: Administrative control functions will be  further weakened. Administrative means are a major aspect of  population control in China, and the growth of the market  economy will weaken these administrative control mechanisms.  This weakening is especially evident in rural areas. The  establishment of the responsibility system in rural households  was the first instance of the weakening of administrative  control functions, and the establishment of the market economy  will be the second.    Fourth impact: On population planning. Population planning  is  formulated from top to bottom, as the Central Committee draws up  the overall plan, which is then broken down to provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions, and then further broken  down to prefectures, cities, and counties, and then directly to  the township, town, and village. Within the structure of the  market economy there is also a market population, namely a  market for population demand and for productivity. Thus, with  population childbirth there exists the birth of markets (which  is determined by the demand of the population market). Thus  when drafting a population plan, we must consider the market  demand of the population and proceed from bottom to top. When  market demand is great, the plan can be appropriately relaxed,  and when market demand is small, it can be appropriately  tightened.</p>

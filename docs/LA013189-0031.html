			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: BENEFITS  </P> <P> Former members of Czechoslovakia's banned rock group, Plastic People of the  Universe, joined U.S. musicians at a benefit concert Sunday in Manhattan for  Ivan Martin Jirous, the group's manager and guiding light who was jailed in  Prague last October after his public reading of a manifesto protesting human  rights abuses in Czechoslovakia. The rock group has become a symbol of  resistance in Czechoslovakia since its inception in 1968. Veteran members of  avant-garde bands the Fugs and Captain Beefheart also took the stage Sunday  with poets Allen Ginsberg and Ed Sanders, as films and slides from the banned  group's 20-year history were projected.

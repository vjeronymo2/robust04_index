			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The research group of Prof. Yusaku Takita et al. of  the Oita University School of Engineering has been successful in  efficiently separating Freon 12, which is used in automobile air  conditioners, etc., into carbon dioxide with a newly developed  fine-grain catalyst. If the reaction takes place at 550C,  almost all of the original freon is separated, and after five  hours, a separation rate of approximately 70% can be  maintained. This means the creation of a low-cost catalyst with  a long life, which has been the problem with catalytic  separation of freon up to now, and it opens the path to mass  processing.    Since freon is chemically stable, combustion decomposition  methods have been used for separation processing. However, a   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-11A>           Normal Pressure Fixed Bed Flow-Through Reaction Apparatus </FIG>  high temperature of 800C is necessary, and after  incineration hydrofluoric acid forms, so there are problems such  as corrosion of the incinerator.    Takita et al. focussed on catalytic separation methods that  have low temperatures and developed a new catalyst. This is one  in which zirconium oxide (33%) and chromium oxide  (67%) are  agitated in an aqueous solution of metal nitrates, the water  evaporated off and the remainder fired at 500C in an air  atmosphere for five hours; after this, it is pressed and formed  into fine spherical grains. In the freon separation experiment,  an apparatus in which one part freon, five parts air and three  parts water vapor were supplied to a pass-through type electric  furnace was used, and the catalyst was set up in the center of  the furnace.       Using one gram of catalyst and introducing 18cc of the  mixture (2cc of which were freon) into the furnace at a  temperature of 550C, 80% was separated into carbon  dioxide, and the remainder was absorbed in an alkaline solution  in the form of a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, etc. In  addition, if the concentration of the freon in the mixture is  reduced to 2.7% separation into carbon dioxide at a yield  of  90% was possible.    Prof. Takita said, "From here on we will set up a miniplant,  and work on development of a long life catalyst and improvement  of the separation rate."</p>

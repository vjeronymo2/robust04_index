			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGALITY OF 'HUMAN BUGS' IN CHICAGO STING QUESTIONED  </P> <P> The federal investigation of alleged fraud at Chicago's two major commodities  exchanges may result in a precedent-setting court battle over the government's  right to use "human bugs" in undercover sting operations, attorneys who have  been retained by some of the traders said Friday.  </P> <P> At issue is whether the government can legally record "ambient conversation"  without a court order, said commodities lawyer and former federal prosecutor  Stephen J. Senderowitz.  </P> <P> "This is an issue that has never really been decided in court," Senderowitz  told a standing-room-only meeting of the Chicago Bar Assn.'s futures  regulations law committee. "Evidence that has been gathered as a result of  violations of the (federal) eavesdropping statutes taints anything it comes in  contact with."  </P> <P> At the same meeting, criminal lawyer Edward Genson disclosed new details about  how government agents operated to gather evidence in the undercover FBI  investigation of trading practices at the Chicago Board of Trade and the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest commodities futures  exchanges.  </P> <P> Agents, posing as traders, worked on the exchange floors for almost two years  wearing concealed recording devices to collect evidence of wrongdoing by  traders and brokers.  </P> <P> In the coordinated twin investigations of the Board of Trade and the Mercantile  Exchange, government agents did not have prior court approval to tape record  conversations on the trading floor and in the trading pits.  </P> <P> Federal law allows a government agent to wear a concealed recording device to  tape a conversation with a targeted suspect in an investigation without a court  order. But, Senderowitz said, to make recordings in a room with a concealed  recording device, the government must get the OK from a federal judge to plant  the bug.  </P> <P> "In this case, you have a situation involving a private exchange," Senderowitz  said. "The public is not entitled to be on (the trading) floor. If they get on  the floor, they go through security checkpoints with a guest badge and they  can't even get into the pits. The FBI agents got into the pit through a ruse.  And once in the pit, without any identifiable target, they acted as roving bugs  in our opinion. In fact, they acted like a planted microphone."  </P> <P> "Is that the type of overhear that needs judicial approval, or is it the type  that does not need judicial approval?" That, Senderowitz said, is the question.  </P> <P> Senderowitz did not refer to any specific cases in his remarks and refused to  respond to questions from reporters about whether any challenges have been  filed in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 25 Interviews  </P> <P> However, other legal sources said a challenge of the government's case based on  improper use of "human bugs" would probably have to be decided by the U.S.  Supreme Court in a precedent-setting decision.  </P> <P> In his remarks, Genson disclosed that an FBI undercover agent who traded at the  Mercantile Exchange and used the name Peter William Vogel ended most trading  days with "some sort of disparity" in his trading account. In some instances,  he volunteered to "eat" losses to ingratiate himself to brokers. In other  cases, he agreed to apparently illegal schemes to wipe out losses.  </P> <P> Genson said his investigation, based on 25 interviews with traders and brokers,  revealed that Vogel asked "brokers to launder money through some sort of ruse.  A lot of people turned that down."  </P> <P> Senderowitz, who prosecuted commodities crimes when he worked for the Justice  Department in Chicago, said that if the investigation were focusing on  relatively common trading infractions, there would be no need for an undercover  investigation. Information on those activities could be obtained from the  exchanges' internal disciplinary reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Humor in Yen Pit  </P> <P> "I think some of the more dastardly things reported may have been the main  thrust of the investigation," Senderowitz said. "I think it remains to be seen  whether money laundering and tax fraud are ultimately the subject of  indictments."  </P> <P> The undercover investigation, which has kept Chicago's best legal minds busy  since it first surfaced a month ago, has spawned both fear and paranoia on the  trading floors of the exchanges but has also resulted in some black humor.  </P> <P> This week, traders in the Mercantile Exchange's yen pit -- a focus of the  federal probe -- were seen wearing little white lapel buttons to indicate they  were not carrying concealed tape recorders. The buttons showed a microphone  crossed out by a red slash.  </P></p>

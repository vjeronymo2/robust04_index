			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHANCES OF RESCUING SEA LION SEEN AS  IMPROVED  </P> <P> County animal control officers hope to try in the next few days to rescue  Gilly, the young California sea lion with a gill net slicing into its neck, a  Malibu veterinarian said.  </P> <P> "We think the chances are much better this time," said Dr. Nancy Smith, who  organized a campaign to raise more than $4,400 to buy a net gun that she will  donate to the county Department of Animal Control.  </P> <P> Smith said the instrument, which costs $3,100, has been ordered and is expected  to arrive this week. The remainder of the funds will also be donated to the  county.  </P> <P> Gilly first attracted widespread attention in February when a fisherman spotted  it on a bait platform a quarter of a mile off the Malibu Pier, where the sea  lion often rests. Rescuers have tried several times to capture it by throwing a  net over it, but Gilly has eluded them. Experts have said that unless the  animal is captured and the net removed, it will eventually choke to death.  </P></p>

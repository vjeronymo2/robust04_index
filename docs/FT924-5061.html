			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc chief sees possible bar to sell-off THE FRENCH government's plans to sell a substantial minority take in Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals group, could be scuppered by a legal hitch, according to the company. Rhone-Poulenc yesterday confirmed a warning by Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, its chairman, that under French privatisation law the state may not be allowed to sell as many shares as it had intended. Mr Fourtou, a staunch supporter of privatisation for Rhone-Poulenc, warned that this plan could fail because it might involve the government selling below the level permitted by France's privatisation commission. He did not specify the level, but warned there was a 'one in two chance' of the state having to scale down the proposed sale. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, this week announced plans to sell at least 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc (10.6 per cent of its equity) before February. This sale, combined with an accompanying change in the status of Rhone-Poulenc's shares to enfranchise non-voting shareholders, will reduce the government's share of voting stock from 77.5 per cent to 45 per cent - although it would still hold an effective majority of the voting shares thanks to the 19 per cent stake held by other state-controlled institutions.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIES SAY NOTICES OF MEETINGS WON'T END  </P> <P> Although a little-noticed provision of the state budget suspends an  open-meeting law for city councils and other elected bodies, many local  officeholders say they will continue to post an agenda three days before any  meeting, stick to that agenda and allow public testimony.  </P> <P> Budget-writers suspended the open-meeting law for a year as a cost-saving  measure. A recent study indicated that it would cost the state more than $2  million annually to reimburse local governments for the cost of complying with  the law, although some critics contend it actually would cost much less.  </P> <P> "I have heard it said that it would save millions of dollars, but I don't see  how," said Tustin Mayor Richard B. Edgar. "I mean, how much time does it take  for an individual to take a piece of paper and put it on a bulletin board?  Practically nothing. And what is the cost of letting people speak at a public  meeting? Nothing that I can see."  </P> <P> Public interest groups and newspaper editorialists are furious about the move,  saying it will allow local lawmakers to conduct shady, back-room dealings.  </P> <P> "We think it's a disaster for open meetings at the local level," said Ruth  Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause. "There are unscrupulous local agencies  that will no doubt be delighted now to hold meetings without the public's  knowledge and without public comment."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney agreed: "This measure cuts at the heart of the  democratic process."  </P> <P> Officials in a number of Orange County cities said they intend to follow the  provisions of the now-suspended law. Many said they posted agendas and allowed  public comment before it was required and will continue to do so, even though  it is no longer a mandate.  </P> <P> Citing the importance of community involvement in local government, the  Huntington Beach City Council unanimously passed a resolution last week to  continue posting agendas and listening to public comment.  </P> <P> "We're pretty used to the current procedures," Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays  said. "As long as I'm mayor, we'll continue to have public comments. It's very  important to have community input in local government and it's important to  have agenda postings."  </P> <P> The Tustin City Council will consider such a resolution at its next meeting and  officials in other cities have voiced their support for continuing under the  previous requirements.  </P> <P> "This City Council is not interested in holding secret meetings," said Irvine  City Manager Paul Brady. "We have no interest in changing the public's access  to their government."  </P> <P> The open-meeting law was one of 19 state mandates -- including a requirement  that police officers provide assistance to stranded motorists and that judges  consider victims' statements when sentencing felons -- that were suspended this  year to achieve a claimed savings of $59 million.  </P> <P> James Apps, a budget analyst for the Department of Finance, said most of those  requirements were "totally unnecessary" because local government would perform  the functions even if the state didn't pick up the tab.  </P> <P> Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) introduced legislation Monday to reinstate the  law. Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), author of the 1986  open-meeting law, said he would follow suit.  </P> <P> "I don't think any public entities are going to abuse the law in the next year,  but the potential is there," Connelly said. "There is a history of public  entities acting without public notice. In some instances it's negligence, but  in other instances it may have been intended."  </P> <P> So far no state money has been paid out because of the open-meeting requirement  and only one local agency -- the Los Angeles City Council, which asked for  $12,000 in 1987 -- has ever filed for reimbursement.  </P> <P> While the Orange County Board of Supervisors has not considered the issue, the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, estimated it would cost $1.6 million  over four years to pay for the posting of agendas and allowing public  testimony.  </P> <P> Some critics challenge those numbers, however. "That's just junk. It has no  basis in fiscal reality. It's not going to cost the state a dime to enforce  this mandate," said Connelly, adding that it is relatively inexpensive to type  and post a two- or three-page agenda.  </P> <P> Times correspondents Shannon Sands and Greg Hernandez contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

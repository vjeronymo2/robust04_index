			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wentworth plans rights as losses rise to Pounds 5.4m WENTWORTH International Group reported pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 5.4m in the year to March 31 and has proposed a refinancing package as, in the words of Mr Robert Gill, its chief executive, the only alternative to receivership or liquidation. The USM-quoted plastic packaging products group is to raise Pounds 9.5m in a 7-for-2 rescue rights issue of up to 380.5m shares at 2.5p. Monceau Investments - an arm of Banque Indosuez, which holds 61.3 per cent of Wentworth - has irrevocably undertaken to apply for its rights in full, and Indosuez is underwriting the balance. If no other shareholders were to take up their rights, Monceau and Indosuez would together hold 91.4 per cent of the enlarged share capital - above the 90 per cent ceiling allowed by the Stock Exchange regarding the suitability of shares to be traded on the USM. Mr Gill said he wanted Wentworth to retain its dealing facility, and he felt that Indosuez would want this too. The Pounds 9.5m raised will be used to pay down borrowings which at March 31 stood at Pounds 19.7m, giving gearing of 200 per cent. Pro forma gearing after the rights and on the year-end figure would be 55 per cent. Further, the group is to convert most of its outstanding loans and overdrafts which currently fall due within one year, to terms of between three and 10 years. Indosuez is also making available a new working capital facility of Pounds 2.2m. For the rights to proceed - the 2.5p price is below the current 10p nominal value of the existing shares - each existing ordinary share is to be sub-divided into one new ordinary of 1p and one deferred share of 9p. The rescue rights has been made necessary by the high level of Belgian interest costs - Pounds 2.3m this time, against Pounds 1.85m last - and 'extremely difficult trading conditions' in the UK and especially in Belgium, which, Mr Gill said, is where the UK was two years ago. In sterling terms, turnover grew to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 25.6m), but in real terms it was flat. Paraphane, the Belgian company which was acquired in 1990 and accounts for about half group turnover, had 'an appalling year', said Mr Gill. Edwards, also in Belgium, remained unsold. McGregor Rutland in the UK, with turnover of about Pounds 5m, did well, he said. Losses per share were 2.64p (3.89p) after a tax credit of Pounds 2.53m (charge Pounds 181,000).</p>

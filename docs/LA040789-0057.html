			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO NAMES LAW SCHOOL DEAN  </P> <P> Kristine Strachan, a University of Utah law professor, has been named dean of  the University of San Diego School of Law, making her the first woman in the  school's history to hold the post and one of just a handful of female law  school deans in the nation.  </P> <P> Strachan succeeds Sheldon Krantz, who resigned the post at the end of the  1987-88 academic term to complete a book on the future of the legal profession.  </P> <P> Active in national legal education groups and a leading advocate of curriculum  reform for law schools, Strachan, 45, was selected after a yearlong search by a  14-member committee, which included faculty, students and alumni. The law  school at the University of San Diego, a private Catholic institution, is  considered the top law school in the San Diego area.  </P> <P> The school's new dean is married to Salt Lake City lawyer Gordon C. Strachan,  who was indicted in the Watergate scandal in 1974 but was granted immunity for  his testimony before a Senate committee. Charges against him were dismissed in  March, 1975.  </P> <P> Professor Lester Snyder, chairman of the search committee, called Kristine  Strachan "an outstanding teacher," whose extensive national connections will  enhance the university's reputation outside the West and attract prestigious  faculty, particularly women and minorities.  </P> <P> "She has practiced law, she has written, she has taught, she is extraordinarily  well-liked by her colleagues in Utah," Snyder said. "We think all of those add  up to an exceptional candidate for dean."  </P> <P> Strachan, who has two teen-age children, said in a telephone interview Thursday  from Salt Lake City that she was "thrilled" with her new job, which she will  begin in mid-August.  </P> <P> "This is a rare and outstanding opportunity to take what is a very good school  and make it one that will rival the very best," said Strachan, who grew up in  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> She attended The Bishop's School in La Jolla before going on to USC and Boalt  Hall, the law school at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Strachan's selection brings to 11 the number of women who occupy the top post  at law schools accredited by the American Bar Assn. There are 175 such schools.  </P></p>

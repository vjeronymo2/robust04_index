			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Faramarz Qorabaghi] </F>   [Text] News Service -- Late in the year 1371 [21 March  1992-20 March 1993] a report made the rounds among foreign  diplomats living in Tehran that the consul of the Dutch Embassy  was infected with AIDS. This report was also published in some  of the nation's press, but the Foreign Ministry made no comment  on the publication to this report.    Also, last year we saw the quiet expulsion of a Brazilian  diplomat from Tehran, and again the Foreign Ministry chose to  remain silent on the subject.    The periodic publication of reports of this type shows the  necessity for careful hygienic monitoring of the foreign  diplomats living in Iran. Although some of the nation's  officials believe that it is proper to look the other way on  this matter, it must be emphasized that the hygienic monitoring  of foreign diplomats is the lawful right of any country,  including Iran.    Of course, the monitoring procedures must be such that they  create maximum confidence for the appropriate officials. The  Foreign Ministry can test the foreign diplomats living in Tehran  after informing the diplomatic organizations in the other  countries and coordinating this with the responsible domestic  organizations, in order to ensure their physical health (it is  worth mentioning that the fact that the Brazilian Embassy's  second secretary and commercial attache was infected with AIDS  became known only after he went to one of Tehran's hospitals for  emergency treatment).    However, the fact that the Foreign Ministry is negligent in  its monitoring of foreign diplomats in Tehran, especially the  diplomats from non-Muslim countries, is not the only point  deserving of criticism. Many other questions also arise. For  example, why do officials in the Foreign Ministry think the  publication of reports such as the one previously mentioned and  providing this information to the public and the media will  undermine the Foreign Ministry's relations with foreign  countries?    The Foreign Ministry's officials are well aware that the  media and the press in the Western nations have close ties to  the diplomatic organizations in their countries. These ties are  not confined to the exchange of information and reports. They  even come into play in the incitement of public opinion and  propaganda controversies; for example, we have seen repeatedly  that some Western governments, before making a hostile political  move against Iran, have aroused public opinion against Iran  through their media. On the other hand, instances have been seen  where first the Western governments have incited the public with  litanies against Iran and then their mass media have undertaken  a propaganda campaign, even going so far as to slander Iran.    In Iran, however, the Foreign Ministry behaves differently  towards the media. With regard to the AIDS infection of the  Dutch consul, for example, the Foreign Ministry remained silent  despite its knowledge of this subject, and unfortunately when  the Dutch Embassy lied in its answer to the publication of this  report in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Foreign Ministry continued this  unbecoming silence. Now, some time later, the truth of the claim  made by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been vindicated. Of course, some  people may think that reports like this are not worthy of being  published in respectable publications and are more  characteristic of the sensationalist press. We must emphasize  that we do not support the sensationalist press in any way, but  one must not shun reporting on events, and "reality" must not be  kept from the public.    The people and the press are asking: Why, when the Turkish  Consulate in Urmia deliberately made fraudulent modifications to  the electrical power meter in its consulate building, did  Foreign Ministry officials fail to react to this illegal  activity and put the seal of silence on their lips, as they have  done in other cases? Indifference on the part of Foreign  Ministry officials in cases like this is seen by public opinion  as implicit acceptance and collaborative silence on the part of  the aforementioned officials, and of course the Foreign Ministry  does not agree with such an implication.    The matter of the expulsion of a Brazilian diplomat from  Tehran because he is infected with AIDS is not something that  should be kept from public view.    In expelling him, the Foreign Ministry has not made a  mistake  whose disclosure it should fear. When in countries like England  even animals are quarantined when entering the country, it is  natural that more attention than before should be given to  health and hygiene in a country with several tens of millions.  Monitoring the hygiene of foreign diplomats in Tehran is a small  but very important step in this regard.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values Compel at Pounds 19m with 125p share price Shares in Compel Group were priced at 125p per share yesterday in a placing with institutional investors which values the computer systems and services company at Pounds 19.07m. The group is issuing 2.48m new shares to raise Pounds 3.1m, with existing shareholders selling 4.12m shares worth Pounds 5.15m. Directors and their families will retain about 24 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Mr Neville Davis, chairman and chief executive, said: 'this is funding working capital needs which the business requires to keep growing. We have made acquisitions over recent years and continue to look for more, but we have nothing in mind at the moment.' Compel intends to expand its sales force at its existing UK network of seven offices, with a new office planned to open in the City. The proceeds of the flotation provide a partial exit for Compel's venture capital investors, 3i and Lloyds Development Capital. It is also expected to boost the share option scheme for employees, a third of whom are already shareholders. The company, which focused on corporate clients after a management buy-out in 1987, provides computer systems to blue chip and public sector customers including Glaxo, Manchester City Council and the Post Office. The group announced a sharp increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 604,000 to Pounds 2.06m in the year to June 30, following a wide-ranging restructuring which saw staff numbers cut by 14 per cent to 227. In the same period, turnover rose from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 54.5m, with operating profit lifting from Pounds 898,000 to Pounds 2.36m. At the placing price, the historic p/e ratio is 12.08, with a notional dividend yield of 4 per cent. The issue is sponsored and fully underwritten by Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities, which is also the broker to the placing.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Seoul encourages investment South Korea yesterday announced measures to encourage stock investments as part of the government's programme to cut the dependence of companies on bank loans as their main source of finance. The government wants companies to increase the raising of capital on financial markets to weaken amily ownership of the country's leading conglomerates and ease the financial burden on the banking system, which is suffering from many non-performing loans. All listed companies, excluding financial firms, will be allowed to raise Won300bn (Pounds 242m) in new share issues annually, up from Won200bn, beginning on January 3, the first trading day in 1995. Any listed company will be allowed to raise paid-in capital by up to 50 per cent if it posted a net profit in the previous financial year, instead of the more rigorous requirement of achieving at least a 5 per cent return on paid-in capital. Financial requirements for companies wishing to go public have also been relaxed.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The head of the grand jury that examined Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's role in the  death of Mary Jo Kopechne says the panel never got a chance to properly  investigate the fatal accident because of a political "cover-up," Newsweek  reported. The Massachusetts Democrat received a suspended sentence for leaving  the scene of an accident, but the grand jury never pursued felony charges, said  Leslie Leland, foreman of the Dukes County grand jury. Kennedy could not  immediately be reached for comment. Kopechne, a passenger, was killed July 18,  1969, when the car Kennedy was driving across the bridge at Chappaquiddick on  Martha's Vineyard, Mass., skidded into the water. Leland said the grand jury  was prevented from subpoenaing witnesses or examining a copy of the inquest.  </P></p>

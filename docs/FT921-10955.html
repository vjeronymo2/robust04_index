			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Technology: Engineers by design - A degree course designed to meet industry's needs beyond 2000 A future British Aerospace technical director, taking up the job in the year 2010, might have been sighted recently in a teaching hangar at Loughborough University of Technology. He or she would have been sitting on a plastic chair with back to an opened-up Jaguar fighter aircraft, listening to university staff extolling the virtues of their institution. This putative director was an applicant for what the university, in its prospectus, cautiously describes as 'a multi-disciplinary course aimed at preparing you for a career concerned with the design and project management of complex engineering systems'. What makes this course different is not only that BAe will be paying for it, at least for the first five years, but also that BAe and the university designed the course together. The undergraduate study is tailored to fit what Harry Thomason, the Loughborough pro vice-chancellor, called: 'The concept of the kind of person BAe wants.' The group wants to create an elite of systems engineers, the next generation of technical leaders. 'They're going to head the company,' said Stephen Grigg, soon to be appointed as BAe's director of educational affairs. The first aspirants start their undergraduate studies at Loughborough next October and should emerge as technological polymaths in 1997. That, at least, is the hope. The university claims that 'this is the first-ever degree course to be designed from scratch for the needs of industry beyond 2000'. Certainly it is a rare attempt to marry the intellectual rigour and independence, which traditionally have been the base of academic life, to the ruder commercial demands of industry. Some universities would find the juxtaposition uncomfortable, but Loughborough historically has had a strong vocational bias; indeed, it and the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, in a country with a notorious and chronic shortage of engineers, have the biggest engineering departments among British universities. Loughborough and BAe enjoy a long history of co-operation. The donation of the Jaguar, precisely to enable students to understand how systems knit together, is testimony to that. The genesis of the new course was a private conversation between senior BAe executives and Thomason. From this, it emerged that BAe could see the need over the next decades for a new type of engineer but did not believe that British universities could supply them. This new type of engineer is a systems engineer. Someone who understands, without being bogged down by detail, individual and specialised engithe ability to knit these practices together to create a system or series of interacting systems. BAe hitherto has been creating its own systems engineers, explained Grigg. 'It takes them off a variety of courses and converts them, in an ad hoc way.' The Loughborough venture 'turns the whole thing on its head. It puts into people a breadth of engineering and an integrated approach.' Instead of starting with the particular and going to the general, the general approach is adopted from the start, with reference to the particular. The graduate from this course, once imbued with industrial practice, should be in a position to manage research and development teams by talking to and controlling specialist engineers. Products and systems as a whole will be designed by teams: the old approach of designing the separate bits and then trying to fit them together has gone for good. But that is years away. Next October the first 50 students will start the course. In 1997 they will emerge as M. Eng. (Systems Engineering). Of these 50, 40 will be sponsored by BAe; the remaining 10 will be selected by the university through the normal university places clearing system. There will be ample opportunity for BAe to decide whether it likes the students and for the students to decide whether they like BAe. Although the implication of sponsorship is that the successful graduate will join BAe, there is no contractual obligation on either side outside the course itself. BAe will pay the students Pounds 1,200 a year on top of what would normally be received in grants, but the students will be expected to do vacation work and a year of work experience at BAe. When they are at BAe, doing this work, the students will be salaried employees. Although BAe has been sponsoring university students around the UK for years, the better to secure its corps of engineers, it has never before so deeply committed itself to a university. The teaching costs for each student will be Pounds 6,000 a year. BAe representatives sit on a joint committee with university staff to review the progress and content of the course. Alongside the undergraduate course, BAe is contemplating new grants for research projects at Loughborough. But the benefits are not all one way. Given the present system of university funding, Loughborough would not have been able to start a new course without financial assistance from the outside; it simply does not have the money. The University Funding Council will not support new courses until they are up and running, until there is proven demand. A university with a strong vocational tradition and expansive ambitions has therefore little choice but to forge partnerships with industry. At the same time, the establishment of the course is a means of breaking down departmental fiefs: it is genuine mix of engineering disciplines. The degree course will be managed by Roger Goodall, the head of Loughborough's department of electronic and electrical engineering. But the course draws in seven other departments: transport technology, computer studies, mathematical sciences, human sciences, mechanical engineering, materials engineering and polymer technology.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: When national limits are legal - European Court National laws restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements do not infringe Rome treaty rules on the free movement of goods, provided the laws are not aimed at imports from other member countries and provided they have the same effect on the commercial freedom to market domestic products as on imports, the European Court ruled last week. In a landmark ruling, all 13 judges said that, where those conditions were satisfied, this kind of national regulation was not by its nature intended to prevent or hinder access to the market by imports any more than it impeded the access of domestic products. The Court's ruling was in response to questions raised by the Strasbourg Tribunal de Grande Instance in connection with criminal proceedings against a Mr Keck and a Mr Mithouard. They were prosecuted for reselling products in an unaltered state at prices lower than their actual purchase price, in contravention of the French law which prohibits resale at a loss. In their defence, they argued that a general prohibition of resale at a loss was incompatible with the treaty ban on import restrictions as well as other rules on free movement and competition. At the outset the ECJ said that it was only appropriate to look at prohibition of resale at a loss from the perspective of the free movement of goods, since the prohibition was concerned with the marketing of goods. The Court confirmed its 1974 ruling in the Dassonville case that any measure which is capable of directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, hindering intra-Community trade can constitute an import restriction prohibited by the treaty. However, the fact that such legislation may restrict the volume of sales in the market concerned, and therefore the volume of sales of imports, is not decisive. It was not the purpose of national legislation imposing a general prohibition of resale at a loss to regulate trade between member countries. Before making its new ruling clarifying the scope of Community law in the context of import restrictions, the Court referred to its 1979 landmark decision in the 'Cassis de Dijon' case. The Court said this held that, in the absence of harmonisation of legislation, import restrictions prohibited by the treaty included obstacles to the free movement of goods where they were the consequence of applying national rules laying down certain requirements to be met by goods to imports from other member countries where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, even if those rules apply without distinction to all products. The only exception was when the application of the rules can be justified by a public-interest objective taking precedence over the free movement of goods. But the Court then said: 'However, contrary to what has previously been decided, the application to products from other member states of national provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements is not such as to hinder directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, trade between member states within the meaning of the Dassonville judgment', provided that the non-discrimination conditions are satisfied. The Court said this kind of rule falls outside the scope of the treaty ban on import restrictions. The judgment is important for business. First, the Court has set out to clarify the Rome treaty's ban on import restrictions in the context of national rules which limit commercial freedom but are not aimed at products from other member countries. It specifically refers to the need to re-examine and clarify its case law in view of the increasing tendency of businesses to invoke the treaty ban on import restrictions as a means of challenging any rules which limit their commercial freedom, even where such rules are not aimed at imports from other member countries. Second, the Court expressly acknowledges that this new ruling is 'contrary to what has previously been decided'.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Foreign Under Secretary Jose Miguel  Insulza stated that Chile believes resorting to military action  to restore democracy in Haiti would be inappropriate. Yesterday,  Insulza discussed the situation on the Caribbean island with  U.S. Ambassador Curtis Kamman, whom he summoned to disclose the  Chilean stance regarding this subject of continental interest.  Referring to the meeting, Insulza said: "I think everyone (the  countries) is aware that military action would be inappropriate."    President Bill Clinton has mentioned the possibility of  direct action to restore democracy in Haiti. Moreover, Insulza  stated that Chile regards the appointment of a president in  Port-au-Prince other than Jean-Bertrand Aristide as unacceptable.    Insulza explained that an agreement was reached with the  U.S.  ambassador to channel any actions referring to the situation in  Haiti through multilateral organizations such as the OAS and the  United Nations.    Insulza voiced support for the blockade against Haiti,  noting  that it entails neither food nor medicines. He added: "For  many years this is all the people of Haiti have had access to."    Insulza also disclosed that the Chilean ambassador to Haiti,  Luis Larrain, is currently in Santiago for consultations, but  that he will soon return to Port-au-Prince.</p>

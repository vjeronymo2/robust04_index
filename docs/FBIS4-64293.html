			<p>BFN     [Text] According to information received tonight by the  Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York,  intense negotiations are to be held at the United Nations after  the collapse of efforts by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  representative in Cyprus, to implement the confidence-building  measures. Clark is expected to arrive in New York tonight and  will have an emergency meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    UN Security Council circles told our correspondent that  Clark  is disappointed with the deadlock and is seriously considering  whether to renew his contract, which expires on 15 May.</p>

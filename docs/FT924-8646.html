			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Continental agrees Air Canada bid CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since late-1990, yesterday accepted a Dollars 450m (Pounds 290.3m) investment proposal from Air Canada, the larger of the two main Canadian carriers. The deal is another step in the trend towards global airlines alliances and follows a long bidding process. It will be implemented when Continental's reorganisation plan comes into effect and the carrier moves out of bankruptcy, probably in early 1993. The deal promises a welcome cash injection for Continental. Meanwhile, Air Canada has been manoeuvring for 18 months to become an emerging global airline, but has been dogged by a worsening financial performance as the Canadian recession has deepened. Air Canada, with a Texan investment partnership called Air Partners, plans to invest Dollars 450m. Of this, Dollars 110m will buy common stock in the carrier, shared between the Canadian carrier and the partnership. Air Canada will also buy Dollars 30m of non-voting preferred stock. Air Canada will also acquire Dollars 150m of debt securities backed by unencumbered assets of the US airline, while Air Partners will buy and then place out Dollars 160m of debt securities secured by assets of Continental Micronesia, a Continental affiliate. Air Canada will hold 27.5 per cent of the equity in the reorganised airline, and 24 per cent of the voting stock. Air Partners - headed by Mr David Bonderman and Mr James Coulter, who both have links with the billionaire Texan financier, Mr Robert Bass - will have a similar equity stake but 41 per cent of the votes. A further 35.6 per cent of the equity will go to Continental's unsecured creditors, in return for forgiving certain claims. The restructured US airline will have 18 board members - six Air Partners appointees, six from Air Canada, three representing unsecured creditors, two independents and one from management. The deal requires regulatory approval, but yesterday Air Partners said the bidders had attempted to comply with US caps on foreign ownership of airlines - which stand at 25 per cent of the voting rights and up to 49 per cent of the equity.

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BUSY OXNARD CONSULATE IS A HELP DEPOT  </P> <P> It's not embassy row, but the Oxnard transportation center is the home of one  of the busiest Mexican consulates in California.  </P> <P> Up well-worn stairs from the Greyhound bus station, above the Amtrak  concession, Consul Zoila Arroyo de Rodriguez and a staff of six tend to the  needs of many of the tens of thousands of Mexicans who live in Ventura, Santa  Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.  </P> <P> An estimated 400 people will file through the small consulate each day during  peak summer and Christmas seasons, seeking help of many kinds. About 150 will  come even on the slow days.  </P> <P> A few are farm workers abused by employers. Others, legal residents of the  United States, want documents so they can visit relatives in their native land.  </P> <P> Many are newcomers, streaming in on buses and at a loss for how to cope in a  strange world that offers not only promise but also the deception of con  artists and the prospect of arrest by the Border Patrol.  </P> <P> "Our most important job is to protect our people when they have a problem, a  labor problem or any kind of problem," said Arroyo, a veteran diplomat who for  21 years was in charge of cultural and student exchange programs at a large  consulate in Montreal.  </P> <P> Under her control since July, the Oxnard consulate today is known as much for  the consul's aggressiveness and visibility as for its central location at the  downtown bus station on 4th Street.  </P> <P> "She's a pretty dynamic character," said Marco Antonio Abarca, attorney for the  nearby California Rural Legal Assistance office. "In Montreal, she mainly  worked with diplomats and upper-class Mexicans. She says she likes it here  because she deals with the real thing."  </P> <P> Arroyo has repeatedly brought farm workers with legal problems to Abarca's  Oxnard office for assistance, Abarca said.  </P> <P> "She's visible, very accessible. Her office covers everything," he said. "If  somebody dies and the family wants the body shipped back, they'll take care of  it. If a Mexican citizen is jailed, she'll go over to help him. She has even  taken us out to the fields sometimes, to different farm worker camps. She wants  to see how people are living."  </P> <P> Arroyo, thin, bespectacled and soft-spoken, has made a name for herself locally  among prosecutors, politicians, arts groups and the wide range of agencies that  deal with immigration.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury said his office is working with her to gain  financial support for children of Mexican nationals both here and in Mexico and  to crack down on businesses that defraud immigrants by selling shoddy products.  </P> <P> "For the first time, the consul's presence is being clearly recognized here,"  Bradbury said.  </P> <P> Armando Garcia, an immigration specialist at El Concilio de Condado de Ventura,  said his nonprofit agency fields about 30 telephone calls a week from the  consulate and receives about one referral a day from it. Problems range from  youth violence, to preparation of legal documents to family and mental health  counseling.  </P> <P> Cooperation from the consulate is new, Garcia said. Not long before Arroyo  arrived last year, El Concilio offered its services to the former consul. "He  wrote back and said they only do passports," Garcia said. "But Zoila takes  seriously her job as a true representative of Mexico. It is a drastic change."  </P> <P> Arroyo is a regular on a Spanish-language talk show broadcast here and in Santa  Barbara County.  </P> <P> She supported a recent Spanish-language play at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium and  arranged for the renowned Ballet Folklorico of Mexico City to perform there in  the group's first Southland visit in 11 years, said Andres Herrera, aide to  county Supervisor John K. Flynn.  </P> <P> Herrera said he could not even remember the name of Arroyo's predecessor, but  has heard from Arroyo at least two dozen times. "I see her everywhere," he  said.  </P> <P> "Oxnard is a very active city, very important," Arroyo said. "All consuls  should have this experience."  </P> <P> The Mexican government opened its ninth California consulate in Oxnard in 1987  because of the local influx of Mexican nationals in recent years. The increased  demand for consular assistance helped create the only real controversy of  Arroyo's brief tenure.  </P> <P> One late-November day, the line into the consulate was so long that it wound  down the stairs and out the front door of the transportation center. Shop  entrances were obstructed and the Border Patrol was apparently called. Agents  arrested three Mexican nationals waiting to get into her office, Arroyo said.  </P> <P> Top patrol administrators assured her that no more arrests would be made at the  consulate, Arroyo said. And none have been.  </P></p>

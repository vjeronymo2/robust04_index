			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES MAY FINALLY GET SHOT AT ASIA'S BOOM;  </P> <P> U.S.-JAPANESE 5-YEAR PLAN AIMS TO EASE DEBT BURDEN  </P> <P> A moment of opportunity may be at hand for the Philippines, the only capitalist  country that has failed to achieve economic takeoff in East Asia, the world's  fastest-growing region.  </P> <P> A five-year multinational aid program, the first that the United States and  Japan have joined in co-sponsoring anywhere in the world, is expected to be  approved in early July, according to Roberto Villanueva, coordinator of the  plan for the Philippines.  </P> <P> It is designed to promote foreign investment to help the Philippines cope with  a $28.5-billion foreign debt and, at the same time, move forward economically.  </P> <P> Economists point out that higher wages are reducing the competitive advantage  that labor-intensive industries have long had in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong  and Singapore, and that investment in Thailand is reaching the saturation  point. In light of this, they say, it is the Philippines' turn to attract  foreign capital and to turn out goods for export.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fresh Interest  </P> <P> Already there are signs of a step in this direction. More than 50% of the  investment made here in 1987 and 1988 was in the export-oriented fields of  garments and electronics, according to Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, an economist at  the Center for Research and Communications here.  </P> <P> Foreign investors who snubbed the Philippines in the past are showing interest,  with Taiwan taking the lead. Last year the Philippines attracted two and a half  times the foreign investment it received in 1987, and businessmen, most of them  from Taiwan, accounted for $139.6 million, a fifth of the net total.  </P> <P> Jose Concepcion Jr., secretary of trade and industry, said in an interview that  he expects the Japanese to invest nearly $1 billion this year. He said he is  also "looking for some $100 million" in investments by South Korean firms.  </P> <P> American businessmen in the Philippines have never stopped investing, a U.S.  diplomat said, "even in the bad years" under deposed President Ferdinand E.  Marcos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Americans Bullish  </P> <P> The Americans continue to be bullish on the Philippines, the diplomat said,  adding that reinvestment by established American firms is expected to amount to  $600 million in the three years ending in 1990.  </P> <P> J. Marsh Thompson, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce and  Industry here, said he is "looking for a good year in investment" from American  newcomers. "We're giving briefings to visitors two or three mornings every  week," he said.  </P> <P> The Japanese ambassador here, Tsuneo Tanaka, said in a recent speech that  Japanese annual investment tripled last year, to $75 million. And Japanese  businessmen have made several significant new moves.  </P> <P> Uniden, a Japanese manufacturer of communications equipment, closed an  electronics factory in Taiwan and replaced it with one in the Philippines.  Asahi Glass made a major investment in a joint venture, and Toyota reopened a  plant it had closed amid the chaos of Marcos' waning years.  </P> <P> "There has been a turnaround here," World Bank President Barber B. Conable said  on a recent visit, "and that is very gratifying because turnarounds are hard to  get."  </P> <P> Against a background of stagnation during Marcos' last three years in power --  gross national product declined in 1985, the year before his fall -- the  economy last year expanded by 6.7%, with an inflation rate of 9%. By  comparison, 16 other heavily indebted nations around the globe averaged less  than 3% growth and inflation of 80%, Conable noted.  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino's government is aiming at growth of 6.5% a year  through 1992, a goal that the International Monetary Fund accepts as realistic.  </P> <P> The long-promised multilateral aid package was expected to bolster Aquino's  goal.  </P> <P> Villanueva announced in early June that 17 nations and 14 international  agencies will send representatives to Tokyo July 3-5 to discuss the plan and  make pledges to contribute to it.  </P> <P> Last year, exports hit a historic high of $7 billion and will grow to $15  billion by 1992, according to Concepcion, who calls himself a "prophet of  boom."  </P> <P> Prophets of gloom are still around in abundance, though. According to Koicihiro  Matsuura, director of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Cooperation Bureau in  Tokyo, the aid pipeline is clogged, with money coming in faster than Manila can  use it.  </P> <P> Although the four U.S. congressmen who proposed the multilateral aid plan in  1987, the World Bank's Conable and Philippine officials have repeatedly talked  about the program bringing an additional $6 billion to $10 billion worth of aid  and foreign investment to the Philippines over a five-year period, it promises  to fall far short of that billing.  </P> <P> The program, officially called "the multilateral assistance initiative," will  gather Philippine aid programs, old and new, under the World Bank umbrella for  coordination and is expected to encourage increased aid from overseas.  </P> <P> Under an agreement on the U.S. bases here, American aid is expected to total  $483.6 million in fiscal 1990, up from $305 million this year. For the  multilateral assistance initiative, President Bush requested an extra $200  million in the budget he submitted to Congress in February.  </P> <P> Japan last year pledged $925.4 million in aid and dispatched a mission to the  Philippines in May to determine the level of this year's aid.  </P> <P> Both Bush and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita have given their personal  support to the initiative, and Sosuke Uno, Japan's new prime minister, will  reiterate Tokyo's intention to contribute "substantially" to it when the  leaders of seven advanced industrial democracies gather for an annual economic  summit in Paris in July, Matsuura said.  </P> <P> Still, in terms of additional aid, no more than $1 billion or $2 billion spread  over five years can be expected, economist Cuyegkeng predicted.  </P> <P> The initiative is expected to bring in new donors, including South Korea,  Taiwan and Singapore, and will give the Philippines an international stamp of  approval that can be expected to raise foreign investors' confidence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hard Cash Needed  </P> <P> But "stamps of approval won't be enough," according to Solita Collas Monsod,  secretary of the National Economic Development Authority. "We've had stamps of  approval all over the place since 1986."  </P> <P> What the country needs, she said, "is actual hard cash that will allow us to  improve our infrastructure . . . that will build the environment for  private-sector investment to come in."  </P> <P> Repayment of domestic and foreign debt consumes 43% of the budget and, without  new money, a Japanese official here said, "this country would go bankrupt."  </P> <P> To sustain the goal of 6.5% real annual growth through 1992, Philippine  officials estimate, the country will need at least $3 billion and perhaps as  much as $8 billion in additional aid and foreign investment.  </P> <P> This year, according to Finance Secretary Vicente R. Jayme, the Philippines  will have to repay $3.3 billion on its foreign debt, compared to a projected  inflow of only $1.7 billion. Last year, the net outflow was $1.9 billion -- and  that after obtaining a moratorium from foreign commercial banks on repayment of  principle until 1992.  </P> <P> Even with the multilateral assistance initiative, Monsod, the Economic  Development Authority official, said, "more will be going out than comes in."  </P> <P> Monsod recalls that 25 years ago the Philippines "exported more than South  Korea and Taiwan put together (and) Thailand wasn't even in sight." Today, she  said, "we're even looking Thailand in the back. . . . We flubbed it."  </P> <P> Monsod blames the quarter-century of stagnation on Marcos' rule. But now, she  said, "the opportunity is here because the growth is here, the human resources  are here, the skills are here."  </P> <P> But a quarter-century ago the level of education in the Philippines was ranked  second only to Japan's in Asia. Now, both South Korea and Taiwan have passed  the Philippines in this respect. Illiteracy is on the rise, and the incidence  of poverty has more than doubled, to the point where about half the people are  considered impoverished, Concepcion said. Crime, insurgency, labor unrest and  political instability have all increased.  </P> <P> An American who works for the Asian Development Bank said the economy has taken  "two steps forward and one and a half steps backward" since he came to the  Philippines in 1964 as a Peace Corps volunteer.  </P> <P> "I don't know why things don't get better," he said. "There is a certain lack  of discipline, of thinking of one's own family or economic unit rather than the  national good. It's going to take a long time to pull the country up again."  </P> <P> Even last year's surge, as some foreign analysts see it, represented little  more than "surface prosperity" limited to the cities.  </P> <P> The World Bank's Conable warned Filipinos that they still face "the challenge  of sustainable development, the deep and difficult structural problems of  poverty . . . and the environment." He said population growth, which is  compounding the poverty problem, will double the number of Filipinos in 30  years to 120 million.  </P> <P> Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro C. Benigno, acknowledged in February that  little of the Philippines' economic success has trickled down to the masses.  And Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, recently complained in a sermon  that the ideals of the 1986 revolution that ousted Marcos had been forgotten.  In Aquino's presence, he charged that government officials have become  insensitive to the needs of the people.  </P> <P> "The old politics," Sin said, "has come back, to the dismay of us all -- the  positioning for power, the corruption, the grandstanding, the jet-setting, the  influence peddling, the petty bickering. It seems we have gone back to life as  usual, to what we really are: a nation of easygoing people, rascals, braggarts,  thieves. It is we who are the problem."  </P></p>

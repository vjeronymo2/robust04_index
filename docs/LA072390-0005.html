			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> INSPECTING TWO DEFENSES  </P> <P> It never fails to amaze me how righteously self-serving moviemakers and TV  producers can get when they are criticized for making films that either pander  to our basest morality or that perpetuate cultural stereotypes. Irvin Kershner  and Henry G. Saperstein in the July 16 Counterpunch are the two latest  examples.  </P> <P> I'm glad to know that Kershner had only the noblest intentions in mind when he  signed to direct "RoboCop 2." In fact, I greatly enjoyed his social analysis of  his own movie. However, that is not the picture he made and that isn't why he  made it. He seems to be ashamed to admit that he needed the job and now seeks  to defend what he did by coating it with an after-the-fact veneer of thematic  idealism. All I saw in "RoboCop 2" was an atrocious disregard for the value of  human life.  </P> <P> Saperstein's rationale for KCAL continuing to show those awful "Dick Tracy"  cartoons from nearly 30 years ago has, in part, to do with their age. They are  "only old cartoons," he says. Using that reasoning, let's bring on the Stepin  Fetchit, Mantan Moreland and Richard Loo movies of the '30s and '40s; let's  dust off the Bosco cartoon, and, hey, let's put "Birth of a Nation" on the  Disney Channel. Yeah, they all featured ugly stereotypes, but they're only old  movies, so "sit back and enjoy."  </P> <P> JIM BOYD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

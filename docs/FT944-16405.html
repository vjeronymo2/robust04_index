			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gardner Merchant rises 14% - Market conditions 'not encouraging' for catering group's flotation Gardner Merchant, the largest contract caterer in Europe, yesterday reported an increase of almost 14 per cent in interim profits. The group, bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of 1992, made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 23.7m) in the six months to July 31 on the back of a 9 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 556m (Pounds 509m). Mr Garry Hawkes, chief executive, said the group was under no pressure to float. 'Our investors are happy with their returns, and clearly the current market conditions are not very encouraging.' Group debt stands at Pounds 220m after a refinancing deal in the summer with the Royal Bank of Scotland and five other banks. Growth during in the half year was all organic, with a net gain of 175 contracts, compared with 163 previously. The group relies on the UK for more than half its business and most of its profits. UK profits grew to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 17.2m) on sales of Pounds 320m (Pounds 291m). Almost a third of new contracts in the UK, where margins improved from 5.9 to 6.2 per cent, were in the public sector - an area the group has targeted for future growth both in the UK and overseas. In the rest of Europe profits edged ahead to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.2m) on sales of Pounds 152m (Pounds 141m), held back by the recession in France. European margins eased to 3.6 per cent (3.7 per cent). Profits from the rest of the world, including the US, were Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 77.2m). The current half will include for the first time the group's five acquisitions made this year for a total of Pounds 72.9m - the main one being the Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) purchase of part of Morrison Restaurants' contract food division in the US. This doubled the size of the group's US business and made it fifth biggest in the US market. Employees who use their staff restaurant are benefiting from a perk worth at least Pounds 300 a year and in today's tough economic climate more employees than ever are eating company food, according to an employee catering survey conducted by the Industrial Society and Touche Ross Management Consultants. The average subsidy per user of company canteen facilities is Pounds 328.90 a year and more than 50 per cent of employees are now using catering services, the survey found.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Jobless rate: Orange County's unemployment rate bumped up a notch in June to  3.3%, from 3.2% in May, as thousands of high school and college students looked  for summer jobs. But the jobless rate remained one of the lowest in the state  -- trailing only Marin County's 2.9% and San Mateo County's 3%. The June rate  was also unchanged from June, 1989, while the total number of unemployed,  46,100, was almost 3% lower than the year-earlier tally of 47,500.  </P></p>

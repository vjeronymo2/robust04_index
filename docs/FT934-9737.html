			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Belgian tool group looks to Asia LVD, Belgium's biggest machine tool company, is planning to begin manufacturing in China to take advantage of growth prospects in Asia for machines that bend, punch and cut sheet metal. The expansion will be one of the few manufacturing investments in Asia by European machine tool companies, most of which are two small to contemplate such a move. It would also be the first western or Japanese company in the machine tools sector to start manufacturing in China. LVD's two main rivals, both larger, are Amada of Japan and Trumpf of Germany. The family-owned concern has narrowed down its choice of Chinese partners to two, said Mr Jean-Pierre Lefebvre, president. The plant could be in operation by late next year. Mr Lefebvre said Asia accounted for 35 per cent of LVD's Dollars 90m turnover last year, up from 15 per cent in 1990. He added that Asia was the only region where the company saw substantial growth over the next few years. China was the best choice because products made there were welcome elsewhere in Asia.</p>

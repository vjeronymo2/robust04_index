			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current procedures for assessing civil penalties by the Coast Guard are contained in 33 CFR 1.07. Generally this process begins when an alleged violation is detected by or reported to a Coast Guard official. The alleged violation is investigated, and if it appears that the elements for a violation case exist, civil enforcement action is initiated by preparing a case report with a recommended penalty and forwarding it with the case file to the appropriate Coast Guard District office for review. The District office reviews the report to determine whether there is in fact evidence of a prima facie case and whether the assessment of the recommended penalty by a Hearing Officer is appropriate. It then transmits the case file with a recommended action to the Hearing Officer. Based on this case file, the Hearing Officer makes an independent determination as to whether a violation appears to have been committed. If so, the Hearing Officer sends a Letter of Notification to the alleged violator that specifies, among other matters, the alleged violation(s) and a penalty amount that appears to be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A party may pay the penalty amount specified as being appropriate by the Hearing Officer, request an in-person hearing, or provide written evidence or arguments in lieu of a hearing. If the party pays the penalty, the case is closed and no further action is required. If the party chooses either of the latter two options, the Hearing Officer either conducts an in-person hearing or reviews the written evidence and arguments, and then issues a written decision assessing a penalty or dismissing the case. The Hearing Officer's decision may be administratively appealed to the Commandant of the Coast Guard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As applied to small (under 100 gallons) oil discharges and pollution prevention violations, the current civil penalty assessment process is not administratively efficient for many uncontested cases. Further, the time required to process these violations minimizes the deterrent effect of the sanction. It is not uncommon for a party to have additional violations before being notified of the initiation of action for the first violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a need for a process where notice of violation can be given in the field to allow for early resolution of apparent small oil spill and pollution prevention violations. Such a process would save the time and cost of unnecessary internal review, improve deterrence, and enable corrective action by providing a party with earlier notice of violations. Each party would have the option of paying a proposed penalty or pursuing their right to a hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Violation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule amends 33 CFR 1.07 to provide a simplified procedure to expedite processing of certain civil penalty violation cases. An interim final rule is being published to test the simplified procedure. A pilot program will be conducted in three ports, prior to a final rule which would be implemented nationwide. The pilot program will be conducted for six months in the ports of Charleston, SC, Galveston, TX, and Los Angeles, CA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedures will allow settlement of cases following the issuance by a Coast Guard issuing officer of a Notice of Violation containing a proposed penalty. A Coast Guard issuing officer will be a commissioned, warrant, or petty officer, with specific training and authority to issue a Notice of Violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A party will have the option of either paying the proposed penalty, requesting determination by a Hearing Officer, or taking no action on the Notice of Violation. Where a party decides to pay the proposed penalty indicated on a Notice of Violation, there will be no District Program Manager or Hearing Officer involved and the case will be closed. Where a party requests a determination by a Hearing Officer or takes no action, a full case file will be sent to the District Commander, in accordance with present procedure, for review prior to forwarding to the Hearing Officer. Upon receipt by the Hearing Officer, the case will be processed under the current procedures. Any adverse action by the Hearing Officer will be subject to administrative appeal under the current procedures. A party who takes no action on a Notice of Violation or who requests determination by a Hearing Officer may find the preliminary assessment issued by the Hearing Officer to be equal to or greater than that specified on the Notice of Violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Cooperation   <F P=102>   FL0604015994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300  GMT 5 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> FL0604015994 </F> <F P=104>  Havana Radio Rebelde Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] A bilateral antidrug agreement for cooperation  between Cuba and Argentina was signed this afternoon at the  Foreign Ministry. The agreement was signed by Cuban Justice  Minister Carlos Amat and by Argentine Secretary of State [title  as heard] Alberto Lestelle.    Lestelle told the press that this agreement will trigger the  development of relations between the two countries within a very  short term. Lestelle said:    [Begin recording] The signing of this agreement implies,  first of all, something very significant for the two countries.  This agreement is extended far beyond the regions, far beyond  government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It will  become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the  treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more  important than the drug issue.    During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and  the police, each group will meet independently and will prepare  a program. This program will determine how we will be able to  provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with  assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a  later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry  officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family  doctor program.    In Argentina we have only a brief sketch of this, nothing  else. By virtue of these meetings, we must establish what we can  do here and what you can do in Argentina. So this possibility  must remain open. [end recording]    I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle is heading an Argentine  delegation that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking  the signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug  fight. I would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a  signatory of the UN convention for the fight against  international drug trafficking, and has agreed to sign bilateral  agreements with many countries of the region.</p>

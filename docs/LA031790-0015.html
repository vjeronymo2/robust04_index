			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPING VENTURA BOULEVARD  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Planning Commission held a hearing on the Ventura  Boulevard Specific Plan on Feb. 22. I was there, and I didn't like what I  heard.  </P> <P> After more than three years, the Citizens Advisory Committee for the plan made  its recommendation, which proved to be compromise for all sides -- residents,  businesses and developers.  </P> <P> However, after the committee submitted its plan, and before the hearing, major  changes were made that deserved further consideration by the committee. From  what I could tell, not everyone at the meeting was happy to hear that the  Planning Commission would like to see six-story buildings, fewer mom-and-pop  businesses on Ventura Boulevard, and excessive trip fees for new development.  </P> <P> I left the hearing feeling "What are they going to do now?" There is just no  time for the committee to give the changes careful thought. It appears that the  version of the plan found to be satisfactory by those most affected will now  give way to political pressure and special interests.  </P> <P> The plan must call for reasonable fees from the developers for new projects,  local shopping services for residents, which will promote economic growth and  jobs, and a two-story height restriction on the boulevard.  </P> <P> As a Sherman Oaks homeowner who wants business growth, yet at the same time  knows the importance of preserving the residential neighborhood of our  community, it angers me to think developers who live somewhere else can come to  my neck of the woods to pressure city planners into a decision that will turn  our residential streets into freeways and parking lots, shadowed by towering  buildings offering few local services.  </P> <P> We need a strong neighborhood-based plan approved quickly by the City Council,  otherwise a healthly vision for the future of the Valley will become a pipe  dream of the Citizens Committee.  </P> <P> ELLEN VUKOVICH  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

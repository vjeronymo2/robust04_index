			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chagrin among the chateaux: The Bordeaux wine and spirits fair THE NIGHT before the grand opening in Bordeaux this week of Vinexpo, the world's premier international wine and spirits exhibition, the region's venerable Chateaux de Fronsac was struck by lightning and burnt to the ground. Given the present malaise of the French wine trade, which is struggling to maintain its pre-eminent position in a profoundly changed market, it was difficult to resist seeing the disaster as an omen. Exhibitors gathering in the Mecca of the wine world on Monday had already heard disquieting news of champagne producers laying off workers. Also giving pause for thought were reports of traditional arch-rivals in Bordeaux and Bourgogne, producers of some of the world's greatest wines, teaming up in marketing efforts to stave off the worst effects of world recession. French proprietors are realising, not before time, that the mystique of producing the finest wines on earth is flimsy insurance against competition from competent and increasingly confident producers elsewhere. More hard-headed market watchers say France is getting its come-uppance for years of greed and complacency. 'Maybe we were naive, but we didn't realise how fast Bulgaria, for instance, would steal the British market for budget red wines,' says Mr Gilles Dupuch, President of the Union of Entre-deux-Mers Producers. 'There are big changes ahead. We rested on our laurels far too long. Bordeaux producers have to realise it's not enough just to be Bordeaux any more. They're in intense competition and they're going to have to bite the bullet.' Ms Serena Sutcliffe, head of Sotheby's Wine Department in London, agrees. 'People are looking for quick, easy flavour. Basic Bordeaux is quite subtle and it lacks that big impact. It's difficult to wean people buying wine on a tight budget away from the full-frontal attack of a Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon once they've experienced it, though directly you go up a notch, Bordeaux's full of flavour.' Vinexpo, a biennial exhibition launched in 1961, has attracted more exhibitors than ever this year. Visitors taste all day, and party all night as Bordeaux's chateaux open their gates to the world in lavish style. There are wines from some 40 countries on offer, from China to Chile, Austria to Australia. Despite a tradition of courtesy in the wine world, there is no doubt about the undertone of cut-throat competition for a shrinking market. 'The atmosphere is much more nervy than before,' says Mr Eric Boschman, Brussels-based master sommelier and regular visitor to Vinexpo. 'Buyers are behaving like cats on a hot tin roof. Producers are very aware the global volume is static, or even shrinking, and they are having to work three times as hard to make it.' Overall, consumers are drinking less wine, but moving up-market. Some 26 per cent of Europeans say they are teetotallers, while a Vinexpo survey among people aged 18 to 30 found 39 per cent saying they never drank any alcohol. There is a significant number of newcomers at this year's exhibition, as well as countries trying to consolidate their position, and it is plain that they are not altogether welcome among the locals. France, Italy and Spain have huge surpluses; but the European Community is set-to pull the plug on the wine lake. The EC's biggest producers are bracing themselves for reforms in the framework of the common agricultural policy that are bound to involve grubbing up at least 10 per cent of their vines and some very hard-headed selection to keep only the best. The presence of central and eastern European wine growers, virtually within sight of EC growers, is among the most keenly felt threats. Moldova and Romania are exhibiting in their own right for the first time, inspired by Bulgaria's success. Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and even Ukraine are represented - the last with a reappearance of the legendary Massandra wines from the Crimea. Poland is there too, showing spirits. All are hoping to expand their trade, particularly with the EC. And they are pinning their hopes on agricultural produce in the first instance. On Monday at the European Community's summit meeting in Copenhagen, leaders pledged to open up their markets to products from the fledgling democracies further and faster than originally planned, on the basis that trade is better than aid, and far, far better than more wars on the community's eastern front. Optimists in France and elsewhere in French-dominated markets are telling themselves that drinkers who strayed from French wines while prices were high will simply revert to type as the market forces rates down. Others are not so sure, however. Mr Dupuch says wines made from a single variety of grape, standard in the New World and, increasingly, elsewhere, have got consumers accustomed to reference points that are easier to understand than the complex wines of Bordeaux. 'Sauvignon spells magic out there. My wines are made of Sauvignon, Semillon and Muscadelle, and we don't explain that on the label. We're going to have to get better at telling people what's good about our wines, why they should like them.' Mr Boschman is convinced that France will only keep its market by fighting for it. 'It's true there are those who'll drink Bulgarian or Romanian wines in private who would never dream of serving anything but French at a dinner party,' he says. 'But there are so many good, inexpensive wines around now and Bordeaux's lost its halo. People all over the wine-drinking world are discovering new flavours and styles and it's not obvious why they should stop.'</p>

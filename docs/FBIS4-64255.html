			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government plans to buy more than 50 Tomahawk  cruise missiles from the United States to give Royal Navy  submarines new non-nuclear weaponry, according to a report today.    The Ministry of Defence tonight refused to comment on the  claims that the low-flying missiles, carrying conventional  high-explosive warheads, would be placed on all 12 of Britain's  Trafalgar class nuclear-attack submarines.    The SUNDAY TIMES said the deal, valued at hundreds of  millions of pounds, would give a more flexible response to the  emergence of powers like Iraq and Iran which do not possess  nuclear warheads but could eventually have missiles which could  target Britain.    Unofficial soundings suggest the deal may get U.S. approval  despite current opposition by President Clinton to proliferation  of weapons like cruise missiles, according to the paper.    It quotes a British source as saying: "This will be a  significant boost to our capability outside of Europe."</p>

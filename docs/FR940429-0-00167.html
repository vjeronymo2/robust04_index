			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of Placement Rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, the requirement in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.8(g)(1)(ii) that an institution exclude from the calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a placement rate students who are hired by the institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been deleted from these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, a change has been made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rate calculation to clarify that every student must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed for at least 13 weeks in a recognized occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before that student can be counted as placed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has amended &sect;668.8 by revising paragraph (k)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remove the provision that an institution offering an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undergraduate educational program measured in credit hours and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least two academic years in length is exempt from applying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula contained in paragraph (l) to that program if the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if each course within the program is fully acceptable for credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward that institution's equivalent degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (k) and (l) were originally published in final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39618). In those final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the Secretary exempted from the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, undergraduate educational programs that were at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least two years in length and lead to an associate, bachelor's,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional, or an equivalent degree as determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary or if each course within that program was fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable for credit toward one of those degree programs at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that institution. The Secretary believed that it was prudent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt programs that lead to an equivalent degree because there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be a type of degree being offered (not an associate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bachelor's, or professional degree) that the Secretary had not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yet encountered. The Secretary wanted to be able to examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree to determine if that degree was in fact equivalent to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associate, bachelor's, or professional degree. If the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the degree was equivalent to an associate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bachelor's, or professional degree, and was at least two academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years in length, the Secretary would exempt from the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undergraduate educational programs that lead to the equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree or if each course within the program was fully acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for credit toward that institution's equivalent degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, since publication of the final regulations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 23, 1993, the Secretary has yet to encounter a degree that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary would consider to be an equivalent of an associate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bachelor's, or professional degree. Conversely, dozens of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions have submitted to the Secretary arguments that their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diploma programs are the equivalent of an associate degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The regulations were never meant to permit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that a nondegree program be classified as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of a degree program. The regulations only applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a determination of whether a degree resulting from an educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is equivalent to an associate, bachelor's, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional degree. Because the diploma programs are not in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves degree programs, the Secretary does not consider those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs to lead to an equivalent degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of this misconception by many institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``equivalent degree'' means an educational program equivalent to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree granting program, and because the Secretary has not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found a true instance of an equivalent degree that is not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associate, bachelor's, or professional degree, the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing the phrase ``equivalent degree as determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary'' from paragraph (k).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SENSITIVITY HAS COST N.Y. JETS' MCNEIL HIS 1ST-STRING JOB  </P> <P> When he was a rookie in 1981, it was a sprained foot. In '83, a separated  shoulder. In '84, broken ribs. In '86, a dislocated elbow. In '87, a severely  pulled hamstring.  </P> <P> When three-time Pro Bowl starter Freeman McNeil doesn't have a great season,  it's usually because of injuries -- his own.  </P> <P> But can he now be having his worst season partly because of injury he caused to  another?  </P> <P> Sounds absurd, doesn't it? Many people will tell you that the sheer folly of  trying to run behind the New York Jets offensive line is reason enough for any  running back to have a bad season.  </P> <P> But in McNeil's case, it seems there's more to it than that. McNeil "suffers"  from a malady rarely admitted to in the macho world of the NFL: sensitivity.  </P> <P> But McNeil's sin was not his sensitivity. His sin was in letting it disturb his  concentration. Letting it get in the way of his job.  </P> <P> It happened early in the second quarter against the Indianapolis Colts Oct. 1.  The Jets ran a sweep to the right, Roger Vick the ball carrier. In a clean,  above-board play, McNeil knocked down Colts linebacker Alston O'Brien with a  roll block.  </P> <P> When the play was over, so was O'Brien's season. He had torn knee ligaments and  terrible pain. He would require surgery. Because of McNeil's block, his career  was in jeopardy.  </P> <P> When he realized what he'd done, McNeil, helpless and heartbroken, lingered  over O'Brien's fallen form. It was the first time McNeil had been directly  responsible for another player's injury. Distraught, he took himself out of the  game and kneeled on the sideline, his head in his hand. He did not play the  rest of the half.  </P> <P> McNeil played the second half, but he was, he admitted, in a fog. He made  several mistakes, including lining up in the wrong spot and missing a block on  a key play inside the Colts' 10. And when the Jets ran a play like the one in  which Alston was injured, McNeil, faced with another Colts linebacker, hit him  high rather than low.  </P> <P> After the game, McNeil sought out Alston to see how he was. A Colts publicist  said there were tears in McNeil's eyes.  </P> <P> Jets Coach Joe Walton publicly criticized McNeil after the game for letting the  team down, for being mentally out to lunch in a game the Jets lost, 17-10. The  next day, McNeil went to Walton's office and apologized. He apologized for  losing his concentration. He did not apologize for his emotions.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to make any of my emotions wrong," McNeil said later. "I should  have been able to bounce back, to collect my thoughts and go out there and  play. The initial contact (with Alston) was devastating. I had lost focus on  what I was supposed to do."  </P> <P> Three weeks later against the Bills, McNeil still hadn't found his focus. He  dropped two passes and made a fumble that led to a Bills touchdown. He also  botched a handoff from quarterback Mark Malone that caused another fumble. He  missed several blocks.  </P> <P> The next week against the 49ers, Walton moved Johnny Hector into the starting  lineup. McNeil played only sparingly in the Jets' loss to the 49ers, and in  their last-second win over the Patriots Nov. 4.  </P> <P> Officially, McNeil touched the ball only once in the first half against the  Patriots. But when he did, he ran 19 yards for a touchdown. It was the first TD  the Jets offense had scored in 14 quarters. You'd figure a guy who runs 19  yards for a TD the first time he touches the ball should be given it more  often.  </P> <P> But while Hector carried 21 times for 72 yards, a 3.4 average, McNeil -- the  only active back to average more than four yards a carry in eight consecutive  NFL seasons -- carried only twice more. When the game was on the line, he was  on the bench.  </P> <P> McNeil, genuinely proud of being a team player, refuses to gripe. It's part of  life, he said, just a brief "down" he'll use to increase his resilience and  determination.  </P> <P> "I don't like to say that I'm this or I'm that," McNeil said, "but I'm a man  built on emotion. There has to be a certain emotion, a passionate feeling, for  me to enjoy something."  </P> <P> McNeil's sensitivity to the plight of others has always made him an All-Pro off  the field. He is active in the United Way, Big Brothers, MS, Students Against  Drunk Drivers, and a Long Island-based anti-hunger crusade founded by the late  folk singer, Harry Chapin.  </P> <P> "There's not a charity thing he turns down," said Jets publicist Ron Cohen.  "He'd rather go to one of those things than a paid speaking engagement. Because  then he's not obligated to anything but his values."  </P> <P> When Hurricane Gloria hit in September, 1985, McNeil drove around Long Island  in his pickup truck, helping stranded motorists. During the off-season and on  virtually every Tuesday during the season -- the players' day off -- McNeil  visits schools and speaks to kids about drug abuse.  </P> <P> "There are some things that are so important that you don't even think about  yourself," McNeil said.  </P> <P> But when you lose your starting job, there is more time to think. Isn't it a  bit depressing to realize that the very traits that make Freeman McNeil such a  good person are hindering his career? Just as doctors must harden themselves to  death so they can have the emotional energy to help the living, so must an  athlete avoid getting so caught up in another's misfortune to the degree that  it affects his own performance.  </P> <P> In the Jets media guide, Walton called McNeil "an excellent team leader. . . .  We have learned to expect only the best from him."  </P> <P> It would be nice if we could again see Freeman McNeil at his best on the field.  But it's not as important as the good he does off it. Or as enduring.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages contained within quotation marks are recorded; </F> Redman speaks in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation]    [Text] Special U.S. envoy Charles Redman held talks with  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency; Presidency member Ejup Ganic; and Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency in Sarajevo  today. Nedzad Leko reports:    [Leko] After three-hour-long talks, only Charles Redman  addressed the journalists, and said the following:    [Redman] "I took advantage of my visit to continue our  consultations on a number of issues facing Bosnia today -- both  political and economic -- and the reconstruction of Sarajevo and  other parts of the country. This evening I am going to Zagreb  where I will have a meeting with Mr. Akashi, President Tudjman,  and members of the Croatian Government. I will spend several  more days in Europe to continue consultations because we all  believe that this is an important moment to continue working  toward a more stable, and, we hope, lasting peace. The  negotiations are very difficult, but we are working hard, and  will continue to do that. You will probably see me here in  Sarajevo again soon."    [Leko] Asked whether the maps on which the contact group  worked over the past two days in London were discussed at the  meeting, Charles Redman said:    [Redman] "I am not here in that capacity. These issues are  obviously always very interesting and important. However, I am  here for bilateral U.S.-Bosnian relations [as heard], and not in  the context of the contact group."</p>

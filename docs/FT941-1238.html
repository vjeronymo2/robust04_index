			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (6): Back to the school desk with Rover - Growing numbers of UK engineers are going on skill-raising courses. At Rover Group, CPD is seen as vital to raising the calibre of the company's senior staff / Continuing Professional Development After 26 years with the Rover Group Mr David Hackett can see how the company has changed since its doldrum days a decade or more ago. Now the company has a fluid structure that aims to 'exploit the knowledge and experience' of its workforce. Employees must show the adaptability and flexibility needed to go 'as and where required by company needs'. His own recent experiences illustrate the point. Five years ago he became one of Rover's new breed of 'cell managers', heading up around 100 shopfloor workers on the recently-launched K-Series engine. After a subsequent spell as a shift manager he moved into product design to assist further development work. Currently he is Conformance Manager for K-Series Manufacture with responsibility for quality and processes in the machining and assembly areas. Next year he will be helping oversee the introduction to manufacture of the enhanced engine. This has required the exercise of a broad mix of managerial and technical skills. Accordingly shortly after he became a cell manager he embarked on the two-year part-time Integrated Manager Development Scheme (IMDS) run by the Warwick Manufacturing Group at Warwick University specifically for Rover employees. Through a mix of tutored course and project work he acquired new expertise in areas such as corporate management, finance, quality, statistics and information technology. It was, he says, his first experience of formal education since he had completed his apprenticeship over 20 years previously. But Mr Hackett is only one of around 700 Rover employees to have embarked on IMDS or its equivalent. Moreover 1,500 of Rover's cadre of 4,000 managers have taken some sort of course at Warwick and many more of the 33,000 total workforce have undertaken a personal development and learning initiative over the past five years. The reason is Rover's recognition that continuing professional development (CPD), the constant effort to improve the quality of its people, is crucial to overall business success. CPD is gaining recognition across UK industry. Figures from the Engineering Council, the umbrella body for Britain's engineering institutions, show that between 1989 and 1992 the proportion of senior engineers reporting involvement in CPD activities rose from 49 to 71 per cent. The Council is keen to promote CPD, and has regional co-ordinators visiting companies to ensure individuals are pursuing it. A Council working party is already drafting a code of practice, which is likely to be published in about a year's time. At Rover, the CPD initiatives are spearheaded by Rover Learning Business (RLB), a wholly-owned subsidiary with 42 staff set up in 1989 to design and develop education and training programmes for Rover's own needs. Mr Ken Simmons, director for learning programmes, says RLB has three distinct missions - to educate the company's dealers, to facilitate the management of change within the company and to support general management development. The main thrust of Rover's management development effort lies in a series of interlocking courses at Warwick. Recently the IMDS was replaced by the Integrated Manager Learning Programme (IMLP), again a two-year part-time course but now allowing attendees to mix a mandatory core of nine general management modules with seven more specific subjects of their own choice. The core modules include, for instance, Human Factors, Commercial Law and Distribution Efficiency. Options range from technical subjects like CADCAM to business issues such as Collaboration and Contracts. Mr Simmons says the new structure allows employees more leeway to promote 'their own personal aspirations'. Beyond IMLP lie two more levels of achievement - the Integrated Graduate Development Programme (IGDS), a three-year MSc degree programme, and a four-year Engineering Doctorate. Below it is the basic Improving Business Effectiveness course comprising three one-week modules intended to provide an introduction to business issues for individuals lacking academic self-confidence. Within Rover numerous other initiatives are under way all of them ultimately relating back to the company's Corporate Quality Strategy Document, which specifically identifies 'learning' as a fundamentally important activity. The document is written by about 400 of Rover's senior managers and the courses devised by RLB are the result of similar broad-based consultation. The Rover Employee Assisted Learning (REAL) scheme allows every Rover employee to claim a Pounds 100 subsidy towards tutored learning in any subject - even ballroom dancing - the point being simply to get individuals used to the idea of learning new skills. Around 70 per cent of all employees have a Personal Development File, a comprehensive set of documentation that allows them to map out their own career progress plans. This year the company is also implementing new Personal Development Reviews, in which individuals discuss with their immediate managers their success in achieving personal objectives defined in the context of cell, departmental or wider corporate performance targets. A fundamental principle in the whole of Rover's CPD efforts, in fact, is the delegation to line managers of responsibility for assessing the training needs and progress of their charges and frequently for providing it. All this costs Rover around Pounds 35m per year in direct charges and time lost from immediate productive work. But Rover is confident that its people development initiatives are a crucial factor in its renaissance and equally adamant that it is not consciously copying the example of any other firm. Enthusiasm for CPD continues unabated at the car manufacturer. Mr Hackett, for instance, is thinking about applying for the IGDS scheme and, says Mr Simmons, the very first morning after the takeover by BMW was announced RLB took a dozen phone calls from Rover staff wanting to learn German.

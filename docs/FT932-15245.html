			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes end fish protest A TWO-WEEK long action by Danish fishermen ended yesterday when the two largest fishing associations agreed to a government rescue package for the industry, which has been hit by cheap imported fish and cuts in EC catch quotas. Exports of fish and fisheries products in 1992 were about Dkr13bn. Fishermen mounted blockades of ports, fish processing factories and trucks transporting foreign fish through Denmark, the action culminating in a freeze on all fishing by Danish fishing vessels. The demands met in the agreement include an increase in fish quotas, in particular cod and sole, cheaper long term loans, improved taxation rules, pension payments for retiring fishermen and better compensation for scrapped vesssels, which are part of measures to cut the size of the fishing fleet.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK insurance The market should be encouraged to see insurance companies getting to grips with their moth-eaten balance sheets. But it would not do to get carried away. Last week's convertible bond from Royal will add only a modest 2 percentage points to the company's solvency margin assuming full conversion. Recent preference share issues from Commercial Union and General Accident plugged larger holes, but fixed rate prefs are a poor substitute for real equity. The suspicion remains that some of the latter will be required before the upswing in the underwriting cycle is over. With luck, better conditions in insurance markets will coincide with a rising equity market. Capital gains on investments would compensate for the tendency of solvency margins to fall as premium income grows. Having sold equities this year, though, insurers' balance sheets are generally less geared to a rising market than in the 1980s. Since the economic outlook is so uncertain, it would take a brave insurer to predicate expansion plans on a bull market for equities. With their own shares trading at a premium to net assets - and having out-performed the market by a streak this year - the more expansionist insurance companies may eventually be tempted to try a rights issue. The message from the recent rash of convertibles and prefs, though, is that the industry still lacks the confidence to take the plunge. Judging by the sharp downward correction in the sector last week it is right to take a cautious line. But if the US insurance market turns next year there will be strong arguments for a bold approach.</p>

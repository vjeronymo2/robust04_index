			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAACP'S HEAD GIVES RIGHTS BILL WARNING;  </P> <P> CONVENTION: BENJAMIN HOOKS SAYS DEFEAT OF KENNEDY MEASURE MAY LEAD TO ECONOMIC  AND SOCIAL 'SLAVERY' FOR BLACKS. HE ALSO DECRIES 'SELECTIVE PROSECUTION' OF  BLACK OFFICIALS.  </P> <P> With the fate of a major civil rights bill still uncertain, the leader of the  NAACP opened the organization's 81st national convention Sunday evening in Los  Angeles with a warning that defeat of the legislation may lead to economic and  social "slavery" for blacks.  </P> <P> In his keynote address before about 5,000 people at the Los Angeles Convention  Center, Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, also had  indirect words of support for embattled Washington Mayor Marion Barry, now on  trial for drug and perjury charges.  </P> <P> Without mentioning Barry by name, Hooks spoke of "the vicious assault on black  leaders. At no time since Reconstruction has there been a comparable period of  incessant harassment of black elected officials."  </P> <P> The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is focusing this year  on passage of the civil rights act of 1990. The bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy  (D-Mass.) seeks to reverse five U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the last  two years that dealt serious blows to affirmative action and  anti-discrimination laws.  </P> <P> "I warn you tonight that unless we are successful in reversing the Supreme  Court's turn-back-the-clock actions, we may again find ourselves -- literally  and figuratively -- on the back of the bus," Hooks told delegates.  </P> <P> The Senate is to begin debating the bill Tuesday. In April, Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh said he would oppose the bill and NAACP leaders fear a presidential  veto.  </P> <P> Those who attended Sunday's opening session were welcomed by Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Later, in his keynote speech, Hooks drew strong applause as he attacked the  Justice Department and other government agencies for their investigations of  black politicians, including Bradley.  </P> <P> "I am so tired of the selective prosecution of black elected officials," Hooks  said. "I'm tired of the hypocrisy. I may be paranoid. But even paranoid people  have enemies."  </P> <P> The five-day convention is also expected to highlight the NAACP's increasing  emphasis on economic and social issues. One convention workshop, titled "The  Endangered Black Male," will focus on the disproportionate number of young  black men in prison or suffering from drug and alcohol abuse.  </P> <P> "If we allow a third of black America to wallow in poverty, allow black young  men to continue to be gunned down at alarming rates, watch our people become  intoxicated by the lures of the drug trade, history will embarrass us," Hooks  told delegates.  </P> <P> A host of black political leaders and entertainers are scheduled to address the  convention. They include actress and television talk show host Oprah Winfrey;  the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference, and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the nation's first elected  black governor, who will address the convention Thursday.  </P> <P> In addition, more than 1,000 high school students from throughout the country  will participate in the NAACP's Afro-Academic, Technological and Scientific  Olympics.  </P> <P> Delegates will also consider a resolution that could reverse the organization's  stand on immigration reform. Up to now, the black civil rights group has  supported penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrant workers,  arguing that the low-paid immigrants take jobs from blacks.  </P> <P> In May, two Latino groups threatened to pull out of the influential Leadership  Conference on Civil Rights -- a coalition of 183 groups including the NAACP --  because the black civil rights group did not support a Latino effort to repeal  employer sanctions.  </P></p>

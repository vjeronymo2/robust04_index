			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by Zantac challenge Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo, which has one of the highest market capitalisations of UK quoted companies, fell sharply yesterday as a fresh challenge was launched at its top selling product. Geneva Pharmaceutical, an arm of Ciba-Geigy, one of the leading global drugs groups, has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a new rival for Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which makes up around 43 per cent of Glaxo's sales. It claims the product would not infringe Glaxo's patent which expires in 2002. Bearish analysts, particularly those from US houses, said the news was a severe blow partly because it constituted a completely new challenge to Zantac and partly because of the status of the challenger. Ms Jo Walton of Lehman Brothers said 'The result is further uncertainty making it very difficult for investors to be clear how long the Zantac franchise will remain.' A Glaxo spokesman said the company was considering legal action against the Geneva application. Very heavy selling after the news broke sent the shares down 21 to 662p on turnover of 11m, and busy trade in options. Ciba shares were up SFr40 at SFr855.</p>

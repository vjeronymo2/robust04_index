			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ARMENPRES correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 26 Apr -- Fierce fighting has continued  today on the Karabakh front. It was reported to an ARMENPRES  correspondent at the headquarters of the Army of the  Nagorno-Karabakh defense force that Azerbaijani subunits have  been attacking in the Martuni and Fizuli directions since the  morning. However, it notes in the report, the fierce fighting  backed up by tanks did not bring the attackers success. Just as  before, the Karabakh fighters are in control of their positions  and are rebuffing the enemy onslaught.    The situation in the northeast of the confrontation sector,  where some of Azerbaijan's firing positions were neutralized  yesterday, was calm.</p>

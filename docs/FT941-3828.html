			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Big powers 'end honeymoon' Russia and the US yesterday acknowledged that the 'honeymoon' between them was over and that they were fated to have disagreements. But they also agreed to remain yoked in a partnership which, it was stressed, was one of equals. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, met for talks in the far eastern Russian port of Vladivostok. Their one-day meeting came after Russia expressed anger over what it saw as Nato's failure to consult it over air strikes in Bosnia. It was also prompted by differences over withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states and a growing swell of opinion in the US that the two countries' attempts to forge a close partnership is - in the words of Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US national security adviser - 'premature'. Mr Kozyrev said after the talks Russia and the US were building a 'mature relationship' of equals that would survive differences. Mr Christopher said: 'We recognise that as large nations with large interests we are bound to have differences, but we pledge to deal with our differences openly.' Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, postponed a trip and remained in Moscow to ensure reliable control of Russia's nuclear forces while President Boris Yeltsin was on leave, the Defence Ministry said yesterday. Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day left for an unannounced holiday by the Black Sea, saying he was still weak after an illness but confident of calm in Russia.</p>

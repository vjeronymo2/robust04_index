These are not military equipment deliveries, but a  commercial  deal, he said and explained that North Korea had bought through  a Japanese company several decommissioned submarines from Russia  which had been completely dismantled and cannot be restored as  means of warfare.    "We view it as an ordinary trade operation. Russia concludes  similar commercial deals with other countries as well", Karasin  said.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter (1): Pensions: resolving surpluses problem through RPI link and collateral question through the law Sir, Mr Richard Malone (Letters, February 11) expresses concern about identifying the rights of schemes' members to surpluses, but the solution is simple; just link all pensions to the Retail Prices Index. As Bacon and Woodrow stated in their pamphlet, 'A fair deal for early leavers', in 1983: '. . . if inflation were eliminated, rendering increases to pensioners and deferred pensioners unnecessary, this would have the same effect on costs as the provision of increases to counteract inflation . . .' Employers, confident that their workers will not understand the truths of actuarial maths, pretend that they cannot afford 'more', pocketing the windfalls of inflation (in the form of contribution holidays and claims to surpluses), at staffs' expense.

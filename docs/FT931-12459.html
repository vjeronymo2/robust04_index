			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: RA's plans for 1993 The early work of Georges Rouault; the city paintings of Pissarro; a major retrospective of 20th century American art; and Master drawings from the Getty Museum are the main dishes on the Royal Academy's exhibitions menu for 1993. There is also a late dessert, the cache of Modigliani drawings which he gave to his physician and which have recently come to light; 200 are to be shown in January 1994 and they are expected to increase the reputation of this rather stereotyped artist. As ever the Summer Exhibition fills the RA from June 6. Last year it attracted 122,000 visitors and 1,700 of the 12,000 submitted works were hung. This year the RA will take 30 per cent of the price of any art sold. Following the success of its new Sackler galleries, the RA is launching a Pounds 7.8m appeal to refurbish its main 19th-century rooms. It is also casting eyes on the nearby Museum of Mankind. If this, as planned, moves its exhibits back into the British Museum after the final opening of the British Library, the RA would like to take over the space and make it the national centre for architecture. The RA had a good financial year in 1992, with attendances breaching the 1m mark. There was actually a final surplus of Pounds 320,000. But secretary Piers Rogers forecasts two difficult years ahead, with sponsorship support increasingly hard to find. The latest exhibition, The Great Age of British Watercolours, is drawing disappointing attendances in its opening weeks.</p>

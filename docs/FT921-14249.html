			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / OECD labour ministers urge improved job market efficiency LABOUR ministers from the industrialised countries have agreed on the need for concerted medium and long-term measures to combat high unemployment, starting with steps to improve the efficiency of labour markets. The ministers, meeting at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, endorsed a three-part programme of action, in which improved labour markets were coupled with the provision of skills for the future and the improvement of coherence between different aspects of economic and social policies. There was broad agreement by the ministers that 'positive incentives to participate in employment should be provided through appropriate gradual adjustment of income support measures'. They also recommended 'more effective and comprehensive training and re-employment programmes for the unemployed and those on welfare and social assistance, while assuring necessary support mechanisms, thereby breaking dependency cycles'.</p>

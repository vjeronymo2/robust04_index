			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Underwriter admits his testimony was 'nonsense' A former underwriter yesterday contradicted testimony he had given to an internal inquiry into the heavy losses of the Gooda Walker syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market. Mr Anthony Willard, who was lead underwriter for Gooda Walker syndicate 299 during most of the 1980s, said in the High Court that information he had given to a loss-review committee investigation headed by Mr Kieran Poynter three years ago was 'nonsense'. He was describing the details of his approach to assessing and providing for potential losses incurred on the insurance syndicate, which specialised in marine risks. The evidence came in the second week of his cross-examination in the case brought against Gooda Walker by 3,095 of its lossmaking Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally underwritten the market. Last Thursday, during a highly strained morning of testimony, he said he had been put under pressure to mislead Names in estimates of losses, which he had refused to do. He said he had conducted estimates of losses before the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster, in contradiction to his testimony to the Poynter committee read to the court. He also dismissed as 'nonsense' his previous comments to the committee about how much of an allowance he traditionally made for losses. 'I made a mistake,' he said. He said he stood by his estimates of losses on syndicate 299, but he had doubts about those made by 'some people' at the agency of the losses incurred on syndicate 298.</p>

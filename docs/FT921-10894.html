			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Trading held to tight ranges Trading was restricted to tight ranges yesterday on the foreign exchange markets, with dealers cautious ahead of US employment data due for release on Friday, writes Simon London. The dollar was mixed overnight in the Far East, losing ground against the D-Mark but holding firm against the yen. The US currency closed in Tokyo at DM1.6050, from DM1.6115 at the close in New York, and Y125.65 from Y125.80. These tight ranges were carried forward into European trading, with only a brief flurry of activity on the announcement that German steel workers and employers had reached agreement over pay. The 130,00 workers represented by the IG Metall union now look likely to accept a 6.4 per cent pay offer. The union was originally asking for a 10.1 per cent pay increase and last week received strong backing for strike action. Even so, most analysts saw the settlement as disappointing and encouraging other unions to press for higher pay. Against this, industrial production figures for December showed output in western Germany falling by 3.1 per cent during the month, having risen by 0.3 per cent in November. Although the data is distorted by national holidays, the figures were taken as a sign that economic activity is now contracting. Overall the D-Mark was stronger. The settlement higher than retail price inflation, currently around 4 per cent, may encourage the Bundesbank to maintain a tight monetary stance. In the afternoon session, the dollar weakened further against the D-mark following the realese of the monthly index produced by the US National Association of Purchasing Managers. The index registered 47.4 in January, unchanged from December. A figure below 50 shows that economic activity is generally contracting. The US currency closed in London at DM1.5975 from DM1.6080 on Friday; Y125.90 from Y125.55; Sfr1.4235 from Sfr1.4285; and Dollars 1.8000 from Dollars 1.7900 against sterling. The D-Mark was also stronger against the yen, rising to Y78.75 by the London close, having traded below 78.00 at the end of last week. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the strength of the D-Mark renewed the pressure on sterling, the weakest currency. The UK unit fell back in the afternoon to close at DM2.8675 from DM2.8775 on Friday, just a shade above its floor within the system, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the strongest currency, the peseta. The peseta was bouyed by the removal of capital controls in Spain, closing in London at Pta62.91 against the D-Mark, little changed from the levels seen on Friday. Analysts expect the liberalisation measures to increase the flow of overseas funds into peseta assets.</p>

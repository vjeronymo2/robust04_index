			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: High class In essence, Observer has only one thing to say to readers who tackled last Monday's numeracy-style questions. It is: 'Go to the top of the class]' After all, any candidate who got 82.8 per cent of the total marks available in a test would be considered to have done very well. But that was merely the average score of the 151 of you who entered the quiz. The questions, with the answers in italics, were: 1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter? Pi. 2 What is 12 1/2 per cent of 60 per cent? 7 1/2 per cent. 3 If 93 folk enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner? 92. 4 In the A1, A2, A3 . . . series of paper-sizes, what mathematical relationship does the length of each sheet's longer side bear to the length of its shorter side? When the shorter side is designated as 1, the longer is the square root of 2. 5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem that sheds light on question 4. Pythagoras. 6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is unique about the number 1,729? It is the smallest number that can be formed from the sum of two cubes in two different ways (13x123=1,729; 103x93=1,729). 7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to 6 instantly. Ramanujan. As Observer reported last Thursday, 62 of you produced perfect answers within the time limit, so necessitating a tie-breaker to find the winner of the bottle of malt whisky. As threatened, it is a stinker calling for knowledge both of numerate and of literary culture. It has two parts. The focus is the ancient problem: Which number when added to one seventh of itself equals 19? It is easily solved by algebra which allows a non-numerical 'place-holder', such as x, to stand for the initially unknown number constituting the answer - for example, x + x/7 = 19. But algebra is a relatively recent method which was scarcely known in England, at least, until the mid-16th century. Before then, there was no facility for using unknown place-holders, and such problems had to be solved by calculating solely with whole numbers and fractions (as distinct from decimals), the preferred method being called 'The way of falsehood.' Now to the question: A Show how the problem could be worked out by such a pre-algebraic method. B Which 16th-17th century English poet hinted that he understood the then new algebra, and in which poem? All entries welcome, but only the previous 62 timely and all-correct entrants will be in line for the prize. Answers by fax to Observer on 071-873 3926 or 071-873 3196 by 6pm London time tomorrow, or by mail postmarked the same day.</p>

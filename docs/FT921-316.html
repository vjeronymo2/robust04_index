			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Third-quarter reverse for BHP BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, reports a fall in third-quarter net profit to ADollars 224m (USDollars 172.3m) from ADollars 245m in the previous year's comparable period. However, BHP said the reduction was caused by an abnormal income tax benefit in the earlier period, which more than offset an improvement in pre-tax profits from ADollars 359m to ADollars 459m. Revenue fell by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 3.6bn. The result suggests BHP is unlikely to match last year's record full-year net profit of ADollars 1.42bn, in spite of higher contributions from the steel division and its share in the Escondida copper mine in Chile. Net profit for the first nine months of the year was ADollars 631m, down 41 per cent on the previous comparable period. Before tax, profit for the nine months was down 13 per cent to ADollars 1.1bn. Revenue fell 13 per cent to ADollars 11bn. BHP said net profits from the minerals division increased 16.8 per cent to ADollars 171m in the quarter, largely because of an increased contribution from Escondida, which began shipments in the third quarter of 1991. The Australian coal business also reported improved results, mainly due to increased sales volumes and the sale of its interest in a joint venture project. The gains were partly offset by lower results from manganese operations caused by lower demand. The steel business produced a net profit of ADollars 37m, compared with ADollars 15m in the previous quarter, which was adversely affected by preparation for the relining of the group's largest blast furnace. Steel despatches were 6 per cent higher than in the comparable quarter of last year, but 9 per cent below the second quarter of the current year. Steel exports were up 33 per cent, but export profits suffered from lower prices caused by over supply. The petroleum division posted a net profit of ADollars 83m, down 58 per cent on the previous period, which included the impact of high oil prices during the Gulf war. BHP said the division's net profit was 44.6 per cent lower if the impact of the war was excluded.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ROLE IN BUILDING IRAQI WAR MACHINE  </P> <P> Your editorial ("The Oil Shortage That Need Not Be," Aug. 9) makes excellent  sense in its separation of source and supply.  </P> <P> Certainly it is time for "the United States to get serious about renewed energy  conservation and finding alternative sources to oil."  </P> <P> What about solar energy and other ways to make machinery run (non-nuclear, that  is)? Consider what might have been accomplished with the time, energy, brains,  and money spent on research for atom and hydrogen bombs, "Star Wars," and all  of the other huge and polluting weaponry.  </P> <P> Of course, the process could be speeded, if only certain favored interests and  states could be granted sole distribution and guaranteed profits from the sun's  rays.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH NAUSS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

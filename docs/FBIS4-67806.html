			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- ``The mechanism for putting into  effect the measures stipulated in the trilateral declaration of  the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States on 14  January has begun working.'' This was how Grigoriy Karasin, the  director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information  department commented at a briefing today on reports of the  arrival at the Zaporozhye AES, the largest in Europe, of the  first batch of fuel installations [toplivye sborki] from Russia  as part of compensation for dismantled nuclear warheads.    As the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, all nuclear  munitions had, in accordance with the statement by the  presidents of the three countries, to be brought from Ukraine to  Russia in order for them to be dismantled as rapidly as  possible, while Russia for its part had to provide compensation  in the form of nuclear fuel installation deliveries to Ukraine  to meet the needs of Ukraine's nuclear power sector during the  same period of time.    In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine,  Russia  had undertaken to supply it over 10 months with fuel  installations containing 100 tonnes of low-level enriched  [nizkoobogashchennyy] uranium for nuclear power stations. A  minimum of 200 nuclear warheads off RC-18 and RS-22 missiles  will be taken from Ukraine to Russia in the same period to be  dismantled.    In the opinion of Russian experts, the first consignment of  fuel received by the Zaporozhye AES is enough to power one of  the power units for a year, providing Ukraine with 5.5-5.6  billion kilowatt hours of electricity.</p>

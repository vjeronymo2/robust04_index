			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery helps Burton to Pounds 41m - Debenhams rises but losses at Principles, Top Shops and men's wear Burton, the clothing retail group including Debenhams, Burtons and Dorothy Perkins, more than doubled profits last year despite falling into the red in its multiples division. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 41.1m in the 53 weeks to September 3, up from Pounds 16.3m in 1992-93 when there was an exceptional loss of Pounds 19.6m. Total sales edged ahead from Pounds 1.89bn to Pounds 1.91bn. Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said the group's plans for recovery were moving along the right track, although all was not behaving exactly as he would have liked. The strategy of rebuilding the brands had led to better sales and margins throughout the group in the second half, with the exception of Burtons. The men's wear chain reported an operating loss of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 6.4m profit) on sales down 5.5 per cent to Pounds 263m (Pounds 278.3m). Sales fell 19 per cent, although 7 percentage points of the decline were accounted for by the decision earlier this year to contract out its business in men's suits. Mr Hoerner said the group had reduced the amount of sales promotions at Burtons and had cut stocks, but he was 'not expecting any great things this season'. Losses at Principles rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 19.4m on lower sales of Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 120.4m), although the figures reflect a fall in the number of outlets. While losses at Top Shop/Top Man increased to Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 5.1m), sales edged ahead to Pounds 216.9m (Pounds 212.9m), and the second half was just in the black. Dorothy Perkins and Evans both increased operating profits, to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 10m) and Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 10.9m) respectively. In the first nine weeks of the current year the multiples had operated without staging sales for 90 per cent of the time, compared with only 30 per cent last year. This had resulted in an improvement of 5 percentage points in the gross margin, although the group stressed that this was not sustainable throughout the first half. Operating profits at Debenhams rose from Pounds 57.7m to Pounds 71.5m on sales ahead from Pounds 854.4m to Pounds 910.4m. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 17.7m, and net debt at the end of the year was Pounds 77m, down from Pounds 212m. This was mainly as a result of the sale in May of four shopping centres for Pounds 153m, a deal that ended the group's foray into the property business. Earnings per share were 2.1p (0.9p). A final dividend of 1p is proposed, giving an unchanged 2p for the year. COMMENT The name of the game is to get the multiples back in profit, particularly Burtons and Principles which between them lost Pounds 32m - a sum not far short of the group's total profit. Stabilising margins and re-establishing price integrity without losing sales is not easy, but early indications for the current year suggest the group has taken the right approach. At Principles, sales in the early weeks are nearly 7 per cent higher and 59 of the badly performing stores have been taken out of the division. A quick turnround will follow if the strategy is successful. This is reflected in the share price, which rose 7 1/2 p to 71p yesterday. Forecast profits this year of Pounds 65m put the group on a prospective multiple of more than 20, a premium to the sector - but perhaps still attractive to the optimists.</p>

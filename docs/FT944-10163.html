			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (1): The hare becomes a tortoise - The most westernised country in the region has squandered its head-start in the past few years Hungary, the pioneer of eastern Europe's economic reforms, remains in many ways the most advanced of the post-communist democracies. But this central European state of 10m people with an impenetrable language appears to have stumbled and squandered much of its head-start over the past couple of years. The national mood has slipped back into a customary malaise after a brief burst of optimism when voters ejected an unpopular conservative government in May and elected what appeared to be a more competent Socialist-led administration. Mr Gyorgy Ivanyi, commissioner for bank privatisation at Hungary's AVRT state holding company, feels along with many commentators that Hungary has lost its 'competitive edge.' He says: 'We are not Poland, forced to make radical moves. Nor a Czech Republic, which can quietly wait for an upturn in the world economy before doing anything serious. That is why we have neither the dynamism of the Polish economy nor the consolidation of the Czech one.' This loss of self-esteem matters. Hungarian business and government leaders, lacking confidence in themselves, find it difficult to woo international investors. 'The Czechs have sold their country fantastically, but the Hungarians have not done so in any meaningful way,' admits Mr Janos Bartha, managing director of CS First Boston in Budapest. Some observers are not surprised that Hungary should slip down the rankings. 'It is logical that as others catch up, Hungary falls into its place,' says Mr Andras Simor, managing director of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest. But the economic numbers are worse than that. Output has dropped 20 per cent in four years; it has also fallen more or risen less than the east European average every year since 1991. Recovery this year has run straight into balance of payments constraints. The economy may show GDP growth of up to 3 per cent this year but is forecast to sink back into a second dip of recession in 1995 as government austerity measures bite. Inflation, at 19.5 per cent in August, and the public sector deficit, expected to reach 7 per cent of GDP, are intractable. Hungarian debt is stuck stubbornly below investment grade while the rating agencies have twice upgraded the Czech Republic. Hidden by the gloomy national statistics, however, are a host of real achievements. Though a deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary and former official of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Gyorgy Szapary argues: 'You cannot reduce a country to a fiscal deficit or a balance of payments number.' The national telecommunications company Matav is the first in the region to be privatised. Gas and electricity sectors are next in line. A start has been made to bring in foreign investment and expertise into the country's troubled banking sector. Activity on the Budapest stock exchange has taken off. Richter Gedeon, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, and plastics producer Pannonplast are among companies that have been floated. A record Dollars 400m of portfolio investment has flowed into the country in the past 12 months. A new generation of entrepreneurs has sprung up. Businessmen like Mr Imre Somody, the founder of pharmaceuticals producer Pharmavit, have taken the place of the wheeler-dealers who made their fortunes in the 1980s, only to lose them in the 1990s. State-of-the-art digital lines have spread apace. New 'GSM' mobile telephone services are a success. Construction has begun on the region's first privately-financed toll motorway, which promises to bring Vienna within two hours' easy driving of Budapest. Complaints about banking services and office space, once staples of businessmen's conversation, are now muted. Hungary's many Cassandras have forgotten the inter-enterprise debt that they once said would entangle the economy. Hungary has its precocity to thank for many of its advantages. The country opened up just in time, and lured foreign investors before the international recession hit and western multinationals retrenched. The lax communist regime allowed a relatively free flow of people and information. 'Hungary is the most westernised country in the region,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central European International Bank. Just look at the people, their outlook, their attitude.' But how has Hungary, with this rich inheritance, produced such a dismal set of economic statistics? One generous theory is that Hungary has gone furthest of the former Communist countries in making bankruptcy a real discipline on corporate behaviour. The government has also spent the most - Dollars 3bn so far - in shoring up state banks made technically insolvent by defaulting clients. The measures should eventually bring benefits. But the bill comes first: lay-offs at bankrupt enterprises; high borrowing rates charged by troubled banks; and government bail-outs which fuel the budget deficit. There are, however, less charitable explanations for Hungary's poor economic performance. 'The fact that Hungary started reforms earlier is in some ways a disadvantage,' concedes Mr Szapary. The sense of being ahead has sometimes induced complacency. 'Politicians could afford the luxury of not reforming and that is what they have been doing,' says Mr Laszlo Csaba of the Kopint-Datorg economic research institute. Moreover, Hungary's economic development in the 1980s was a mixed blessing. It was financed largely by foreign borrowing. Even the central bank admits that Hungary's debt ratios - debt service was 45.5 per cent of current account revenues in 1993 - are 'very near the critical point'. The uniquely heavy burden has stood out all the more as Poland, Yugoslavia, Russia and Bulgaria have defaulted and moved towards rescheduling. Mr Almos Kovacs, a deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary, issues the kind of advice a doctor might give to one of the many Hungarians with heart conditions: 'Since we have this additional constraint that these others don't have we must be careful how we generate economic growth.' Another legacy is obstinate inflation. Price controls were lifted earlier and more gradually than in other east European countries. That meant that inflation peaked at 38 per cent, lower than elsewhere. The downside is that expectations of inflation are built in to the public consciousness. Phased adjustment in prices has also allowed wages to keep up more than they could in Poland and the Czech Republic. Corporate profitability has suffered. Hungary's reforming communists may also have institutionalised a western-style welfare system too early - at a time when it seemed that the country could afford generous benefits and exorbitant tax rates. Mr Janos Kornai, an economist, coined a phrase: Hungary has developed a 'premature welfare state'. His Swedish colleague, Mr Anders Aslund, looks no further for an explanation of Hungary's malaise. 'There is little reason to expect economic dynamism from Hungary when only Sweden has a higher tax burden.' But others insist that it is not yet time to write the country off. One favoured metaphor for eastern Europe's arduous economic transition is the 10,000 metre race. One should not judge the outcome by the position after the first lap. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the new Socialist finance minister, is after all making the most serious effort in years to get to grips with welfare spending. And the sophistication of people, companies and institutions must eventually pay off in better economic performance. At least that is what Mr George Kopits, country representative for the IMF, believes. 'They have fantastic human capital. In this country if they moved government out of everyday life, the economy could grow at 5 per cent plus for several years in a row. No problem.'</p>

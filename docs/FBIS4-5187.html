			<p>BFN     [Text] Heavy fighting between Phnom Penh forces and the  Khmer Rouge at Khao Preah Vihear on the Thai-Cambodian border  continued for a second day yesterday.    Cambodian government soldiers moved to seize the ancient  landmark from the Khmer Rouge this week.    More than 400 government soldiers supported by artillery and  mortars, began to storm Khao Preah Vihear on Wednesday [6 April]  to capture a Khmer Rouge stronghold on top of the ancient  remains but they failed to gain control since the faction fought  back with heavy gunfire.    The Phnom Penh forces had to back down and lay siege at the  foot of the mountain.    Details of casualties are unavailable. Heavy shelling by  government soldiers however, was believed to have caused some  damage to Khao Preah Vihear itself.    During the clash, four artillery shells reportedly strayed  across the border and landed near a Thai rangers' base in  Kantharalak district but no one was injured.    The sound of gunfire was heard in Kantharalak district  yesterday.    A Thai soldier yesterday said Thai forces were on alert and  had reinforced para-military troopers near Khao Preah Vihear.  The Suranari Task Force had prepared to fire back if more  shells from the fighting landed in Thailand.</p>

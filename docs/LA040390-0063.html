			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE POSTS HUGE LOSS IN 4TH QUARTER;  </P> <P> EARNINGS: JUNK BONDS WERE BLAMED FOR THE $836 MILLION IN RED INK. REGULATORS  ALSO HAVE TAKEN ADDITIONAL ACTION AGAINST THE LOS ANGELES INSURER.  </P> <P> First Executive Corp., the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurance holding  company, on Monday reported an $835.7-million net loss for its 1989 fourth  quarter, much larger than expected and due mainly to continued declines in the  value of its junk bond holdings.  </P> <P> The writedown on its investment portfolio amounted to $859 million, which was  $344 million more than the company in January had said it would take for the  quarter. The company said it took the bigger writedown in part because the  market value of the junk bond portfolio deteriorated considerably after the  year ended.  </P> <P> Insurance industry analysts said the huge writedown didn't appear to pose an  immediate threat to the company's viability, and First Executive said its main  insurance units, Executive Life of California and Executive Life of New York,  have enough cash and liquid investments on hand to meet foreseeable needs.  </P> <P> First Executive grew to prominence in the 1980s by investing heavily in  high-yield, high-risk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and offering  exceptionally high returns to buyers of life insurance and annuity products.  But like other companies that invested a big portion of their assets in junk  bonds, First Executive's fortunes have declined as the junk bond market  collapsed in recent months.  </P> <P> In its earnings statement, First Executive said the fourth-quarter loss,  equivalent to $9.98 per share, contrasts with net income for the 1988 fourth  quarter of $48.2 million, or 42 cents per share. First Executive reported a net  loss for the full year of $775.6 million, or $9.67 per share, contrasted with  net income of $174.5 million, or $1.51 per share, for 1988.  </P> <P> In over the counter trading, First Executive's stock ended the day unchanged at  $2.75 a share.  </P> <P> In a separate development, the company disclosed a series of actions by  regulators, including the launching of a formal investigation last month by the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> The SEC is said to be looking into whether the company failed to disclose  severe financial problems when it sold an offering of its own securities to the  public last year. Although an informal SEC inquiry on the subject has  previously been reported, the announcement that the commission is now taking  formal action suggests that the SEC believes it has sufficient evidence of  wrongdoing to go ahead with a full investigation.  </P> <P> Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive, refused to comment  on the SEC investigation.  </P> <P> In an SEC filing, First Executive also revealed that the California Insurance  Commissioner recently ruled that First Executive had entered into illegal  arrangements with a partly owned subsidiary, First Stratford Life Insurance  Co., concerning reinsurance. Former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief  Michael Milken also owns a minority stake in First Stratford. The exact nature  of the problem wasn't disclosed, but sources said First Stratford's own heavy  investments in junk bonds violated California reinsurance regulations.  </P> <P> A spokesman for First Executive said: "It appears to be a technical issue that  should be resolved in the near term." A spokesman for Milken said he had not  seen the filing but added: "Milken is not involved in the operations or  regulatory issues involving this company."  </P> <P> First Executive confirmed that 45% of its total invested assets remain in junk  bonds, an exceptionally high proportion for an insurance company. The company  also disclosed that it had agreed with the California regulators not to buy any  more junk bonds without first notifying them. New York regulators have already  severely restricted the junk bond purchases of the firm's New York unit.  </P> <P> Disclosure of the much larger than expected fourth-quarter writeoff angered  some securities analysts, who said the company hadn't warned them about it at a  meeting in California a month ago, when the company gave a relatively rosy  presentation of its financial outlook. Frederic Townsend, a principal of the  Connecticut firm Townsend &amp; Schupp, which analyzes insurance companies,  said Monday that "this is much worse news than they told us." He added: "Their  credibility is pretty much smashed."  </P> <P> Carr refused to comment. However, the company said the rate at which customers  are pulling money out of the company through surrenders of annuities and life  insurance policies has begun to drop, approaching "normal" levels after a big  surge earlier this year.  </P> <P> The surrenders have been a major source of concern for regulators, and are  considered the biggest threat to the company's survival. A decline in  surrenders would therefore be good news. Carr, however, declined to give  specific figures for the surrenders, although the company warned that Monday's  news of larger than expected losses might temporarily cause another increase in  surrenders.  </P> <P> Analysts now are concerned about how well the company performed in this year's  first quarter, which has already ended. The company is weeks away from  disclosing figures. Carr refused to go into details but said: "The company  continues to perform very well in the first quarter in what has been a  difficult period."  </P> <P> DREXEL ASSETS ON THE BLOCK  </P> <P> The now bankrupt junk bond king is not-so-quietly selling its assets, including  its prized computer database.

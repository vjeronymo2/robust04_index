			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (9): Don't just sit back - Andrew Jack examines the role of trustees WHEN Kingsley Napley, a firm of solicitors, issued a booklet recently on the legal duties of charity trustees it had no idea of the level of response this would provoke. The firm's London office has since been bombarded with telephone calls and written requests for copies. At a time when the need for charity trustees to take their responsibilities seriously has never been greater, the incident is an illustration of the extent of current ignorance of their role. A recent survey by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations showed that few charity trustees had a clear view of their responsibilities. Only one-third of the members of charity management committees were even aware that they were trustees. Under present law, Britain's estimated 1m charity trustees have wide-ranging legal, financial and managerial responsibilities. Of them all, the most worrying is that a trustee could face personal bankruptcy in order to meet outstanding debts incurred by the charity. This is true in spite of the fact that trustees usually give their time voluntarily, with no thought of personal gain. (In fact the law itself prevents them from receiving payment for their labours.) The 1992 Charities Act has added to existing obligations by including additional requirements on financial reporting and annual auditing, fund-raising and administration. Mr Tony Sacker, head of the charities group at Kingsley Napley, says that for the first time he is now dealing with several cases of charity trustees who face personal legal action to recover funds. 'People's first reaction, when I tell them their obligations, is that I must have got it wrong,' he says. 'They can't believe it.' It is not so much that the new legislation has brought aggressiveness; rather that there is increasing willingness by creditors (such as landlords and banks) to take action to recover outstanding debts. Moreover, in an era of declining government grants, charity trustees might even find themselves liable for staff redundancy payments if they have to close or reduce the operations of a charity. 'Trustee' may be more widely defined than those persons who simply have the name attached. Trustees normally also include executive committee members and, more widely, the council members who delegate powers to this executive. Guidance on who are the trustees of a charity's assets comes from the legal trust deed or memorandum which formally governs the charity. But what action can trustees take to protect themselves against legal action and personal liability? Mr Sacker says: 'When you realise you've got a problem it's usually too late.' The greatest protection for trustees, he says, is to act only for charities which are limited by guarantee and governed by the requirements of the Companies Acts. This grants to trustees a protection similar to that of directors of companies, exempting them from personal liability. But Mr Sacker says the catch is that few charities want to incur the administrative difficulties or the audit and other costs of incorporation when they are first created. And once a charity is running successfully, trustees are equally reluctant to incur the additional burdens of re-establishing their organisation as a corporation. Charities which have sufficient assets to cover their liabilities - even if that means curtailing their operations - will generally be able to liquidate these before the need for trustees to dip into their own pockets would arise. The main safeguard for a trustee is not to enter into any commitments which might result in personal liability. For example, if the charity takes out a loan or a lease on premises, Mr Sacker suggests that trustees should agree the ground rules in advance, explicitly stating, in writing, that they are not willing to be made personally liable. As a rule, trustees are only liable for any commitments made once they join a charity. If they sign a bank loan or a new lease without special protection, they may leave themselves vulnerable to action. Normally they will not be liable for actions made by previous trustees before they joined, according to Mr Sacker. But they run this risk if they have signed an indemnity to take on liabilities from out-going trustees when they first join. Even with all these safegaurds, trustees may still be vulnerable. 'In every case you have to get into the detail,' says Mr Sacker. 'You could find yourself responsible. These things appear to happen almost by accident.' That leaves preventative action to ensure that a charity does not run into financial difficulties in the first place. Kingsley Napley's book highlights a number of points worthy of note by prospective trustees: Ask to see the governing document of the charity. Check the status of the charity and what it is entitled to do. Meet the co-trustees and ask if they are following its purposes. Find out what the charity's liabilities are and ensure they are covered by assets. Examine and get help in understanding the latest set of accounts, ensuring they are informative and up-to-date. Ask about any investments, in order to understand how well they are managed. Mr Sacker stresses the need to keep the threat to trustees in perspective. 'I can't say the bankruptcy courts are bursting with charity trustees,' he says. 'It probably will never happen to you. But don't just sit back and assume that everything going on is fine.'

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Closure threat to two north-east coal mines TWO coal mines in north-east England may close shortly, leaving only three working pits in the region. Easington, in County Durham, faces a review that will decide its future, and nearby Vane Tempest, near Newcastle upon Tyne, will be reviewed shortly afterwards. If the two pits close, nearly 1,500 jobs will be lost at Easington, and a further 900 jobs will be lost at Vane Tempest. Both collieries have had considerable financial difficulties. Vane Tempest made a loss of Pounds 922,000 in the first six weeks of this financial year, mainly because the colliery had failed to open enough new coal faces to maintain output. At Easington production has improved and losses have been reduced since January, but Mr Brian Wright, group director for the region, said in February that the pit had to sustain its performance to stay open. Mr Tom Watson, manager of Westoe colliery, which has been mainly profitable since the mid 1980s, said last week he might be able to offer jobs to miners made redundant.</p>

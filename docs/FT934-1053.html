			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market plunges further Speculators stepped up pressure on the world cocoa market yesterday, forcing prices to the lowest level since early October. At the London Commodity Exchange the March futures position closed at Pounds 904 a tonne, down Pounds 62 on the day, Pounds 132 over the past week, and Pounds 165 from the 5 3/4 -year high reached on December 3. There was no fresh fundamental news to explain the snow-balling sell-off, said Mr Lawrence Eagles. 'It was all down to massive long liquidation of speculative positions,' which had been been built up during the period of uncertainty about the health of Mr Felix Houphouet-Boigny, veteran president of the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer of cocoa, whose death was announced two weeks ago. In the event the power struggle that had been feared failed to materialise and the market was left at the mercy of the bearish developments that had been masked by the Ivorian factor - heavier-than-expected arrivals from West African harvests and signs that the Ivory Coast would not, after all, be delaying the marketing of its mid-crop cocoa. Mr Eagles said longer term prospects for the market remained bullish as rising consumption and flagging production continued to eat into excess stocks. And he thought a move below Pounds 900 a tonne in the near term was likely to attract manufacturers back into the market.</p>

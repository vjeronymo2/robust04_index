			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Sweden ponders barring politicians from company directorships SWEDEN'S politicians could soon find their moonlighting days are numbered. For years, politicians have been able to supplement their income by sitting on company boards, earning up to SKr100,000 a year (Dollars 17,200), according to some estimates. However, following a number of embarrassing scandals in recent months - which have suggested that some politicians have little aptitude for financial matters in their capacity as directors on a company board - the Finance Ministry is looking at ways of reducing the influence of politicians in the financial sector. The new Centre-Right government may then introduce a bill in parliament this autumn. The move is seen as long overdue by some members of the business community. Already, the government has announced plans to privatise 35 state companies. In addition, some Swedish savings banks - which are owned by foundations with separate boards of directors - plan to merge to form a large banking group listed on the stock exchange. Both measures are expected to encourage a more 'business-like' attitude, with directors appointed to the board on the basis of their expertise, and with responsibility to shareholders. The Ministry of Finance says the decision to reduce the influence of politicians in the financial sector stems from a number of recent scandals. Only last month, Forsta Sparbanken, a savings bank with customers mainly in the Stockholm and Gothenburg areas, announced losses of SKr5.7bn for 1991. Forsta's financial problems emerged over a year ago, and have been blamed on bad management, poor credit analysis and overexposure to the finance company and real estate sectors. The bank's management resigned in April 1991 but some members of the financial community question the responsibility of the board of directors at the foundation which controls the bank. At present, local authorities and county councils select the members of the board for the foundations which control each savings bank. 'Surely it is up to the board to take steps to reduce the risk exposure,' says Mr Leif Vindevag, a senior official at the stock exchange. Like many of the other savings banks, the board of directors on the foundation which controls Forsta contains several political appointees. Mr Tommy Lindell, executive vice president of Forsta, says: 'Most of our board members are political appointees  .. it is rather common in the savings banks.' The board members are from across the political spectrum, he adds. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance says that under the present law, the government appoints the chairman of the board and must approve the other board members for the foundations controlling the savings banks. However, this could change. In addition, some observers believe the question of responsibility needs to be addressed. In February 1992, Folksam, a mutual insurance group whose board of directors is dominated by trade union representatives, revealed heavy losses of SKr220m for 1991 with the prospect of further losses up to 1995. The company's managing director was forced to resign. However, much to the surprise of the business community, Mr Stig Malm, the chairman of Folksam's board and the head of LO, the powerful Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions (which is closely associated with the Social Democrats) announced that neither he nor the board would take responsibility for Folksam's losses. Despite his lack of experience in running a business, Mr Malm is still chairman of Folksam's board. Even more embarrassing for the Social Democrats - who were ousted from power last September - was the collapse of A-Pressen, the Social Democrats' newspaper publishing group, in February. A-Pressen revealed that its financial situation was far worse than expected - partly due to bad management, but also due to the tough economic environment. In this case heads did roll: the managing director was sacked, and Mr Bo Toresson, a board member and Social Democrat party secretary, resigned from the company. Mr Bjorn Karlin, who heads the Swedish share promotion organisation, an independent body financed by listed companies, claims some change is already taking place: 'The new government has put in fewer politicians and more professionals.'</p>

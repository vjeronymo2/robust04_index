			<p>CSO     [Text] According to the managing director of the  Budapest Stock Exchange, the elections have caused some  uncertainty in the stock market. But that is not a consequence  of a change in political direction. Rather, the uncertainty can  be attributed to the fact that the details of the new  government's economic policy are still unknown.    In the opinion of Jozsef Rotyis, international causes are  behind the slow decline of share prices over an extended period.  The Prague and the Warsaw exchanges, for instance, have suffered  sharper declines of their share prices than the Budapest Stock  Exchange has. On the other hand, the present slow correction is  also a result of exaggerated expectations at the beginning of  the year.    Nevertheless, the managing director believes that waiting to  see what the change of governments will bring is also a  significant factor in the decline of the exchange's trading  volume. This is not an exodus of foreign capital, but new  investments usually are not initiated at times like this, he  emphasized.    Jozsef Rotyis expressed concern about ideas that are being  voiced frequently nowadays--namely, that in privatization it is  necessary to concentrate on finding strategic investors and,  therefore, public offerings and privatization through the stock  exchange will be playing a smaller role in the future. Which  would mean that large financial investors would mostly shun  privatization in Hungary and would turn to other countries in  the region. To retain the presence of these large investors in  the Hungarian stock market, domestic small investors must also  be attracted to a greater extent, because only that can ensure  the stock market's liquidity.    However, the stock exchange expects foreign investment to  become more lively once the uncertainties regarding the new  government's economic policy have subsided. An indication of  this is a report in last Friday's WALL STREET JOURNAL to the  effect that George Soros's investment fund, which manages  several hundred million dollars, is about to embark on a more  active investment policy in Central Europe. And the managing  director of the Budapest Stock Exchange believes that other  investors will be following in Soros's footsteps.</p>

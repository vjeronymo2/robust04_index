			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US cut announced as aluminium hits fresh peak Alumax yesterday became the second US aluminium producer to announce output cuts following the unprecedented international trade deal reached at the weekend by some of the world's big aluminium-producing countries. It did so as the price of aluminium for delivery in three months reached a fresh 16-month peak on the London Metal Exchange, moving up another Dollars 26.25 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,302.75. The prospect of the international deal, which aims to cut global output of the metal by at least 1.5m tonnes to bring the market back into balance, has lifted aluminium's price by nearly 15 per cent since the begining of 1994. Alumax will cut annual output by an additional 40,000 tonnes by the end of March. With curtailments already made, this brings its total to cut 146,000 tonnes a year. It did not say where the latest cuts would be made. Immediately after the weekend trade deal, Southwire said it would cut 10 per cent from production at its 170,000-tonnes-a-year Hawesville smelter in Kentucky. The market is also expecting announcements from Hoogovens of the Netherlands and Norsk Hydro of Norway, which have both indicated they would be willing to make more cuts. Mr William Adams, analyst with the Rudolf Wolff commodities group, said in a special paper on the outlook for copper and aluminium that 'on balance, it seems that cuts will be made and that in the long term aluminium prices will edge higher'. He added: 'Uncertainty in the market is likely to keep prices underpinned but the market will remain vulnerable to disappointed sell-offs should the western producers delay cuts.' Chile Copper Corporation, which has reported losses of about Dollars 200m on 'irregular' futures trading, was a big user of the LME but its activities were very small compared with the market as a whole, said Mr David King, the exchange's chief executive, reports Reuter. He said daily LME volume was over Dollars 3bn and 'while Codelco's activities are very important and significant to us in relation to liquidity and depth of the market, they are not so significant (a) that they would cause a problem to the market or (b) that they would cause financial problems overall to LME members'.</p>

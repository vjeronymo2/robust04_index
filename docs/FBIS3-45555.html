			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman reiterated here today that the financial  arrangements for the construction of the new airport in Hong  Kong should be something for China and Britain to settle through  consultations in accordance with the provisions of the  memorandum of understanding on the construction of the project.    "This is always the position of the Chinese side," said  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin at a routine news  conference here this afternoon.    He made the remark when responding to a question about the  British Hong Kong Government having last week asked the  Legislative Council to make allocation of funds to the  provisional administration of the airport.    "Before agreement is reached between the two sides,  unilateral actions will do no good to the settlement of the  financial arrangements," the spokesman said.    He revealed that the Chinese and British sides still have  working contacts within the new airport committee.</p>

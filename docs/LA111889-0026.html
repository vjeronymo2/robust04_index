			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> DERBY COULD BE A BATTLE OF CHARLIES  </P> <P> Can Charlie deal with Charlie?  </P> <P> This is one of the questions that will be answered Sunday in the 49th running  of the $200,000 Hollywood Derby at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Certainly, Charlie Barley, the 3-year-old Canadian colt, will be outnumbered by  the forces of Charlie Whittingham, the 76-year-old Southland trainer.  </P> <P> Seeking to win the Grade I Derby for only the second time this decade,  Whittingham will enter four horses -- River Master, Seven Rivers, Live the  Dream and Shining Steel.  </P> <P> Each of the four has reason to succeed. River Master is the most accomplished,  having won stakes at Del Mar and Bay Meadows, in addition to running second  behind Hawkster in the Del Mar Derby.  </P> <P> He bombed in his most recent appearance, winding up eighth in the Volante  Handicap at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. Eddie Delahoussaye, riding the colt  for the first time, said he thought something was bothering River Master, who  was trying to run wide the entire journey.  </P> <P> However, the son of His Majesty came out of the race well and his recent works  have been sharp. Chris McCarron, who has ridden him in each of his four  victories, will be aboard Sunday.  </P> <P> Seven Rivers, after being unable to break his maiden in four tries last year,  has blossomed as a 3-year-old, winning four of five since returning to the  races, including a 7-1 upset in the Volante.  </P> <P> Live the Dream was fifth in a pair of races at Del Mar, then turned things  around when he got to Santa Anita. After just missing in an allowance race, the  Northern Baby colt surprised older horses in the Henry P. Russell Handicap as  Robbie Davis scraped him through the narrowest of openings along the inside.  </P> <P> Shining Steel, winner of three of eight starts in England, has been training  well for his U.S. debut. He is owned by King owner Bruce McNall and his star,  Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> The four comprise a powerful Team Whittingham, but Charlie Barley has the  credentials to make this a profitable invasion. Trained by Grant Pearce and  owned by Scott Abbott and John Haney, the son of Affirmed has been a model of  consistency throughout his 18-race career.  </P> <P> He has failed to finish in the money only three times and is equally at home on  dirt or turf, the surface on which the Derby will be contested at 1 1/8 miles.  </P> <P> Regular rider Robin Platts thinks that grass is Charlie Barley's preference,  and this is the root of a good-natured, year-long argument between him and  Pearce.  </P> <P> "That's something Robin and I have had a lot of fun with," Pearce said. "I'm  not convinced he's better on either. He's pretty consistent and runs well on  both surfaces."  </P> <P> Platts, who was third aboard Carotene in the 1986 Yellow Ribbon Stakes on one  of his two previous trips to California, thinks the distance and the Hollywood  Park course will suit the half-brother to 1987 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner  Success Express.  </P> <P> "As long as it stays firm and he's running strictly against 3-year-olds at a  mile and an eighth, he's got a very good chance," Platts said.  </P> <P> "He breezed real well this morning (three furlongs in :35 2/5). He's kind of a  moody horse who likes to be pampered but he always tries."  </P> <P> Most recently, Charlie Barley was third in the Rothmans International over soft  going. Two races before, he lost by a half-length to Breeders' Cup Turf winner  Prized in the Molson Million on the dirt.  </P> <P> "He would have won the Rothmans on a firm turf course," Platts said. "They  didn't catch him until the last eighth of a mile."  </P> <P> Purchased for $50,000 at Keeneland two summers ago, Charlie Barley began his  career by running second in a stakes and has since earned more than $675,000.  </P> <P> When an anticipated invitation to the Japan Cup didn't come, it was decided  that the Hollywood Derby would be his last race of 1989.  </P> <P> "We're shortening him up a bit -- I think his best distance is a mile and an  eighth to a mile and a quarter -- and we're running strictly against  3-year-olds," Pearce said. "There aren't any other races for 3-year-olds now,  so this looked like the right spot when we didn't get invited to Japan. After  this, we'll send him to Florida for a rest.  </P> <P> "He's coming up to the race super. He breezed real well and I'm very pleased."  </P> <P> Besides the Whittingham foursome and Charlie Barley, nine others entered the  Derby, which continues to be a popular event.  </P> <P> Fourteen started last year's Derby, and the race was split into divisions the  previous seven years.  </P> <P> Also in Sunday's field are Raise a Stanza, third in the Volante; Go Milord, a  European making his American debut for Wayne Lukas; Broto, who has three  victories on on grass against lesser imports, Gauntlett Boy; Fast 'n' Gold; One  Drink; Art Work and Lowell.  </P> <P> The main event on today's program is the $75,000 Hollywood Turf Express at six  furlongs.  </P> <P> Topping the lineup is Sunny Blossom, who finished a distant second to Sam Who  in Oak Tree's Ancient Title Handicap, his first race in more than seven months.  Making only his second start on grass, Eddie Gregson's gelding drew the rail  today.  </P> <P> The highweight for the Express is Oraibi, back from Maryland after finishing  second in the Laurel Dash. He returned with a :58 2/5 workout at Santa Anita  for Richard Mandella and will be ridden by Laffit Pincay.  </P> <P> Others entered are California Jade, Summer Sale, You're No Bargain, Undercut  (also out of the Gregson barn), Star Cutter (who ran some strong races here at  this distance during the summer), Cutter Sam, Bit of a Lark and Ofanto.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Sam Who, whose number was taken down in the Breeders' Cup Sprint for  interference shortly after the start, skipped the Express in favor of the  National Sprint Championship Dec. 16. . . . Look for a change in the official  program sold at Hollywood Park. The odds will return to their traditional spot,  and most of the information supplied by the Daily Racing Form will be  eliminated. All that will be kept is the horse's record in 1989 plus its turf  record when applicable. . . . All Hollywood Derby entrants will carry 122  pounds. . . . For the first time at the meeting, the Pick Six fell Friday.  Because of some short fields and equally short prices, there were 49 perfect  tickets, each worth $4,057.40.  </P></p>

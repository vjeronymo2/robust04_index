			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President of the Republic Franjo Tudjman  unveiled a statue of Don Mihovil Pavlinovic, a leader of the  Croatian national revival, in Podgora today. President Tudjman  spoke about the work of Don Mihovil Pavlinovic and the current  situation in Croatia.    [Begin Tudjman recording] [passage omitted on details of  Pavlinovic's life] If it were not for the greatness -- both  intellectual and political -- of men such as Mihovil Pavlinovic  we would not have Croatia as it is today. His ideas, similar to  those of Ante Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual],  were the foundation for the thoughts of later cultural and  political players in Croatia, and we have used his ideas today  as the basis for the movement for the creation of the  independent and sovereign Croatian state. They have enabled us  to conduct Croatian state policy, as we have done, on all  issues, including the Serb problem in Croatia, the general south  Slav problem, and especially policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [end recording] [announcer's remarks indistinct]    [Begin Tudjman recording] We have proved to the world that  we  are in favor of a peaceful solution. The world has seen that  Croatia is a peace-loving country, but also a resolute country.  Consequently, if we have to, if our efforts to normalize  relations by peaceful means and gradually to introduce the  constitutional and legal system into the occupied territories  fail, the world will have to understand that Croatia has used up  all possibilities and that it can no longer support a situation  in which more than 250,000 Croatian people, refugees live  outside their homes, even if those homes are destroyed and  ruined. We will build new ones, we will build everything all  the way to Vukovar and Baranja [words indistinct] [applause]  [end recording]    [Announcer] Croats from Australia, Canada, America, and  Europe are coming back home. The unity and reconciliation of  all Croats here and in the diaspora have been achieved. Despite  the war we have managed to conduct a stable economic policy, and  it is thanks to this that we will manage to introduce our money,  the Kuna, on Statehood Day. The president said that economic  experts have recognized our achievements:    [Begin Tudjman recording] You have achieved this despite the  consequences of the war and without a single dollar or mark in  foreign loans. You have achieved this because you knew what you  wanted both in the political and economic spheres. Croatia had  a leadership that knew what it wanted, that led its people, and  gained the people's trust. [passage indistinct]    Let us be worthy of Mihovil Pavlinovic and other great men  of  Croatia, and of all Croatian victims who have laid their lives  on the altar of the homeland. Let us be worthy of everything we  have achieved in the past four years, worthy of the achievements  the world has recognized and admires. The world is ready to  lend assistance to our stable Croatia. As a democratic and  stable country, we needed allies in the world, but, I assure  you, the world also needs this stable Croatia as a factor of  peace and democracy, as one of the important players in the  creation of the new international order in this part of  southeastern Europe.    Dear brothers and sisters, men and women of Croatia [words  indistinct] Croatian navy, and the Croatian armed forces. I am  convinced that the Croatian people will know how to complete  their historic task, that they will strengthen their sovereignty  and know how to build the Croatian homeland into a country of  well-being and progress for all people of Croatia, a homeland  which Croats in the diaspora, throughout the world, will come  back to, because today they can be proud of being the sons of  the Croatian people and of a democratic Croatia.    Long live Croatia! [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

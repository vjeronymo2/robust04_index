			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Trustees saw risk in Belling deal: Pension fund invested Pounds 5.5m THE FORMER pension trustees of Belling, the cooker maker now in liquidation, acknowledged long before they purchased a subsidiary of Belling in 1991 that its value would be severely diminished if the company were wound up. The chairman and the finance director of Belling, Mr Richard Eric Belling and Mr Michael Henley Stewart, were responsible for the administration of the Belling pension fund. About Pounds 6m of the Pounds 8m sought by the current pension fund trustees from Belling's liquidators and others relate to this transaction. The activities of the trustees come to light as the government's own panel, under the stewardship of Professor Roy Goode, considers whether the present trust law framework is adequate to protect pensioners. The Goode committee is also asking whether there should be further restrictions on the composition of boards of trustees and on transactions between pension funds and plan sponsors. The subsidiary, Compound Sections Ltd, was sold to the pension scheme for Pounds 5.5m in December 1991. It is now valued at Pounds 2.5m. The Pounds 8m sought by the trustees includes about Pounds 3m as a performance-related penalty payment for failing to achieve expected earnings. In April 1991 Mr Stewart and Mr Belling contemplated the likely winding-up of Belling by Midland Bank, its largest lender. Mr Stewart believed CSL would be able to continue to trade as an independent company but that its value would be severely diminished by the loss of work from Belling itself. Belling had been trying to find a buyer or investor for all or part of the company for some months before the sale of the subsidiary to the pension fund. Earlier in April 1991 3i, the venture-capital investment company, turned down a request by Belling for a cash injection via a buy-out of the company. 'We felt that next year's budget is credible, but contains areas of risk', 3i said in explaining its decision. Also that month Belling was discussing the possible sale of all or part of the company with investment bankers S G Warburg. The present pension trustees are also seeking Pounds 2.1m from the former trustees personally in connection with pension fund monies used for an advance interest payment on a Dollars 50m loan to Belling itself which never materialised.</p>

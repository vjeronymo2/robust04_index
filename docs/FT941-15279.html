			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Timely sales made - Directors' transactions As the revelry of the new year dies, director activity continues with a mixture of judicious purchases and timely sales. Vega Group, involved in the provision of computer software systems, came to the market in June 1992 and its shares have out-performed the market by 67 per cent over the past 12 months. Following the strong growth, directors have been selling stock: Christopher Duckworth, the finance director, sold some back in September; more recently he has joined with two other directors, John Rigg, the chairman, and Angus Johnson to sell a total of 690,000 shares at 210p per share. Johnson and Rigg both retain sizeable stakes but Duckworth's holding has been cut considerably. Smith New Court, the City stockbroker and market maker, saw its share price rise 220 per cent over the past year. Given such a movement, it is not surprising that directors are taking some of the cream off the top. Two directors have sold a percentage of their stock: Anthony Abrahams has more than halved his holding and Michael Heath has cut his by one third, both at 415p. After Osprey Communications announced its final results, Ronald Sidaway, an executive director, bought 125,000 shares at 41p. This increases his holding to almost 500,000 shares and reflects the note of optimism the chairman sounded in his year-end statement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                     Sector       Shares      Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BTR                         DivI        275,000      1,029          1 Caradon                     BM&amp;M         20,000         82          1* EMAP                        Mdia         16,350         69          1 GBE Intl                    Eng          36,000         30          1 Grand Metropolitan          SW&amp;C        149,824        872          1* Hanson                      DivI          4,200         11          1 Independent Newsppr         Mdia        250,000      1,125          1 Life Sciences Intl          Hlth         68,000        102          1 Marks &amp; Spencer             RetG         15,000         58          1* Mercury Asset Mngmt         OthF          2,594         19          1 Pearson                     Mdia         30,000        188          1* Premier Land                ExIn      4,415,337        298          1 Radius                      SSer         70,500         18          2 Reed Intl                   Mdia         20,000        183          1* SEP Ind (inc pref)          Dist        853,956        316          2 Senior Eng Group            Eng          10,000         13          1 Sheriff Hlgds               BCon         25,000         64          1 Smith New Court             OthF        280,000       1162          2 Tarmac                      BM&amp;M         12,000         21          1 Trafalgar House             DivI         10,500         12          1 Vega Group                  SSer        690,000      1,449          3 Weir Group                  Eng          18,680         60          1 Wetherspoon JD              Brew        180,000        664          1 Wilshaw                     BM&amp;M        150,000         59          1 Willis Corroon              Insu          7,500         18          1 Yorkshire Water             Watr          2,090         13          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AAH Holdings                Hlth          5,000         25          1 Betterware                  RetG         12,297         16          1 Burnfield                   Eng          15,000         10          1 Cattle's Holdings           OthF         20,000         35          2 Clarke Nickolls &amp; C         Prop         54,250         15          1 Devlpmt Secs (open)         Prop      2,353,846        765          2 Dewhirst Group              Text        100,000         99          1 EMAP                        Mdia          7,500         32          1 Holliday Chem Holgs         Chem         10,000         16          1 Kalamazoo                   SSer         15,000         15          1 Marshalls(inc CCRP)         BM&amp;M         11,750         15          1 Osprey Comms                Mdia        125,000         51          1 Radius                      Text         47,000         12          2 Siebe                       Eng           8,000         46          1 Watts, Blake Bearne         ExIn          5,028         13          3 Wellman (pref)              Eng         100,000         90          1 Willis Corroon              Insu         10,000         24          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

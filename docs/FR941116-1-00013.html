			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under an established VE program (which operates on a continuing basis), the application of VE to the highway projects need not adversely affect or delay any project because the VE studies are normally performed in the early project development phase, where they can be integrated into the process. In addition, the overall effect of employing VE is generally positive, rather than duplicative of the engineering analysis already completed on any project, because VE uses a multi-disciplinary team, creative thinking, and functional analysis to improve quality and productivity, foster innovation, eliminate unnecessary and costly design elements, and ensure that projects are cost effective. The regulation may affect staffing levels in SHAs that do not currently utilize VE. Establishing, administering, and monitoring a VE program will require each SHA to assign staff to carry out specific VE functions, although it is expected that staffing assignments will be minimal. States with existing VE programs probably already have adequate staff assigned to carry out the VE functions. Individuals serving as VE study team leaders or members should be selected from existing SHA staffs that are trained in VE. Agencies may also hire VE consultants to perform the VE studies. In either case the study costs are eligible for reimbursement with Federal-aid funds at the appropriate pro-rata share for the type of project studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, any additional costs due to the need to hire or reassign staff to manage the VE program have been more than offset by the overall monetary savings resulting from the application of VE studies to highway projects. In general, States with active VE programs report return on VE investments of between 30 to 1 and 50 to 1, giving the opportunity for substantial overall savings. In 1993, California, Florida, and Massachusetts reported savings in excess of $100 million as a result of VE study recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since VE programs would be geared primarily toward analyzing the larger and more complex projects, most local agencies (those receiving small amounts of Federal-aid highway funds) would find themselves exempt from the process. Large local agencies receiving substantial amounts of Federal-aid highway funds would have to apply VE to some of their larger projects in the same manner as the SHAs and would achieve analogous benefits. Like State highway agencies, local agencies that are required to perform VE studies may perform the studies themselves or hire a VE consultant to perform the study. The cost to local agencies of performing VE studies is project related and is therefore eligible for reimbursement with Federal-aid highway funds, as stated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FHWA has determined that most small entities (those receiving small amounts of Federal-aid highway funds) will probably not perform VE studies because their projects are small and do not fit the project selection criteria set forth in this proposal for performing VE studies. Still, due to the many benefits that accrue through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the VE process, States should encourage local agencies to use VE in the development of Federal-aid highway projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities apply to this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. Under the Federal-aid highway program, the FHWA reimburses States for costs incurred in highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction projects. This regulation would simply provide that, as a condition of receiving such grants, States must ensure that project costs are controlled and project quality is maintained. This regulation recognizes the role of the States in employing VE. It gives States wide latitude in establishing, administering, and monitoring their VE programs and in selecting projects to be constructed using VE. Therefore, the FHWA has determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a separate federalism assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

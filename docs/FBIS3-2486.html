The mainland imported 25 million metric tons of iron and  steel in 1993, ranking first in the world in terms of iron and  steel imports; whereas Taiwan imported 15 million metric tons of  iron and steel last year, ranking third in world, Kuo Chin-mao  said, adding that the two sides' iron and steel imports  accounted for more than one-third of the world's iron and steel  trade last year; for this reason, it is necessary for the two  sides to strengthen exchange of information on iron and steel,  as this will benefit iron and steel businessmen on both sides.    In addition, Kuo Chin-mao said: In recent years, more and  more Taiwan bicycle and hand tool investors are investing on the  mainland; if people in the steel industry still remain  conservative and do not have a good idea of the mainland's  market trends, their business will be affected. Although the  government is energetically introducing a "southward-bound  policy" to reduce industrialists' fever in investing on the  mainland, the federation will still lead iron and steel  manufacturers and businessmen to the mainland to seek  cooperation, out of consideration of practical needs.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / People: Dunn's tomorrow Martin Dunn, editor of the Today newspaper, is leaving for the US to edit the Boston Herald. Several months ago the name of Dunn, 37, a former deputy editor of The Sun, was linked with the editorship of the Daily News in New York. Instead he is moving from one of Rupert Murdoch's five UK national papers to his main remaining US newspaper. During his editorship, Today became Britain's fastest growing newspaper and, according to News International, registered a 21.87 per cent last year.</p>

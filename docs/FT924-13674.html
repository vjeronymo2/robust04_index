			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel group announces cut in output NORILSK, THE world's largest nickel producer, attempted yesterday to steady the market after the metal's price plummeted again on the London Metal Exchange following news that LME stocks had reached their highest level for 34 months. Mr Nickolai Abramov, vice general director of the Russian group, revealed that low prices and weak demand had forced Norilsk to cut output by 15 per cent from the 1991 level and further output cuts were planned for 1993 if demand did not pick up. Traders were not impressed. 'Production cuts are all very well but nickel is still pouring out of Russia,' Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out. He suggested that Russia's formal nickel exports were being substantially augmented by primary nickel alloyed with some iron so that it could be exported as 'scrap'. Mr Abramov acknowledged, in a statement to the International Nickel Study Group meeting in closed session in the Hague, but released to the Reuter news agency, that there was a serious problem with unofficial or 'grey market' nickel exports from Russia. 'A strong policy from the Russian government is necessary to stop the leakage of nickel, copper and cobalt-containing metals,' he added. Analysts said the onus remained on nickel producers to cut output. Recently-announced measures by Inco, the Canadian group which is the world's second-largest nickel producer, to trim 1993 planned output by 18,000 tonnes was not enough. Most of its other rivals have said they will not follow suit, at least for some time, but 'other cuts of 30,000 tonnes are needed, although it's difficult to see where that will come from,' said Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research. The LME reported yesterday that its nickel stocks had risen by another 1,440 tonnes to 50,850. A year ago stocks were 8,604 tonnes and two years ago only 3,240. Nickel for delivery in three months, which dropped by Dollars 156 a tonne on the LME on Monday, fell another Dollars 84 on the LME to close last night at Dollars 6,447.50, down by another 3.5 per cent in two days.  --------------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS        (As at Monday's close)  -------------------------------------- tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium  +10,550 to 1,382,125 Copper        +350 to   300,475 Lead          +400 to   176,750 Nickel      +1,440 to    50,850 Zinc        +1,500 to   374,250 Tin            -25 to    14,880  --------------------------------------</p>

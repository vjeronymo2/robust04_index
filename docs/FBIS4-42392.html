			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday [30 May] about 200  demonstrators protested with whistles, paint bags, and noisy  slogans such as "Nazis out" against a rally by the rightist  "League of Free Citizens" for the European election in Hamburg.  When demonstrators tried to break through the cordon around the  speaker's rostrum, the police used clubs. Several demonstrators  were arrested. A few policemen and demonstrators were slightly  injured.    Even though Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of  Austria, who was the speaker at the rally, and "League of Free  Citizens" Chairman Manfred Brunner could barely be heard because  of the ear-splitting noise, the rally was not interrupted.  Haider and Brunner thanked the Hamburg police for "protecting  us against the leftist mob." The demonstrators repeatedly  chanted "German policemen protect fascists" or "Everyone wants  the same thing -- throw Haider into the Elbe River."    The "League of Free Citizens" considers itself to be  conservative-liberal. It primarily opposes the Maastricht  Treaty, which would turn Germany into a European province, "but  we want a Europe of the fatherlands, of nations."</p>

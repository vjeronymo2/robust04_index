			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Drinks combines see long term growth - Leading multinationals are taking more of a declining market It took an unusual combination of war and recession last year to slow the progress of the international drinks industry's leading multinationals. So far this year, their relative share performance has declined as investors have looked for opportunities in short term recovery stocks. As economic conditions improve, however, the pattern of growth that marked the international drinks sector in the 1980s should again bring long term outperformance. The global trend, summarised in the adage that people are drinking less but drinking better, is firmly established. Best estimates indicate that the total volume of spirits consumed worldwide is falling about 1 per cent a year; but high quality, heavily marketed international brands are growing at the expense of local products at the rate of 2 to 3 per cent a year. The process is visible in the most health-conscious western markets, and particularly in many less developed countries where personal affluence is increasing and trade barriers are being eroded. Companies which have benefited most from this trend - and stand to do so in the future - are those which have assembled strong portfolios of spirits brands and control marketing and sales through their own worldwide distribution networks. Research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), the London broker, suggests that such companies should attain organic profits growth of 11 per cent a year. Guinness and Grand Metropolitan hold the strongest hands. Each has 11 brands in the top 100. The Guinness portfolio includes the top-selling Scotch whisky, Johnnie Walker, and the premier gin, Gordon's. GrandMet has Smirnoff, the leading vodka, and Baileys, the most popular liqueur. The two companies, which dominate the UK drinks sector, generate the cash flow which has enabled them not only to strengthen their distribution systems but to begin reinforcing their prospective profits growth through acquisitions. In the past year, Guinness has bought such strong regional brands as Asbach, of Germany, Bundaberg, of Australia, and Pampero, of Venezuela. GrandMet has purchased a stake in Jose Cuervo, of Mexico, and taken over Cinzano. Seagram, with 10 of the top 100 brands, and Allied-Lyons, with eight, have tended to lag a little behind the pace of the two leaders. In the past year, however, both have put in radical restructuring programmes to sharpen the focus of management. Allied's joint venture agreement with Suntory, of Japan, could have important long term potential. Seagram's investment in Du Pont has been a valuable cash generator. Cognac and champagne tend to be the most vulnerable to recession. This suggests there may be some extra benefit of recovery in the stocks of LVMH and Remy Cointreau, the French groups. Each has reinforced its position in the market through alliances. LVMH's joint venture with Guinness has given it wider, low-cost distribution for brands which have the highest margins and profits per case in the industry. Remy's deal with Highland Distilleries has added a leading Scotch whisky to its portfolio - and its distribution strengths may yet bring in more agency brands as well as benefits from the integration of Cointreau into the system. The earnings outlook for these two groups appears vastly superior to that of Pernod Ricard. Speculative considerations apart, Pernod Ricard's shares look overvalued. Its Irish whiskies and Australian wines have given it some international dimension, but half of its earnings still come from the stagnating market for aniseed products, and 37 per cent of sales are in France. Bols, the Dutch group, in spite of the bias of its business towards liqueurs and the Netherlands and Italian markets, seems to have a much clearer growth strategy. Yet it trades at the lowest premium in the Dutch food and drinks sector.</p>

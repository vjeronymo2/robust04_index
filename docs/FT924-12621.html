			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Unisys extends rally with sharp third-quarter upturn UNISYS, the US computer manufacturer, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, raising confidence that the once seriously troubled company was making a turnround. Unisys debt burden has been reduced to Dollars 2bn, the lowest level since the formation of the company in 1986. Net income for the third quarter was Dollars 68.3m, or 23 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 75.8m, or 66 cents, last year. Revenue was up 5 per cent to Dollars 2.07bn, from Dollars 1.97bn. Tax-loss carry forwards contributed 6 cents a share to third-quarter net earnings. Growth in commercial information systems and services revenue was partly offset by a slight decline in revenues from Paramax, Unisys defence subsidiary, the company said. 'Despite economic uncertainty, we are confident that our record over the past 12 months of sustained profitability is a solid foundation for 1993,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. As projected by the company, total revenue for 1992 will be down from 1991. 'However, we are confident that we will meet or exceed all of our financial goals for 1992.' During the quarter, Unisys began paying down the arrears on its preferred stock dividends. Nine-month net income was Dollars 222m, or 79 cents a share, including 16 cents from tax benefits. This compared with a net loss of Dollars 1.47bn, or Dollars 9.69 a share, last year when the company took restructuring charges of Dollars 1.2bn. Revenue for the nine months was Dollars 6.17bn, against Dollars 6.23bn a year ago. Intel's fifth generation of microprocessor chips, to be launched early next year, will carry a new name. The company has registered the name 'Pentium' as a trademark to prevent competitors using the same name. Intel's current products are called the 386 and the 486, following a numbering convention the company has developed over several years. 'The natural course would be to call this chip the 586,' said Mr Andrew S. Grove, Intel president and chief executive. But Intel lost a legal battle with rival Advanced Micro Devices last year to protect its numbering system. 'That means that any company might call any chip a 586, even if it doesn't measure up to the real thing.' Pentium will be the 'brains' of the next generation of personal computers. 'It represents the next advance in performance - running software two to three times faster than today's 486 PCs,' said Mr Grove.</p>

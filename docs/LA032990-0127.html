			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AVIATION BUFFS REVEL IN 'THE CORNER' VIEWS  </P> <P> Antelope Valley aviation fans simply call it "the corner."  </P> <P> On a good day they might see some of the newest and most secret aircraft in the  world as they look east from Sierra Highway and Avenue N in Palmdale into the  Air Force's Plant 42.  </P> <P> Patrick Stebbens, 33, a dishwasher for a local hospital, says he's seen the B-2  Stealth bomber, the B-1 and the SR-71 "Blackbird," which was retired from  service recently. Stebbens said he tries to observe the Air Force base at least  three times a week.  </P> <P> Another regular, Bjorn Engstrom, 40, of Palmdale, said he likes to start his  day at the corner, where up to 100 others might be taking in the sights. "Many  times I stop out here at 7 a.m. with my coffee and newspaper," he said while  pointing out the underside of an Air Force jet to his son, Erik, 9.  </P> <P> "If I can, I'll stop by at lunchtime again and maybe a quick five or 10 minutes  in the afternoon. It's kind of a hobby to just come by and watch the airplanes.  There's been quite a few friendships built out on this corner," Engstrom said.  </P> <P> Sitting in the cab of his truck, local resident John McWhirter is equipped with  a chattering CB, a radio scanner spitting out aircraft call signs and a cooler  filled with drinks. "We're all airplane buffs and it doesn't cost us anything,"  he said.  </P> <P> Gary Larsen, 47, of Quartz Hill brought his son, Jason, 11, and daughter Gail,  21, out for an afternoon of sun and airplane watching. "It's great to come out  and watch what the planes do," Gail said.  </P> <P> Mixed in with the regulars are first-timers such as Palmdale resident Joe  Tyson, 31, who brought his wife, Andrea, and two children to see the show.  "It's neat," he said with a grin. "I plan to come back."  </P> <P> "I love to watch the airplanes," said Tom Engblom, 43, a Lancaster construction  worker who has been a regular since 1987.

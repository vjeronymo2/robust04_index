			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Yi (2621 1837) entitled: "A Strong Political </F> Boost Behind Economic Cooperation Between the Mainland and  Taiwan: Dissecting Taiwan Mainland Cooperation on Investment in  Hainan"]    [Text] Taiwan has decided to form a joint corporation with  Singapore to invest in the development of Hainan Island. This  plan on the surface appears to be an economic one, but in  reality the background behind this plan has an important  political content. And the CPC, because it agreed to this plan,  also is considering countermoves. Behind the CPC's attraction of  investment also lies a certain political purpose.    The plan for Taiwan businesses to invest in Hainan goes  under  the name of economic cooperation, and is also a political boost  for both sides of the straights. .  <H5>  Highlighting Taiwan's Position as a "Sovereign Country" </H5>   In confronting the swarm of Taiwanese businessmen recently  entering the mainland market, Taiwan authorities have  consistently been apprehensive that too many Taiwan businesses  are being drawn into economic trade activity, and that this  constitutes a non-governmental force among the people that would  tie down the policies of mainland authorities. For example, with  the "three connections" issue [China, Taiwan, commerce, postal  communications, and air and sea transport], Taiwan officials  recently also have been subjected to every kind of pressure,  because Taiwan businesses generally demand direct "open air  traffic," and direct "open business dealings," causing the  authorities much difficulty in holding fast under the  established conditions (the CPC must renounce the use of force  against Taiwan and give Taiwan international space), allowing  the "guiding principle of unification of the country" to enter  into an intermediate state, and permitting the state of the  "three connections."    What meaning does making Taiwan business investment in the  mainland transcend relations between the two sides endow to  international investment? This is the major task for Taiwan  officials doing all they can to implement the policies of "the  two sides as reciprocal political entities" and a "staged two  China's." For this reason, Singapore was brought into the  picture, and the formation of a joint corporation for the joint  development of Hainan's four natural resources of oil, natural  gas, minerals, and tourism, has become an important measure.  This plan has Taiwan putting up funds, Singapore providing the  name and personnel, and in reality is based primarily on putting  up the name. In this manner, this natural resource sector among  Taiwan's investments in the mainland, which touches on Taiwan's  economic lifelines, constitutes an international investment, and  avoids the situation where the CPC in the future could  nationalize Taiwan's source of oil, even as it achieves a  certain political purpose.    Taiwan business investment in the mainland has changed to  become an international investment, and also highlights Taiwan's  position as a sovereign country. This is beneficial to Taiwan's  expansion of its international space, to defeat of the CPC's  attempts to isolate Taiwan internationally, and to promote the  policy of "two China's by stages."    Another important factor is that Taiwan and the mainland  until now, as a result of the sovereignty issue and failure to  agree to an accord on guaranteeing investment, have also not yet  agreed to an accord on mutual exemption from rental taxes. But  Singapore has separately concluded accords with the mainland and  Taiwan on investment guarantees and mutual exemption from rental  taxes. With this type of investment in a major projects (the  development of oil, natural gas, and mineral natural resources),  Taiwan businesses also require an accord on guarantees. Using a  Singaporean corporation's name, of course, is quite a good  option.  <H5>  CPC Strengthens Its Economic Leverage Over Taiwan </H5>   From the CPC's point of view, the new CPC document on Taiwan  policy of early this year shows that the CPC's three principles  towards Taiwan have not yet changed. These three principle are:  the one China principle, the principle of not undertaking to  abandon the use of force against Taiwan, and in terms of  international space, the principle of continuing to restrict  Taiwan's activities.    The principle of the use of force against Taiwan is only a  threat of force, and has no meaning in terms of guiding current  actions. What is really guiding present actions internationally  is the continuation of the use of the "one China" policy to  oppose Taiwan's policy of "two Chinas by stages," and in this  way restricting Taiwan's international room to maneuver.    Because of changes within Taiwan's internal political  situation, there is more and more tendency to have a regular  posture vis-a-vis the mainland. Hence, the State Council's  Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Zhaoguo [3769 0340 0948], in  an early January public speech, also changed from the past's  emphasis on unification as the main task, "placing hope on  Taiwan authorities, and also placing hope on the people of  Taiwan," to "placing hope on Taiwan authorities, and placing  even more hope on the people of Taiwan." It should also be said  that the CPC has strengthened its people-to-people "work"  vis-a-vis Taiwan, and created a posture of "having the people  pressure the authorities."    Under the premise of confronting the changes in Taiwan's  political situation and the coordination of the three  principles, the focal point of the CPC's work on Taiwan has been  determined: economically, leverage over Taiwan, in military  affairs, pressure on Taiwan, and internationally, restricting  Taiwan.    Of these, economically gaining leverage over Taiwan means  attracting Taiwan businesses to invest in the mainland. This, on  the one hand stems from the requirements of the mainland's  economic development, and on the other also increases the  dependence of Taiwan's economy on the mainland. The mainland is  large, while Taiwan is small, and if the mainland lacks  investment from Taiwan businesses, then this type of risk can be  endured; Taiwan, a short time after it forms an economic  dependence on the mainland, will seem to lack the mainland's  market, the mainland's resources and raw materials, and it is  very possible that Taiwan's authorities could be compelled to  submit politically.    This is the political meaning of the CPC economically  gaining  leverage over Taiwan, and Taiwan of course cannot but recognize  this, and also cannot but protect itself.  <H5>  Both Sides Use Political Abacus </H5>   The issue of a guarantee accord for Taiwan investment was  raised during last year's April Gu-Wang talks and, at that time,  because of the "sovereignty issue," Taiwan was not able to  consult on a country-to-country guarantee accord and the issue  was shelved.    Since this time, the CPC has been more and more eager to  "economically gain leverage over Taiwan," and therefore has  decided to use an internal legislative approach to seek an  investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses.    But Taiwan authorities on the contrary have not been as  ardent in pursuit of a relevant guarantee accord. For this  reason, if the mainland is using a legislative approach, an  investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses on the mainland is  still limited by the "one country" category of the relationship  between the two sides. Taiwan must seek a "two country" or "many  country" guarantee, and for this reason has decided to promote  the plan calling for Taiwan Singapore cooperation to develop  Hainan.    When it comes to the plan for Taiwan Singapore cooperation  to  develop Hainan, CPC officials on the surface are still reticent,  and have yet to make known where they stand on this issue. It is  quite clear that the CPC is still considering the political  content of this plan, while locally, particularly on Hainan,  where activity is already taking place, officials are hastily  making preparations for large scale investments from Taiwan  businesses.    In appraising future CPC countermeasures, in terms of  large-scale, major projects, the Taiwan Singapore cooperative  development plan will channel this sector cooperation into the  international investment category. At the same time, a large  amount of investment will be channeled based on major projects  and the border investment projects of Taiwan businesses; medium  and small scale Taiwan business investment projects will be  allowed within the category of economic cooperation between the  two sides of the straights. Using the former to spur on the  latter, the latter then can help to achieve the political goal  of "gaining economic leverage over Taiwan."</p>

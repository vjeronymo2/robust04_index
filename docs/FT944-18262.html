			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (6): Carmakers locked into lobbying battle - Moves in Brussels to liberalise the car market Europe's carmakers have been locked for several months in an intensive lobbying battle in Brussels against the plans of the European Commission's competition directorate for liberalising the European car market. At issue is the reform of the so-called block exemption granted to the motor industry for 10 years in 1985, which allows carmakers to operate selective and exclusive car distribution and retailing systems in contravention of European competition rules. The present regulation expires at the end of June 1995. After much delay the Commission is set to publish shortly its proposed terms and conditions for a new block exemption. Following consultation with governments and the opposed ranks of the car producers and European consumer organisations, it is hoped that details of a new regulation can be finalised by the end of the year. The timetable is tight, but Karel van Miert, competition commissioner, is anxious to have the new rules agreed before the four-year term of the present Commission runs out at the end of December. At stake are sharply contrasting visions of how new cars should be sold and serviced, an issue that affects millions of car owners across Europe and which arouses intense emotions among Europe's carmakers. Is the consumer best served by the dedicated exclusive dealerships allowed under the present system? Or should the dealer networks be exposed to another order of competition, with multifranchising - the sale of competing brands - allowed on the same site. During coming weeks the debate will focus on several issues: Should dealers be allowed to take on other competing franchises within their existing exclusive territories, Should the carmakers have to provide technical information to independent service garages, and Should they have to agree sales objectives with dealers with independent arbitration in the case of disagreement. For how long should a new block exemption be granted, seven or 10 years, and should there be an interim review of performance? The battle over the terms of a new block exemption began in earnest in May, when the contents of the competition directorate's first draft were published in France. In an 'explanatory note' the competition mandarins stated that 'the experience acquired over the past 10 years shows that this regulation has not contributed in any significant way to either the opening up of national markets or to the development of flexible and efficient structures in the distribution of cars and spares'. The block exemption had to be revised to 'remedy these defects and stimulate competition'. The carmakers are incensed by the proposals. They argue that the present regulation works well, that far from stifling competition, it actually guarantees it, and that what the motor industry needs above all is stability, as it fights to restructure and regain world competitiveness against both Japanese and newly resurgent American rivals. 'There are those who wish, in particular within the European Commission, to subject this industry to an unprecedented and arbitrary experiment . . . who seek to undermine the whole foundation of automobile distribution in Europe,' says Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of the Fiat group and president of Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The assault on the carmakers in Brussels has been led by the consumer organisations, chiefly through Beuc, the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs. Jim Murray, director of Beuc, says that the block exemption has been 'an unmitigated disaster for consumers'. Beuc accepts the need for competent, trained personnel to carry out garage servicing - the notion of 'selectivity' allowed in the regulation. But it claims that there is 'no basis whatsoever' for allowing the present twin notions of exclusivity, that allow manufacturers firstly to limit the number of outlets on a geographic basis, and secondly to restrict them from stocking more than one brand. 'Why shouldn't new car buyers have the chance to compare different brands at a single outlet?' asks Mr Murray. 'This is the sort of consumer-friendly distribution we would like to see in place after 1995.' Beuc also maintains that the original block exemption of 1985 was granted on the condition that new car prices across the then European Community should not diverge beyond certain limits, namely 12 per cent in the long term and 18 per cent for periods of less than one year. It was also agreed on condition that individual consumers were at all times free to buy cars across borders from another member state. On both counts, the block exemption has failed, it says. The most recent car price study by the commission published this summer showed that 22.5 per cent of the models produced by European manufacturers had price differentials of more than 20 per cent. And as far as cross-border car-buying is concerned, Beuc is scornful. It claims that consumers that try to buy cars abroad are met with enormous difficulties, both from dealers and carmakers and from institutional barriers in national import, registration and tax regulations. Acea has led the call for the extension of the existing vehicle distribution system for another 10 years, essentially without modification. Rudolf Beger, Acea executive secretary, claims that cars are different and cannot be distributed like other products such as toasters or washing machines. Cars are the most complex consumer goods on the market, and the way in which they are serviced has big implications for both safety and the environment. The carmakers claim that the competition directorate has provided 'no factual evidence whatsoever' to support the case for radical reforms. Competition has increased greatly during the past 10 years, says Acea. Between 1986 and 1993 the number of car brands sold on the German market has jumped by 50 per cent from 44 to 66. The number of models and versions sold in France has risen by 47 per cent from 515 in 1986 to 758 in 1993. Surveys in the US show that customer satisfaction with conventional one-make dealers is consistently higher than with dealerships selling various brands, says Mr Beger. The carmakers argue that exchange rate fluctuations are the biggest cause of diverging car prices, not selective distribution. 'Total price harmonisation will remain a fantasy as long as there is no truly uniform market with harmonised taxes combined with a single currency or a prolonged period of guaranteed currency stability,' argues Mr Beger. As for cross-border car purchases, Acea says that it is already happening. 'In recent years more and more customers and dealers have purchased cars in other member states,' says Mr Beger.</p>

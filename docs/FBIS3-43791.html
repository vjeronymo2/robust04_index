Bacongo, an opposition stronghold, has been the scene of  repeated fighting since November, when Lissouba ordered a  crackdown on "brigands" among the opposition.    Lissouba's opponents were excluded from parliamentary bodies  created last June, and fresh elections in October failed to  resolve the situation.    Government troops in armoured vehicles used heavy weaponry  against opposition supporters in the same districts on Thursday  and Friday when they came under machine gun fire, witnesses said.    The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were  still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the Makele-Kele  district.</p>

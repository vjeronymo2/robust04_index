			<p>CSO     [Text] The production and use of substances used as  substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons should be regulated because  they damage the earth's ozone layer too, an environmental  advisory council said Thursday.    The Central Environment Council made the proposal to Wakako  Hironaka, director general of the Environment Agency. She was  urged to revise the current legislation on protecting the ozone  layer to comply with an international agreement, strengthened in  November 1992, on phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals.    The agency hopes to submit the revision to the current Diet  session.    CFCs -- industrial gases used as refrigerator coolants, in  plastic foams and in aerosols -- are blamed for depleting the  ozone layer, which filters out the sun's harmful ultraviolet  rays.    Signatories of the Montreal Protocol agreed in November 1992  to ban the use of CFCs by the end of 1995, four years earlier  than initially planned.    They also agreed to begin regulating consumption of  alternatives to CFCs, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons. If the  law is revised, the use of HCFCs, for instance, will also be  phased out by around 2030.    To prevent CFCs from being emitted into the atmosphere, the  council proposed that a system be set up that encourages  recycling and collecting of substances from refrigerators and  other cooling devices that are presently thrown away as waste.    The costs of recycling and collecting should be shared among  manufacturers, distributors and consumers, the council said.    An advisory body to the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry recommended similar measures last month.</p>

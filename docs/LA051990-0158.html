			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE WATERFRONT: BOAT LOVERS BUY THE OLD, FIX THEM UP  </P> <P> When Henry Wheeler began looking at new boats, he couldn't find anything he  liked. For one thing, most new boats are made of fiberglass and Wheeler wanted  wood. He also liked the traditional lines of older vessels. So Wheeler bought a  used boat and hired a yacht restorer to renovate the vessel from stem to stern.  </P> <P> Today, more boat lovers like Wheeler are opting to fix up the old rather than  buy the new.  </P> <P> "Restoring a boat is more difficult than building a new boat," says Bob Steel,  the man in charge of the two-year project that will transform Wheeler's 64-foot  sailboat into something "better than new."  </P> <P> Steel and his seven-person crew have been working on the boat for 18 months and  expect to have it completed by September. First the hull had to be taken down  to bare wood and refinished and the boat's teak decks were replaced. The crew  is now working on the boat's interior.  </P> <P> "To do a boat restoration properly, you have to keep it as close to the  original as possible," says Steel, who runs a Costa Mesa company called  Maritime Outfitters. "But in doing that you can marry the old traditional ways  with new technology while relying on old-world craftsmanship."  </P> <P> One way Steel plans to do that is by using some of today's newest and strongest  materials, such as titanium, which will be used to make the spreaders on the  ship's mast. He also is coating the boat's wooden bottom with an  environmentally safe paint that contains no anti-fouling ingredients or  solvents that could pollute the water.  </P> <P> In addition, he is strengthening the rigging so that the boat can carry some of  today's high-tech sails, which are often stronger than the hardware that holds  them, he says. "Old sails could disintegrate. Now the new ones are almost  bulletproof and won't fail. The rigging could fail before the sails would. So  (in an old boat) you have to have rigging to carry the new sails that are made  of new, stronger materials."  </P> <P> Whether you call it restoration or renovation, nearly everyone involved in such  boat work agrees that it requires lots of patience, lots of skill and lots of  money. Although Steel would not reveal the exact budget of the restoration  project he is conducting, he says that typical restorations can cost hundreds  of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> Robert Vanderwater, a marine carpenter who has been working on a 66-foot  powerboat for a year and a half, says: "Any client we have is in the  millionaire status." Vanderwater, who has his own marine carpentry business in  Costa Mesa, says his work on the boat involved remodeling three heads, three  staterooms and an entire galley. "We even built a refrigerator, every inch of  it from beginning to end," he says.  </P> <P> The boat, which is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Farrah of Long Beach, has a  steel hull and teak upper deck and was originally built in 1965 in Holland. The  restoration project was under the direction of Sheryl Bretz of Yachts of Class,  a marine design firm in Newport Beach. "Our goal was to keep the classic look  of the boat," Bretz says. "It even looks older than it really is."  </P> <P> Bretz designed all the interior structural changes, including custom tables and  settees, then hired a crew of four carpenters to work on the project. "The  whole interior was redone," she says. "There were structural changes in every  single room. It was challenging, believe me. Everything on a boat is a  challenge. There are no straight lines and everything has to be custom made.  You don't just go out and buy furniture."  </P> <P> As an example, Bretz cites the custom teak cocktail table built by Vanderwater  at a cost of about $6,000. The table had to follow the line of the settee and  so is wider at one end than it is at the other. In addition, the table is  convertible and can be raised to dining table height when needed.  </P> <P> Dennis Ambrose of Newport Woodworking compares boat restorations to redesigning  a house. "Usually the owner gets a designer. And then you bring in the various  trades -- upholsterers, carpenters, shipwrights. On the upper end, where you  have these mega yachts -- the million-dollar-plus yachts -- the owners will buy  one and then change it to his personal preference. That makes up about 30% of  our work for us."  </P> <P> In addition to renovating mega yachts, Ambrose says he does a lot of custom  built-ins. "The majority of our customers are building something in -- like a  nice master stateroom with a built-in TV." Last year Ambrose says he built in a  giant TV monitor on a 45-foot powerboat owned by a television producer who  worked on "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> Building something into the cramped quarters of a boat is always a challenge,  says Dwayne Irvin of South Coast Marine, a Costa Mesa company that does custom  woodworking. "On a boat you are conscious of every inch and how it works in  proportion to the interior and how it will function to do what it is supposed  to do and to give you storage. The design has to make all the compromise you  need to make and still not make you feel crowded or uncomfortable. Almost  everything you put into a boat has to function in many ways. From a building  standpoint, you can't get any more difficult."  </P> <P> One of the biggest challenges facing such craftsmen is trying to figure out how  to build in as much storage space as possible when doing a remodeling job.  "They (boat owners) discover that they don't have as much storage space as at  home. And they want to know if we can put in a shelf here or enlarge this,"  says Chris Shelley, owner of C. Chris Shelley Woodworks in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> When faced with such a job, Shelley says: "The first concern is that the boat  should look as if it has always been that way. It shouldn't look as if it has  been added on."  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Machine tool chiefs lobby for industry finance agency: Loans body for small manufacturers demanded THE MACHINE tool industry is urging the government to set up a lending institution for small and medium-sized manufacturers as part of a package of Budget measures to bolster competitiveness. In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the Machine Tool Technologies Association said financing of small and medium-sized companies required attention because they were vital to jobs, innovation and growth. 'We would suggest creation of an institution similar to the KFW in Germany dedicated to industrial lending or the instigation of a national investment bond, similar to that in operation in France,' it said. Yesterday at a press conference in London for next April's Metcut '94 exhibition in Birmingham industry leaders joined Mr Neil Johnson, the director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, in calling for the return of 100 per cent capital allowances. Mr Stan Vaughan, association president, said the UK had suffered persistent under-investment, especially by small and medium-sized companies. 'The time has come for the government to back its encouraging words with action.' Next year's Metcut show is being seen by the industry as a focus for its efforts to show it has weathered the recession.</p>

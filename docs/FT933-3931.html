			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Money Markets: A gloomy mood THE Bundesbank's  1/2 percent-age point cut in its official interest rates yesterday did not generate an expectation of further German easing in European cash and futures markets, writes James Blitz. The German central bank reduced its discount and Lombard rates to 6.25 per cent and 7.25 per cent respectively. More importantly, the repo rate was lowered to 6.70 per cent for next week's money market operation, re-establishing a differential of around 50 basis points between the repo rate and the official rate floor. Yesterday's move was followed by a succession of official rate cuts across Europe. But the surprise was that cash and futures markets were downbeat about the news. The September Euromark contract declined 3 basis points to close at 93.48, because the repo cut will make little difference to the cost of three-month D-Marks by the time the contract expires next week. The December contract shed 6 basis points to finish at 94.08. It may be that dealers saw yesterday's moves as purely technical, leaving little hope for interest rate cuts over the next six weeks. The move may also have been heavily discounted by German money market dealers who, on Wednesday, accepted surpris-ingly few repo bids at the prevailing rate of 6.80 per cent in money market operations. Conditions in the German market were very tight yesterday, with call money still hovering at 7.52 per cent. Some institutions will be able to borrow cash from the Bundesbank at the new discount rate today. In France, the reduction in the five to 10-day lending rate to 7.75 per cent was seen as a disappointment because it only provides the rate ceiling. The December French franc contract had peaked at 94.13 when the Bundesbank news came through, but fell back to close at 93.98. Sterling interest rate futures fell sharply after Mr Howard Davies, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, was reported as saying that the UK did not need a rate cut now. The December contract fell 6 points to close at 94.36. Conditions in the cash market were very easy after most of a Pounds 2.4bn shortage was removed in the early round of dealing. Three-month money lost 1/16 percentage point to end at 5 7/8 per cent.</p>

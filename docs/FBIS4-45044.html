			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wahib Muhammad Ghurab] </F>   [Text] Jeddah--King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz, Custodian of  the Two Holy Mosques, two weeks ago laid the final stone in the  Prophet's Mosque expansion works, thereby completing an effort  spanning nearly 10 years to give the Mosque its largest  expansion ever.    King Fahd had noted while visiting Medina in 1403 Hijra [H]  [1982] that the number of visitors to the second most important  shrine in the Islamic world is constantly rising. He  consequently ordered a comprehensive feasibility study for a  mosque expansion that would accommodate the current and future  needs of the ever-expanding number of visitors, while utilizing  the area surrounding the mosque.    The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques laid the cornerstone  for the expansion project on a visit to Medina. Actual work on  the project began the following year.    The King underscored his special interest in the project by  making annual visits to the Prophet's city in order to  personally monitor the progress of construction and learn about  any problems that are encountered or modifications and  supplemental plans that are needed.  <H5>  The Project </H5>   The basic elements of the expansion cover a lot more than  the  modern enlargement of the original shrine and essentially  include an extension to the mosque itself; improvements to the  surrounding courtyards; the construction of restrooms, washing  facilities, and underground parking facilities; and the  upgrading of nearby roads and those leading to the shrine such  as the primary beltway, the Bab-al-Salam highway, and the second  beltway and its intersections.  <H5>  Enlargement of the Shrine </H5>   The shrine itself was enlarged with a main extension whose  cornerstone was laid by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in  1405H [1984]. The extension encircles the main mosque and  connects to it from the north, east, and west. It covers an area  of 82,000 square meters or five times the area of the original  building. This brings the mosque's current area to 98,500 square  meters aside from a marble-covered area of 67,000 square meters.  The expanded mosque, its interior, and its annexes have a peak  capacity of a quarter of a million worshippers. This maximum  capacity rises to a million worshippers when the surrounding  courtyards are utilized. The expansion project, which has logged  a total cost of about 30 billion riyals, has required the  expropriation of more than a 100,000 square meters of property  in the vicinity.    This segment of the construction includes 27 moving domes,  each approximately 4 meters in height and 14 meters in inside  diameter, that glide on rails affixed to the extension's roof.  The open-air areas of the mosque's main hall have been supplied  with 12 electrically-controlled mobile sun-shades.    Also completed during the same stage of expansion were seven  main northern, eastern, and western gates as well as two others  to the south. Eighteen escalators handle traffic within the  shrine.    The main entrance to the extension is King Fahd Bin  'Abd-al-'Aziz's Gate located in the center to the north. The  extension has seven domes and is flanked by two minarets. The  expanded mosque therefore boasts 10 minarets, of which six are  new and rise to a height of 104 meters, which is 32 meters  higher that their original counterparts. At their height, these  minarets are probably the tallest in the Islamic world.    The extension's interior installations have been decorated  with designs that duplicate those of the first Saudi expansion,  including mantels, wrought iron windows and screens,  copper-inlaid wooden doors, pillar capitals, and gilded  chandeliers, as well as round and decorative marble works. The  pillars have special crevices at the base to hold copies of the  Koran and to accommodate air conditioning vents.    Automatic systems control the mosque's lights, sound  systems,  and air conditioning. Other systems control emergency lights,  pollution monitors, and fire detectors. Special rooms contain  lighting controls, circuit breakers, and distribution consoles.  This segment of the construction also includes mechanical  systems for potable water coolers, rain drainage, sewers,  ventilation of the lower floors, and some of the largest air  conditioning tunnels in the world. Cooling ducts run along 7 km  of service tunnels connecting the central air conditioning  station with the mosque's interior. The air conditioning station  was deliberately built far from the mosque for several reasons,  such as sparing more property from expropriation and distancing  worshippers from the noise generated by the station.  <H5>  The Mosque's Courtyards </H5>   That segment of the project sought maximum utilization of  the  courtyards surrounding the mosque by preparing them to  accommodate worshippers as needed at times of peak attendance.  The courtyards have an area of 225,000 square meters covered  with marble and granite in colorful and coordinated designs. Of  the courtyards, an area of 135,000 square meters has been  designated for prayer and is capable of holding some quarter of  a million worshippers. This number may be increased to 400,000  when all the courtyards are utilized. The mosque and its  immediate surroundings are therefore capable of accommodating  nearly a million worshippers at peak times.    Parking is located directly under those courtyards to the  north, east, and west. The parking facility consists of two  underground levels covering a total area of 39,000 square  meters. This state of the art underground facility has a  capacity of 4,500 cars and is served by 126 well-equipped stands  with three driveways leading to the upper level and three others  leading to the lower level.  <H5>  Public Roadways </H5>   The expansion effort also covers the roads leading to the  shrine, and especially Bab-al-Salam, which is intended to  provide visitors with fast access to the shrine. It is a  64-meter-wide dual expressway that is 5.9 meters long, with an  18-meter extension at its intersection with the second ring road  [beltway].    The main expressway running in both directions is  supplemented by two or three service roads in either direction.  The highway connects Pilgrim City to the west of Medina with the  holy al-Madani shrine near the Bab-al-Salam gate. The highway is  supported by vital installations such as bridges and overpasses.    The completed expansion works ordered by the Custodian of  the  Two Holy Mosques are the most ambitious such projects in the  history of the mosque since it was founded by the Prophet.  Future needs have been kept in mind; the extension was  constructed to support the addition of upper floors, when  needed, as befits the stature of the second mosque of the  Islamic world.</p>

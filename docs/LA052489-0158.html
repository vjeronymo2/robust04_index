That proved to be a 13-year  relationship in which he did music for such dramatic radio shows as "The  Adventures of Ellery Queen," "Radio Readers Digest," "March of Time," "The Ford  Theater" and "26 by (Norman) Corwin."  </P> <P> During the 1930s, '40s and '50s his Lyn Murray Singers were featured on the  "Hit Parade" show.  </P> <P> Besides Berlin's tribute to soldiering, Murray's other Broadway credits include  the choral music for "Panama Hattie," "Let's Face It" and "Finian's Rainbow."  </P> <P> His film scores include "The Prowler," "Son of Paleface," "Here Come the  Girls," "The Bridges at Toko Ri" and "To Catch a Thief." His music was heard on  such television series as "General Electric Theatre," "Alfred Hitchcock," "Mr.  Novak," "Dr. Kildare" and many documentaries, particularly "Carl Sandburg's  Lincoln."  </P> <P> He also provided the musical interludes for "Steambath," the highly regarded  PBS drama, as well as "Incident at Vichy," "Requiem for a Nun" and "The Last of  Mrs. Lincoln." In 1974 he was nominated for an Emmy for "Struggle for Survival"  on NBC.  </P> <P> In the last few years he composed and conducted for the California Artists  Radio Theater, a group of former radio performers. One of those programs will  be broadcast Sunday at 8 p.m. on KUSC-FM.  </P> <P> Murray, a founder of the Screen Composer's Guild and board member of the  National Academy of Music, also conducted and arranged for several Decca  Records stars, among them Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong.  </P></p>

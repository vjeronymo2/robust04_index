			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Sewage disposal scheme in Turkey WALLACE EVANS has won two contracts in Turkey with a combined construction value of Pounds 130m. Both have been won in conjunction with its Turkish associated practice, Seyas. The largest contract is for the design of a new sewage disposal system for Buyukcekmece on behalf of Iski, the Istanbul water supply and sewage disposal authority. Buyukcekmece is located west of the Bosphorous, and the treatment works will serve a population in excess of 800,000 people. Valued at Pounds 100m, the work includes the design of 18km of tunnel, 11km of open cut sewer, a new sewage plant for tertiary treatment utilising the latest techniques for nutrient removal, and a 1.5 metre diameter sea outfall. The design team was selected both on price and track record in solving environmental and engineering problems similar to those confronting Iski. Work on the project commenced in April with Wallace Evans' involvement being managed at Haverfordwest.</p>

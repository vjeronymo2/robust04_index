			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, fighting between Rwanda Patriotic Front  [RPF] rebels and Rwandan armed forces in Kigali has been raging  all day. Shelling and small arms fire have not ceased.  Christophe Boisbouvier has just phoned General Dallaire,  commander of the UN Mission in Rwanda:    [Begin recording] [Dallaire] There has been a partial  offensive by the RPF in the southeast sector of the town.    [Boisbouvier] Have RPF rebels entered the town center?    [Dallaire] If you mean the presidential district, no, not as  far as I know. I was there part of the day today, and there was  no fighting.    [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the rebels will be able to  seize the town center and the presidential district?    [Dallaire] The RPF continues its operations; it has received  reinforcements. What are its aims? Is it to seize this sector?  Is it to isolate it? It depends on the resources it managed to  get in order to seize the most secure sector of the town.    [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the Rwandan Armed Forces  have enough men and artillery to resist for several days?    [Dallaire] After seeing the number of men and their  preparedness, I believe that they seem very resolute to defend  their positions.    [Boisbouvier] Are those refugees now in the Hotel des Milles  Collines and in the Amahoro stadium being threatened?    [Dallaire] The evacuation of those refugees [words  indistinct] in the current situation any movement of people  would certainly not be a plausible option. Where they are now,  they are at least with us. Those staying at the Milles  Collines, if they are still there, are with gendarmes and  soldiers as well as with UN observers. [end recording]</p>

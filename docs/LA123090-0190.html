			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BETTER OFF PREPARED  </P> <P> I would like to comment on Diane Villasana's response (TV Times, Dec. 9) to  NBC's showing of "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake."  </P> <P> She said that the show shouldn't have been aired because people were already  worrying about tensions in the Persian Gulf. The movie's purpose wasn't to  scare, but to inform. The movie didn't scare me or my friends. Instead it  helped us better prepare for the big earthquake.  </P> <P> Andrew Freeman, Agoura  </P></p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Strangeways tender open to private sector BIDS to manage the re-built Strangeways Prison, Manchester, which was damaged during Britain's most serious jail riots of modern times, are to be invited from both the public and private sectors. If ministers choose a private-sector bid Strangeways will become Britain's first old-established prison to be run by the private sector. Strangeways is undergoing extensive refurbishment after damage caused by the rioting two years ago, and bids for its management will be invited in the autumn. Securicor, the security services group, said yesterday that it was likely to be among those interested in bidding. Ministers stressed yesterday, however, that the decision to involve the private sector did not mean they had excluded the possibility of the public prisons department making the winning bid. Mr Peter Lloyd, minister responsible for prisons, spoke on BBC Radio yesterday of the public service's 'huge reserves of skill, expertise and dedication' but said these qualities had not been brought together in the running of the prison service as effectively as the government would like. Britain's first privately managed prison, the Wolds remand establishment on Humberside, opened earlier this year. Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester, another new development, will open under private management later this year and will be the first to take convicted prisoners. Ministers are anxious to modernise prison management and challenge the power of the Prison Officers' Association. They see the introduction of private-sector man-agement as a means of doing both. The government believes that, provided the state sets and monitors standards, there are no ethical objections to private prisons. Penal-reform groups, however, say that profit considerations should not be involved in depriving people of their liberty. Mr Brian Caton, vice-chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said he feared that the decision to invite private-sector bids to manage Strangeways would be repeated at other types of prison. 'We will not stand by and watch an immoral practice continue without some kind of action,' he said. Publication today of a severely critical report following the death of a patient at Ashworth high security hospital, Merseyside, is expected to lead to a government review of high-security hospitals. Even before publication of the report of an inquiry led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission, mental health organisations have started calling for the closure of Ashworth and the other large high-security special hospitals at Broadmoor, Berkshire and Rampton, Nottinghamshire. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said yesterday that 'all the indications point to a scandal of staggering proportions' involving rottenness and cruelty. The government had to respond to the report with immediate action.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO;  </P> <P> INEXPERIENCED CREWS FOUGHT FIRE  </P> <P> The battle against a forest fire that killed a Fontana firefighter was marked  by the use of inexperienced crews and a lack of medical equipment, a report  says.  </P> <P> Whether those problems contributed to Kenneth Enslow's death or hampered  efforts to rescue him has yet to be determined by authorities investigating  last August's Mendocino National Forest fire. The accident report by U.S.  Forest Service and state Department of Forestry and Fire officials was obtained  by the San Bernardino Sun under the Freedom of Information Act. The  firefighter's parents, Melvin and Valerie Enslow, criticized the lack of  medical equipment and training cited by investigators.  </P></p>

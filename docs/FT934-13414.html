			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei resumes advance as region consolidates INDEX-LINKED buying by arbitrageurs and purchases of large-capital stocks by public funds lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average closed moderately higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 103.51 at 20,173.42, having opened at the day's low of 20,054.21 before rising to the high for the session of 20,221.72 in late morning trading. Volume amounted to 224m shares, against 206m. Traders said investors would remain quiet until Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform bill passed through parliament. 'Once the bill is approved, the government will be able to concentrate on measures to boost the economy,' said one Japanese broker. Overall falls retained a narrow lead over advances by 494 to 483, with 195 issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.40 to 1,647.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.73 at 1,286.54. Dealers said the Nikkei index has been stunted for the past few weeks due to selling by corporate investors, with small-lot buying support only coming from public funds and arbitrageurs. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Companies are expected to sell about Y1,000bn during the remainder of the fiscal year to March.' Among the large-capital stocks, Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, firmed Y1 to Y332 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y4 at Y679. High-technology exporters were bought as beneficiaries of the yen's recent easing against the dollar. Sony advanced Y70 to Y4,830 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to Y1,510. Heiwa, the pachinko pinball machine maker listed on the second section which is currently under police investigation, fell Y500 to Y3,450. Other leisure-related stocks were also weak, with Sega Enterprises down Y120 to Y9,750. Telecom linked shares continued to sag on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone slipped Y10,000 to Y884,000, and Fujitsu was off Y2 at Y861. Railway linked stocks were higher ahead of the listing of East Japan Railway next Tuesday. Nippon Signal rose Y40 to Y1,550 and Keihin Electric Express Railway Y18 to Y753. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 43.83 to 22,156.12 in volume of 20.3m shares. Roundup MANY of the Pacific Rim markets continued to consolidate. HONG KONG finished modestly ahead after a session that had seen the Hang Seng index swing between a 120-point deficit and a 100-point gain. The index finished 41.39 higher at 8,902.80 in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 7.29bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 9.55bn. Mr Michael Paterson of Asia Equity commented that blue chips had been overbought and the market was broadening out into second liners and derivative instruments which had been left behind in the recent bull run. He thought that the current correction was very healthy, adding that he did not see the index moving upwards very far from its current level for the time being. HSBC, which topped the actives list, was down 50 cents at HKDollars 87, after slipping to a low of HKDollars 86 following news of a provision for its Samuel Montagu unit. AUSTRALIA pulled back to close weaker as profits were booked for the second consecutive day, and the All Ordinaries index finished 23.8 lower at 2,051.7 in turnover of ADollars 412.2m. The All Industrials index fell 35.7 to 3,179.6 and the All Resources 14.8 to 1,190.1. BHP ended 22 cents cheaper at ADollars 17.40, while News Corp retreated 40 cents, or 3.4 per cent, to ADollars 11.26. SEOUL was lower in continued reaction to recent advances, but renewed interest in some shares with low price-to-book ratios neutralised much of an early decline. The composite stock index lost a net 2.61 at 738.63 in turnover of Won564.45bn. TAIWAN saw late selling after a minor technical rally and the weighted index ended 11.86 off at 3,958.32 in turnover that fell to TDollars 19.52bn. SINGAPORE was easier on profit-taking, with sell-offs in selected index shares and some speculative issues dragging the market lower. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 12.42 down at 2,095.84, near the day's low of 2,093.07. NEW ZEALAND lost ground, the NZSE-Capital index shedding 11.91 to 2,060.25. Telecom, still suffering from Merrill Lynch's change of recommendation on the stock, declined 7 cents to NZDollars 4.28. MANILA, however, resumed its climb after Tuesday's respite, and the composite index appreciated 46.79 to a record 2,205.78. KARACHI kept up its forward momentum with a gain in the KSE-100 index of 28.14 to 1,478.57, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The market was helped by the victory of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PPP party in forming the government in the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province.</p>

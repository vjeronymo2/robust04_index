			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Old Masters extend their allure: Saleroom IT has always been a disappointment to western antique dealers that they could rarely interest the Japanese in Old Master paintings. The iconography was outside their experience. That seems to be changing, judging by the Pounds 110,000 paid by a Japanese private collector at Phillips yesterday for The Bird Trap by Pieter Brueghel the Younger. It shows Flemish peasants of about 1600 skating. It was the highest price in an Old Master auction which did reasonably well, bringing in Pounds 769,725 with 25 per cent unsold. A scene of peasants at a roadside shrine, attributed to Cimaroli, went for Pounds 66,000, against a Pounds 15,000 top estimate, and an Italian private collector gave Pounds 60,500 for a pair of Roman views by the 18th-century local artist Paolo Anesi. Christie's achieved an impressive price of Pounds 143,000 for an early 18th-century German house altar by Thelot. It had been estimated that it would sell for around Pounds 25,000. That was compensation for the failure of two important lots to find buyers - a bronze bust of the fourth Earl of Chesterfield cast from a model by Roubiliac was unsold at Pounds 90,000, and a micro-mosaic of the head of Bacchus, produced in Rome around 1800 in imitation of the antique, was bought in at Pounds 25,000. A group of four Limoges enamels, produced about 1535 by the Aeneid Master, showing scenes from Virgil's chronicle, went within forecast for Pounds 55,000, and a Franconian wood relief of Christ on a donkey, carved about 1500, sold for Pounds 52,800. The sale of European sculpture and works of art totalled Pounds 522,555. Also at Christie's, Old Master drawings brought in Pounds 385,495.</p>

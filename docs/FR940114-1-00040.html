			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Program Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should have centralized program planning, initiation, and coordination to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety program issues as part of a comprehensive highway safety program. Evaluation is also important for determining progress and ultimate success of pedestrian and bicycle safety programs and for providing those results to revise existing programs and to develop new programs. The State should have program staff trained in pedestrian and bicyclist safety so that this program can: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Conduct regular problem identification activities to identify fatality and injury crash trends for pedestrians and bicyclists and to provide guidance in development of countermeasures, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to other State agencies and local pedestrian and bicycle safety programs and projects; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Convene a pedestrian and bicycle safety advisory task force or coalition to organize, integrate with other involved groups, and generate broad-based support for programs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Integrate pedestrian and bicycle safety programs into Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs, injury prevention programs, and transportation plans; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluate the effectiveness of its pedestrian and bicycle safety program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Multi-Disciplinary Involvement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pedestrian and bicyclist safety goes beyond the confines of any single State or local agency (enforcement or education) and requires the combined support and coordinated attention of multiple agencies, representing a variety of disciplines, at the State and local level. At a minimum, the following kinds of agencies should be involved: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Law Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Health <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Driver Education and Licensing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation_Engineering, Planning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Communications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Legislation and Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should enact and enforce pedestrian and bicyclist-related traffic laws and regulations. Specific policies should be developed to encourage coordination with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other agencies, in the development of regulations and laws to promote pedestrian and bicyclist safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Law Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a law enforcement component. Each State should strongly emphasize the role played by law enforcement personnel in pedestrian and bicyclist safety. Essential components of that role include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Developing knowledge of pedestrian and bicyclist crash situations; investigating crashes; and maintaining a report system that supports problem identification and evaluation activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providing public information and education support; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providing training to law enforcement personnel in matters of pedestrian and bicycle safety; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishing agency policies; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coordinating with the supporting education and engineering components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Traffic Engineering <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Traffic engineering is a critical element of any crash reduction program. This is true not only for the development of programs to reduce an existing crash problem, but also to design transportation facilities that provide for the safe movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and all motor vehicles. Balancing the needs of pedestrians and those of vehicular traffic (including bicycle) must always be considered. Therefore, each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a traffic engineering component. Traffic engineering efforts should be coordinated with enforcement and educational efforts. This effort should improve the protection of pedestrians and bicyclists by application of appropriate traffic engineering measures in design, construction, operation, and maintenance. These measures should include but not be limited to the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Pedestrians signals, signs, and markings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parking regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sidewalk design <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pedestrian pathways <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bicycle routes and pathways <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Public Information and Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs contain a public information and education component. This component should address school-based education programs, coordination with traffic engineering and law enforcement components, public information and awareness campaigns, and other targeted educational programs such as those for the elderly. These programs should address issues such as: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Being visible in the traffic system (conspicuity) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of facilities and accommodations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Law enforcement initiatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proper street crossing behavior <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature and extent of the problem <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Driver training with regard to pedestrian and bicycle safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rules of the road <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

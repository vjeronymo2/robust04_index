			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A joint project between  Australia and China on sheep research will be conducive to  China's sheep raising, said visiting Australian Governor-General  Bill Hayden after he toured the Sino-Australian Sheep Research  Center here today.    Hayden said the project will play a positive role in  popularizing new technologies and in improving the quality of  sheep bred in China, which includes the sheep's hereditary  features and mutton and wool quality.    To inspect the development of the project, the  governor-general made a special trip to the Nansha [Spratly]  sheep-breeding pastureland, located in the suburbs of Urumqi,  capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was  jointly set up by China and Australia. He checked and was  satisfied with the wool of the sheep, which had been cultivated  from Australian breeds.    The Sino-Australian joint project on sheep research was  initiated in accordance with the technological cooperation  agreement between the two countries. It is one of Australia's  biggest aid projects to China in agriculture, in which Australia  has invested 6.44 million Australian dollars.    The five-year project, starting from 1991, involves nine  items and 30 subjects covering the fields of breeding,  nutrition, reproduction, wool technology, pastures, and  veterinary surgery as well as women's participation and  development.    At present, 33 Chinese have been sent to Australia for  long-term and short-term training sessions, while two Australian  experts are working in Xinjiang.    A Chinese official with the research center said that the  two  Australian experts are working well here and the project has  been developing smoothly.    To improve the teaching conditions of the school in the  pastureland, the Australian Government has provided ten thousand  Australian dollars and improved the laboratory of the school.  One hundred thousand Australian dollars will help to establish  a knitting mill, which will enable 80 Kazak women to get jobs,  part of the effort to solve the Kazak nationality women's  employment problems.    Governor Hayden highly praised such cooperation, which may  promote the economy in the autonomous region inhabited by  minority nationalities.</p>

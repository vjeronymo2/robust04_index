			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Observer: Only dregs Brazilian dexterity is not limited to the soccer field. The Dart family, the polystyrene-cup billionaires holding Dollars 1.4bn of old Brazilian bank loans, who refused to join the giant bank debt restructuring in April, has sued the Brazilian central bank. They are seeking Dollars 60m of back interest and accelerated payment of the Dollars 1.4bn. The Darts are about to find out that their cup runneth not over. In anticipation of their attitude, the Brazilians ensured the collateral which backs the debt restructuring was not held - as is traditional - with the New York Fed. Instead, it was placed with the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, in the hope of keeping it beyond any court action. Sensible move.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE formalises broking trade curbs THE Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has formalised rules on share trading which severely restrict the ability of large broking firms to trade on their own account. However, the rules do not apply to medium-sized and small brokers, who have been hit particularly hard by the stock market slump. Indirectly, this could benefit the leading Japanese brokers: these control a number of smaller broking firms, though their shareholdings are limited to 5 per cent. The TSE had originally proposed that the rules should also be applied to programme trading - the computerised selling or buying of a basket of shares. This would have made arbitrage trading, which is the core of foreigners' business in Tokyo, impossible. This proposal has been dropped from the final rules, although its earlier inclusion has served further to heighten tensions between the financial authorities and leading foreign brokers. The Tokyo stock market has been shaken by rumours that a leading foreign brokerage has threatened to move out of the Tokyo market. Market participants have become increasingly concerned over the regulators' spate of restrictions, aimed at reviving the sluggish cash market. Leading foreign brokers have expressed discontent as they were excluded from discussions towards the formalisation of the rules. The new rules had already existed in voluntary form for own-account trading by large brokers. They include a number of restrictive regulations, such as prohibiting the the trading of equity-linked issues. Also, brokers trading on their own account are severely restricted in the prices at which they can deal, being effectively tied to the last price at which a trade was conducted in the market. The move represents special treatment toward medium-sized and small brokers, who are exempt from such limits on proprietary trading. Meanwhile, two further rule changes by the TSE have raised concern that the transparency in the Tokyo market may once again decline, following attempts recently to outlaw practices which some claimed amounted to market manipulation. The TSE has lifted its '30 per cent rule', which prohibited brokers from dealing in more than 30 per cent of the turnover in any stock in a given month. The rule was originally implemented to avoid the dominance of the leading Japanese securities in the market. The TSE also abolished its '15-minute rule' which prohibited brokers from proprietary orders during the last 15 minutes of the trading session.</p>

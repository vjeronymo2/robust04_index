			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Uncertainty Surrounds Program for </F> Purchasing Shares on Favorable Terms; Securities of Listed Firms  More in Demand"]    [Text] Although the Program for Purchasing Shares on  Favorable Terms (KRP) is still in place, preparations for the  stock issues of the two remaining firms in the program's  experimental stage have slowed down perceptibly, under the  influence of statements made about the program's future.    Economic-policy experts of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party] and SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] have said  repeatedly that the KRP ought to be suspended. The AVU [State  Property Agency] has not adopted any new decision for the time  being, but preparations for the stock issues of Global T.H. and  Pannonia Hotels, respectively, have slowed down. However, there  have been also technical problems at the latter firm.    Officials at the AVU nevertheless believe that, sooner or  later, there will be stock issues by both Global and Pannonia  Hotels, even if the new government suspends the KRP. At worst in  that case, the issues will not take place within the framework  of the KRP. The officials deem it important that privatization  through the stock exchange be retained in the armory of  privatization tools. As one official put it, that strengthens  the stock market, and the stock market in its turn strengthens  privatization. Many foreign investors, particularly financial  investors, are willing to invest only in firms that are listed  on the stock exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is necessary to create proper conditions for  working people. As far as social protection is concerned, it  should be provided to pensioners, children, invalids, and other  sections of the population that need it. Presidential  candidate, Ukraine's Minister of Education Petro Talanchuk was  saying this while in Zhitomir.    He believes that it is necessary to carry out a wise policy  of taxation and crediting, using all possible means so that  people be paid properly for the work they do. Talanchuk pointed  out that, if elected to the high post, he would, first and  foremost, carry out transformations in the agro-industrial  complex. According to the candidate, the countryside would  provide Ukraine with ample quantities of food in two years time.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: News Corp seeks SEC approval to raise up to Dollars 1bn NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, has filed a shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which would permit it to issue up to Dollars 1bn in debt securities, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. News Corp said the filing would allow it to issue senior subordinated, subordinated or senior debt securities 'from time to time' once a related registration statement becomes effective. This is the latest in a series of moves to raise debt and equity capital to replace bank debt acquired as part of the group's Dollars 7.6bn restructuring in 1991.</p>

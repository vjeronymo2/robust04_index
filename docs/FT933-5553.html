			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Exim boosts Euroyen sector with Y75bn offering THE EUROYEN sector of the international bond market was given a significant boost yesterday by the launch of a Y75bn Eurobond offering from the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Bankers said that Exim's 10-year issue paved the way for other Japanese government-guaranteed entities to tap this sector of the Euromarket. In the past, the finance ministry had discouraged them from raising yen-denominated funds outside the domestic market. However, the ministry has changed its stance in recent years. So far, the Japanese Development Bank has been the only government-guaranteed entity to issue in Euroyen. It has launched two such offerings in the past two years, and it is thought to be considering a third, of the same size and maturity as Exim's. Exim's bonds, which carry a coupon of 4 3/8 per cent, were priced to yield 25 basis points over the 10-year Japanese government bond No 157. The yield on the issue offers a pick-up of six basis points over the World Bank's yen global bond due 2003, but is four basis points below the yield on the European Investment Bank's 10-year Euroyen issue. An official at Nomura International, the lead manager, said that Exim's issue was aimed at satisfying demand from European investors for liquid Euroyen bonds. He added that the size of the offering should ensure that the bonds would remain liquid in the future. About half of the bonds were placed in Europe, with the other half finding a home in the Middle East and Asia. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose from their issue price of 99.73 to 99.92 bid. Exim, which needs dollar-based funding, was also attracted to the Euroyen sector by the favourable arbitrage opportunities. The borrower is thought to have swapped the proceeds of the issue into dollars, achieving an all-in cost of 20 basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Elsewhere, Rabobank, the triple-A rated bank, launched a L500bn zero-coupon offering, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating-rate dollars. The market has been expecting a zero-coupon Eurolira bond for some time, but its launch was delayed by volatile swap levels, said an official at IMI Bank, the lead manager. The bonds, which yield 8.27 per cent, were placed with institutional and retail investors in the Benelux countries, Germany and Switzerland, where the issuer has a strong following. Two emerging-market borrowers also launched new issues yesterday. Hemaraj Land and Development, a Thai real estate company which is developing the Eastern Seaboard area south of Bangkok in collaboration with the government, raised Dollars 60m through a 10-year convertible Eurobond. An official at the lead manager, Jardine Fleming, said that the aim of this deal, and of the three previous convertible Eurobonds from Thailand, was to widen the ownership of Thai shares. Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company, raised Dollars 200m through an offering of three-year Eurobonds. The bonds will be used to refinance the 10 per cent Eurobonds due 1996 which the issuer has called. The bonds are due to be priced today to yield 335 basis points over the 4 3/8 per cent US Treasuries of August 1996, at the top end of the indicated spread. A fall in the three-year Treasury yield in August from 4.50 per cent to 4.18 per cent has worked in Petrobras's favour but the issuer was keen to offer a sufficiently wide spread to compensate for the decline in yields.</p>

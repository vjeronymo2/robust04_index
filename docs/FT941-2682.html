			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Floating gilt targets investor uncertainties The Bank of England's decision to launch a floating rate government bond - its first such issue in 15 years - may be seen as an opportunistic move, given the difficult conditions in financial markets. The gilt-edged, European government and US Treasury bond markets have all experienced sharp price falls since February 4, when the US Federal Reserve hitched up short-term interest rates. The bond markets have been especially nervous about US inflation prospects and the possibility of further rises in US interest rates, and there has been heavy selling of bonds by investors, particularly the US-based hedge funds. A few borrowers have responded to the uncertainty over interest rate movements this year by issuing floating-rate notes, either in US dollars or in sterling, in order to attract investors. Some gilt analysts pointed out that the Bank is probably hoping to take advantage of investor uncertainty about the direction of UK interest rates, adding that as some of the existing floating-rate sterling issues mature this year, there will be a shortage of such notes. One analyst said: 'Some investors clearly think that UK interest rates may have bottomed out or be close to their lows, and that a floating-rate bond would enable them to take advantage of a rising interest rate scenario.' The Bank has been looking at ways of encouraging banks and building societies to increase the size of their gilt holdings, and it expects its new floating-rate gilt to appeal to this particular class of investor. The fact that the new gilt issue is targeted at banks and building societies may also help - indirectly - to iron out the sharp fluctuations in money market interest rates. As part of its regular money market operations, the Bank holds fortnightly sale and repurchase operations - known as repos - whereby the banks borrow money from the Bank at a specified rate using their gilt holdings as security. In theory, by boosting the financial institutions' holdings of gilts, there should be more government bonds available for use in the repo operations. The last time the Bank issued bonds with a variable interest rate, the exercise was not deemed a success. It sold three issues, of Pounds 400m each, in 1977 and 1979, which matured in 1981, 1982 and 1983. Demand was poor and was not helped by the coupon-setting mechanism which was seen as too complicated. It was set retrospectively, based on an average for the UK Treasury bill rate over the previous six months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, on 13 May, the U.S.  imperialists flew nuclear-loaded F-16 and F-15 fighter bombers,  pursuit-assault planes, and early warning planes from their  overseas military bases to the skies over South Korea and  conducted, with the puppets, an aerial war exercise aimed at  invading the North.    This frantic war exercise was conducted in the skies over  Pochon, Kimchon, and Yongwol. Various squadrons from the U.S.  bases in the Pacific and approximately 380 fighter bombers,  assault planes, and observation planes of the U.S. and puppet  Air Forces were mobilized massively.    An E-3 early warning plane which flew from the Okinawa base,  prowled about in the skies over Taejon, Umsong, Chechon, and  Kunwi, and comprehensively commanded the squadrons which were  mobilized in this provocative exercise for a war of northward  invasion.    This power-reeking war exercise was a game of fire aimed at  examining the feasibility of an early warning plane's unified  command over squadrons composed of different types of aircraft.    On the same day, the South Korean puppets brought hundreds  of  heavily armed bandits to Mihyon-ri, Yanggu County, Kangwon  Province of South Korea and deployed armored personnel carrier  groups to Sojin-ri, Kosong County. On the same day, tens of  armed helicopters flew to Mt. Yawol north of Majon-ri, Yonchon  County, Kyonggi Province; Munsan-ri, Paju County; and Chung-ri,  Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea and  frantically conducted an exercise aimed at giving firepower  support to ground attacks and airlifting operational materials.    Also, formations of C-130 transports flew to the skies over  Pochon and Yonchon and massively dropped commandos of the puppet  armed forces. These commandos frantically conducted an exercise  aimed at launching surprise strikes against major targets on the  Northern half of the Republic and inspired an atmosphere of war.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Hungarian budget deficit soars THE Hungarian budget deficit surged way above target over the first quarter of this year against the background of a steeper than expected recession which has placed hundreds of enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy. Latest government figures show that accumulated arrears of tax and customs payments reached Ft 170bn (Pounds 1.22bn) by the end of the first quarter. This helped push the first quarter budget deficit to Ft 47bn and raises a question mark over the government's ability to meet its target of restricting the overall budget deficit for the year to Ft 69bn, or 1.9 per cent of GDP. Mr Gyorgy Szapary, the International Monetary Fund's representative in Hungary, yesterday warned that the situation looked serious enough for the Fund to take a hard look at the budget overrun in mid-year, given the danger that it could keep interest rates high, crowd out private investment, and hold back Hungary's economic recovery. The government first responded to the tax shortfall last week with 'drastic measures' to seize tax debtors' bank deposits and impound goods at the border until duties were paid. It also clawed back tax refunds granted to banks. The underlying reason for the pressure on the budget became clearer yesterday with new figures which showed Hungary's economic recession was much deeper than expected. Recorded gross domestic product fell by 10 to 12 per cent last year, Mr Szapary revealed.</p>

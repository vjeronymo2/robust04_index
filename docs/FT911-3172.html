			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Power workers continue strike Efforts were continuing last night in Ireland to bring an end to a strike by electricity workers which has caused three days of chaos throughout the country, writes Kieran Cooke in Dublin. Electricians at the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), Ireland's state run power monopoly, are striking for more pay. The government has warned of the serious economic consequences of the strike and says the electricians must return to work while a peace formula is being considered.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: Light clouds over coffee talks - Commodities Members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries are to meet in London on Friday to discuss changes in the market situation. They could have more to discuss than seemed likely when the meeting was scheduled. The association was formed to organise a retention scheme aimed at reviving coffee prices, which came into effect just over a year ago. Its initial success in lifting prices to 2 1/2 -year highs resulted in the suspension of retention, even before the market surged on news of damaging Brazilian frosts in June and July. With concern over a subsequent drought in Brazil driving prices to 8 1/2  year highs - more than three times the levels prevailing at the inception of the scheme - Friday's meeting might have been expected to be largely self-congratulatory. But recent events have introduced an element of doubt into market prospects. Since the Brazilian government gave its official assessment of the size of its damaged 1995-96 crop - which was broadly in line with market estimates - prices have tumbled. A higher than expected figure for Brazilian coffee stocks released last week accelerated the slide and nearby robusta futures prices in London dipped below Dollars 3,000 a tonne, more than Dollars 1,000 less than the September peak. The market remains well above the level that the retention scheme was designed to support, but with chart analysts suggesting that further falls could be on the cards, delegates at Friday's meeting may not have such a rosy picture to review as they might have hoped. Other events this week include a five-day meeting, starting today, of the International Natural Rubber Organisation. Agreement is expected to be reached on the extension of the price-stabilising 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement for another year after its scheduled expiry on December 31. Wednesday sees the release of the International Wheat Council's latest monthly crop report.</p>

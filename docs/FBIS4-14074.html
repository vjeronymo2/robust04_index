			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by </F> correspondents Zuhayr Hawari and 'Imad Marmil; place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Lebanon has not  participated in the multilateral peace negotiations during which  fundamental issues are being discussed that affect it, such as  refugees and water. Are you still insisting on not  participating in the talks?    [Buwayz] Not only are we still insisting but we are also  more  convinced than ever before that it was premature to embark on  multilateral negotiations before the bilateral negotiations made  tangible, essential, and decisive progress. We are insisting  that participation in them is a mistake. Lebanon was the first  country that warned against joining the multilateral talks. I  remember that I made this warning when I chaired the Arab League  Council meeting in Cairo in 1990 before the Madrid conference.  I said then that we are reading in the press and hearing from  some sources that multilateral talks are being proposed on the  issues of water, armaments, the environment, transportation,  communications, etc. I also said: While firmly convinced that  these are essential issues, that we cannot be forgiven if we  ignore them, that these issues have to be discussed when peace  comes, and that an agreement must be reached on them because  they are common problems, we cannot embark on discussing these  issues if they are proposed to us--and at that time they were  not officially proposed--before we are certain that peace is  coming and on the details of this peace.    Why? First, because I regarded the multilateral talks as  complementary to peace and to the peace decision. How can we  complement a decision that has not been made yet?    Second, I said that these multilateral talks are like  someone  who tries to furnish a house before it is built or the shape is  known. How can we choose the furniture for a house that has not  been built?    This is why I say that the multilateral talks involve  complementary issues that presuppose the existence of peace. We  must be certain that the peace decision has become inevitable  and that its aspects and shape have become clear before we enter  into multilateral talks. We have no reservations about the  issues being discussed at the multilateral talks but about the  mechanism. We even welcome international participation in them.  But we have reservations about their timing. We say it  openly--and time has proved that we are right--that the  multilateral talks have not made progress because the bilateral  ones have not made progress. Those who have been tempted to  take part in these talks admitted to us later that they were  tempted by the promises made from outside the multilateral talks  framework. Some Arab countries have admitted to me later that  they joined the multilateral talks not out of conviction but on  the basis of foreign promises to improve their relations with a  certain country. Where have the multilateral talks gone now?    The question is how could the negotiator sitting at the  multilateral talks table make progress when he knows that the  principal negotiator involved in the bilateral talks is stalled?    [AL-SAFIR] It appears that the dead end is a dual one?    [Buwayz] In addition to what I have already said, the most  important consideration for us is that the multilateral talks  must be in the interest of everyone in the region. For Israel  it is of an additional interest. How can we pay a price to  Israel when the latter has not yet agreed to implement the  Madrid agreement principles and the international resolutions  that were supposedly used by the Madrid conference as a basis  for shaping the implementation mechanism?    [AL-SAFIR] Israel alone is not responsible for the dead end  in the talks but is jointly responsible for it with the United  States, which is managing the negotiating process?    [Buwayz] Like in criminal law where there is a positive and  a  negative responsibility, I believe that Israel is responsible  for not abiding by the Madrid agreement and for not seeking to  implement the Madrid decisions. It is prevaricating on  implementing what was decided on in that conference. It tried  to prevaricate when it sought to gain six additional months  during the U.S. elections and when it procrastinated with all  the Arab countries as it was working to push the Palestinian  negotiator into certain positions while refusing to make  progress on the other tracks. Between the policy of isolating  the other parties, the policy of the Israeli Governments'  internal weakness, and the policy of wagering on the change in  U.S. Administrations, Israel has squandered much of the years  since the peace process started. I say that this is a positive  responsibility, that is, it practiced this responsibility  intentionally and negatively. That was a positive  responsibility done to serve a negative objective.    Regarding U.S. responsibility as cosponsor of the  conference, we did not enter the peace process believing Israel  really wanted peace and would quickly embrace it. We did not  enter an ambiguous peace process either; we entered a process  with well-defined features, goals, mechanisms, and roles. The  goals were clear and frank. They were represented by the  principle of land for peace, the principle of the implementation  of UN resolutions, and the principle of the restoration of lands  and the Palestinian people's political rights. A major reason  for our participation in the conference was our belief that the  U.S. role would be an influential one. We believed that Israel  on its own would not move toward peace. We took into  consideration the U.S. and Soviet assurances. The Soviet Union  still existed then. We particularly depended on the U.S.  assurances, believing that the U.S. commitment to this  conference would result in pressure being applied on Israel to  move in the required direction.    I cannot say that the successive U.S. Administrations have  fully played this role. I cannot say that the United States has  played this role from the beginning, that is, the role of an  honest broker or a driving force. I believe that the United  States has so far sufficed itself with playing a role of a  logistical nature or that of a technical broker. It has not  undertaken dynamic and strong mediation as envisaged in the  peace process. Hence, its responsibility is negative, the  responsibility of someone who has not fulfilled his obligations.    [AL-SAFIR] Israel claims that the Lebanese delegation is not  negotiating with it. At the same time, Rabin stresses that  there is no full withdrawal from the Golan in return for a full  peace. How can this vicious circle be broken?    [Buwayz] This question consists of two parts. Regarding the  negotiations with the Lebanese delegation, what do they want the  Lebanese delegation to negotiate? There are certain Lebanese  principles. Lebanon clearly says that Israel must implement  Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal to the  internationally recognized border, and for the Lebanese state to  establish its authority. In return, Lebanon pledges to assume  its responsibility as a state and to ensure that security and  stability prevails in the area that the state will receive. We  tell the Israelis that this resolution is independent of the  Middle East conflict. Let them accept the principle of its  implementation and we will then be ready to form a joint  military commission that will adopt the executive steps,  programs, and timetables. Afterwards, in solidarity with the  other Arab states, we will move forward with the peace talks  until a comprehensive and final peace is achieved.    We have proposed progress in two phases. The first phase is  purely Lebanese and is through the implementation of Resolution  425. The second phase is on the regional level. What did Israel  do? It linked the Lebanese dossier with the other dossiers,  especially the Syrian dossier. First, as a precondition Israel  demanded that the Lebanese state control the resistance when it  knew that this was impossible. Israel knows that the resistance  is the result and not the cause of the occupation. The result  cannot disappear as long as the cause remains. Israel knows  that the Lebanese Government cannot drop the principle of  resistance as long as it does not have definite assurances that  its territory will be restored. Therefore, Israel is imposing  impossible conditions while we have pledged to establish peace  and security when Israel withdraws from the south. Second,  Israel links its withdrawal to the signing of a comprehensive  peace treaty under which all Arab rights are supposed to be  restored. Hence, it is Israel that is linking the problem of  the south with the regional problem. This is not the first  time it has done this. In the 17 May [1983] agreement, which  was signed after one and a half years of talks, Israel linked  the outcome of the talks with Syria's commitment to the security  of the south. Therefore, if Israel is accusing us of linking our  dossier to Syria's dossier, it is doing that itself. If it is  accusing us of linking it to the regional problem, it is also  doing that itself.    [AL-SAFIR] In the beginning you stated that Israel is  seeking  to deal unilaterally with the Arab states. Now you are saying  that it is linking the Lebanese dossier with the Syrian dossier.    [Buwayz] In the Lebanese dossier, instead of accepting the  spirit of Resolution 425 and acknowledging the need for the  implementation of this resolution in return for security and  stability and then moving on to the regional level, Israel is  linking this subject with the regional topic. One of Israel's  conditions for withdrawal is the signing of a comprehensive  peace agreement.    [AL-SAFIR] The Madrid conference was launched on the basis  of land for peace. The Lebanese translation of the conference  is the implementation of Resolution 425 in return for what?    [Buwayz] Well, we have told Israel to please declare its  readiness for complete withdrawal. This would justify forming a  military committee, which would work out a timetable for a  withdrawal and then we could proceed together toward a  comprehensive peace. However, Israel is proposing forming a  military committee with an as yet unidentified purpose. We have  asked Israel about the purpose of a military committee. If the  purpose is to maintain the prevailing truce, then we say that  there is a truce committee, so why this new committee? If the  goal is to maintain the current situation, we say that there are  UN forces doing that. Let us do their job. However, if the  purpose is really to reach a full withdrawal from south Lebanon,  then let Israel declare this and there would be justification  for forming a military committee.    [AL-SAFIR] We are currently in a dormant stage that may last  for a long time. Can Lebanon tolerate such a situation?    [Buwayz] For us to say whether this situation will continue  or not we have to pinpoint responsibility for it. It was very  obvious in the latest round of talks, the 12th round, that  Israel deliberately refused to make any progress for three  reasons:    1. It wanted to frustrate all results of the Geneva summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton to negate any possibility  of an Arab-U.S. agreement that might be imposed on it and to  show that nothing positive can be done without taking the  Israeli factor into account.    2. It believed that it could not make progress on a track as  long as the Palestinian track had not run its course, so Israel  deliberately prevaricated to foil this round in the hopes of  reaching certain agreements with the Palestinians.    3. It used the pretext that the government's internal  situation at the time did not allow it to make certain decisions  and that it had to secure certain domestic alliances before  making new decisions. Israel used these three reasons directly  or tacitly to prevent any progress. So, who is responsible for  the stagnation in the negotiations?    [AL-SAFIR] There is no doubt that Israel is responsible, but  the Arab party has no other option than negotiations.    [Buwayz] I would not say that the Arab side has no other  options, but that the Arab side is trying to give the peace  process every chance. I would also like to maintain that the  Arab side refuses to bear the responsibility for the failure of  the peace process, should it fail. Therefore, despite the  difficult negotiations and Israeli stalling, the Arab side wants  to ensure all chances for these negotiations to succeed. Should  the negotiations fail, the Arab side does not want to look  negative before the world. If a party does not mind looking  negative and bearing the moral and political responsibility for  the peace process, let it be Israel. [passage omitted]    [AL-SAFIR] One of the issues that shows the extent of Arab  solidarity is that of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab  countries, which is being discussed at the multilateral talks.  For example, Jordan, which you said will not sign, said that it  will resort to international law and not Resolution 194, which  provides for the return of refugees to their land. What about  the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and how will you deal with  this issue?    [Buwayz] When Jordan chooses a certain legal or any other  framework to deal with the Palestinian refugee problem, it means  the problem of Palestinians on its territory and not elsewhere.  Regarding Lebanon, we believe that there can be no possible  solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in the context of  the multilateral negotiations outside the bilateral talks.  Regarding the Palestinian presence in Lebanon, we are  proceeding from the points outlined in our Constitution: We  reject settling the Palestinians in Lebanon in any way, and all  Lebanese concur on this issue. We believe that there is no one  radical solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Anyone who  believes that there is one prompt solution is mistaken. I  believe that solving this problem must follow four lines:  First, recognizing the right to return and consolidating the UN  resolution on the right to return. What do I mean by the right  to return? Of course, Israel will not agree to the Palestinians  returning to the territories that will remain under its  authority. But what about Israel's stance on the return of  Palestinians to the territories that will be regained--Gaza and  Jericho--and to more areas that may be regained later? The  right to return to the Palestinian territories that will be  under Palestinian authority in the future must be entrenched,  particularly those Palestinians who have connections there such  as material, property, or relatives. I believe that if we work  seriously to emphasize this principle, some 20 percent of  Palestinian citizens in Lebanon could be assimilated there.    Second is the principle of the family reunion return. The  world has the humanitarian responsibility to allow those who  have family members anywhere in the world--whether it is Egypt,  Syria, Jordan, the Gulf, Palestine, Canada, or the United  States--to join their families, that is, family reunion by  having the minority join the majority. If we can shape this  idea and adopt it, it can solve 25 percent of the problems of  the Palestinians in Lebanon.    Third, I believe that there are countries with many  immigrants. There are countries that are large and rich but  suffer from the weakness of their human resources and low  populations. These countries have let in a number of  expatriates. They include Australia, Canada, and possibly the  United States. I believe that these countries that continue to  accept a large number of immigrants should give priority to the  Palestinians who want to settle in them.    And last, I believe that the Middle East region is also a  very extensive area. Some of its areas have huge resources and  need manpower and certain human resources. I also believe that  some of these countries have the moral, political, and ethnic  responsibility of tackling even the problem of the Palestinian  refugees. How can we continue to import Asian laborers when we  have Palestinians who cannot enter and work in these countries?    Hence, I believe that if we deal seriously with these four  solutions, they can solve a major and radical part of Lebanon's  problem with the Palestinian presence. While this presence  might be normal, acceptable, and "easily digested" in other  countries of immense size and huge population and where the  absorption of 400,000 or 500,000 Palestinians will not affect  them, this presence in Lebanon will have deep and fundamental  consequences. First, Lebanon's geographic size is very small  compared to its population. Second, the Lebanese area that can  be inhabited or is fit for investment--if we take away the high  mountains and deep valleys-- remains very small. Third,  everyone knows that the Lebanese structure is a very complicated  one and any imbalance in it will have political social,  economic, and security consequences. Fourth, we believe that  the conditions of the Palestinians in the refugee camps in  Lebanon radically differs from those in a number of countries  where they have settled down, are working, and are enjoying  health care and education. It is impossible to ask Lebanon at  present, when it has emerged from war and is incapable of  satisfying the social needs of the Lebanese, to take care of the  Palestinians' needs, too.    [AL-SAFIR] But the state has banned the rebuilding of the  camps from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency funds and  not from Lebanon's funds. What exactly is going on? What is  being planned for the camps?    [Buwayz] If this were allowed, you would have said that  resettlement is already taking place. What is required here to  keep the Palestinian issue alive and keep it the responsibility  of everyone or to absorb and resolve it here in Lebanon? I  believe it is impossible to reconcile these two notions. If you  want to allow the Palestinians to build wherever they want and  if you want them to be included in social security and to enjoy  all the rights of Lebanese citizens, then I believe that you are  moving, intentionally or unintentionally, toward bringing  resettlement about.    [AL-SAFIR] Mr. Minister, it is clear that Israel will not  allow the Palestinians back and is raising the issue of the Jews  in Arab countries.    [Buwayz] I don't think that the problem lies with Israel  only. I don't believe that there are Palestinians who want to  live in the State of Israel. This issue is not under discussion  in the first place. We are talking about the Palestinians'  return to the territories that will be retrieved and placed  under Palestinian authority.    [AL-SAFIR] Your words imply that Lebanon does not want to  keep the Palestinians already here and will work to reduce their  numbers because, as you just said, it cannot tolerate such a  number.    [Buwayz] I am not saying that Lebanon cannot tolerate that  number now because this implies that it could tolerate that in  the past. I am saying that Lebanon has never tolerated such a  number and cannot tolerate it. We do not accept or allow a  solution to the Palestinian problem to be made at the expense of  creating a Lebanese problem. We also do not want or accept the  exchange of the Palestinian identity for another one, including  a Lebanese identity.    [AL-SAFIR] But Lebanon has shouldered responsibility for  some of the Palestinians and must continue to do so at least  temporarily.    [Buwayz] Lebanon and other Arab countries have temporarily  received a number of Palestinians until solutions are found.  The solutions have not been forthcoming. Does this mean that  Lebanon must shoulder the responsibility alone for these  Palestinians? This is an international responsibility resulting  from the creation of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians,  and an Arab responsibility from the perspective of blood and  brotherly ties. Accordingly, this subject concerns the host  states.    [AL-SAFIR] In any case, we retain our viewpoint regarding  what you are saying.    [Buwayz] What is the problem?    [AL-SAFIR] Matters might not be explained only on the basis  of the options you have spoken about. There is a problem.    [Buwayz] You have convinced me that there is a problem. Has  anybody said there is no problem? If this problem did not  exist, you would not have asked me all these questions. I agree  with you that there is a problem. You have asked me how it can  be solved. I have given you the realistic and possible  solutions for this problem.    [AL-SAFIR] Are the ideas that you have aired personal or  part of arrangements being prepared for the region?    [Buwayz] They are a kind of evaluation of the approaches  that we can adopt. We have discussed this topic with  international and other quarters. These quarters are now  discussing this topic.    [AL-SAFIR] Do these ideas apply to Syria, Jordan, and Egypt?    [Buwayz] No, this solution applies to Lebanon. Perhaps the  Palestinians in Egypt are not facing a problem. Egypt, with a  population of 60 million, might not have a problem in  assimilating 500,000 Palestinians. Syria does not have a  problem with large refugee camps. The Palestinians in Syria  benefit from free medicine and education. They enjoy almost all  rights, except political rights.    I have explained Lebanon's special character. It is a small  country with a sensitive social structure.    [AL-SAFIR] If the Palestinians refuse to leave Lebanon, will  they be forced to leave?    [Buwayz] The Palestinians have so far proved their adherence  to their identity. I believe a large number of Palestinians  want either to return to Palestine or to go to another country  where the conditions for living and working are better. I  believe the opening of these options does not conflict with the  Palestinian people's rights to return, to family reunions, or to  choose the country in which they want to live.    [AL-SAFIR] Is there a possibility of discussing other  options  for the Palestinians in Lebanon that will provide better  conditions for them?    [Buwayz] Under no circumstances will Lebanon accept the  naturalization of the Palestinians.    [AL-SAFIR] We did not mean naturalization.    [Buwayz] Lebanon may accept gradual solutions. The  residence of some Palestinians might be organized in accordance  with solutions that will require some time. However, there is a  firm national principle. Lebanon cannot assimilate the  Palestinians and melt them into the Lebanese identity.</p>

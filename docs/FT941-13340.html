			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Carmen steals the show Denyce Graves was ill for Friday's Royal Opera Carmen revival writes Max Loppert. This was a big disappointment: since the charms of the young American mezzo-soprano and the special qualities of her gypsy heroine had already been loudly hymned in several of the world's main operatic cities, her London debut was eagerly awaited. In her absence, the house flew in an opening-night replacement with fine qualities of her own; for her appearance alone the occasion proved not a waste of time. Magali Damonte, Marseilles-born, also new to London, is only the second francophone performer of Carmen in the postwar history of Covent Garden (the first, Lyne Dourian, also 'jumped in' as a substitute, on a single evening during the 1966-67 season). In this opera the shock of hearing sung and spoken words delivered with clarity and bite, and with the teasing, throwaway inflections that only French singers seem to have, is always a savoury one. Miss Damonte's stock of these brought happy rewards in the tavern scene, and the daring flatness of her final rejections of Jose added perceptibly to their shock-content. But there is more to this highly attractive artist than native accent. The figure is slim, the manner agile, the voice not large but warm, fresh and quick-speaking, with a dusky texture in mid-range that lent a personal tang to many of Bizet's key phrases. Nervousness was perceptible, and excusable, in most of Act 1; thereafter, although the rampant banality of the 1991 Nuria Espert production proves no stimulus to any sort of inventiveness, its very mediocrity meant that few surprises were sprung on a late arrival like Miss Damonte. Certainly she has earned herself a return invitation. The other main principals are capable, although the dead hand of the production team tells more obviously in their vocal and physical actions: Neil Shicoff a serious, passionate Jose too frequently reliant on all-out forcefulness, Barseg Tumanyan an energetic, unstylish Escamillo, Leontina Vaduva an appealing but too tremulous Micaela. To add to the built-in handicaps of this hopeless, irredeemable Carmen staging, the revival has thrown up a new one: that of conductor. Of all the operas Jeffrey Tate has led at Covent Garden so far, Carmen - an opera which thrives on Gallic lightness, snappiness and zest of handling - is surely the one to which his musical gifts are least aptly suited. By Monday night the promised Carmen had arrived, writes Richard Fairman. Reading the gypsy's cards had presumably warned her that she would face a different Don Jose from her stand-in and that the two of them would have to inject any life that there was to be in the performance. As much of Europe and the US have already discovered, Denyce Graves is a natural as Carmen. Quietly brooding, tempting, she plays the role with a kittenish touch, teasing the soldiers and giving Don Jose a surprise by springing upon him from behind. Her dark mezzo flashes various colours, including a warning red in the chest register when her temper is roused. As she looks and sounds a Carmen, she judges rightly that she has no need to work overtime to put the character across. Her Jose, the tenor Richard Margison, is not so lucky: he is physically on the stiff side and his voice, so clean and bright in Italian opera, sounds too little sensuous and flexible in French. He does work hard, especially at getting sensitivity into his singing, and all his intentions are going in the right direction, even if the last ounce of passion is missing. Their final scene together belongs to Graves, who underplays to a daring degree, always still, calm, the emotion held within. Her Carmen somehow belongs in a different kind of production. Royal Opera House: in repertory until February 2</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Italian Elections: Mafia plot theory enlivens poll WITHIN the space of a week Italy's Christian Democrat-led government has managed the unusual feat of both inventing and dismissing a nationwide plot to destablise the country's elections on April 5. The ill-explained conspiracy was advanced by Mr Enzo Scotti, the interior minister, to account for the presumed Mafia killing of Mr Salvatore Lima, the Euro-MP and most powerful Christian Democrat politician in Sicily. But now even Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister and a close friend of Mr Lima, has dismissed the conspiracy theory as 'a worthless piece of paper.' Indeed, it has emerged that the only people to give credence to the idea of occult forces at work in concert to destabilise the elections were Mr Scotti, a Bologna magistrate, and a dubious prisoner with a record of previous disinformation who purveyed a story claiming Mafia elements had a hit list of senior politicians. Over the weekend, Mr Andreotti said acting on this informer's evidence was like clearing a school when a student has telephoned with a bomb scare. The affair looks as though it is now being buried as quickly as it was raised, the Christian Democrat leadership recognising that the electorate was unimpressed and that to pursue the matter risked serious embarrassment. As it is, the opposition have had a field day, criticising a crude attempt to manipulate voters' sympathy. L'Unita, the daily of the former communist party, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), carried a full page advertisement labelled 'the worthless pieces of paper' with a picture of the government. The ruling party's principal approach continues to emphasise the risks of votes going to the smaller parties which will weaken the prospects of a new coalition with their Socialist partners. However, the weekend results of France's regional elections, closely watched in Italy, could give further encouragement to protests going to parties such as the Republicans (PRI), the populist Lombard League, parties backing referendums and the Greens.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PRIME AGREES TO WHITNEY MERGER  </P> <P> Prime Computer Inc., besieged for eight months by hostile suitor MAI Basic Four  Inc., turned today to a friendly buyer, the New York investment firm of J. H.  Whitney &amp; Co., in a deal valued at over $1 billion.  </P> <P> Prime and Whitney said they have agreed to an acquisition in which Whitney  would pay $21.50 a share in cash for 79% of the Natick, Mass.-based computer  maker's outstanding common stock. The remaining 21% of Prime's shares would be  exchanged for bonds with a face value of $22 a share.  </P> <P> Securities analysts said that offer appeared to be significantly higher than  MAI Basic Four's last bid, which was $19.50 a share in cash for 75% of Prime's  shares and securities with a face value of $21 a share for the remainder.  </P> <P> However, MAI said this week it was preparing to boost its offer, raising the  prospect of a bidding war.  </P> <P> "Is it too late for (MAI) to top this one? Presumably not. You're in an auction  mode," said John W. Adams, who follows Prime for the Boston investment firm of  Adams Harkness &amp; Hill.  </P> <P> Prime had been searching for months for a friendly buyer, or white knight, to  top MAI's offer. It said its board of directors unanimously approved the merger  agreement.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Bitzan: "United States Insists on Iraq </F> Boycott by All Means"]    [Text] Vienna -- 'Abd al-Razak al-Hashimi, director of the  foreign office of the Iraqi Ba'th Party, accuses the United  States of wanting to maintain the international boycott against  Iraq by all means. "The United States prevents the UN Security  Council from lifting the sanctions; and this even though Iraq  has fulfilled all demands and resolutions." The foreign leader  of the state party also criticizes the United States with regard  to Kuwait: "Kuwait was not the point for them, because the  crisis has long passed, more than three years have passed. But  the United States is maintaining the sanctions. This shows that  the problem was not Kuwait."    Al-Hashimi also complains about international propaganda:  "We are accused of still having Kuwaiti prisoners. Commissions  visited us, which confirmed our claims -- there are no  prisoners. We have even invited Kuwaiti parliamentarians, but  they rejected the invitation."    Regarding the latest attacks on UN employees in northern  Iraq, al-Hashimi says that this area is not under government  control; therefore, Baghdad rejects all accusations that its  agents have carried out these attacks. "The Kurds in this zone  know now that things were much better in the past. The problem  is foreign interference. There will only be a solution if the  foreign powers leave the country. We will get along well with  the Kurds."    For al-Hashimi the most important thing is that the  sanctions  are lifted, "that the Iraqi nation has enough to eat." He sees  signs of a softening: "The United States cannot prevent that  anymore. Sooner or later the boycott will be lifted." In this  period, which is so difficult for Iraq, one is choosing the  friends, and also future business partners, who will then  already have a foothold in Iraq as soon as the sanctions are  lifted, al-Hashimi says temptingly.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Poor outlook may force Alcan to review dividend ALCAN ALUMINIUM warned that it would be forced to reconsider its 1991 capital spending of CDollars 900m (USDollars 775.8m) and its dividend policy if the global recession continues and aluminium demand remained stagnant. Mr David Morton, chairman, said after the annual meeting that the world aluminium industry was going through a 'rough spot that may be quite prolonged'. Alcan reported a small loss in the first quarter, but maintained its quarterly dividend. Mr Morton would not estimate the impact of low prices and sluggish demand on Alcan's second quarter, but he indicated that business in April did not show much change from the first quarter. Spot ingot prices in London earlier this week touched a four-year low of around the equivalent of 61.5 US cents a pound. Mr Morton said that at such a level Alcan could still make an operating profit at the smelter level.</p>

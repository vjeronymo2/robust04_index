			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Major pledges more scrutiny of councils MR JOHN Major will today reinforce the government's commitment to subjecting local councils to more independent scrutiny. He will also underline the extension of private ownership, individual freedom and choice in a speech to the Young Conservatives' conference in Eastbourne. The prime minister will use his speech to set out some of the themes intended for his party's manifesto and to try to frustrate Labour's hopes of exploiting voters' dissatisfaction with public services. He will reaffirm the government's plans for league tables on councils' performance. Details of Mr Major's speech emerged last night and were intended to counter Labour's local government conference in Blackpool. He will also launch a fresh attack on Labour's economic policies, saying that the opposition party has no proposals for strengthening the economic recovery when it comes, but many which would lead to a perpetual recession. Councils are currently setting poll tax levels and households may start to receive bills around the time of the general election, if it is called on April 9. Tory efforts so far have focused on blaming Labour councils for setting high bills. Details of how more independent scrutiny could be introduced have yet to be worked out but could build on existing plans to enhance the role of the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog. Mr Major's speech, described by Tory officials as 'wide-ranging' will build on the principles behind the Citizen's Charter he unveiled last year. He will say that the re-election of a Tory government will mean 'no more municipal cover-ups and no hiding place for incompetent and uncaring councils'. Besides seeking to increase Tory appeal to young voters, Mr Major will outline four principles of his Conservative philosophy: ownership, responsibility, choice and individual freedom.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Presenting a truer and fairer view - The implications of a new ruling from the Accounting Standards Board RULES MAY be made to be broken, but companies bending the letter of the law to comply with its spirit in presenting their accounts should from now on be prepared to stand up and take the consequences. That is the implication of the seventh abstract from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board issued last month, which became mandatory for year-ends from December 23 1992. It says that businesses using the 'true and fair' override in the 1985 Companies Act, which exempts them from the law's required format, must state this fact clearly and unambiguously in the accounting policies note which immediately follows the primary financial statements. The note must state the treatment normally required by the act, a description of the treatment actually adopted, an explanation of why the normal treatment would not provide a true and fair view, and either a quantification of the effects of the departure, or an explanation of why it cannot be quantified. The ruling is unusual because it appears to add little to the wording in the act itself, which states that: 'particulars of any such departure, the reasons for it and its effect shall be given in a note to the accounts.' But it reflects a frustration that standards-setters and those monitoring accounts to ensure compliance have been unable to assess the extent to which the clause is being used honestly. It will make the job of those reviewing accounts much easier. 'The statement of this requirement in practice has varied and there has been a tendency for some companies to understate rather than emphasise the significance of what they have done,' the task force statement explains. As Mr Dick Wilkins of the Accounting Standards Board warns: 'The intention was for use of the true and fair override to be fairly limited.' A number of companies have been using phrases in the notes to their accounts justifying a particular treatment as providing a 'truer and fairer' view, or a similar phrase. Whether they are invoking the override has sometimes been unclear. 'We felt the use of the override was too low-key and blurred in the past,' says Mr Wilkins. 'Users might find it difficult to judge when it was being applied. We wanted to make it much clearer and bring general practice up to the standards of the better companies.' There have been a wide variety cases in which the override has been used, including: Non-depreciation of investment properties, as specified in SSAP 19. Offsetting government grants from non-depreciating fixed assets - notably infrastructure of the water companies. Placing convertible capital bonds in the balance sheet in reserves rather than under long-term creditors. Deducting goodwill from gross shareholders' funds to provide a net figure, rather than showing it separately. Non-consolidation of investments by investment trusts and venture capital companies. Non-consolidation of subsidiaries held for disposal. Commodity brokers showing investments at market value, and passing any increases in value through the profit and loss account. Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual accounts, has highlighted a growing tendency in recent months for companies to use the true and fair override. Its December issue identifies several examples. These include BM Group, which provides segmental information of profit including interest but excluding exceptional items. A note says this is contrary to SSAP 25, the standard on segmental reporting which requires interest to be excluded, but that the directors consider 'interest is an integral part of the costs of the business and thus to exclude interest would give a misleading view'. The task force abstract is unusual because it was not placed on the agenda - as most of the previous issues under discussion were - by its own members who had identified the problem among company accounts. It represents instead a recommendation from the Professional Standards Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The committee's role to maintain the professional standards of members had been clouded by the creation of the new accounting bodies and their own enforcement mechanisms. It is now beginning to find its feet and make recommendations to the task force on problems which it has identified in financial reporting. Since the task force's new abstract is about disclosure as much as treatment, its effectiveness will be hard to judge. Companies choosing to ignore it will remain difficult to spot. But those faithfully highlighting, but wrongly applying the override can expect to hear from the Financial Reporting Review Panel before too long.</p>

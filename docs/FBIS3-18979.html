			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Northern League lower house </F> floor leader, by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given:  "We Will Only Join Forces with Forza Italia If the Numbers Are  Sufficient"]    [Text] Milan -- [Passalacqua] Deputy Maroni, what sort of  government do you think will be formed after 28 March? An  institutional government?    [Maroni] I believe so. We are open to all plausible options.  It will all depend on the figures that emerge from the polling  booths. [League Secretary] Bossi said so yesterday: "The  League and Forza Italia will form a government on their own, if  the numbers are sufficient." If, on the other hand, they are  not, we will never join forces with [Italian Social Movement  (MSI) Secretary] Fini, and therefore...    [Passalacqua] Therefore what?    [Maroni] I think that it is unlikely that the League and  Forza Italia will obtain enough support to form a government on  their own and, therefore, if we cannot do so with Fini, and we  cannot form a government with the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] or Communist Renewal either... then an institutional  government may be the most viable option.    [Passalacqua] What do you mean "we cannot form a government  with the PDS"?    [Maroni] Exactly what I said: We cannot form an organized  government with the PDS.    [Passalacqua] Will the institutional government be similar  to  Ciampi's government?    [Maroni] Yes, I believe so. Personally speaking, I am  against institutional governments.    [Passalacqua] It was you, however, who launched the idea  during an interview with LA REPUBBLICA.    [Maroni] If need be, I will go ahead with such a government,  but I will do so unwillingly, because I realize that it will be  blocked by opposition vetoes. However, if the alternative is to  hold new elections immediately, let us at least form this sort  of government.    [Passalacqua] For what purpose?    [Maroni] Modifying the electoral law to make it 100 percent  uninominal, reducing the number of deputies from 630 to 475.    [Passalacqua] Meaning?    [Maroni] If there is no choice but an institutional  government, we must hold new elections, but not, say, just two  months later. Let us do something positive, let us amend the  electoral law by introducing a straight uninominal system for  everybody, but getting rid of the proportional quota, which  implies amending the Constitution.    [Passalacqua] What will happen then?    [Maroni] We must have everyone's support.    [Passalacqua] I have the feeling that the MSI and [Forza  Italia leader] Berlusconi are not very much in favor of this  formula.    [Maroni] If it is an institutional government, then it must  enjoy everyone's support; otherwise, it is not an institutional  government. Berlusconi and the MSI have said no, but it al  depends on what such a government is called upon to do. If the  prospect is holding elections with a straight uninominal system  and voting directly for the prime minister, then everyone is  agreed or can agree, in my opinion.    [Passalacqua] You seem to be neglecting federalism in your  plans.    [Maroni] The MSI is light years away from this position.  Forza Italia supports an important point which is that of  fiscal federalism. This is not the full solution, but it is a  first step. Federalism is not an instant process, the important  thing is to get started.    [Passalacqua] What if the institutional government were only  supported by the progressives?    [Maroni] It would no longer be an institutional government,  but something different. When someone gets excluded, a  political choice is being made.    [Passalacqua] What, however, if someone decides to exclude  himself?    [Maroni] If that were to happen, I do not think that we  could  form an institutional government: It would be up to us and the  Left. At that point, a left-wing minority government would be  preferable. However, I must say that perhaps Berlusconi has not  fully understood what an institutional government is. He is  afraid that it might only mean a genuine executive power, with  the PDS as part of it, governing the economy. An institutional  government is something different. It is the expression of a  parliament that decides to go back to the ballot boxes.    [Passalacqua] And, in the event of a left-wing minority  government, what would the League then do?    [Maroni] It would be in the opposition.    [Passalacqua] Who should be the prime minister of an  institutional government?    [Maroni] Not a politician, but someone guaranteeing the  balance of forces.    [Passalacqua] Is this the only possibility that the League  can envisage for the next parliament?    [Maroni] This is what I envisage in the event that the next  parliament fails, that is, if we do not succeed in forming a  League- Forza Italia majority.    [Passalacqua] If you do, who would be the prime minister?    [Maroni] Not me, I hope. It would be very hard on Italy -- I  only really get going after midday.    [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? The other day Bossi  ruled him out...    [Maroni] As a matter of fact, he did. But we also believe  that the people have the last word.    [Passalacqua] So we have to wait and see who wins in the  proportional round?    [Maroni] Something along those lines.    [Passalacqua] It seems clear enough: Berlusconi will win.    [Maroni] Not necessarily. You are thinking in terms of  national percentages, we think in terms of geographical areas.  If the League wins the first place in the north, this will  carry some weight.    [Passalacqua] What is the state of your current relations  with Berlusconi?    [Maroni] Well, I am in charge of relations with Berlusconi,  and they are good.    [Passalacqua] You always seem to be squabbling, though...    [Maroni] My relationship with him is good, although he is  worried about these differences because he thinks they may cause  us to lose votes.    [Passalacqua] Will you still stay together after the  elections?    [Maroni] I think so.</p>

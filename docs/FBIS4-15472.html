			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry has closely followed the  development of events in and around Gorazde, where clashes  between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims flared up once again, a  high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on Thursday.    According to him, Bosnian Serbs reacted to Muslim acts of  provocation in the area of Gorazde "inadequately." "The Serbs  made a four-kilometer incursion from the disengagement line, and  invaded several villages, whose Muslim population took shelter  in the city of Gorazde which is controlled by Muslim units," the  diplomat said.    As he said, the situation is aggravated by the circumstance  that in Gorazde the Muslims are holding about 50 Serb prisoners  of war, whom the field commanders of Bosnian Serbs are seeking  to free at any cost.    On Friday, the official from Russia's Foreign Ministry said,  high-ranking representatives of Bosnian Serbs and Muslims are to  meet in Sarajevo's airport to discuss the possible ways to reach  a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole, and in Gorazde in  particular.    According to Interfax's interviewee, the formula that helped  to ease tensions in and around another Bosnian city, Srebrenica,  could be used in the area of Gorazde. "Stipulated in an  agreement reached between Bonian Serbs, Muslims and the command  of the U.N. protection forces, the formula provides for  withdrawing the armed units of both sides from the line of  confrontation, demilitarizing the "buffer" zone and deploying  U.N. peace-keeping forces there," he said.    This week-end or early next week the special envoy of the  Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, may  make a trip to the Balkans, the diplomat said. "We are working  in two directions -- Bosnia and Krajina. It's not surprising  therefore that the program of his trip includes Zagreb and  Belgrade," he added.    According to Interfax's interviewee, in Moscow on Wednesday  Churkin conferred with one of the leaders of Bosnian Serbs,  Momcilo Krajisnik, and discussed with him the situation that had  emerged in the wake of the Washington agreements signed to form  a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,and subsequently  establish a confederation between it and Croatia. "The two men  discussed the role Bosnian Serbs could play under these  agreements. Russia wants the lawful rights of the third nation  making up the state of Bosnia- Herzegovina -- Bosnian Serbs --  to be observed," he stressed.    Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of  the  Russian president, will fly to Belgrade Sunday, April 10 to meet  with Serbia's leaders, Grigoriy Karasin, a spokesman for the  Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing in Moscow Thursday.    Karasin added that Churkin would meet with Croatian leaders  in Zagreb Monday and the next day would attend talks on the  economic issues of the settlement that would be held in the  Russian embassy to Croatia.    Karasin did not rule out the possibility that Churkin would  also visit Sarajevo.</p>

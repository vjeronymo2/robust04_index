			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Blow to Clinton as Bentsen quits: President nominates Rubin to take over US Treasury post President Bill Clinton is to nominate Mr Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary, taking over from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the administration's elder statesman, who announced his resignation yesterday. Mr Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, heads the National Economic Council, a White House policy co-ordination unit. Mr Bentsen, 73, who on Monday had called speculation on his departure 'premature', said he had told Mr Clinton in September that he wanted to step down. His leaving is not expected to signal any sharp change in economic policy. Mr Rubin and Mr Bentsen stand on the conservative wing of the Democratic party and share a commitment to free trade, fiscal responsibility and pro-business policies. However, after last month's devastating defeat for Democrats in the congressional elections, the loss of Mr Bentsen, who will return to Texas to relaunch his business career, is expected to be sorely felt. One of the criticisms most frequently levelled at Mr Clinton's White House is its failure to persuade Congress of its way of thinking. That task will be harder with Republican majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives. With six years' service in the House and 22 in the Senate - the last six as chairman of the powerful finance committee - Mr Bentsen had an instinct for Congress's mood and an ability to work with the Republicans that was rare in the Clinton administration. Mr Rubin's confirmation by the Senate is not expected to pose difficulties. He was endorsed yesterday by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, and by Senator Pete Domenici, who will chair the budget committee. But Mr Bentsen's retirement still leaves Mr Clinton with a large array of vacancies to fill. A successor must be found to Mr Rubin at the NEC - the most widely mentioned candidate is Mr Erskine Bowles, an investment banker. Mr Clinton also still needs to pick a successor to Mr Mike Espy, who resigned as agriculture secretary over charges of ethics violations. The Democrats' political apparatus is also in disarray after last month's poll setback. Mr Clinton needs to fill the jobs of White House political director, head of the Democratic National Committee and head of his own re-election committee. Honest broker, Page 3 Currencies, Page 40</p>

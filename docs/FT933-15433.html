			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Recycling 'economically sound': German waste management chief defends stance on plastics MR Wolfram Bruck, chief executive of Duales System Deutschland (DSD), Germany's national waste recycling venture, yesterday defended the country's waste management scheme. Mr Bruck said that DSD had conducted its own studies and could prove that plastics recycling was economically and environmentally efficient. The survival of DSD depends on the controversy regarding recycling plastics. Germany, which has some of the strictest environmental laws, is currently rethinking the high recycling quotas it is imposing on plastics packaging collected by DSD. The federal environment office, the principal think-tank behind environmental policies in Germany, is conducting a study on whether plastics should be incinerated rather than recycled and what is to be done with the 280,000 tonnes of plastics packaging for which there are no recycling facilities in the country. The problem of plastics waste disposal has become all the more urgent in recent months following bitter attacks from France and the UK against German waste exports. France has threatened to ban imports of German waste. Mr Bruck pointed out the two plastics recycling methods - hydrogenation and gasification - used in Germany. Both methods, which consist of burning plastics and re-using the energy for oil refineries or power plants, are environmentally controversial. Many claim that the net effect on the environment is not positive because a high amount of energy is used to burn the plastics. Germany's federal environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, yesterday also defended Germany's recycling scheme, adds Tim King in London. Mr Topfer was speaking in London at the launch of a two-day seminar on Britain, Germany and the new environmental agenda. He suggested the key to improving environmental performance was to create, either by regulation or price, bottlenecks in the market. Excess of packaging waste amounted to a bottleneck which he hoped would be solved by technological innovation. There was now a stimulus for new technological processes, he said.</p>

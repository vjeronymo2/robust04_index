			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Bruce Richards' new weather-vane paintings sure know which way the wind's  blowing. With his usual symbolic aplomb he looks at love, law, art and luck and  comes to the unhappy conclusion that these much touted forces are prey to the  whims and winds of popular opinion. Love is an arrow-shafted pointer  capriciously turning in the morning breeze; law is blind justice -- a fixed  lightening rod for change that never moves; art and luck are fickle and spin in  any direction.  </P> <P> Richards is an able realist painter with a strong feeling for the potent power  of mundane objects to spill out witty narratives. Like Ed Ruscha, he has a  particularly keen appreciation for Populist symbols, which he manipulates and  alters within the painting. In "First Thought," an apple with heart-shaped love  bites becomes a biblical narrative with a set of underlying assumptions that  ignite when placed next to the rounded, Venus of Willendorf fertility symbol.  </P> <P> Like a film director, Richards recognizes objects like burnt out matches and  glass slippers as emblematic icons for thought and feeling. Simply by focusing  tightly on the objects and aligning them with declarative titles he can unleash  pent-up associations as entertaining as they are literal. Occasionally he gets  carried away in the heart-shaped "Courtship" love letter envelopes. The  envelope idea seems a bit labored, partly hiding a reproduction of a well known  piece of art in envelopes ripped open in ways that suggest the imagery. But we  still catch the reminder that in today's art world images have become cultural  icons, indistinguishable from their makers. (Hunsaker/Schlesinger, 812 N. La  Cienega Blvd., to Dec. 23.)

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / German industrial orders fall again THE LEVEL of industrial orders in west Germany fell in August for the sixth month in succession, underlining the gloomy outlook for the German economy. A slight improvement in unemployment figures for September, also published yesterday, failed to reflect the normal seasonal upturn, while retail trade figures showed a sharp drop in turnover in the past 12 months. The level of manufacturing orders was down by 0.4 per cent in August compared with the previous month, and 8.2 per cent lower than August 1991. Taking the two months, July and August, orders were down 1.7 per cent compared with May/June, reflecting a sharp drop of 2.9 per cent in export orders, even before the latest sharp increase in the value of the D-Mark in the currency markets. The two-month total was down 6.7 per cent from July/August 1991. Although export orders were virtually constant in August, according to the economics ministry, there was a clear drop in orders for the vehicle manufacturing industry, a reliable bell-wether for other sectors. On the jobs front, the number of unemployed fell by 38,000 in west Germany to 1.783m, although seasonally adjusted that amounts to an increase of some 20,000. Compared with September 1991, the number of jobless was up 174,000. In east Germany, the unadjusted unemployment figure was also slightly down - by 58,000 to 1.11m - but commentators are unanimous that the figure does not reflect any reliable or lasting upturn in that economy. Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the Federal Labour Office, said that the figures from the west showed there was no sign of an end to the weakening economy there. The figures for the east did not suggest any sign of the hoped for upturn in the labour market, although they did indicate that the low point of unemployment might be reached by the end of the year or the beginning of 1993. Figures for specialised retail trade showed a real 5 per cent drop in turnover over the 12 months to August, according to the retail industry association in Cologne. The slowdown was reflected in public protest yesterday when more than 3,000 workers at Porsche sports car plants staged demonstrations against the company's plan to cut 1,850 jobs in the current year, according to the IG Metall union.</p>

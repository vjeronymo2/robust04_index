In accordance with the agreement's conditions, the  government of Ukraine, in the person of Valentyn Landyk, deputy  prime minister for issues of foreign economic activity, is  handing over the debt for gas equaling U.S. $671,900,000 to the  "Respublika" corporation, which was recently set up in Kiev.  The corporation has also assumed the obligation to pay for  deliveries of Turkmen gas for 1994 to the value of $500 million.    In accordance with the agreement's conditions, 35 percent of  the said totals should be paid in cash. The remainder should be  compensated to Turkmenistan by Ukrainian goods, which in fact  means the consolidation of the system of export quotas and  licenses. In the event that the "Respublika" corporation does  not fulfill its obligations in paying off the debt, Ukraine's  government is to pay it. That is, under the agreement the  mediator does not bear any financial responsibility.    Experts note that the resale of state debt to nonstate  structures is an extremely dangerous matter. These means are  only used after a country has been officially declared bankrupt  (for example by The Hague arbitration court). We will note that  payment for the mediation operations of the "Respublika"  corporation could be from 3 to 8 percent of the total debt,  which is from 35 to $94 million. In addition, the mediator  becomes a monopolist of 10-15 percent of Ukraine's total  exports. The emergence of a commercial mediator in interstate  relations evokes the surprise of experts. We emphasize that in  accordance with the law, such agreements become valid only after  ratification by Ukraine's Supreme Council.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Zimbabwe cancels controversial land leases The Zimbabwe government has cancelled 72 farm leases under which ministers and senior officials had occupied state land forcibly acquired from white farmers for the resettlement of landless peasants. The move is being seen as an exercise in damage limitation at home and abroad. Announcing the cancellation in parliament late on Tuesday night, agriculture minister Mr Kumbirai Kangai published the names of prominent black Zimbabweans who had been provided with farms. The list includes the head of the air force, the minister of education (and former agriculture minister who piloted the controversial land legislation through parliament), the governor of Matabeleland North, the deputy minister of industry and commerce and several members of parliament. Political sources insist that President Robert Mugabe was not party to the scheme and was upset by the elitist image created by the allocation of farms to people in well-paid positions. Last month Mr Mugabe, who said he had not been aware that land acquired by the state for resettlement purposes was being leased to tenant farmers as part of the government's 'economic indigenisation' programme, promised to cancel all leases. The announcement has been welcomed by businessmen concerned that the Zimbabwe investment promotion conference in London on May 19 would have been undermined by the controversy. While there is general acceptance of the need for the provision of more and better land for the country's black majority, land policy has been a persistent headache for Mr Mugabe's government. It has run into criticism from white farmers fearing that their land will be subject to compulsory acquisition by the state; by donors critical of the slow pace and poor results of past resettlement programmes; and by black Zimbabweans angry at the delays in making land available. In 1982 the government promised to resettle 162,500 families on vacant or under-utilised land by 1985. The programme fell well behind schedule and latest figures put the number of families resettled at less than 65,000. Government spokesmen blamed inadequate funding and a shortage of land and new legislation to enable ministers to 'designate' privately owned agricultural land was introduced. The designation and compulsory acquisition process replaced the previous 'willing seller, willing buyer' programme applied during the 1980s. Controversy over designation has died down in the past year as relations improved between white commercial farmers - the main targets of designation  -and the government. Early this year, however, independent newspapers began reporting that state land was being leased to prominent black ministers and officials. rather than being used for peasant resettlement. The lease programme was stoutly defended by the government-controlled media and by Mr Kangai despite mounting criticism from opposition politicians, the independent media and even the ruling Zanu-PF party newspaper. The controversy came as industrial relations problems have mounted. Junior doctors in the government service are on strike demanding a 40 per cent pay award, the Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions and postal workers have demanded pay awards of at least 25 per cent and school teachers are threatening action unless they receive a 40 per cent pay increase. Official figures show that non-farm real wages reached a 20-year low last year. Prices have more than doubled since the launch of the country's Economic Structural Adjustment Programme in 1991 and virtually all wage and salary-earners have experienced a decline in real take-home pay. Real income per head has fallen more than 10 per cent since 1991 and is currently at its lowest level in more than a decade. Yesterday, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry published a gloomy business opinion report, suggesting that industrial production, down more than 20 per cent in the last two years will take at least another two years to regain its 1991 output levels.</p>

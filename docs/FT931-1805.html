			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Poland to press on with privatisation THE POLISH government said yesterday it would push ahead with a programme for mass privatisation despite parliament's rejection of the plan, Reuter reports from Warsaw. In a shock defeat for the government and its economic reforms, parliament last week threw out the plan to privatise 600 state companies via western-managed investment funds and distribute shares to the public. Government officials said the cabinet had decided to amend the long-delayed programme, taking account of some opposition objections, and send it back to parliament. But they said the cabinet was ready to start implementing the plan if parliament delayed it. Privatisation ministry director Jerzy Thieme told a news briefing that existing laws did not prohibit the government from creating the funds, although it could not start handing out shares without parliamentary approval. Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka's ruling coalition sees the programme as an essential plank of radical market reforms begun after the collapse of communism in 1989. The 200 companies, all of which have taken the first steps towards privatisation, would be transferred to between five and eight investment funds.</p>

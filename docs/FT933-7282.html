			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Many company returns rejected MORE THAN 8 per cent of the documents filed to Companies House, the government's corporate information agency, in the past year were rejected as inaccurate or incomplete. The latest Companies House annual report, covering the 12 months to March, shows that officials sent back 329,000 of the 3.98m documents received from companies in 1992-93. Nearly a fifth of the annual accounts that companies are required by law to file omitted the signature or name on the auditor's report. More than 10 per cent had no original signature on the balance sheet and more than 30 per cent failed to list their members, directors or company secretary in their annual returns. Companies House only scrutinises returns for this sort of clerical error. It does not check to see whether the accounting policies are correct or that the books balance. The report shows that 85 per cent of companies are filing annual accounts and returns on time, a sharp increase since Companies House introduced late-filing penalties last year. Fines generated Pounds 5.7m, which the agency says it is happy to report as below expectations. In an indication of the effects of the recession the number of new company incorporations fell from 112,000 to 109,000 in the year, the lowest level for more than five years. Those struck off the register increased sharply from 119,000 to 153,000. That reduced the number of limited companies to 973,000 compared with 1,008,000 a year earlier. Demands for searches of company information also fell - down 11.3 per cent from last year - which contributed to the agency's decision to cut expenditure by Pounds 2.8m. Redundancy and early retirement cost Pounds 1.5m and it reported a deficit of Pounds 2.4m for the year. Turnover from fees and charges was Pounds 49.1m, of which Pounds 17m was remitted to the Department of Trade and Industry to cover the unexpectedly high costs of company investigations, and for developing company law. It wrote off Pounds 2.1m for the development of projects including a computerised register of mortgages. This might not proceed, since demand is less certain than expected. Mr David Durham, chief executive, acknowledges in the report that the possible privatisation of part of Companies House, announced last year, created 'an atmosphere of uncertainty' for staff.</p>

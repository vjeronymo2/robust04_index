			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Hungary privatisation bid to boost share ownership HUNGARY is to extend state shareholdings worth Ft100bn (Pounds 682m) in 70 companies on concessionary terms to small investors, in an effort to broaden share ownership and privatisation. The initial wave of sales, to be formally announced next week will see shares worth Ft5bn in eight profitable companies floated on the Budapest stock exchange in January. First on the block are minority stakes in the Pannonia, Soproni and Borsodi breweries, the Pannonia, Eravis and Hungaria hotel chains, plastics producer Pannonplast and bottled gas distributor Primagaz. Every adult Hungarian paying a nominal Ft2000 entrance fee will be entitled to a Ft100,000 interest-free credit facility which can be used to subscribe to the offerings. The scheme, devised by Schroders, the UK investment bank, allows repayments to be spread over five years and no security is required beyond the purchased shares themselves. The design of the programme may leave the government holding the risk and ultimate ownership of shares that are sold, some observers fear. An OECD report concluded that the new privatisation investment facility was 'seriously flawed.' Nevertheless, the authorities hope the generous terms will attract 1m of Hungary's 10m population. Hungary's privatisation drive has until recently been heavily reliant on foreign investors. General Electric's purchase of light producer Tungsram in 1990 led a host of big western multinationals into Hungary. These acquisitions helped the government privatise 18 per cent of the state enterprise sector by the end of last year and have taken foreign investment to over Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), more than half the total inflow into eastern Europe. But foreign interest in manufacturing investments has waned as the cherries of Hungarian industry have been picked. At the same time, political sensitivity about foreign domination and attacks against the privatisation process have intensified. The qualified success of the Czech voucher privatisation scheme has also encouraged Hungary's more modest version of popular capitalism.</p>

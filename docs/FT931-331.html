			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (12): A modest leader's identity problem - Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, talks to Anthony Robinson and Laura Silber THE LEADERS of newly independent Slovenia and Slovakia both think they have the same problem - that the world mistakes one for the other. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime minister, complains: 'We are at the heart of Europe but no-one knows us. Foreigners always confuse Bratislava (the Slovak capital) with Belgrade (the capital of the warring rump of Yugoslavia), and Slovenia with Slovakia.' Mr Janez Drnovsek, the quiet-spoken polyglot who is the prime minister of Slovenia, has an additional problem. He is slightly miffed that people sometimes confuse Slovenia and Slovakia, but recognises that this is largely because the names of the two republics are so similar, especially when written in their respective languages. Slovakia, for example, is called Republika Slovenska in the Slovak language. But a more important problem for the 42-year-old Liberal Democrat leader is to ensure that there is no confusion between peaceful, newly-independent and ethnically-homogeneous Slovenia and Slavonia, rather than with Slovakia. For Slavonia is the war-torn north eastern region of Croatia whose Serb minority, backed by Serbia and the Serb controlled army, revolted against Croatian independence in June 1991 and fought a bloody war which reduced such towns as Vukovar and Osijek to ruins and led to a mass exodus of ethnic Croats from the mixed areas. Slavonia is one of the great victims of the war. As President of the Yugoslav Federal Republic for the year ending May 1990, Mr Drnovsek saw first hand how the federal state withered in the hot breath of Serbian nationalism. Misha Glenny,in his recent book, The Fall of Yugoslavia, tells of the humiliation that Mr Drnovsek had to endure at the hands of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, who invited him to an unrestrained pageant of Serb nationalism at the 600th anniversary of the Serb defeat by the Ottomans at Kosovo Polje in June 1389. This took place shortly after Mr Drnovsek assumed the chair of the revolving presidency, and must have convinced him early on of the doomed nature of the Yugoslav experience. His official CV, which lists the important events of his presidency, records his attendance at the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution celebrations in Paris and the Independence ceremonies in Namibia. It does not mention Kosovo Polje. Just two years after his public exposure to raw Serb nationalism, however, Mr Drnovsek was negotiating with Serb generals over the withdrawal of the federal army from Slovenia after its humiliating defeat in the 10-day 'war' which followed Slovenia's declaration of independence on June 25 1991. Slovenia gave the Titoist system its main ideologue, in the shape of Edward Kardelj, but also its most pragmatic, reformist 'communists.' Mr Drnovsek was one of them. But in March 1992 he became president of the Liberal Democratic party, reviving a political tradition which dates back to the late 19th century when Slovenia spawned a number of small Liberal and Christian Democrat orientated parties during the last decades of Habsburg rule. A month later, Mr Drnovsek - a former construction company manager, banker and diplomat - became prime minister of the second post-independence government, replacing the government headed by Mr Lojze Peterle, the Christian Democrat leader, who is now foreign minister and deputy prime minister in the present government. In December last year Mr Drnovsek led his party to victory in the general elections, emerging with 25 per cent of the seats in the 90-seat national assembly. A month later parliament approved his new coalition government of Liberals, Christian Democrats and the 'associated list' of four left-wing parties dominated by reform communists. This is the government now ruling Slovenia. 'The main goal of our coalition is to create stable government for the next four years and carry out our programme of modernisation,' Mr Drnovsek says. Ideologically, the coalition would be more consistent if limited to the Liberals and the Christian Democrats with their more rurally-orientated, conservative support. 'But this is a government which will have to do unpopular things, like reduce real incomes and restrain government spending. There will be strong pressures on the government and we decided to bring in the left-wing parties, with their links to the unions, to broaden our majority.' At present, party loyalty and discipline are unreliable 'but I hope that in the course of this parliament there will be a normalisation of the political scene,' he says. 'My party stands for western rules in both the economy and in politics. In future, our base will be in the middle class. I just hope that will prove to be enough,' he adds. The government's critics in the 'associated list' parties accuse it of being slow to build a fair taxation system and complain about the emergence of a flashy 'new rich' class. Most have got rich quick through trading, some of it shady and linked to the war, some of it organised through the exploitation of old nomenklatura links with the former regime, says Mr Vojko Venisnkik, a reform communist. The left-wing parties voice similar complaints about privatisation, which is slow to get off the ground, and remains largely in the hands of the old 'self-management' factory managers. At the other end of the spectrum, rising unemployment and the erosion of workers' 'historic social rights' have led to a fall in real incomes among the poor who are being wooed from left and right. Right-wing nationalists, such as Mr Zmago Zelencic of the Slovenian National Party, accuse refugees of taking jobs and bread from the mouths of native Slovenes, but the party has now split into two factions and remains on the sidelines of politics. More jobs will be lost in such sectors as railways, steel and energy which badly need new management and an end to overmanning if they are to become competitive. The private sector is not yet vigorous enough to take up the slack and privatisation, initially, will lead to further job losses. The problems facing the government are likely to get worse before getting better. But they appear to be manageable in this small, beautiful country close to European markets. Among Slovenia's plus points can be counted a strong currency, a tradition of skilled labour, a competent team of economic reformers in the key ministries and institutions - and a political class with modest leaders and realistic aims.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Hindu militants start to build Ayodhya temple: The start of construction is in defiance of an assurance to central government A ROW erupted in the Indian parliament yesterday after Hindu militants on Thursday openly defied a court order and began construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a disputed 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya. Five thousand Hindu activists from the militant right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) poured into the dusty town near Lucknow with truckloads of gravel and sand, and three concrete mixers as prominent Hindu leaders performed the ritual of pouring gravel on the foundation stone, laid almost three years ago. The Hindus want to build a temple on the site because they say the Hindu god Lord Ram was born there. The symbolic start of the temple construction was in open defiance of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s assurance to the central government that it would respect the verdict of the courts. The VHP is a radical wing of the BJP. A court order forbids the construction or demolition of any permanent structure on the disputed site. While Hindu activists have not dared to invade the barbed wire fencing around the ancient Babri mosque, they have demolished other smaller structures on the site. The move, which is seen as politically expedient rather than religiously motivated, has escalated tension between Hindus and Moslems in northern India. The BJP which wrested power in Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, a year ago, on the promise that they would build the Hindu temple, against all odds, has been unable to contain the enthusiasm that it whipped up on the temple issue two years ago. Mr SB Chavan, the Indian home minister has summoned Mr Kalyan Singh,the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to New Delhi, to ask for an explanation. Mr Singh, who has been under tremendous pressure to deliver on his main electoral promise to build the temple, has allowed the commencement of the construction to appease the militant wing of his party.</p>

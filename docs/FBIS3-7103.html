			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Won Chol-hui was elected chairman of the National  Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) for a four-year term  yesterday.    Won, 56, took over the chairmanship of the NACF by earning  875 of the 1,386 votes cast directly by regional cooperatives  heads at the NACF auditorium.    Won, an executive vice president of the NACF, competed with  two other candidates, Chong Ki-su and Chong Tae-kun, who  garnered 162 and 345 votes, respectively.    The new NACF head assumes the chairmanship today as the  second NACF to be selected chosen directly by federation  deputies.    Won succeeds Han Ho-son, who is now under arrest on charges  of embezzlement. Han resigned from the post last Saturday.    "I will push ahead with drastic reforms to transform the  NACF  into a "genuine" body which will serve farmers and will develop  new projects," the new chairman said in a news conference  shortly after the election.</p>

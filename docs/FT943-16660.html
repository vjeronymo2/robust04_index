			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Rail union leaders set to call for further negotiations The leaders of RMT, Britain's main rail union, are today likely to call for a resumption in negotiations to resolve the signalling staff dispute that has cost Railtrack Pounds 30m in lost revenue through three one-day strikes. The union's executive of 21 is likely to announce plans for further 24-hour stoppages after its meeting this afternoon. It will also discuss calls for an escalation of the dispute through longer stoppages. Railtrack, the state-owned company in charge of the network's infrastructure, says the men  - traditionally a moderate group  - want a settlement and not further stoppages. But some union officials fear the company's 'hearts and minds' campaign to convince the signalling staff to accept its three-stage productivity deal might harden attitudes. The union's rejection of the deal as it stands may be reinforced by confirmation tomorrow that British Rail has substantially reduced its operating deficit to about Pounds 100m for last year, down from an operating loss of Pounds 167m in the year before. Both sides made clear last night that they would like to resume negotiations as soon as possible. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, and Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, are to give evidence tomorrow before the House of Commons employment committee. They are expected to use the opportunity to emphasise their desire to settle what has turned into an intractable and complex dispute. However, further negotiations are likely to come too late to prevent this Wednesday's 24-hour strike, the fourth in as many weeks. In spite of outward signs of deadlock, RMT officials and Railtrack hinted yesterday that the gap between them might not be as unbridgeable as it has looked for the past four weeks. BR is also expected to report that it spent an estimated Pounds 100m in the past financial year in preparing for the privatisation of the railway network, nearly double its previous estimate. The total cost of privatising the railways is believed to have risen to more than Pounds 600m. The dramatic improvement in BR's business performance is mainly due to a 7 per cent cut in railway operating costs. A union official said yesterday it would have cost Railtrack Pounds 5m to meet the RMT's 11 per cent interim pay demand for signalling staff. A spokesman said the RMT wanted negotiations to focus upon possible improvements to Railtrack's offer. Politics obstructs line to peace in signals dispute, Page 7 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

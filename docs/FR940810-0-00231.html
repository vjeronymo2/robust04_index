			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Cutting, abrading or breaking the material shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to result in asbestos fiber release are not feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Asbestos-containing material removed, shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately bagged or wrapped, or kept wetted until transferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a closed receptacle, no later than the end of the work shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Alternative Work Practices and Controls. Instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the work practices and controls listed in paragraphs (g)(8) (i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through (v) of this section, the employer may use different or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified engineering and work practice controls if the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions are complied with.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The employer shall demonstrate by data representing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee exposure during the use of such method under conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used, that employee exposure will not exceed the PELs under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any anticipated circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) A qualified person shall evaluate the work area, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected work practices and the engineering controls, and shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify in writing, that the different or modified controls are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PELs under all expected conditions of use and that the method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the requirements of this standard. The evaluation shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include and be based on data representing employee exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the use of such method under conditions which closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current job, and by employees whose training and experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos work. Class III asbestos work shall be conducted using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering and work practice controls which minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to employees performing the asbestos work and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bystander employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The work shall be performed using wet methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To the extent feasible, the work shall be performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using local exhaust ventilation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Where the disturbance involves drilling, cutting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abrading, sanding, chipping, breaking, or sawing of thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system insulation or surfacing material, the employer shall use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermeable dropcloths and shall isolate the operation using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mini-enclosures or glove bag systems pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Where the employer does not demonstrate by a negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure assessment performed in compliance with paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)(4)(iii) of this section that the PELs will not be exceeded,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or where monitoring results show exceedances of a PEL, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall contain the area using impermeable dropcloths and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plastic barriers or their equivalent, or shall isolate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation using mini-enclosure or glove bag systems pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (g)(5) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Employees performing Class III jobs which involve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbance of TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM or where the employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not demonstrate by a ``negative exposure assessment'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PELs will not be exceeded or where monitoring results show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceedances of the PEL, shall wear respirators which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected, used and fitted pursuant to provisions of paragraph (h)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Class IV asbestos work. Class IV asbestos jobs shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be conducted by employees trained pursuant to the asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awareness training program set out in paragraph (k)(8) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. In addition, all Class IV jobs shall be conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity with the requirements set out in paragraph (g)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, mandating wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and prompt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean up of debris containing ACM or PACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Employees cleaning up debris and waste in a regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area where respirators are required shall wear respirators which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are selected, used and fitted pursuant to provisions of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Employers of employees cleaning up waste and debris in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an area where friable TSI or surfacing ACM/PACM is accessible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall assume that such waste and debris contain asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair and service. During automotive brake and clutch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce employee exposure to materials containing asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low pressure/wet cleaning method, which meets the detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements set out in Appendix L to this section. The employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may also comply using an equivalent method which follows written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures which the employer demonstrates can achieve results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to Method A. For facilities in which no more than 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pair of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaired, or assembled per week, the method set for in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [D] of Appendix L to this section may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer may also comply by using an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method which follows written procedures, which the employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates can achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two ``preferred methods.'' Such demonstration must include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring data conducted under workplace conditions closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resembling the process, type of asbestos containing materials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control method, work practices and environmental conditions which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equivalent method will be used, or objective data, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document that under all reasonably foreseeable conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake and clutch repair applications, the method results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures which are equivalent to the methods set out in Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Respiratory protection <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The employer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide respirators, and ensure that they are used, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by this section. Respirators shall be used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following circumstances:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) During all Class I asbestos jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

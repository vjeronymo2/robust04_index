			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Rethinking British defence MR MALCOLM Rifkind, the British defence secretary, sought to pre-empt yesterday's report from the House of Commons select committee by rescinding some planned cuts in the country's armed forces - at a cost of 'only' Pounds 80m or one-third of 1 per cent of the defence budget. On Monday Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, announced a sweeping review of public expenditure in general, but appeared to exempt defence as a principal target. Yesterday the select committee duly reported, seeking even more concessions than Mr Rifkind had already offered. It may be concluded from these events that Britain is still far from a political consensus about the scale of its defence spending in a post-imperial world. The question that has haunted the debate for decades continues to hover. Is there a case for economically battered Britain to outspend its richer European neighbours, devoting 4 per cent of its economic output to defence, compared with 3.4 per cent for France and only 2.2 per cent for Germany? There are many signs that old lessons have not been learnt. In 1990 the statement Options for Change by the then defence secretary, Mr Tom King, suggested substantial reductions in force levels as a result of the end of the cold war, though even then the cuts in costs did not match the proposed cuts in manpower. With these cuts still not fully implemented, there is already talk of overstretch, which is merely the current term for describing the old problem of too few resources to match too many commitments. The select committee calls the overstretch 'chronic' and wants all planned cuts in ground forces to be stopped. Top tables The motives behind such thinking too often stem from a nostalgia for a country that was more powerful and relatively richer than it is today. More insidiously, attempts to keep up with defence spending spring from a desire to impress the Americans and to maintain a place at top tables. Almost invariably, however, the dilemma returns: Britain tries to do too much and, in the context of the latest public spending crisis, has to cut back. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has done something to develop the context for an alternative view. In a recent speech at Chatham House, he noted the trend towards international military intervention, whether of the peacekeeping or peacemaking variety, and envisaged for Britain a worthy rather than a leading role. His theme was that Britain cannot do everything towards which it feels morally or politically impelled. Burden-sharing Mr Hurd's analysis, however, stopped short of suggesting solutions. If Britain is to do less, who is to do more? In Europe, Germany? In Asia, Japan? If there is to be more burden-sharing, by what process is that burden to be shared: by ad hoc contributions of the kind which financed the war against Saddam Hussein, or via the United Nations, which is already bedevilled by the failures of some members to pay their dues? Nor is this a complete list of the awkward questions which lie ahead. If Britain is to cede more international defence activity to others, how long can it maintain its position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council? If it is seriously to consider relinquishing that seat, what price could it or should it seek in return? And within the European Community, how can a potential British desire for more burden-sharing be made to fit with its anxiety about more integrated EC defence structures? As the world seeks answers to these complex questions, Britain has much to offer. Its armed forces have a deserved reputation for professionalism. Its relationship with the sole superpower, the US, is special. Britain can do much to help modernise Nato, develop the Western European Union and cement bilateral links with France. It can also play a worthy part in international peacekeeping. But it cannot evade larger questions about the resources of its own economy or shifts in relative global economic and political standing. Mr Rifkind's concessions will comfort those who prefer old glories to harsher truths.</p>

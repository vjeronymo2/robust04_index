			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Too much to expect Those who lament the short-termism of British industry will find plenty of supporting evidence in the CBI's survey on manufacturers' investment appraisal, published today. Despite an unusually sunny climate for investment, many UK companies are acting as if little has changed. The survey does point to serious flaws in many companies' criteria for making investments. But UK businessmen would be short-termist indeed if they were already betting their futures on the end of 'boom and bust'. In spite of low inflation rates and the worldwide fall in the cost of capital, the CBI's study found that most of the companies surveyed had not lowered their required rates of return on new investments. Indeed, many still aim for nominal or real rates of over 20 per cent, or impose on projects a pay-back period of two to three years. Findings such as these add plausibility to the oft-voiced concern that UK companies are missing a golden chance to invest in higher capacity. Nevertheless, a fair critique must distinguish between two different 'failings'. The first is using inefficient methods to decide on investments, an undesirable trait in any economic climate. The second is lacking faith in the government's triumphant long-term economic predictions. Investment has been slower to pick up in the current recovery than in the early 1980s, while capital expenditure by manufacturing companies is expected to improve only modestly in 1994. Economy-wide, investment fell less as a proportion of national output during the recession than was true in previous downturns. For all that, the subdued state of capital outlays in manufacturing is a worry. Are high hurdle rates to blame? Hurdle of choice Interpreting the 'required rates of return' which companies claim to employ is nearly as perilous as setting them in the first place. In the survey, the CBI makes a fair stab at determining each respondent's hurdle of choice: whether it is measured in real or nominal terms, for example, or before or after tax. Judged by the study's findings, many companies have been slow to respond to recent events, but a more striking feature of the responses is just how high many of the hurdles were to begin with. If both real and nominal required returns started at over 20 per cent for many companies, it would have taken large changes in inflation or the real cost of capital to make a significant dent. Wide variation The sheer magnitude of hurdles such as this, taken with the wide variation in the companies' replies, indicates that something else is going on. A sizeable minority of companies surveyed is using rates very close to current estimates of the true, risk-adjusted, return on capital. These are likely to be companies with an established habit of closely relating their internal rate of return to current financial market conditions. Those companies citing the much higher required rates of return may be trapped in inhospitable local credit markets. But they could also be using the rates to reflect a wider range of factors. A vaguely defined conception of the risk involved, for example, or to guard against over-optimism on the part of project planners. Obviously, these are legitimate issues to consider. But using the required rate of return ends up penalising long-term investments. If this is what lies behind some of the high hurdles, the companies concerned would be better off adopting other safeguards, which would treat projects with different time horizons more equitably. Another explanation is that the penalty on investments which take longer to pay off is intentional. Accustomed to the ups and downs of the traditional UK business cycle, managers demand that new capacity pay off in two to three years because that is roughly how long they think it will be before things turn sour. Over time, greater macro-economic stability may change matters. On its own, a low inflation rate can have only a limited direct effect on required rates of return: none at all, if a real rate is used. There would be a much bigger impact if inflation were to remain stable over time, since that would imply fewer occasions for government to put on the brakes. By all accounts, companies have yet to see things so favourably. Given their long experience of the opposite, this is not surprising.</p>

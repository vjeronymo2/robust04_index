			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: N Ireland water sell-off delayed THE GOVERNMENT has angered Scottish MPs and fuelled suspicions that it is deliberately wooing Northern Ireland MPs by shelving until after the next general election the privatisation of Northern Ireland water. Labour and the Scottish Nationalist party seized on the decision to demand that the controversial plan for the privatisation of Scottish water also be postponed - a call rebuffed by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. Northern Ireland water privatisation was promised in the government's election manifesto. But Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, told MPs late on Tuesday that for 'technical reasons' the sell-off had to be postponed. Ministers said yesterday that a report by consultants Touche Ross had concluded that the time needed for reforming water charges and to collate data on consumer and environmental issues ruled out privatisation before the next election. The NIO favours privatisation via flotation rather than a trade sale. Ministers insisted that the commitment to privatisation remained. The delay will help Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restart political talks on province's future following local elections on May 19. Unionist and nationalist parties are opposed to water privatisation and welcomed the move. 'We hope it will be the harbinger of things to come,' said one Ulster Unionist MP who believed the delay was intended to help win his party's support for political talks. In the past year the government has looked to Unionist MPs to help avert Commons defeats on coal and, to a lesser extent, on Maastricht. The decision will not have been hard for Northern Ireland ministers who are not among the most enthusiastic supporters of privatisation. Reform of water charges is expected to lead to controversy, with many of the less well-off households affected being in nationalist communities. Scottish water privatisation has been linked by the government to restructuring of Scottish local authorities. Mr Lang said: 'The circumstances in Scotland are different from those in Northern Ireland. Our purpose - and we have reached no decision yet - is to achieve the best solution for Scottish circumstances.'</p>

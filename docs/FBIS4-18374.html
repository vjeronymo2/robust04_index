			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marco Ansaldo: "The Greek Minister Speaks of </F> `Fascist Danger'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- Theodhoros Pangalos struck again. The  Greek European affairs minister, notorious for his opinions  which are often outspoken to the point of being brutal, not  content with the violent polemic which broke out two days ago  with Italy over some scathing remarks of his on the Right's  electoral success, again returned to the attack. Despite the  official note which [Foreign Minister] Beniamino Andreatta had  immediately addressed to the minister's office, requesting him  to maintain "a respectful and reserved attitude toward internal  developments in Italy," yesterday Pangalos again expressed his  "concern" at the outcome of the Italian elections and the  possibility of "a fascist party joining the government."    "There is nothing wrong in the fact that a member of the  European Union takes an interest in the matter," he explained in  Athens, after meeting with the Spanish European Community  affairs undersecretary. "We have the situation in Italy very  much at heart, and it is in our interest to see a democratic  government in Italy. All our parties have condemned fascism, and  the involvement of a fascist party in the government worries  us," he added. "Clearly, the instability of Italian politics  may create problems. We hope," he went on to say, "that Italy  will have a democratic government, guided by the European ideal"  and capable of "making an important contribution to the Union."  Finally, he concluded his latest statement by asserting that  the Greek political community, which recently experienced a  military dictatorship, "condemns fascism and neofascism." The  Greek comments were considered inappropriate in diplomatic  circles, considering also that the Athens government currently  holds the European Community's presidency.    Pangalos, however, wished to minimize Andreatta's firm  intervention. It was a "friendly action," he explained,  "motivated more by his concern over internal developments than  by concern over my statements."    However, according to some sources at the Farnesina [Foreign  Ministry], Pangalos is now trying to tone down the meaning of  the comments he made on Wednesday [27 March], and, in any case,  "Andreatta's intervention was firm, and there is no need now for  further clarification." Following instructions from the Italian  foreign minister, yesterday Italian Ambassador to Greece  Giovanni Dominedo addressed a note of censure (in diplomacy,  this is somewhat less than an official protest) to the Greek  Government.    [Radical leader] Marco Pannella also made a statement  yesterday concerning the polemic: "Given that the Greek  European affairs minister insists on commenting on Italian  political problems (which, in itself, is not necessarily a bad  thing), including arbitrary ideological judgments on this or  that `fascist' danger or shame which could result from the new  political situation in Italy, Athens should also bear in mind  that the key question that must be judged, in Europe and for  Europe, is that of the European or non-European nature of the  policies pursued by the various countries and the Community's  various political forces." According to Pannella, "if Italy and  Europe were to compare the policies of the Greek Left with those  of the Italian Right, they would not hesitate to consider the  Italian Right as the most genuinely European and  Community-oriented of the two."

The proportion  of those who were generally satisfied with the speech exceeded  the proportion of dissatisfied. [passage omitted]    One-third of those interviewed felt that the Patten's speech  should be helpful to the Sino-British talks later, and only  one-fifth of the sample felt that it would not help these talks  later.    Three-tenths of those interviewed considered that Britain  had  made some concessions under pressure from the PRC, but there was  also one-quarter of the sample who did not feel that concessions  had been made.    One of the major concession Britain can make would be  reducing the number of persons elected on a functionally  differentiated basis. Close to four-tenths of the respondents  felt that Patten should not make such a concession, but there  was also one-quarter who felt that he should so concede.    As for Patten's insistence that there should be objective  criteria for the through train issue, more than one-half of  those interviewed expressed concurrence.    But, with regard to the fact that Patten did not spell out  his political reform proposals in this policy speech, a majority  of those interviewed were indifferent, and only around one-third  of the sample expressed dissatisfaction over this point.    The following are the responses to the questions by the Hong  Kong residents interviewed in the sample.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik </F> by Stanislav Bartnikas under the "Reporting the Details" rubric;  date and place not given: "It Was Recommended That I Send  Khasbulatov and Rutskoy to the Firing Squad. Latest Revelations  by Former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik"]    [Text] [Bartnikas] Did anyone put pressure on you during  the discussion of the question of the general prosecutor in the  Federation Council?    [Kazannik] I think that everyone had already realized that  it was impossible to put any pressure on me. To buy me off or  offer me positions. But when I was general prosecutor, they did  try. For instance, they said: So you have got yourself an  apartment; why waste your time, let us furnish it for you for  free. I refused. But in the present case no one pressurized  me. On the other hand, I know that the president's  administration worked at the highest level with many deputies  and tried to persuade them to vote only for the dismissal of  Kazannik. But I wish it to be noted that deputies are more  law-abiding than the president and his team. And in the vote  two motives prevailed -- the purely legal, and the moral.    [Bartnikas] Yes, but after all, the question of the general  prosecutor was by no means closed by your dismissal....    [Kazannik] Agreed, a far from straightforward situation will  arise. The point is that there is no provision for an acting  general prosecutor either in the Constitution or in the Law on  the General Prosecutor. Only the general prosecutor's deputies  can perform his duties in his absence, and only in accordance  with the general prosecutor's own directives. An outsider  simply cannot do this. But this is evidently no obstacle for  the president, although difficult legal problems arise here.  For instance, supposing it is necessary to extend a period of  detention in custody to 18 months -- that is the exclusive  prerogative of the general prosecutor. Suppose that Ilyushenko  extends this term; then any lawyer will state that it is  illegal. And the accused will be immediately released from the  detention center.    [Bartnikas] Do you think that the disputes over the general  prosecutor are linked primarily with a desire on the part of the  president's team to have a puppet Prosecutor's Office, or is it  simply a matter of personal dislike?    [Kazannik] I think that they have one wish -- to be able to  telephone the Prosecutor's Office and say: Don't do this or  that. And I am sure that, had Ilyushenko been general prosecutor  during the amnesty period, he would have released no one. After  all, he obeys not only Yeltsin's orders, but even Kozhakov's  (chief of the Russian Federation president's security service --  editor's note). And after all, the president's entourage put  very strong pressure on us. For example, immediately following  the October events, the Prosecutor's Office received from the  president's administration instructions on how the investigation  should be conducted. These instructions ran more or less as  follows. No political trials should be conducted. No  investigation team should be set up, but rather just five or six  investigators should be assigned. The October events should be  investigated within three to four days, everyone should be  charged under Articles 102 and 17 -- that is to say for  complicity to murder -- and the cases should be handed over to  the military collegium for criminal affairs. The trial should  last two to three days, and everyone should be sentenced to the  death penalty. These documents were unsigned. But imagine what  another prosecutor would have done in my position who might have  said: It must be done; how simple everything is. I did not  allow this.    [Bartnikas] Are you not sorry to leave your post?    [Kazannik] Yes, I leave with regret. The post is not the  point, nor are the privileges. I thought that I would be able  to deal a serious blow to crime, including organized crime. But  the latter cannot exist without corruption of the state  apparatus. After all, how come that people in the MVD [Ministry  of Internal Affairs] say: We know the location of around 15,000  bands, but we do not possess more detailed information. I am  curious to know how it can be that people know the ringleaders  by sight, they know their aliases and so forth, but they are  still at large. And therefore I planned to check how the law on  operational investigations activity is observed in all regions.  I think that we would have determined why the MVD does not have  the relevant information or does not want to have it. In  addition, I wanted to reform the General Prosecutor's Office --  I wanted to reduce the central apparatus by one-half; after all,  we have many departments where people are worn out through  having nothing to do. However, I think that it would not have  been possible to have remained an honest prosecutor.    [Bartnikas] And one last question -- have you handed in your  credentials?    [Kazannik] Not yet. Incidentally, Acting General Prosecutor  Ilyushenko fired me as long ago as 15 March -- either he has a  poor grasp of legislation, or he was fulfilling an order from  the Kremlin. In the near future I will take all my documents  from the Prosecutor's Office, but I will be obliged to hand over  the Russian general prosecutor's credentials.</p>

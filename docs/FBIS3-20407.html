A CSCE statement published here urged Belgrade to permit it  to carry out "long-term" missions, banned by rump Yugoslavia  last year.    The CSCE mentioned arbitrary arrests and detentions, police  brutality and attempts to create ethnically cleansed zones in  the rump federation of Serbia and Montenegro.    In July, Belgrade banned long-term CSCE missions to Sandzak,  the majority Albanian province Kosovo and the province of  Vojvodina, where there is a substantial population of ethnic  Hungarians.    The missions' aim was to check minority rights were being  respected and help prevent an extension of the war in  ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

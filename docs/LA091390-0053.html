			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIA PACT STIRS CALLS FOR CEASE-FIRE  </P> <P> Cambodian rebel and government leaders, following up on their acceptance of a  United Nations peace plan, on Wednesday called for a voluntary cease-fire and  began winding down radio propaganda.  </P> <P> Premier Hun Sen, who arrived in Bangkok Wednesday, said that agreeing to the  plan was a good start but that further steps were needed. In a government  broadcast, he repeated his call for a cease-fire and said a Supreme National  Council, part of the peace pact, should be convened promptly.  </P> <P> He again urged a cease-fire before leaving for Jakarta, Indonesia, where, on  Monday, the four Cambodian groups who have waged a civil war for more than a  decade agreed to the U.N. terms.  </P> <P> "We have been able to construct a new boat in which all of us could sail, that  is the Supreme National Council," Hun Sen said at the airport.  </P> <P> "The point is that now we have the boat, the passengers are on, but we have not  yet put the engine on. We need to go very fast. That is why I have come here."  </P> <P> Prince Norodom Ranariddh, commander of one of three resistance factions and the  son of former Cambodian leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, made similar  proposals.  </P> <P> "Even before a formal agreement is reached, all Cambodians, if they really want  peace, should create a peaceful, safe environment for implementation of a peace  agreement," he told reporters here. "I am very favorable for a self-restraint  cease-fire."  </P> <P> The peace pact, meanwhile, was endorsed by both China, which has backed the  hard-line Communist Khmer Rouge rebels, and Vietnam, which supports the  Cambodian government. China also said it was ready for the first time to  establish contact with the Cambodian government.  </P> <P> Ranariddh quoted Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, as saying he would  prefer to wait for that conference before agreeing to a cease-fire, but that an  interim cease-fire "may be" possible.  </P> <P> The accord is designed to establish a transition administration so that  hostilities can end and free elections can be held. It sets up a four-party  Supreme National Council and commits the factions to a major U.N. role in the  interim government.  </P> <P> In talks late Wednesday with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan, Hun Sen  proposed that the first council meeting take place at the former Cambodian  embassy in Bangkok on Monday, Thai spokesman Suvit Yodmanee told reporters.  </P> <P> Suvit quoted Hun Sen as saying the meeting should elect a chairman and decide  who should represent Cambodia at the U.N. General Assembly meeting later this  month.  </P> <P> Although a cease-fire is part of the U.N. plan, the pact is not expected to be  effective until it is ratified in an international conference that is not  expected to be convened before November.  </P></p>

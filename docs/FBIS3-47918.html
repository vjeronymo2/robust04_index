In his New Year address, the great leader presented  the militant slogan our people should uphold.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must  effect a new upturn in socialist construction by overcoming  difficulties and by displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude more highly.    With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude,  let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This is  the call of our party, as well as the militant slogan our people  must uphold today.    Self-reliance and fortitude mean a resolute revolutionary  position to carry out endlessly the revolution and construction  by our own might, as well as an indomitable spirit of struggle  to adhere to the revolutionary banner in defiance of any  difficulties and obstacles.    The display of the dignity and honor of the country and  nation depends on self-reliance and fortitude. Even the way to  build the most consolidated and vital socialism depends on  self-reliance and fortitude.    With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude,  let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This  slogan is the militant one that our people must uphold today  because we can overcome various challenges and obstructive  maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries and resolutely  safeguard and adhere to socialism of our own style only if we  uphold it.    As soon as socialism collapsed in various countries  throughout the world, the imperialists and reactionaries  strengthened their unprecedented offensives in all fields --  political, economic, military, and diplomatic -- to isolate,  suffocate [chilsik], and crush [apsal] our Republic, which is  advancing under the socialist banner.    Because of the enemies' anti-Republic and antisocialist  maneuvers, the situation in our country have been aggravated and  complicated. Also, a great number of obstacles have been  created on the road ahead of us.    For all people to accelerate on the grand socialist march  with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude  will be a firm guarantee in smashing challenges by the  imperialists and reactionaries and in resolutely safeguarding  and adhering to socialism of our own style.    Socialism of our own style is the chuche socialism built by  our people's own might under the wise leadership of the party  and the leader [suryong]. This means that we must solve all  problems in the socialist construction by our own might and from  the chuche stance in any difficult conditions.    The people, who highly display the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, can keep their dignity and honor  under any adversity, but the people, who fail to display it,  will easily give in to the difficulties and trials and be doomed  to ruin.    Even last year, the imperialists and reactionaries applied  pressure on various fields to crush [apsal] our Republic.    We accelerated the socialist general march, however, by  highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle and by rising as one with firm determination,  not yielding to any maneuver, under the wise leadership of the  party and the leader. Thus, we defended the supreme interest of  the nation and people and safeguarded and protected our-style  socialism.    Experience shows that when we vigorously carry out the  socialist general march by displaying the revolutionary spirit  of self-reliance and arduous struggle, we can resolutely crush  various challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists  and reactionaries, can staunchly defend and protect our-style  socialism, and can firmly safeguard dignity and honor of the  nation.    "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist general march  with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle" -- this is a militant slogan that our people should  uphold. Only when we uphold this slogan, can we thoroughly  implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy and  further glorify our-style socialism.    In his New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song  put forward as a strategic task the implementation of  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy  during the three-year adjustment period by giving priority to  the coal industry, the electricity industry, and railway  transport -- the precedence domains in the national economy --  and continuous development of the metal industry.    We will thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary  economic strategy during the adjustment period of socialist  economic construction, and thus will firmly consolidate the  foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy. We will more  satisfactorily ensure the people's living standard in compliance  with the demand of socialism and will hold a new offensive  position to occupy the greater height of socialism.    Displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle by our people is an important demand for  implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy.    This year we should continuously adhere to the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy.  This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of  the rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the struggle to  accomplish the historic task of the rural thesis and should  effect a new turn in the development of rural economy. Thus, we  should attain without fail the lofty target of grain production  put forward by the party.    At the same time, by vigorously accelerating the light  industry revolution, we should effect great innovations in the  production of consumer goods and should develop external trade  in compliance with changing circumstances.    For us to develop agriculture and light industry and to  vigorously accelerate the nation's overall economic  construction, we should direct our strength to the coal,  electricity, and metal industry, and should more satisfactorily  establish railway transport.    The tasks for implementing the party's revolutionary  economic  strategy are indeed gigantic. The road for successfully carrying  out these grave tasks is to more highly display the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    Only when we wage the struggle to carry out our party's  revolutionary economic strategy based on the revolutionary  position to rely on our own strength, technology, and natural  resources, can we successfully accelerate socialist  construction. This proves that when we advance by highly  upholding the slogan on accelerating the socialist general march  with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle, we can further glorify our-style socialism by  thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic  strategy.    What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge  in  socialist construction under the revolutionary banner of  self-reliance is for all party members and working people to  fight staunchly with the spirit of adding the speed of the  nineties to Chollima.    All party members and workers should advance and advance  again and should struggle and struggle again with the tenacious  Chollima spirit cherished by the working class in Kangson, which  produced 120,000 tons of steel billet from the blooming mill  with only a 60,000-ton capacity when everything was short and  difficult, and with the militant spirit with which they  manufactured modern machinery with their own strength through  arduous struggle.    For all people to vigorously accelerate the socialist  general  march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle, we should, above all, have firm resolution and  determination to safeguard to the last and glorify the socialist  banner with our own strength by trusting this strength.    Our people will not abandon our independent position even if  someone else applies pressure on us, nor will we rely on others  in the face of difficulty.    Our people's will to nurture the socialist ideal on this  land  with our own strength, wisdom, and natural resources will not  change today and in the future. All party members and working  people should more firmly assume the thoroughgoing position to  carry to accomplishment the chuche socialist cause to the end  with our own strength, and should vigorously accelerate the  socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and arduous struggle.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The need for fair dealing - Diary of a Private Investor / New laws should get wider publicity The London Stock Exchange declared recently that it was 'committed to investor protection and the need to ensure fair dealing on its markets for all'. The statement came in a consultation document on 'orderly markets: dealings ahead of the disclosure of price-sensitive information'. Yet, while the sentiments are fine, thousands of private investors are being kept in suspense. The exchange revealed that, in the previous 12 months, there had been 7,000 'price jump alerts' where unusual upward movements in share prices had prompted investigations, although only 130 cases had failed to result in a satisfactory conclusion. Where there was not a satisfactory explanation, the exchange said its policy was to investigate further to see if price-sensitive documents had been 'leaked', and to discover if there was any evidence of insider dealing or market manipulation. It would also investigate any unusual falls in a company's share price. During the year, around 70,000 company announcements were made through the exchange, a high proportion of which could be regarded as price-sensitive. The exchange is now considering 'trading halts' - of not more than 24 hours  -in any company's shares where there is strong evidence that price-sensitive information exists but has not been announced officially, and where it appears that the unusual market activity is due to a leak. This seems like a good idea. But the document suggests, also, that trading halts could result in a full suspension in cases where the situation has not been resolved satisfactorily within 24 hours. While a suspension certainly stops anyone else from profiting by buying the shares, it means also that existing investors in the suspended company are, effectively, 'locked in': they cannot sell their shares. Unfortunately, where a company is suspended because of 'bad news' announcements, investors often find themselves stuck with shares that turn out to be worthless when the full state of its finances is revealed. Some people, with access to the company's condition, may well have dumped their shares before the suspension - but the ordinary private investor has been unable to do likewise. He could have to wait months - or years - before he learns the final sad fate of his investment. Indeed, he might never be told directly because some companies which go into receivership have too few assets to pay for a circular to shareholders giving them the bad news. Even where there is no fraudulent activity or insider dealing, shares could be suspended to ensure that no one can benefit from any information of a price-sensitive nature that might emerge. My wife could not sell her 1,000 shares in Dominion International in 1989 when the company announced it was in financial difficulties and asked for its listing to be suspended. The shares proved worthless when the company was put into administration in 1990. Fortunately, we did not invest in Queens Moat Houses, the shares of which have been suspended since the end of March 1993 but there are other companies which, despite being in financial difficulties, have had their shares traded freely right up to when the receivers were called in. Similarly, while some companies will ask for a temporary suspension pending a take-over announcement, others will not. Provided that adequate warnings are given, however, I feel shares should not be suspended. The exchange has suggested that it could issue a 'new market alert' and draw attention to any unusual price movements in a company's shares. This is an excellent idea, as is the suggestion that the exchange should have the power to require member firms to reverse share deals where the exchange has reason to believe they were carried out with the benefits of unpublished price-sensitive information. In the past, the exchange's investigations have sometimes run into the brick wall of an offshore nominee which refuses to disclose its true ownership. But new legislation to prevent money laundering came into effect on April 1. It requires financial services businesses (including stockbrokers) to have anti-money laundering procedures. These include verifying the identity of the people on whose behalf a transaction is to be carried out. Failure to introduce these procedures can result in imprisonment for up to two years and a substantial fine. But I feel there has not been enough publicity about these new rules, especially as even failure to report suspicions of money-laundering to the National Criminal Intelligence Service can result in imprisonment for up to five years and a hefty fine. Perhaps insider dealing and the need for suspension might be reduced if the NCIS embarked upon a major publicity campaign to alert people to the new legislation.</p>

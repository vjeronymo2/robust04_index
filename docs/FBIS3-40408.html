			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Fallout of the Rafale Program Delay"; </F> first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL  introduction]    [Text] A parliamentary report estimates that the six-month  delay in the Rafale program will cost an additional 700 million  French francs [Fr] and over 1,000 jobs at Dassault, SNECMA, and  Thomson-CSF.    Delaying a weapons program is always a costly move. The  report compiled by Bouches-du-Rhone deputy Olivier Darrason and  presented on behalf of the National Defense Committee in the  Assembly offers fresh evidence of the fact. The Bouches-du-Rhone  deputy, who is the reporter for the "Air" portion of the budget,  calculated the cost of the government's decision to slow down  the Rafale program at an additional Fr700 million. Most  important, 1,170 to 1,420 highly-skilled jobs will be lost.    The official reason for the six-month delay are budget  decisions that will hold up the aircraft carrier, thus setting  back the start-of-service date of the "Navy" and consequently  the "Air" Rafale. The reporter, who considers Rafale primarily a  replacement for Crusaders on the Foch, and not the  Charles-de-Gaulle, challenges that pretext. The deputy believes  the real reason is budget problems.    Whatever the true cause, Olivier Darrason believes the  financial and industrial costs will be high. He estimates the  delay will raise the price tag of the program by Fr700  million--Fr400 million for development and Fr300 million for  manufacture. "Thus, although we will save Fr1,535 million on the  1994 budget, final savings will reportedly be only Fr800  million, or about half," he calculates.    But it is primarily the industrial consequences that are  likely to cut deepest. Indeed, contrary to conventional wisdom,  the projected budget delay cannot be absorbed solely by freezing  new hiring, since program teams have already been sized to meet  the deadlines in effect before the announced holdup. As a  consequence, the deputy thinks job losses are unavoidable. To  estimate them, he used a pre-study conducted last July by the  ACE-International consortium on the consequences of potential  lags. Although manufacturers are not committed to these numbers,  which should be treated with caution, they do bring the picture  into focus.    "For Dassault Aviation and its subcontractors," says the  report, "a six-month delay could cost 400 jobs, most of them  engineer and high-level technician positions." Likewise, another  770 to 1,020 workers would be at risk among all the program's  equipment suppliers: 200 at the enginemaker SNECMA, 450 to 700  for the electronics manufacturers (essentially Thomson-CSF and  Dassault Electronique), and 120 for "C" equipment suppliers such  as Dassault Equipements, ECE, Intertechnique, Labinal,  Messier-Bugatti, Sagem, and Sextant. In all, over a thousand  jobs, most of them in engineering, are at stake. "This is an  unacceptable risk, for it would not only translate into  additional delays and thus greater risks to employment, it would  also mean an irretrievable loss of technological raw material,"  comments Olivier Darrason.    Finally, the setbacks in the Rafale program clearly could  compromise the fighter plane's chances for sales abroad. Between  1996 and 2000 or 2003, Dassault's aircraft will have no serious  rival on the market. The F/A-18E/F, Gripen, and Eurofighter 2000  will still be pending. However, competition after that date will  be fierce. Considering the combat fleet modernization needs that  will then exist, France must make maximum use of the period to  capture those markets. "We should be aware, then," concludes the  report, "that delaying the Rafale means denying it export  markets--a major asset against its rivals."  <H5>  Chart Information </H5>     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |An Estimated Fr188-Billion Program                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Total cost (FrMillions 94|Unit cost (FrMillions 94)|  |                         |)                        |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Development*             |41,257                   |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrialization        |14,781                   |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |95 Rafale C series craft |27,574                   |290                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |139 Rafale B series craft|42,312                   |304                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |86 Rafale M series craft |26,305                   |306                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Spare parts              |34,744                   |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Simulators               |1,130                    |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*Figures in today's francs Caption: During drafting of the never-passed 92-94|  | appropriations bill, the total cost of the Rafale program was estimated at '|  |94 Fr205 billion.                                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN HE NEEDS ASSIST, OREGON STATE IS THERE;  </P> <P> GARY PAYTON'S PERFORMANCE MAKES ST. JOHN'S REGRET TURNING HIM DOWN  </P> <P> The pace is slow in Corvallis, Ore., a college town in the lush Willamette  Valley about 100 miles south of Portland.  </P> <P> Downtown looks like the set from "American Graffiti." Gangs around Corvallis  are the kids who hang out at the local convenience store on weekends and cruise  in their hot rods.  </P> <P> When Gary Payton, a high school basketball phenom, visited on a recruiting trip  to Oregon State in 1986, he was ready to go right back home to Oakland.  </P> <P> A street-wise city boy, Payton felt out of place in Corvallis.  </P> <P> Besides, Payton had dreamed of attending St. John's, where he could bask in the  national limelight. He even made an oral commitment to St. John's after  visiting New York, where he toured Manhattan in a limousine. Lou Carnesecca,  coach at St. John's, closed the deal with Payton's parents.  </P> <P> "He came to our house and gave us a lot of promises," said Payton's father, Al.  "He told us he was going to take care of Gary. I wanted him to go where they  had an older coach who could look after Gary because he'd never been away from  home before, not even for a night."  </P> <P> But Carnesecca reneged after signing another guard, and Payton eventually  signed with Oregon State.  </P> <P> Welcome to big-time college basketball.  </P> <P> "It kind of shocked me that they had set me up like that," Payton said. "They  were running a game."  </P> <P> Carnesecca said: "We made a mistake. We should have signed him. He's a great  player. We really blew it."  </P> <P> But Payton, a 6-foot 3-inch junior, has no regrets.  </P> <P> Payton has emerged as an extraordinary point guard. Some say he's among the  nation's best.  </P> <P> "If he's not the best point guard, he's right up there with whoever is," said  George Raveling, USC basketball coach. "Those who see him on a regular basis  realize he's right up there with B.J. Armstrong (of Iowa) and Sherman Douglas  (of Syracuse). But he's not a player who's fully appreciated nationally."  </P> <P> Payton could have gained a lot of respect by making the 1988 Olympic team. He  was invited to the tryouts but failed a physical because of an irregular  heartbeat.  </P> <P> "That was the weakest excuse for me to go home," Payton said. "I had a chest  cold and told our trainer. I didn't think it was serious, but they took it in a  big way. They put me through all sorts of tests, like the treadmill. And I had  a tingling sensation when I got off."  </P> <P> He underwent further tests in Corvallis, which indicated nothing abnormal.  Payton thought he'd be able to return, but Coach John Thompson wouldn't allow  it.  </P> <P> Not making the Olympic team has given Payton added incentive this season.  </P> <P> "I don't know that it hurt us that he didn't make the team because he still had  a lot of proving to do this season," said Ralph Miller, Oregon State coach.  </P> <P> Payton leads the Beavers in scoring, rebounding, steals, minutes played and  assists going into tonight's game against USC at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Oregon State's career assist leader, with 596, Payton is on a pace that would  break the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record. The mark of 894 is held by  Andre LaFleur, formerly of Northeastern.  </P> <P> A poor shooter in his first 2 seasons, Payton has blossomed as the Pacific 10's  leading scorer with a 22.9-point average. He was obsessed with improving his  range last summer, taking 500 shots a day.  </P> <P> "Payton has really jumped his game up a level, especially offensively," UCLA  Coach Jim Harrick said. "He's stepped up to where he's right up there with the  best guards in America.  </P> <P> "But nothing's more impressive than his shot. He shoots a 3-pointer like it's a  layup. Before, you'd beg him to take it."  </P> <P> Payton has elevated his game to an even higher level in recent weeks.  </P> <P> He scored a career-high 41 points against Washington State 2 weeks ago, putting  himself in elite company. Gail Goodrich is the only other Pac-10 guard who has  scored 41 points or more in a game. The former UCLA star had 42 against  Michigan in the 1965 NCAA final.  </P> <P> In a 69-64 overtime victory at Cal last week, Payton scored all 9 of Oregon  State's points in the extra period. After being held to 4 points in the first  half, Payton finished with 24.  </P> <P> Payton was spurred by the Cal rooting section, which taunted him.  </P> <P> "Gary was having a perfectly miserable game until they tried to discombobulate  him," Miller said. "As far as I'm concerned, they picked on the right player.  They should have learned by now that you don't get on him."  </P> <P> Actually, Payton sometimes goes out of his way to incite opposing fans because  the reaction motivates him.  </P> <P> "He's the one that the other team loves to hate," said Mike Corwin, Oregon  State publicist. "A crowd will always pick him out because he's easy not to  like."  </P> <P> Payton wears his arrogance as a badge of honor on the court, strutting as if he  owns the world.  </P> <P> "He's a cocky little rascal," Miller said. "I've never seen a little guy who  was pretty good that wasn't on the cocky side. As long as it doesn't get out of  hand that's fine."  </P> <P> A master at intimidation, Payton likes to talk to his opponents on the court to  upset them. His icy glare -- "the evil look" -- is a staple. Payton developed  his style at Skyline High, which competes in the rough Oakland Athletic League.  </P> <P> "We went through riots and fights in the OAL," Payton said. "People would try  to punk you out and you had to be tough enough to come back at them. I just  brought my high school with me to college."  </P> <P> The Beavers reflect Payton's style off the court, too.  </P> <P> After big victories, Payton leads the team in a chorus-line dance -- packing  burgers -- the players moving their hands as if they're scooping hamburgers off  a grill.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Oregon State beat USC at Corvallis last month, 64-55. George Raveling, USC  coach, presented Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller a Playboy magazine before the  last game, saying he wanted to distract Miller. Miller sent the magazine back  to Raveling and asked him to autograph it. "My wife would never believe George  gave it to me unless he signed it," Miller said. . . . USC is 7-12 overall and  0-8 in the Pacific 10. Oregon State is 13-4 overall and 6-3 in the conference.  </P></p>

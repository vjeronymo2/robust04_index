			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [`Roundup' by Xia Zhimian] </F>   [Text] Bonn, January 23 (XINHUA) -- China's top lawmaker  Qiao Shi ended a successful eight-day official visit to Germany  today, which is expected to give impetus to the development of  friendly relations between the two countries.    Qiao's was the first visit to Germany by chairman of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, marking a  major event in the history of Sino-German relations.    During his visit, Qiao held separate talks with German  President Richard Von Weizsacker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and  Federal Assembly (parliament) President Rita Suessmuth.    He told German leaders that both China and Germany are  major,  influential nations which have no conflict of interests between  them and share common or similar views on international issues.    The economies of the two countries can be mutually  complementary, and there are broad vistas for the development of  friendly relations, he said.    Over the past three years relations between the two  countries  have developed smoothly, with an exchange of visits by foreign  ministers and other senior officials.    Bilateral relations have entered a new phase of overall  development since Chancellor Kohl visited China last November  and signed a series of agreements on promotion of bilateral  relations and cooperation.    During Kohl's stay in China, Chinese President Jiang Zemin  stressed that the two countries should handle bilateral  relations from a long-term point of view, not only looking to  this century, but the next as well.    In Bonn, Qiao echoed Jiang's call by saying that the two  sides should view and handle bilateral relations from strategic  point of views.    Such positive remarks indicate that the development of Sino-  German relations will gain new momentum.    Bonn was Qiao's first leg on a three-nation European tour,  which will also take him to Switzerland and Austria.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEDROSIAN'S SON FOUND TO HAVE LEUKEMIA; PITCHER LEAVES GIANTS  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants have granted indefinite leave to pitcher Steve  Bedrosian, whose 2 1/2-year-old son, Cody, has leukemia.  </P> <P> "It's up to him and his family when he comes back, however long," Manager Roger  Craig said.  </P> <P> "Steve should take as much time as he needs with his family before coming back,  as those concerns are so much more important than baseball," General Manager Al  Rosen said.  </P> <P> The child suffered from a fever and pain in his right shoulder and on Tuesday a  lump was found on his forearm. He underwent tests Wednesday and Thursday and  his condition was diagnosed as leukemia.  </P> <P> Dr. Will Straw, the team physician, said chemotherapy will probably start  immediately. Bedrosian left the team Tuesday in Atlanta and flew home to the  Bay Area.  </P></p>

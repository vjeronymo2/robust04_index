"No national security issue is more important to us and to  our children than a stable government in Russia dedicated to  democracy," said Perry, who appeared at a confirmation hearing  in the Senate.    Now deputy to outgoing Pentagon chief Les Aspin, Perry said  the Pentagon would strengthen military cooperation with the  Russians and to "encourage the Russian military to be a force  for reform, not an opponent of reform."    Warning that "the road to democracy and stability in Russia  is going to be rocky and twisted," Perry said the U.S. "must be  patient and not be deterred by temporary setbacks" in Russia.    Perry, 66, had been a professor in the School of Engineering  at Stanford University and co-director of Stanford's Center for  International Security and Arms Control before taking the  current post.    In the face of a smaller defense budget, Perry pledged to  "institute innovative management techniques to vigorously foster  acquisition reform and to preserve a necessary industrial base."    According to Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sam  Nunn, there is a 13-billion-dollar gap between the Clinton  1994-1998 spending plan and what is called for under the  recently-concluded military "bottom-up review."    In addition, if inflation factors were taken into account,  the Pentagon may face another 30 billion dollars shortage in the  five-year period.    Besides budgetary problems, Perry also has to cope with such  headaches as homosexuals in the military and women serving in  combat missions.</p>

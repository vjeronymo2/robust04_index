			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: A new culture for a new society - South Africa can at last explore the wider imaginative world beyond apartheid South African art has finally begun to recover from the struggle against apartheid. Apartheid was bad enough, with its virtual refusal to fund any art form which did not mimic Europe; then came the struggle against apartheid, with its ready-made themes and powerful stories. But in 1990, when former President FW de Klerk announced the imminent demise of apartheid, post-struggle torpor began to set in. Artists fed on a constant diet of apartheid atrocities - and heroic responses from the townships - found it hard to kick the habit of political theatre and politicised art. Now they too have been liberated by April's elections; for the first time they are free to explore the wider imaginative world beyond apartheid and racism. It was a rich vein, but years of struggle art have mined it out and the country is well and truly ready for something new. This year's Grahamstown festival - which artists used to boycott because of its Eurocentric bias - marks the beginning of South Africa's artistic recovery from post-apartheid ennui. Run for years by the '1820 Settlers' Foundation' festival art used to be almost exclusively English (not even Afrikaans) and derivative of Europe. This year's festival, too, has its performances of recent London stage hits (Travels with my Aunt and Arcadia), a good Traviata and some fairly standard symphonic fare. But the best works are South African originals - and in the new South Africa, that means anything from township theatre to dramatised fables, African opera to two-hander tragedies of white domestic life. Of the 12 performances I saw in one short weekend at the festival, there was hardly a moment to regret. As a hardened Edinburgh-goer, I am ruthless about abandoning sub-standard performances; at Grahamstown, I stayed to the end of every show. Festival organisers, under pressure to make art reflect the complexion of the new South Africa, say they aim for an equal mix between indigenous works and those originating abroad. 'We don't want to lose the Western component,' festival chairman Professor Alan Crump told the Johannesburg newspaper, the Weekly Mail, recently. 'It is a mistake to go blindly indigenous. If it's a question of baby and bath water, what we want to do is create a swimming pool.' He points out that there is no reason to believe that black South Africans only like African art - far from it. Ballroom dancing has gained enormous popularity in black townships, the Soweto String Quartet has an enthusiastic following - maybe opera will take off as well, he suggests. The challenge for South African art is not just to adapt Western forms to African audiences, but to develop works which draw life from each of the country's many cultures, or from several at once. To judge from the festival offerings, non-verbal art forms such as dance do this most effectively: the Zimbabwe modern dance troupe Tumbuka almost makes a joke of it, alternating Strauss waltz tunes and African drums in stunning routines choreographed for white woman and black man; and the opera Enoch, Prophet of God, performed as a work in progress, uses traditional Xhosa church hymns and the contemporary score of composer Roelof Temmingh to tell the powerful story of the massacre of an Israelite religious sect in 1921. It is a haunting and lovely work which provides hope that high-brow art forms can prove their worth in the new South Africa. The festival does not entirely escape from old-style moralising: for those whose liberal guilt has survived into the post-apartheid era, there is Emakhishini (In the Kitchen), performed by the Domestic Workers Union of South Africa. And there are the predictable dramas of feminism, rape, homosexuality and incest common to all Western festivals (yet even that is welcome, as it shows South Africa at liberty to indulge its obsessions, just like any other nation). What is mostly gone is apartheid angst, and what has mostly replaced it is wit and satire of a high order. Nicholas Ellenbogen's Theatre for Africa performs several short plays based on visual wit and fable which are a delightful break with the past; Themi Venturas' Birth of an African Day is billed as a 'celebration of South African poetry, prose and drama' but is far more entertaining than the blurb would allow; and the Amakhwenkwe Cultural Group (despite its rather literal name) pokes fun at apartheid - and even at Nelson Mandela - in its play Eita Da] Hoezit? The most distressing performance I saw was not really about South Africa at all; a drama of domestic violence, Vanessa Cooke's This is for Keeps, which could be set anywhere that men abuse women, and get away with it. After hours, there is cabaret, jazz, pasta and drink - pretty much along Edinburgh lines, except the wine is better. Numerous craft markets sell not only African crafts, but South Africa's own version of the traditional. And Grahamstown's well-preserved Cape Dutch architecture is a constant pleasure. The only disappointment was the accommodation - festival goers are put up in some of the coldest private homes in the southern hemisphere. But despite the cold, the sun celebrated the arrival of the new South Africa - shining as brightly as on the day Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, and liberated art finally from the struggle. The Grahamstown Festival continues until Sunday.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Proton posts marginal increase to MDollars 135m Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has announced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 1993 of MDollars 135m (USDollars 52.9m), compared with MDollars 130m a year ago. Turnover rose substantially to MDollars 1.36bn, compared with MDollars 908m previously. This was mainly due to high demand for a new model launched on the home market in mid-year. Analysts said that the marginal rise in profit was due to the increased cost of imported parts. Proton cars are manufactured in partnership with Mitsubishi of Japan, and the company has suffered from the appreciation of the yen. Proton has a 70 per cent share of the domestic market and is seeking to increase exports, particularly to Europe. It expects an improved performance in the second half of the financial year.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: PWS static at Pounds 2.07m PWS Holdings, the Lloyds's insurance and reinsurance broking group, reported static pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.07m for the six months to March 31, against Pounds 2.1m. A 5 per cent increase in brokerage income was offset by reduced investment gross income of Pounds 9.27m (Pounds 9.2m) because of lower UK and US interest rates. Earnings per share came out at 6.4p (6.8p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p.</p>

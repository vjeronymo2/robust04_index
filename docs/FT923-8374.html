			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Camp David revisited WHAT A difference an election makes. Less than two months ago, the leaders of the US and Israel were barely on speaking terms, and President George Bush was punishing what he saw as intransigence on the part of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, by withholding Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees. Yesterday at the presidential summer home in Maine, Mr Bush and Mr Shamir's Labour successor, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, gave a vivid demonstration of how much has changed since the latter's election victory in late June. Amid extravagant expressions of mutual affection, Mr Rabin evidently convinced Mr Bush that he is committed to making a success of the next round of Middle East peace talks, due to commence in Washington on August 24, and Mr Bush responded by promising to press Congress to release the loan guarantees. For good measure, Mr Rabin even gave President Bush's flagging re-election campaign a fillip by praising his leadership in the Gulf war. The change is more than atmospheric. Mr Shamir was a genuine obstacle to the peace process that Mr Bush and his secretary of state, Mr James Baker, have expended so much effort on. In the past six weeks, Mr Rabin's centre-left coalition has done much to prepare the way for progress: he has frozen almost all new Jewish settlement activity in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and has promised to engage in intensive negotiations on interim self-rule for their Palestinian inhabitants. Circumstances have not been set so fair for some form of new Israeli-Arab understanding since the 1978 Camp David accords negotiated between Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. Rapid progress President Bush himself has good political reasons to want to secure rapid progress in the Middle East. In the eyes of the American public, the failure to make headway with Arab-Israeli talks has tarnished the US victory in the Gulf war; at a time when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is still taunting Mr Bush from Baghdad and Washington seems at a loss over Bosnia, any prospect of foreign policy success will be gratefully seized. If the prize can be achieved in a way that improves Mr Bush's standing with the influential US Jewish community, as yesterday's love-in certainly will, so much the better. This represents, in Mr Henry Kissinger's phrase, a 'window of necessity' for all sides - not least for the Arabs. Palestinians' suspicions may be aroused by the sudden US-Israeli rapprochement, but it is they who have most to gain from exploiting the new Israeli flexibility that underlies it. That essentially means being realistic about what they can obtain at this stage of the process. More limited As Mr Rabin has repeatedly made clear, there is no question of his current government offering a land-for-peace deal as such. What may be available is something much more limited - a transitional arrangement on Palestinian autonomy as provided for at Camp David, and an understanding that the territories' final status is to be negotiated after a specified number of years. Even this much will be very difficult to agree. However far and fast his left-wing coalition partners want to go, Mr Rabin feels constrained by his desire to carry with him mainstream Israeli opinion and to keep opposition from Jewish settlers to the margins. The Israeli and Palestinian definitions of autonomy will be so different as to be mutually unrecog-nisable. And however strongly Mr Bush may want the talks to succeed, some of the external impetus behind the negotiations may be lost if, as is widely expected, Mr Baker steps down as secretary of state to take charge of the presidential campaign. That the talks have reached this point is thanks to American pressure as much as to growing realism among Arabs and Israelis. But America is not going to be there holding the reins, or holding Israel's hand, for ever; the US election campaign itself illustrates how domestic concerns have come to the fore. All the more reason, then, for the parties themselves to demand that the talks restart in a brisk and decisive fashion.</p>

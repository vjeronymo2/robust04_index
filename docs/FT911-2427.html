			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Angola struggles for a fresh start: The move to peace is fraught with difficulty SCRAWLED on the rusty corrugated iron walls on one of Luanda's many squalid shanty homes is a slogan which for most people sums up the political dilemma facing Angolans: 'MPLA Robs, Unita Kills.' Yesterday's announcement by Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rightist rebel Unita movement that a peace deal has been worked out with the leftist MPLA government will be greeted with joy by the long-suffering civilians of Angola. But it will not reduce the discontent with the two main political forces which have shaped the country's bitter history since independence from Portugal in 1975: the Soviet and Cuban backed MPLA which has ruled the country with an ideological iron fist and the US backed Unita rebels, who have waged a ruthless 16 year civil war against the government. The peace deal, which will be initialled in Lisbon today, offers the first real prospects for realising Angola's tremendous economic potential in oil, diamonds and agriculture and for rehabilitating the devastated infrastructure. But the transition to peace and democracy in what could be one of Africa's richest countries is fraught with risk. Sixteen years of corrupt and oppressive one party rule, inefficient central planning and a war which has been waged indiscriminately against civilians has cast a shadow over the credibility of both the MPLA and Unita. 'Most people in Angola want a fresh start with a third political force which is neither the MPLA nor Unita,' said Mr Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, president of the recently formed Angolan Civic Association. 'We want people whose hands are not stained with blood, death and destruction and whose pockets are not full with state money.' The fact that such statements are now possible marks the rapid pace of political reform since last year, when it was almost inconceivable that the MPLA would relinquish its monopoly of political power. Last week the MPLA Congress met to abandon Marxist-Leninism and prepare itself for the country's first multi-party elections. But reforming Angola's distorted economy and implementing austerity measures while campaigning for elections in 1992 will be a trying task for the MPLA. Social unrest and strikes are likely as public sector workers make demands for their long-suppressed economic grievances to be addressed with the end of the war. Many Angolans, including some senior MPLA officials, also privately fear a return to the anarchic violence and internecine conflict which raged through Luanda in 1975. Demobilisation will be difficult. Keeping the ceasefire during a process of disarmament and integration of the estimated 150,000 government troops and 40,000 rebels into one national army will be a Herculean effort. Opposition figures say both sides are already hiding caches of arms in preparation for a renewal of military conflict if things go wrong. International supervision and aid by the US and Soviet Union will help to reduce tensions but that may not be enough. There are serious question marks over how genuine the commitment of many MPLA hardliners is to democracy, under which they may be forced to share or surrender political power and the economic privileges which go with it. Few in the MPLA believe they have any chance of winning elections. When asked how he would sell the MPLA in an election Mr Joao Miranda, vice-minister of information and a progressive in the party, appeared confused. After hesitating, he said their main electoral appeal would be that 'in spite of foreign invasion by South Africa and the war against Unita the Angolan nation did not disappear. It has survived because of the MPLA.' Such an appeal is unlikely to win many votes when the huge debit side of MPLA rule is considered. Much more likely the MPLA's chances of winning any seats in a democratically elected parliament and in managing a peaceful transition will depend on whether they can deliver a higher standard of living. So far, however, long-overdue economic reforms proposed by a new team of technocratic ministers, including price, trade and exchange rate liberalisation, has been obstructed by MPLA stalwarts. Unita's chances of political success are generally rated higher than the MPLA's but, but while there have been atrocities committed by both sides many Angolans blame the rebels for the worst excesses of war. Unita could also threaten national reconciliation by raising the spectre of tribalism which has plagued Angola since Portuguese colonial rule. Ethnicity remains a source of division and Unita has been successful in building a movement out of the Ovimbundu people, the largest single group in Angola. Mr Andrade, the leading opposition figure to emerge so far, says that unless the government brings together the diverse political forces and associations into a civic forum with real deliberative powers, like in Czechoslovakia last year, the transition will degenerate into political conflict. 'Without a national consensus and a shared sense of responsibility for the transition a collapse into anarchy and conflict is inevitable,' he said. Whether the government or Unita would accept power sharing in the run up to elections remains questionable. But clearly the measures taken so far are merely the first steps in a difficult process of change which could easily degenerate into killing and robbing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Undisguised Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  denounces the South Korean puppet prosecution for recently  blocking the people from bringing a suit against the culprits of  the Kwangju massacre.    The news analyst says:    When the members of the National Federation for Democracy  and  Reunification showed a sign of bringing a suit demanding the  punishment of 35 culprits of the Kwangju bloodbath including the  chief culprits -- traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u -- the  puppet Seoul District prosecution authorities hurriedly  mobilized riot police for a strict cordon around the prosecution  building and violently blocked dissidents from entering the gate.    This is a truculent anti-democratic act of fascist tyrants  ruthlessly trampling down the elementary democratic rights of  the people.    It is a very legitimate exercise of their right for the  people to indict the culprits of the Kwangju massacre and demand  their punishment.    Moreover, there is no ground for the present  "civilian"-veiled "government" of South Korea, which pretends to  have inherited the "spirit of the Kwangju resistance," to refuse  to meet the people's demand. The violent hindrance of the  presentation of the indictment was aimed at burying into  obscurity the crimes of the murderers of Kwangju people and  defend them.    The Kim Yong-sam clique, though "civilian"-veiled, is a  fascist group little different from the military dictatorial  forces of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics."    If the clique thinks it can go scotfree, protecting the  culprits of the Kwangju massacre, it is foolish and stupid,  indeed.    The South Korean people's unanimous will is to clarify the  truth behind the Kwangju bloodbath and judge and punish the  murderers.    If the Kim Yong-sam group, turning a deaf ear to their  demand, persists in "defending" the murderers of Kwangju, it  will encounter greater protest and criticism from the people.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Book Review: English ennui and French polish FRANCOIS MITTERRAND: a study in political leadership By Alistair Cole Routledge, 216 pages, Pounds 19.99 LA FIN D'UNE EPOQUE By Franz-Olivier Giesbert Fayard Seuil, 304 pages, FFr120 I was full of anticipation when I read the press release accompanying Alistair Cole's book, which says it is the first in-depth political biography of Francois Mitterrand. Many thick books have already been written by French authors on this subject, some of them quite distinguished, so it seemed a bold claim to make. On the other hand, President Mitterrand is such an important figure in the postwar history of France, and indeed of Europe, that there must still be room for the definitive biography. At the moment, as he approaches his final year of office, he seems a cold and dying star, weakened by the collapse of his Socialist party, by his own unpopularity, and by the overwhelming power of the conservative government majority. But history may well judge that his achievements as a French and European political leader place him second only to Charles de Gaulle. De Gaulle restored France's self-respect after the debacle of 1940, and he rebuilt its political stability after the Algerian war of independence 20 years later. But it was Mitterrand who stifled the French Communist party; it was Mitterrand who converted the French to the principles of the liberal economy; and it was Mitterrand who converted the French political establishment to the cause of European integration. These are not mean achievements. Unfortunately, Alistair Cole's book is not the biography we have been waiting for. In fact, it is not a biography at all, in the ordinary sense of the term. Cole is a lecturer in politics at the University of Keele, and this appears to be an academic textbook for students in the department of politics. It is constructed as a series of themes - 'the party leader', 'the world leader', 'the European statesman' - which systematically cut across the sequence of chronology; and the book's essential purpose is set out in Chapter 11, which purports to evaluate Mitterrand's political leadership against a matrix of 'resources', 'constraints' and 'opportunities'. Cole's bibliography shows that he has read a great deal of the published material, and I do not reproach him for producing a book which is essentially constipated in tone, second-hand in its facts and tentative in its judgments. Francois Mitterrand is still very much alive, and the French political establishment is unusually loquacious in private conversations with the media; an English academic cannot expect to match the vividness or the sureness of touch of the French press. What I do reproach him for, however, is giving an account that all too often does not quite correspond with the reality I recognise. The facts are there, but the story that emerges seems time and time again to be just that bit off beam. To be blunt, despite his considerable book-learning, I am not sure that Cole fully understands much of the story he is telling. Take the big turning point in 1983, when Mitterrand abandoned economic reflation and went for austerity. Cole's economic explanation for this switch is obviously out of kilter: he implies that the crucial factor was the cost of the nationalisation programme, whereas in reality it was the massive injection of purchasing power through a sudden increase in wages and in public employment. But the deep lacuna in his explanation is that he does not make the link between the need to keep the franc in the European Monetary System, and the need to keep France close to Germany at a crucial moment in the Euro-missile crisis. That is one of the consequences of chopping up 'leadership' into separate little system boxes. Similarly, Cole seems to think that the disintegration of the Socialist party after 1988 was due to Mitterrand's failure to 'exercise leadership over his former lieutenants'. This is naive rubbish. The simple truth is that the Socialist party factions, which he had originally created to divide and rule the party, automatically turned into feudal baronies fighting for the succession, once Mitterrand had been re-elected and was therefore a lame duck. To say that Pierre Mauroy gave up the leadership of the party by 'consent' is simply misleading; he was forced out by the turncoat alliance between Laurent Fabius and Michel Rocard. And when he talks about the Socialists' seismic defeat in 1993, Cole underplays in an extraordinary way the significance of the corruption factor, both wholesale in the party and scandalously at the centre of power. In addition, Cole's prose appears to have been translated from a remote foreign language by someone with a shaky grasp of English. He uses 'bestowed' when he means 'endowed', 'deduct' when he means 'deduce', 'whole-scale' when he means 'wholesale', Robert Schumann when he means Robert Schuman, 'primary' when he means 'primitive', 'pursuing' when he means 'promoting', and 'reverential' when he means 'revered'; and he does not seem to know the meaning of 'aphorism' or 'endemic'. After Cole's painful efforts, La Fin d'une Epoque by Franz-Olivier Giesbert, editor of the Figaro, comes as a delightful relief. This is his fourth book on contemporary French politics, and it is constructed as a series of personalised vignettes covering the first months of the new cohabitation between Mitterrand and the conservatives. Sceptics may query the literal accuracy of the many conversations in quote marks; but whatever one's misgivings about creative licence, it is hard to deny that he gives insights into the personal power play of French politics that Cole could study with advantage.</p>

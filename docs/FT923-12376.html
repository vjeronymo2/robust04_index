			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / High Court rejects call for review of Lloyd's A CALL for a judicial review of Lloyd's of London was yesterday rejected by the High Court. Lord Justice Leggatt and Mr Justice Popplewell set aside leave to apply for the review which had previously been granted to six of the Names, the individuals whose capital underwrites the insurance market. The judges also awarded costs to Lloyd's. The six Names seeking the the judicial review - an action against public or semi-public bodies alleged to have failed to observe their duties - are members of syndicates that have suffered heavy losses. In his conclusion to the judgment, Lord Justice Leggatt said that Mr Justice Potts, who granted the review in May, would not have done so 'had he been told what he should have' about the earlier legal proceedings instigated by the Names. Lord Justice Leggatt also said that the relationship between Names and their agents and the insurance market was 'governed by contract and is of an essentially private nature'.</p>

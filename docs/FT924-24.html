			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Damart to close mail order business in Spain THE slowdown in the Spanish economy has prompted Damart, the French clothing company best known for its thermal underwear, to close its mail order business in Spain at a cost of up to FFr60m (Dollars 11m). Damart said the 'general deterioration' in the Spanish market, which has worsened in the second half of this year, had forced it to rationalise its operations there. The company will maintain a presence in Spain through its 18-strong chain of shops which will be unaffected by the cuts, but will withdraw from mail order. The closure of the Spanish mail order business is expected to cost Damart between FFr50m and FFr60m, which will be expressed in full as a provision in its 1992 accounts. Damart, in common with its competitors in the European textile industry, has been rationalising its activities for several years in an attempt to improve productivity. Although Damart, as a specialist company with a strong market position, has been more resilient than other, less focused, companies, it has been forced to cut its workforce by over 20 per cent since 1990. This productivity initiative was one of the main reasons for the increase in Damart's net profits last year from FFr110m in 1990 to FFr222m in 1991 when sales rose by 6.5 per cent to FFr3.7bn. However, its 1991 profits were lower than the FFr297m made in 1989.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Interest rates not so high I used to have a distant South African relation who would silence her loquacious husband by saying: 'Barney, don't talk about things you don't know.' That is what I feel like saying when I read claims that the European exchange rate mechanism is the main cause of the British recession and the main obstacle to economic recovery. These are mostly political writers, gossips and others who mainly read each others' writings and assume that what they tell each other a million times must be true. Should any of them seek economic confirmation, they will find the assertion repeated on almost every page of Economic Affairs, the journal of the Institute of Economic Affairs, back under Brugiste control. If any of these anti-ERM zealots is prepared to look up from their reserved corners of the Tory press and examine a genuine piece of economic analysis, they could do no better than look at a paper that Professor Mervyn King, economic director of the Bank of England, gave to a British audience in Rome last week on Europe in the 1990s: the Economic Perspective. The author first outlines the conventional wisdom on the recession: An unbalanced policy mix in Germany (with taxes too low to pay for unification) is keeping German long-term interest rates high. Another result is tight German monetary policy, leading to high short-term interest rates throughout Europe. These high rates are preventing recovery. King disagrees in part with all these propositions. He does not accept that German short-term interest rates represent a floor to short-term rates in ERM countries. This is so, even if Germany remains the anchor country of the system in the longer run. On the sheer arithmetic other countries could temporarily move several percentage points below German rates if they are near the bottom of their bands and are expected to move back towards the centre or top. Whether this can happen 'is not a question of high theory but of practice and market expectations'. Or as I said on May 18: 'Suck it and see.' The more novel part of King's case is that recovery depends much more on long-term real interest rates and less on short-term ones than commonly supposed. Nominal long-term bond yields are very similar in the UK and Germany. Real long rates, after allowing for inflation (and excluding mortgage interest distortions in the British case), are actually lower in both Germany and the UK than in the US. The conventional wisdom is that most private sector borrowing is on a short-term basis. King believes that to be a superficial view. US and Japanese exporters will not be able to take advantage of present low short-term rates, because built into financial markets is an expectation of dollar recovery. Thus the competitive advantages are not entirely where they seem and European exporters may be better off than spot real exchange rates suggest. That is not all. Capital investment takes a long time; and today's base rates are not a good guide to the cost of finance over several years. Even a company that finances itself with a revolving bank credit has to think in terms of an average of base rates over several years; and long-term rates may here be a better guide to what to expect. King does not overstate his case and accepts that high short-term rates 'have a restraining impact on consumption and create special difficulties for countries suffering high burdens of debt inherited from the expansion of the 1980s'. Naturally he does not speculate on when German short-term interest rates will decline. Given all the pressures on him, the Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger, has to engage in tough talk. But German interest rates will come down if activity weakens enough. Professor King also alludes to a theme that he has developed earlier. This is that high long-term interest rates may be appropriate, given the supply side revolution in the west and the voracious demands for capital in the ex-communist world. Here I am not so sure. The need for capital investment will not automatically translate into an investment prospect appealing to lenders in the west. And in the English-speaking countries the new, once-bitten caution about borrowing may continue for a while. The important question is not which guess will prove right. It is whether the world's bond markets will have sufficient flexibility to respond to pressures in either direction by allowing long-term interest rates to move up or down enough.</p>

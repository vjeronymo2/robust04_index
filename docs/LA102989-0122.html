			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: CAN WE AVERT THE NEXT FINANCIAL  CRISIS?  </P> <P> Consider the following picture: It is a time of peace and prosperity, of  capitalism triumphant. The Republican Party has overwhelmingly won the past  three presidential elections, apparently establishing a permanent lock on the  White House -- and why not, because Republican policies have brought steadily  rising employment and consumption. Businessmen are the heroes of the age;  organized labor is in retreat.  </P> <P> There are, of course, a few blots on the picture. Battered by low export prices  and the burden of their foreign debt, less developed countries do not share in  the prosperity of the industrial world. Protectionist pressures are rising.  There are strains on the international system because the traditional leader of  the world economy is in relative decline, while the most economically dynamic  major nation remains unwilling to take on its full responsibilities.  Nonetheless, the fundamental picture is so strong that few would suppose that  disturbances in the financial markets could produce more than a brief, mild  recession.  </P> <P> The year, of course, is 1929. Herbert Hoover is President. Britain is the  declining leader of the international system, and the United States the dynamic  nation unwilling to step into Britain's shoes. And the greatest economic  catastrophe of modern history is about to happen.  </P> <P> As the market hiccupped this year on Friday the 13th, the question that  everyone asked two years ago came around once more: Can it happen again?  </P> <P> A group of economists and policy-makers met recently in Cambridge, Mass., to  discuss just that issue. Although the discussion was full of disagreements, and  off the record anyway, I concluded several things from it.  </P> <P> First, in a purely financial sense, crises on the scale of 1929 are if anything  even more likely than they were 60 years ago. Black Monday in 1987 was actually  worse than Black Thursday in 1929, and the global spread of the stock crash in  1987 was faster and more complete than that of 1929. Computers and faster  communications apparently don't make markets any more rational; they just allow  panic to spread more efficiently.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the modest reforms undertaken since 1987 have done little if  anything to reduce the vulnerability of the market to crashes. As it turned  out, Friday the 13th didn't develop into a full replay of Black Monday -- but  it certainly could have.  </P> <P> On the more optimistic side, financial crises do not have to turn into real  depressions. In October, 1987, a few sensible things were done, and the effect  was to insulate the real economy almost completely from the effects of  financial panic.  </P> <P> Essentially, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to pour credit into the economy  after the crash, abandoning for the time being both its monetary targets and  any attempt to stabilize the dollar. Money growth accelerated to levels that  horrified monetarists, and the dollar plunged 17% against the Japanese yen; but  the crisis was contained. For most of the population, the stock market crash  was purely a spectator event.  </P> <P> What I learned from the historical discussion, however, was that the contrast  between disaster in 1929 and successful containment of crisis in 1987 was not  because of any fundamental change in the vulnerability of the economy. Had the  Federal Reserve acted in 1929 as it did in 1987, there would almost surely have  been no Great Depression. On the other hand, had the Federal Reserve acted in  1987 the way it did in 1929, we would not now be shrugging the whole thing off  as a temporary market aberration. The difference between then and now was  primarily one of leadership, not institutions.  </P> <P> The leaders deserve praise, of course, but it is worrisome when so much hangs  on having a few men do exactly the right things. As one conference participant  put it, we have relied on brilliant chairmen of the Federal Reserve to deal  with financial crises twice in one decade; will our chairmen always be so  brilliant?  </P> <P> What is particularly worrisome is that many economic pundits advocate policies  that would have ruled out the actions that insulated the real economy from  financial panic in 1987. Suppose, in particular, that the kind of economists  favored by the Wall Street Journal -- people such as Stanford's Ronald McKinnon  or Columbia's Robert Mundell -- had been at the helm in the weeks after Black  Monday. What would these people, whom we may refer to as "global monetarists,"  have done? The answer is, nothing -- or worse than nothing.  </P> <P> As advocates of a real or simulated gold standard, they would have fiercely  opposed the policy of rapid credit expansion that sterilized the real impact of  the crash while driving down the dollar; this is especially true because the  global monetarists insist on regarding the dollar as seriously undervalued.  Since the crash would have placed downward pressure on the dollar even without  a rapid credit expansion, and since this downward pressure would have been  reinforced by speculation about possible future dollar depreciation, a global  monetarist approach would actually have required a considerable credit  contraction.  </P> <P> The result would have been to turn the market slump into a major real slump as  well. Probably our economy is not as depression-prone as the economy of 1929,  but the result would still have been disastrous.  </P> <P> The purpose of this scenario is not to emphasize how bad the economic analysis  is at the Wall Street Journal or how bad the advice given by some economists is  (although both points are true enough). Instead, the point is that we were all  very lucky: The sensible and timely policies that actually averted disaster  were carried out in the teeth of advice from seemingly reasonable and  respectable voices.  </P> <P> Someone once pointed out that the reason that the Romans, not the Greeks, ended  up ruling the world was that while Hellenistic armies could perform miracles  under brilliant leadership, Roman armies could manage adequately with mediocre  generals -- which is more important in the long run. Unfortunately, we seem to  have a Greek, not a Roman, world financial system. So the answer is yes -- it  can happen again, though not under current management.  </P> <P> Yet that was not the observation that most depressed me about the conference on  crises. For the time being, at least, we seem to know what to do about stock  market crashes and to have a leadership that is prepared to act on what we  know. There is, however, another kind of international financial crisis: the  kind of crisis that happens when a heavily indebted country's creditors decide  that it is no longer a good risk. This is the kind of crisis that hit Latin  America in 1982 and that may someday hit the United States.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, we do not seem to know how to manage debt crises. The same  people who averted financial crises in 1982 and 1987 have attempted to deal  with the Latin American problem for the past seven years. They have organized  emergency loans, collective bargaining between debtors and creditors,  international coordination on a grand scale. And the result? A decade of  declining living standards, soaring unemployment and hyper-inflation.  </P> <P> Latin America has done worse in the '80s than it did in the '30s. Predictions  of a hard landing for the United States have so far not come true, but then  people who worried about Third World debt were widely regarded as cranks right  up to the moment of crisis.  </P> <P> So there won't be a replay of 1929 in the near future; but if you want to see  America turn into Argentina, it's a possibility.  </P></p>

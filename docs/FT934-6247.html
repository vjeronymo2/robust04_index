			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Battle begins for future of ITV: Takeovers likely as government prepares to ease rules on regional licences The government yesterday set off a 'phoney war' for the future of independent television by proposing that each ITV company be allowed to own two large regional licences - but not yet. As Mr Peter Brooke's National Heritage Department talked of 'stable movement' and 'evolution rather than revolution', the big potential predators such as Carlton Communications and Granada sat on their hands. Shares in most ITV companies moved up by only a few pence. That reflected the need for both houses of parliament to approve the change, which is unlikely before January 1, and the view that many companies are highly priced because of takeover speculation. Mr Brooke made clear that he had tried to balance ITV arguments that companies needed to be larger to compete in world markets with calls for protection for the regional nature of ITV. In London, the weekday and the weekend broadcasting licences must continue to be held by two separate companies. Arguments that Scottish Television and HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the West, could be protected from takeover from other large ITV companies were rejected. Ministers decided that the regional identity of the Scottish and Welsh broadcasters would continue to be safeguarded by programming obligations in their licences. The government also rejected pleas from newspaper publishers to be able to own more than 20 per cent of an ITV company, but promised to keep ownership restrictions under review and to look again at the wider questions of cross-media ownership. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, accused Mr Brooke of causing chaos by tinkering to try to correct errors in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. A number of ITV companies issued bullish statements yesterday. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central, whose share price rose from Pounds 20.93 to Pounds 21.70, said he was confident that the company would be able to become one of Britain's leading international operators. Carlton, the London weekday franchise holder which already owns 20 per cent of Central, is widely expected to pounce - when it considers the time is right. Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Television, franchise holder for southern England, said the changes would allow the company to expand in the broadcasting market. Meridian's natural target is Anglia Television. Granada, which owns 20 per cent of London Weekend Television, is expected eventually to launch a takeover bid for it. 'Everybody is looking at every permutation. Our blackboard's covered in them,' said one ITV chief executive. Mr Gus MacDonald, chief executive of Scottish TV, said: 'I'm peering over Hadrian's Wall waiting for the opportunity to invade.' The fact that the government has decided to set a limit of two licences makes it very unlikely that anyone will tackle financially troubled Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which already holds two licences, or try to acquire any of the five smallest companies such as Grampian or Border. By doing so, they would forfeit their chance of acquiring a large licence - unless a big company sought a sweetheart deal with a tiny company before the end of 1993 to protect its independence.

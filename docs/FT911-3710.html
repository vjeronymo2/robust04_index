			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Overseas arms help Avon to 20% rise AVON Products, the world's biggest maker of cosmetics and toiletries, yesterday turned in a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter net income. The result included strong gains from the company's overseas operations offsetting the deteriorating performance of its US business. For the first three months of 1991, Avon had net income of Dollars 18.4m or 16 cents a share against Dollars 15.2m or 11 cents a year ago. Revenues grew 9 per cent to Dollars 769.6m from Dollars 703.8m. The 1991 figures include a Dollars 7m settlement with Chartwell Associates, the investor group which recently agreed to abstain from launching a proxy fight for increased control of Avon's board for 10 years, after nearly two years of consistent pressure on Avon. Mr James Preston, Avon's chairman, said the company expects a good year in 1991 thanks to its strong international position. 'Avon continues to benefit from having a global portfolio of businesses that minimises the impact of a recession in one country or region.' The New York-based company said pre-tax profits from its international business grew 40 per cent in the quarter on a 25 per cent improvement on sales, led by Europe and the Americas. In the US, Avon's pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent on a 7 per cent decline in sales. This reflected the continued impact of recession, particularly in the northeast. Avon, which has been steadily reducing its debt, said debt at the end of the 1991 first quarter was Dollars 572.7m, down 18 per cent on a year earlier.</p>

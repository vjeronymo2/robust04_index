			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK and France to set up air defence unit Leaders of France and Britain are today expected to unveil a new planning unit to co-ordinate use of their air forces in peacekeeping missions. Greater defence co-operation will be the main theme at today's one-day summit meeting in the city of Chartres between the two countries, which have otherwise found it hard to find much common ground on other issues of European integration. Prime Minister John Major and several other UK ministers will be holding some six hours of talks with the French side, led by the ailing socialist President Francois Mitterrand, now in his last year of office, and by gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur who shares many of Mr Major's views on European Union institutions, though not on most of the policies those institutions should carry out. On defence, however, there is a communion of interest between France's ambition for a strong EU defence effort and the UK's desire to play a positive role in foreign and defence policy discussions in advance of the EU's 1996 constitutional conference that may pit London and Paris against each other on other issues. Underscoring their countries' diplomatic partnership, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will breakfast in Paris tomorrow with their Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, to discuss the situation in Bosnia, following the US decision to drop out of enforcing the arms embargo. The air planning unit will only initially involve about a total 10 officers from both air forces. But it is part of a broader defence dialogue which has involved contacts between French and UK rapid deployment forces, and a continuing discussion of nuclear doctrine between Europe's only two atomic weapon powers. The Anglo-French nuclear working group is not, however, tackling anything as far reaching or sensitive as joint nuclear submarine patrols or missile targeting. On joint arms projects, France will be keen to press the UK to join it and other Europeans in building the Future Large Aircraft, a new troop transport designed to give European armies the capacity to project power overseas. UK ministers are still weighing whether to join the FLA project or to go the traditional route of buying Lockheed transport aircraft from the US again, and they will be keener to review progress on the trilateral Horizon frigate project with France and Italy. Both France and the UK are ready to help African states with peacekeeping missions, and one idea is that France focus on better equipping and training two or three francophone African countries, and the UK do the same with some anglophone countries. Reuter adds from Paris: While Britain, Washington's most faithful ally in Europe, did not join the Franco-German inspired European army corps, officials on both sides say close political and military co-operation in Bosnia and concern at a perceived US drift towards disengagement have brought Britain and France, western Europe's main military powers, closer together. 'The British were up to now extremely reticent about European defence co-operation. Now it seems we can progress together,' a French official said. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

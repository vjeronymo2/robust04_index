			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Beware the 'quick buck' hard sell - Business expansion scheme ABOLITION OF the business expansion scheme could, perversely, mean a 'double whammy' boost for BES sponsors. There is no mention of the scheme in the Finance Act, but at least there is now no doubt as to the intentions of a future Conservative government. Chancellor Norman Lamont could have abolished the scheme with immediate effect - an option still open to an incoming Labour chancellor. Instead, he extended its life for two more tax years by announcing that it will last until the end of December 1993. This should allow the industry to raise plenty more funds before the deadline while also claiming - with some legitimacy, for a change - that investors should 'buy now while stocks last.' Not only this, but Lamont also decided, against expectation, not to abolish the 'buy-back' covenanted return companies. Dismissed by one commentator as 'arbitraging the taxman,' these schemes are thought by many to offer too generous a tax incentive for the social benefits they delivered. But they will survive. Indeed, Lamont wants to open the way - if the Conservatives are re-elected - for housing associations to use the schemes for 'mortgage rescue'. In other words, they will buy accommodation which would otherwise have been repossessed by a lender, and then rent it to the previous owner as a tenant. Two such schemes - one sponsored by Johnson Fry for the Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association, and another by Smith &amp; Williamson for The Mortgage Corporation - already have provided a 'rescue' for homeowners in arrears with their mortgages. These involved tortuous legal arrangements, as BES companies were not allowed to buy properties where the tenant was known in advance. They do, however, have more obvious social worth than companies which buy properties after they have been repossessed. They should, therefore  - as Graham Cox, BES manager of Sun Life, points out - be a rather easier 'sell,' both to housing associations and to wary customers. Small wonder, then, that BES sponsors greeted the news of their impending demise with ill-concealed glee. They even have 21 months to look for new areas of business. Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson Fry, was delighted by the news. He said it made the position clear for all parties and added: 'I welcome what the chancellor has done. It makes a lot of sense, and we look forward to the next 18 months and raising a lot more money.' Fry predicted a 'double whammy' sales bonanza for next year, caused by a rush to take advantage of tax incentives at the end of the 1992-93 tax year and also at the end of December 1993. He suggested that new sponsors might enter the market, as buy-back deals are simple to put together and are unlikely to tarnish the reputation of a big investment house with a loss. Sun Life has operated in the BES assured tenancies market since 1988 while John Govett, a unit and investment trust manager, launched into the BES market last autumn. Other mainstream fund managers came close to making a similar move for this tax year, but were deterred by the political risks. Now, the temptation of the BES 'assured exit' market will be all the stronger. Last year, such schemes accounted for 75 per cent of the total Pounds 255m raised by the scheme (up from Pounds 165m the previous year). According to Anthony Yadgaroff, of the Allenbridge Group, funds raised so far in the present tax year amount to Pounds 280m, of which Pounds 235m has gone to 'assured exit' schemes. Good news for the sponsors. But is it good news for investors? Probably not. Some of those entering the market will be strong and reputable. Others might be looking for a 'quick buck.' The supply of rental accommodation is finite, and investors will need to be wary as the scheme lives out its last few months. In particular, look at the condition of the housing market. If it remains depressed, then there must be some long-term doubts over the ability of housing associations to pay back to investors their full covenanted amount. Then, there is the old scare about Labour. The April 9 election date, just catching the beginning of the next tax year, provides a window of opportunity for 'buy now while stocks last' tactics. Sponsors are likely to open schemes for investment on April 6 and then allot shares on April 9. Barring a wholesale break with convention, a Labour government could not remove the tax relief retrospectively. BES business could be brisk if Labour enters the last week of the campaign doing well in the polls, as the party is likely to abolish the assured tenancy BES. But it is dangerous to take a rushed decision to go into a speculative investment. Also, if you are worried by Labour, it might not make sense to lock your money away for the entire term of the government, during which higher taxes would squeeze your income. Abolition of the assured tenancy BES is fixed by legislation for the end of next year in any case, but abolishing the BES for trading companies at the same time needs legislation after the election. This part of the scheme has dwindled since the introduction of assured tenancies. But some believe the move could cut off a source of funds for small companies, and had hoped the scheme would continue. Tim Villiers, chief executive of the BES Association, condemned the move as 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater.' He added: 'I think it's astonishing to cut out private investors completely in an area where corporate investors have been so reluctant to come forward.' This leads to the supreme irony that one section of the venture capital industry, at least, favours a Labour policy actively. BES financiers are profiting already from fears among small investors that a Labour government would abolish the scheme for rental accommodation. But Labour also has plans for a regionally-based 'growing business scheme' which could offer the BES industry a lifeline. Villiers said: 'Labour would now seem to be looking towards the funding needed for small companies rather more clearly than the Conservatives are.' John Harrison, of Investment and Tax Publishing Services, also attacked the chancellor's assertion that the venture capital industry could cover business venture funding. He pointed out that this was focused on management buy-outs, targeted usually at funding of more than Pounds 500,000. He said there could be a serious equity gap below Pounds 500,000. And, finally: what should you do in 1994 if you still hate paying tax? Enterprise zones could continue to provide shelter - if you are particularly keen on investing in Motherwell or Sunderland. There are also many dark comments that something similar to the BES will need to be invented to boost smaller companies. But the Budget also suggested another loophole at which the boffins will be looking very carefully in the months to come. Invested in any good films lately?</p>

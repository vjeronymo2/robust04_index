			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> U.S. ACCUSES 12 OF SMUGGLING POT  </P> <P> A federal grand jury has indicted 12 people, accusing them of being members of  a Tulare County-based marijuana smuggling ring that has been operating for more  than a year. The indictments charged the 12 with 22 counts each of conspiracy  and smuggling marijuana. U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> David Levi said members of the alleged ring, which operated in three states,  brought more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico  in 11 trips between January, 1989, and Dec. 31, 1989, by concealing it in  secret compartments built into motor homes. He said the marijuana was smuggled  across the border crossings in Texas, Arizona and California. Levi said Amador  Barragan, 35, and Alberto Barragan, 32, both of Porterville, were the leaders  of the smuggling ring. All suspects are in custody, Levi said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["bid"-signed report: "Closer Cooperation in Asian-Pacific </F> Area"]    [Text] Bonn, 17 Mar -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt has reiterated his request for more political support  and better access to the Asian-Pacific markets for German  enterprises. Rexrodt on Thursday [18 March] discussed the issue  of closer economic cooperation with the ambassadors of ASEAN  [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.    In the spheres of infrastructure, energy supply,  telecommunications, and environment, in particular, Rexrodt sees  opportunities to appear in Third World countries of the  Asian-Pacific area hand in hand with the ASEAN countries. These  potentials have so far been only insufficiently used, the  minister emphasized.    He briefed the ambassadors on the provision of FRG Hermes  export guarantees and the federal capital investment guarantees  for the support of direct investments. Further focal points in  the talks were the extension of information and consulting  facilities and the participation in foreign trade fairs.    In the federal economic minister's view, the ASEAN countries  determine to a large degree the economic situation in the  Asian-Pacific area. Between 1987 and 1992, German foreign trade  with the six countries doubled to 25.7 billion German marks  [DM]. According to preliminary figures, exports to the ASEAN  countries increased 7-9 percent, which is consistent with the  average annual economic growth achieved by these nations.    In late April, the minister is scheduled to visit Malaysia,  Thailand, and Taiwan. In Bangkok, he will take part in the  Asia-Pacific Conference. Rexrodt expects important impulses from  this conference for extending economic relations with the  Asian-Pacific countries.    In Germany, Rexrodt is due to meet the prime minister of  Singapore and government members from Brunei and the  Philippines. Indonesia will be the partner country at the 1995  Hannover Fair. An Asia-Pacific Forum at the fair is intended to  serve as a meeting place for business people from Asia and  German business representatives.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANLEY REINSTATED, BUT HE IS WAIVED BY THE REDSKINS  </P> <P> Dexter Manley got the new chance he has been looking for from the NFL. Now he's  looking for a place to resume his career.  </P> <P> The former Pro Bowl defensive end was reinstated to the league Monday, a year  after he was banned for substance abuse, but he was also waived by the  Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> "It's a new beginning," Manley told reporters.  </P> <P> "I am most grateful to the commissioner for the faith, trust confidence he has  placed in me," Manley said in a statement through his lawyer. "I will make  every effort never to violate that trust."  </P> <P> Several teams have expressed an interest in picking up Manley when he becomes  eligible for waivers today. He would go to the team with the worst record that  claims him. If no team claims him by Wednesday afternoon, Manley would become a  free agent.  </P> <P> Manley's attorney, Bob Woolf, said he had heard indirectly that the Rams and  Raiders are interested, but Phoenix, which has the second-worst record in the  NFL, has also expressed an interest, as have Miami and Denver.  </P> <P> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Manley would be eligible to practice this  week but not allowed to play in a game until Dec. 9.  </P> <P> The NFL, in a statement released from New York, said Manley must avoid drug  involvement and participate in a "structured support program" to remain in the  league.  </P> <P> Coach Joe Gibbs said the Redskins released Manley because the team already has  enough defensive linemen. He said Manley, who has had several problems and a  previous suspension in Washington, could do better in a different city.  </P> <P> "We're going to miss him. He gave a lot to us," Gibbs said.  </P></p>

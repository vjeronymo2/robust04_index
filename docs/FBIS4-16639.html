			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Explanation by Ukraine's Ministry of Justice Regarding </F> Recent Events in the Crimea" issued by the Department for Legal  Information at Ukraine's Ministry of Justice; date not given]    [Text] Ukraine's Ministry of Justice has already drawn the  public's attention to the illegal actions of Crimean President  Yu. Meshkov. Unfortunately, not only did the high official of  the autonomous Republic fail to embark upon the road of  respecting the law, but he is even further intensifying his  illegal activity. This is confirmed, in particular, by the  following facts: On 11 April, the Crimean president,  accompanied by a group of his bodyguards, arrived at the  building of the Crimean Security Service, where, in the presence  of members of its council, he announced his edicts on suspending  from duty Crimean Security Service chairman General I.F.  Kolomytsev and on appointing another person as acting chairman.  He did the same at the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs  with regard to Minister of Internal Affairs General O.N. Plyuta.    Not only are such actions on the part of the president of  the  Crimean Republic a blatant violation of Ukraine's legislation  and of the international norms on human rights, but also of the  Constitution of the Crimean Republic on the text of which he  recently took the oath of allegiance. The Main Law of the  Crimea (Article 129) envisages the right for the president to  introduce proposals to the Supreme Council on the candidacy of  the Security Service chairman. In accordance with Article 8 of  Ukraine's Law "On the Division of Powers Among Organs of State  Power of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and the Constitution  of the Crimean Republic (Article 115, clause 13), the Crimean  Supreme Council agrees to the appointment of the chairman of the  Crimean Security Service only on the recommendation of the  chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service. The appointment and  the dismissal of this person from this post are the prerogative  of the chairman of Ukraine's Security Service. Besides, the  dismissal must be coordinated with the chairman of the Crimean  Supreme Council.    Regarding the minister of internal affairs, in accordance  with the Constitution of the Crimean Republic, this official may  be appointed or dismissed only upon coordination with the  Crimean Supreme Council.    The president of the Crimean Republic, in conformity with  his  status, must act as a guarantor of the Constitution and laws.  However, if he opts for a different road, it will inevitably  lead to anarchy and lack of security in society. No objective  circumstances can justify such actions.</p>

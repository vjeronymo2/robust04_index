			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM acquires stake in Queensland copper/gold mine Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian natural resources group, is moving closer to its aim of becoming one of the world's big copper producers by acquiring 51 per cent of the Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit near its base in north west Queensland for ADollars 80m (Pounds 36m). Ernest Henry, one of the richest mineral discoveries in Australia in recent years, has been at the centre of an ownership dispute that ended abruptly at the weekend. Analysts suggest that the outcome is severely embarrassing for Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest groups, which discovered the deposit in 1991 jointly with Hunter Resources on a group of six leases owned by Savage Resources, a small coal and exploration company. A judge in the New South Wales supreme court ordered an adjournment on Thursday and told WMC to consider its position 'at the highest level' after a WMC executive had admitted the company misled Savage about exploration work carried out at the Ernest Henry site. Settlement of the dispute has enabled MIM to buy a majority stake in Ernest Henry from Savage. WMC's share price fell sharply on the court revelations which came only a few months after the group was also strongly criticised and ordered to pay costs of more than CDollars 10m by a judge in Nova Scotia, where it had sued directors of Seabright Resources, a gold company it acquired during a takeover spree in North America in 1987. MIM had manoeuvred itself into a position to take a substantial stake in Ernest Henry whatever the outcome of the court battle. The deposit, which consists of at least 69m tonnes of ore containing an average of 1.6 per cent copper and 0.8 grams of gold a tonne, is near MIM's Mount Isa base where it has extensive mining and copper smelting operations. MIM will also acquire Hunter's 30 per cent interest in the nearby Mount Fort Constantine joint venture - WMC has the remaining 70 per cent - for ADollars 17.5m. Mr Norm Fussell, talking to the Association of Mining Analysts in London yesterday, said growing its copper operations was MIM's present 'priority target'. The group aimed to mine 200,000 tonnes of copper a year and to smelt 250,000 tonnes, the capacity of its Townsville refinery. The stake in Ernest Henry and another prospect, Eloise, near Mount Isa, would enable the group's growing smelter capacity to be used 'and will average down our overall production cost.' He said it would take at least three years to get Ernest Henry into production. MIM's longer-term aim was 'to double our global influence in copper to 400,000 annual tonnes, while improving our competitive position'.</p>

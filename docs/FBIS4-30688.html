			<p>CSO     [Text] On 20 June, Mitsubishi Group's telecommunication  satellite company, Space Communication Corporation  (SCC--Shinagawa ward, Tokyo; president, Yoshio Taniguchi),  announced that it is considering a joint venture with U.S.  satellite telecommunication company Orion for the launching of  its third satellite. SCC is studying the advisability of joint  ownership of satellite facilities as well as contracting with  Orion for the sale of circuits in the Asian market. The  launching of a single satellite costs over 30 billion yen and  SCC's intent in this case appears to be an effort to reduce  costs and risks through a joint venture with a U.S. firm and to  boost its global sales capabilities.    SCC plans to launch its third satellite in December 1997. A  proposal has been presented for the joint ownership of  transponders to be loaded on the third satellite and Orion has  already proposed a specific number of transponders to be loaded  on the satellite. President Taniguchi indicates, "We would like  to make our decision by yearend on whether we will proceed with  the joint venture."    Currently, Japanese telecommunication satellite operators  are  restricted to domestic services only, but approval to provide  international services is expected to be issued in the fall. SCC  will enter the international market with the launching of the  third satellite, but past satellite accidents have caused  financial difficulties for the firm, leading it to consider the  joint venture route with a U.S. firm.    Rival Japan Satellite Systems (JSAT) plans to enter the  international market with the launching of its third satellite  in August 1995.</p>

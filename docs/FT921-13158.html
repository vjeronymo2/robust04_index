			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Israel hid settlement costs, says peace group AN ISRAELI opposition group said yesterday it estimated the government spent at least Shk2.5bn (Pounds 600m) - about 15 per cent of the civilian budget - on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip last year, principally on increasing settlement housing stock by more than half. The issue of spending in the occupied territories is central to Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees from the US to help finance the absorption of mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is to discuss with Israel's ambassador in Washington today to discuss conditions for approving the guarantees. Peace Now, a group which advocates giving up the West Bank and Gaza, said its study showed at least Shk1.8bn had been spent on building more than 13,000 houses in 1991, raising by 60 per cent in one year the total number of houses in the settlements. Calling the spending 'a financial swindle of immense proportions', the group said the government deliberately obscured the extent of its settlement activity to conceal from the Israeli public how much of the state's resources it was devoting to its ideological commitment to secure perpetual rule over the territories. In reply, Mr Ariel Sharon, the minister of housing and construction, branded Peace Now as 'sick informers'. He said his ministry's budget for building in the West Bank and Gaza last year was Shk850m. He said it was necessary to build there now because it would not be possible after Palestinian autonomy was established, as envisaged in the current Middle East peace talks. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy arrived in China yesterday for a breakthrough visit to establish diplomatic ties, Reuter adds from Beijing. Hours after his arrival, China confirmed it would take part in Middle East peace talks due to begin next week in Russia, the first time Beijing will participate in the US-Moscow brokered negotiations.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Investigation urged into Suharto's sons INDONESIAN opposition groups have demanded an investigation into the business interests of President Suharto's children as the first week of a general election campaign nears its close. Mr Soerjadi, chairman of the Indonesian Democratic party, one of two opposition parties, has condemned a monopoly in trading in cloves granted last year to BPPC, a private company headed by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son. Cloves are the key ingredient in Indonesia's fragrant kretek cigarettes. The monopoly had a projected turnover of about Rp1,000bn (Pounds 275m) last year but Mr Putra has said BPPC was unable to service Rp759bn in soft loans from Bank Indonesia, the central bank. Mr Soerjadi also criticised a monopoly in orange trade in the Kalimantan region, granted to a subsidiary of a group headed by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, Mr Suharto's second son. The presidential family was also attacked earlier in the week by Mr Deliar Noor, a member of the Forum for the Purification of Democracy, a leading dissident group which includes retired generals and religious leaders. Mr Noor accused Mr Suharto of 'nepotism' and described the business interests of his children as 'an abuse of power'. The governing Golkar party, however, is likely to retain power in the June 9 election with a large majority, bolstered by its 20-year record of economic growth averaging more than over 6 per cent a year. But the sensitive issue of his children's businesses may embarrass the 71-year-old president before he faces an election next March when he is expected to stand for a sixth term of office. His election has never been contested as all the parties have nominated him as their candidate.</p>

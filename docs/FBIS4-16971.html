			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Tajik opposition Akbar Turadjonzoda  has stressed the need to create in Tajikistan a provisional  government from among those who did not take part in the  "internecine war." He was speaking in an INTERFAX interview  after the first round of inter-Tajik talks ended in Moscow.    The opposition does not seek power, the people should take a  decision concerning who should rule on the basis of multi-party  elections, said Turadjonzoda.    "We stand for close ties with Russia, we understand and  recognize its interests in Central Asian. No one can replace  Russia as partner of Tajikistan, and Tajikistan cannot exist  without Russia, he believes.    The opposition leader said that during two-week talks in  Moscow the two sides only elaborated the agenda and signed the  communique on refugees which envisages their registration and UN  aid. The next round of talks will be held in Islamabad  (Pakistan) or Tehran (Iran). Turadjonzoda said that UN  representatives proposed to start talks on 23-25 May. This,  however, does not suit the opposition because this coincides  with Moslem holidays. The talks will obviously begin later, he  said.    He said that difficulties on solving the problem of refugees  are caused by the fact that Dushanbe is unable to provide full  guarantees for them. Practically 50 per cent of Tajik families  have suffered to some degree at the hands of the Dushanbe  regime, he said. People do not want to return and live under  this regime, said Turadjonzoda.    He said that it is necessary to adopt a Tajik Constitution.  Not now, as Dushanbe would like, but after the refugees return,  he said. A civil war is going on in Tajikistan, a state of  emergency imposed and political parties banned. It is  impossible to hold elections and referendums under such  conditions. This is humiliating for democracy, he said.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK union pact with Teamsters Britain's Transport and General Workers Union yesterday signed what it called an historic agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters of the US, writes Robert Taylor. The TGWU said the two unions would consult about developing a co-ordinated approach toward the United Parcel Service company. The co-operation agreement would also cover an exchange of information and educational facilities but concentrate on developing common interests in global transport. 'As capital becomes more internationally mobile, so must organisations of labour co-ordinate their work across national boundaries', said Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary.</p>

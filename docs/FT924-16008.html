			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Property boom casualty list grows - How European investors took risks in North American real-estate THE LIST of those paying a heavy price for stoking the red-hot North American property boom of the 1980s keeps on growing. Besides US savings and loans, Japanese financial institutions and North American real-estate developers, it is now evident that many supposedly cautious banks and individuals in continental Europe took enormous risks in a market whose collapse has proved to be every bit as spectacular as its rise. The European involvement has come to light through the bankruptcy of Montreal-based Castor Holdings, the top company of a tangled and mysterious international property syndication empire headed by German-Canadian financier Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg. It will be some time before the full extent of the pain suffered by Castor's shareholders and lenders is clear, but few would be surprised if these losses eventually top CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m). Mr Stolzenberg, who also has other business interests in Europe and North America, is said to have lost about CDollars 30m himself in the Castor debacle. With assets of CDollars 2bn at the end of 1990, Castor did most of its business in the riskiest part of the real estate market. It provided second and third mortgages and construction loans to developers, either to top up first mortgages pro-vided by banks, or to bridge the gap until permanent fin-ancing could be put in place. During the 16 years of its existence, Castor financed some 55 to 60 properties in North America, ranging from New York's Gorham Hotel, to condominiums in Florida and one of Montreal's biggest shopping centres. Much of its money was sunk into hotels and undeveloped land, which are among the forms of real estate least likely to generate a strong cash-flow when the economy turns sour. Castor's biggest creditor is the Chrysler Canada pension fund (with an exposure of more than CDollars 200m). But the bulk of its funds came from European banks and individuals. The names on a creditors' list drawn up by Richter &amp; Associates, the bankruptcy trustee, range from Credit Suisse, BHF Bank, Sal Oppenheim &amp; Cie and Banque Nationale de Paris, to numerous individuals identified only by their initials or by the lawyers representing them in Germany, Switzerland and Liechenstein. 'People were investing many millions,' says one of the small army of lawyers representing Castor's shareholders and lenders. As a result, 'Castor could take time and go to some cost to investigate the best way of doing its transactions.' For more than a decade after its formation in the mid-1970s, its investors enjoyed handsome returns. Second and third mortgages carry premium in-terest rates, and the company also extracted sizeable fees from developers for arranging finance for their projects. These deals also provided huge tax savings, especially to Germans. With the help of tax experts at auditors Coopers and Lybrand, Mr Stolzenberg channelled about half of Castor's funds through subsidiaries in jurisdictions which had negotiated favourable tax treaties with Germany. The most active offshoots were in Ireland, Cyprus, Curacao and the Netherlands. By using these vehicles, German lenders were able to pay a much lower rate of tax on their interest income than they would by investing directly in North America. Castor's equity ballooned from CDollars 2.1m in 1978 to CDollars 191.6m in 1990. Assets, almost all in the form of high-risk mortgages, grew from CDollars 18m to CDollars 1.9bn. As a private company, Castor was not obliged to issue prospectuses, and much of its business appears to have been done by word of mouth. 'They spent a lot of money doing beautiful presentations,' says a lawyer representing some of the individual investors. Many questions remain to be answered, however, about Castor's life and its death. Among them is its relationship with two property developers, Imry Merchant Developers of the UK and York-Hannover, most of whose business is in Canada. Mr Stolzenberg acquired a controlling stake in Imry in 1989. According to accounting records in Zug, Switzerland, which were examined by auditors Peat Marwick, Castor provided a CDollars 93m loan to Imry, which itself has financial difficulties. Peat acted as a 'co-ordinator' for Castor while it was under court protection earlier this year. However, Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer representing Castor's directors, said he had been told by Mr Stolzenberg and Imry directors that 'they are unaware of any amount of money being owed by Imry to Castor or any of its subsidiaries'. Neither Castor nor its creditors has so far lodged a claim against Imry. York-Hannover, controlled by Mr Karsten von Wersebe, Castor's co-founder and former chairman, is at the centre of allegations in Switzerland that Rothschild Bank of Zurich contravened banking rules by advancing more than 20 per cent of its capital in unsecured loans to a single customer. York-Hannover also owes Castor CDollars 359m, of which CDollars 70m was personally guaranteed by Mr von Wersebe. Some of Castor's creditors raise questions about the cause of its problems. They are not convinced that its difficulties can be explained completely by the collapse in the North American real estate market. Their uncertainty stems in part from Castor's highly complicated structure. But according to one of the company's advisers, Mr Stolzenberg is eager to co-operate with creditors and the authorities in sorting out Castor's affairs. The one certainty is that it will take months, if not years, to get to the bottom of the Castor story. The process took another step forward last Friday when the trustee and five 'inspectors' appointed to represent creditors met to discuss where to go from here. Mr Stolzenberg, who lives in London, is due to appear behind closed doors before a bankruptcy receiver in Montreal on October 19. The trustee also expects to interview Mr Stolzenberg at length within the next few months.</p>

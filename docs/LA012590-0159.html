			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS PIER REBUILT;  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH RULED LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO RESTORE BATTERED LANDMARK  </P> <P> Nearly two years after two storms and a fire reduced the Redondo Beach pier to  a battered stump, a judge ruled Wednesday that the city must rebuild the  once-venerable landmark.  </P> <P> Torrance Superior Court Judge Abraham Gorenfeld, to the delight of the  shell-jewelry vendors and seaside restaurateurs whose businesses once lined the  pier, held that reconstruction -- which could cost up to $4.6 million -- is  required by the pier lease.  </P> <P> "I'm elated!" crowed Jay Robinson, a general partner in Pier Properties Ltd.,  the leaseholder representing the 15 businesses destroyed in the third of three  1988 pier disasters, a spectacular fire sparked by faulty electrical wiring.  </P> <P> But among the pier's neighbors, the reaction was less jubilant.  </P> <P> "I have nothing against piers, but our pier was a dump," said Greg Diete, who  chairs the city's General Plan Advisory Committee and who lives in a  condominium near the pier.  </P> <P> "It brought crime into the community, and gangs, and it cost the taxpayers more  money than it brought in because of the need for law enforcement and city  staff," he said.  </P> <P> Once a popular promenade of tourists and fishermen and souvenir shops and  restaurants with ocean views, the horseshoe-shaped landmark was chopped in half  by the wave of disasters in 1988. First a January storm with crashing, 20-foot  waves caused $17 million in damage. Then in April, a second storm swept away  the popular 155-foot fishing promenade. Fifty-two mile an hour winds and  12-foot breakers pounded telephone pole-sized pilings against sections of the  pier. Decking collapsed. A coffee shop kitchen dropped into the ocean. Another  $1.25 million in losses were toted up.  </P> <P> The following month, a spark from electrical wiring under a pier restaurant  delivered the coup de grace. About a third of the pier businesses and half of  the remaining decking were destroyed as the midsection of the horseshoe went up  in flames.  </P> <P> The loss was a civic blow to Redondo Beach. In the nearly 100 years since the  city was founded as a logging port, it had never been without a pier. Three  times in city history, storms had claimed the city's harbor centerpiece. But  the pier had always risen again, and city officials vowed this loss would also  end in resurrection.  </P> <P> Within six months, the City Council had voted to restore the pier. But the  decision soon faltered in the face of vocal opposition from people like Diete  -- and the election of a new council.  </P> <P> Amid mixed messages from the voters, many of whom loved the old pier and  disagreed with Diete, a council majority promised to put the question of  reconstruction to a voter referendum.  </P> <P> But as a cautionary measure, the city asked the courts to determine its legal  obligations to businesses under the pier lease. City Atty. Gordon Phillips  argued in court that the document did not address the city's duties if  irreparable damage occurred, but required the city only to maintain and repair  the existing structure.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the leaseholders, meanwhile, said the lease clearly indicates the  city's responsibility for replacing piling and decking.  </P> <P> The mayor and council plan to meet early next month to discuss whether to  appeal Wednesday's ruling. Initial reaction was mixed.  </P> <P> Councilman Ron Cawdrey, who has backed the reconstruction from the start,  shouted, "All right! I love it!" when told of the ruling. But Councilwoman  Barbara Doerr noted that "five million dollars is a pretty expensive tag," and  said she would push for an appeal.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that we don't have the option whether or not to rebuild,"  said Mayor Brad Parton. But he noted that the city may be able to make the new  pier more palatable to opponents by imposing strict conditions on such things  as business hours and building design.  </P> <P> The money won't be difficult for the city to come up with, said City Manager  Tim Casey, since Redondo Beach is already eligible for between $2 million and  $3 million in state disaster assistance, and property taxes from a nearby  redevelopment project could alone support a bond issue of nearly $5 million.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Zurich Insurance buys bank Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, is acquiring a Zurich private bank, Rud, Blass &amp; Cie, which operates mainly in securities broking, from Mr Jurg Blass. Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive of Zurich, said the acquisition is being made in the context of the liberalisation of Swiss regulations on life insurance products. Companies can now offer investment trust-linked life insurance policies. Mr Hanggi said that meant Zurich would have a need for investment trust management. It already has investment trust management subsidiaries in Germany and Italy and hopes to manage some of its new Swiss business through its acquisition. Rud, Blass, with total assets of SFr351.4m (Dollars 275m) at the end of last year, specialises in trading Swiss franc securities and is particularly strong in bond trading. Mr Hanggi said Zurich, which maintains about a third of its SFr78.5bn investments in Swiss francs, generates about SFr3bn a year in transactions in that currency.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Donelon defies the sector trend with Pounds 3.1m DONELON TYSON yesterday became one of the few construction groups able to boast even a small increase in profits and dividend for last year. The announcement lifted the shares 3p to 44p. Pre-tax profits moved up from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 3.06m, despite a 15 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 80.9m. A substantially reduced tax charge led to an increase in earnings per share from 4.01p to 4.61p. As a result the dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 1.2p (1p), when many construction companies have been struggling simply to maintain payments. Mr Sean Donelon, chairman, said the group had performed well in difficult markets. He expected to maintain modest progress in the current year. The group steered clear of speculative residential and commercial property developments, and had not been required to make costly write downs on land bought in the late 1980s. One of its strengths is its tunnelling business which sells almost entirely to British water companies About a third of contracting turnover - down from Pounds 59m to Pounds 55m - was generated from tunnelling. Contracting profits, however, slipped to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5m) on lower turnover from general construction. Contracting margins held up against the current market trend. Property development profits fell to Pounds 450,000 (Pounds 720,000) and merchanting profits to Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 572,000). On the other hand losses from the industrial insulation business, which is being discontinued, were cut to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.8m). Net debt of Pounds 14m at the year-end represented gearing of 90 per cent on shareholders funds of Pounds 15.5m. But borrowings were expected to be reduced by more than Pounds 3m with negotiations at an advanced stage for the sale of the Skelmersdale Estate industrial property development. This would cut gearing to about two thirds of shareholders' funds.</p>

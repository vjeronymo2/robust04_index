			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING ROCK VIDEOS  </P> <P> Chris Willman's April 14 "Videos That Missed the Point" showed he has not even  the slightest knowledge about the workings of the music video business.  </P> <P> His assertion that rock video directors "misunderstand or misrepresent the true  content" of songs is an insult to the artists, recording executives and all of  us in the music video industry.  </P> <P> Let me explain:  </P> <P> The artist, management or the record label names a director and submits the  track and any guidelines that may apply (concept vs. performance, budget,  etc.).  </P> <P> The director writes a treatment, and after discussions among artist, director  and the record company, a final treatment is agreed on. Once approval is  reached on the budget, the label issues a contract. Only then does the  production company make the video.  </P> <P> Then when the artist and record company approve the video -- the contract  stipulates that they have "creative control" -- they distribute it for airplay.  </P> <P> So you see, directors are not the autonomous, omnipotent villains.  </P> <P> PAUL FLATTERY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Shake-up helps ICI hold fall to 11% ICI, the UK chemicals giant, yesterday confirmed the world economy's gloomy state when it warned that the commodity chemical cycle might not pick up until next year and a recovery was likely to be gradual. The company reported pre-tax profits down 11 per cent from Pounds 936m to Pounds 843m for the year to December 31. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said fourth-quarter results were disappointing and full-year figures could not be viewed as satisfactory. 'In the UK, the signs of an upturn are so faint as to be virtually invisible,' he said. 'Politicians' crystal balls appear rather clearer than ours, which are based on demand from customers.' Sir Denys said there was, as yet, little sign of economic growth resuming in the leading industrialised countries. The company had not been immune to the depressed state of key markets, but the impact had been reduced by vigorous self-help measures, he added. The company had reduced its head-count by more than 12,000 during 1991, and more than 20 plants and operating sites had been closed. The ongoing rationalisation programme had added Pounds 140m to the profit figures, said Sir Denys. The company had also sold more than 20 businesses, raising more than Pounds 500m. He expected further disposals this year, although not at the same rate as 1991. Group turnover fell from Pounds 12.91bn in 1990 to Pounds 12.49bn last year. A 4 per cent fall in sales and adverse currency movements had been offset by increased selling prices and acquisitions. Trading profits for the last quarter increased 62 per cent from Pounds 121m to Pounds 193m. One analyst described results at the industrial chemicals operations as 'shocking', as they fell from a Pounds 61m profit during the last quarter of 1990 to a Pounds 2m loss for the same period last year. Sir Denys again attacked electricity pricing in the UK. He said that in spite of continuous efforts for more than a year, he had been unable to achieve a satisfactory solution over electricity prices and supply. The figures for 1990 were restated to meet new accounting procedures. Earnings per share fell 7.2 per cent from 82.3p to 76.4p. The board declared a second interim dividend of 34p a share, the same as last year, making a total 55p for 1991. ICI's shares fell 23p to Pounds 12.84. Details, Page 21 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Article by S. Furmanyuk: "A Coal Face Argument"] </F>   [Text] It is unlikely that the visit by L. Kravchuk  to Yenakiyevo, the site of a meeting of the president with  directors of coal, by-product coke, and metallurgical  enterprises, will clarify anything in the complex mutual  relations between the center and the oblast.    Leonid Makarovich, naturally, was unable to refuse the  directors their request to do everything possible to halt the  collapse of the economy and production. He promised to help with  the settlement of unpaid accounts between enterprises and with  the granting of extensive technical credits for the basic  branches. But in return he took back to Kiev with him what he  came for. At a joint meeting an appeal to the parliament and the  government was adopted (with the president as the third  addressee) proposing the ensurance of order and prosperity in  the country through the transfer of local and presidential  elections to a later more "feasible" date and the introduction  of strict presidential rule.    Local political leaders have not had time yet to comment on  the results of the conference at Yenakiyevo, but it is unlikely  that the results will have any effect on the mood at the  grassroots level. It seems that no one is trusted any longer. No  matter how insistently Yu. Belomestnov, director of the  Oktyabrskoye Mine Administration, appealed to his workers to  halt the strike that started on Saturday 14 May, for example,  they refused to go down to the coal face.    "It is better to go hungry on the surface, than to work  hungry in the mine," declared Petr Moyseyenko, deputy chairman  of the local Independent Miner's Union, and that argument  outweighed all of the reasoning by the administration which  showing the miners that "things are what they are." In April the  administration fulfilled the state order in full shipping coal  to consumers but the wages are yet to be credited to the  bursary. At the Abakumov mine, however, which is officially  designated as a priority candidate for closure, wages were paid  to the workers on time. At Donetsk they are certain that this is  not a coincidence. It was specifically the labor collective at  Abakumov mine which turned out to be the only one in Donbass to  have nominated I. Plyushch, the former speaker of parliament, as  candidate for president. That is why "things are what they are  there." Are the leaders of state enterprises in the oblast  expecting similar "pressing economic measures," having supported  the president on the rescheduling of elections set for June?</p>

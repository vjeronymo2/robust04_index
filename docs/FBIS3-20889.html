			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Research, Education, and </F> Training Programme News"]    [Text] SPRINT -- Strategic Programme for Innovation and  Technology Transfer. The Council has officially decided to  extend the above programme until December 31st 1994 -- it was  due to run from 1989 to 1993. The Council envisages the future  integration of SPRINT into the Fourth Framework Programme for  RTD. SPRINT's `Lines of Action' have also been amended.  Briefly these are:  <H5>  Networks </H5>   1. Strengthening Intra-EC Networks for innovation    -- consolidating and developing existing networks,  particularly those involving technology and innovation  management consultants, sectoral collective research centres,  and innovative financing institutions;    -- the formation of new networks, particularly between  contract-research organisations, engineering consultants,  quality and value-analysis specialists, etc.    -- strengthening intra EC cooperation between  research/industry and university/industry interfaces, and  between technopoles and science parks;    2. Network Support Measures    -- information actions of various kinds across national  frontiers and between regions, in close liaison with the COMETT  [Community Program for Education and Teaching in the Field of  Technology] programme;    -- enhancing the effectiveness of networks, inter alia by  visits and professional exchanges, enhancing the transnational  impact of technology exhibitions, identifying `best practice'  with respect to technology transfer, and through specific  measures to help less favoured regions to participate in  intra-EC networks;    -- the launching of innovations emerging from networks by  improving the dialogue between sources of funding, technical  experts and innovators identified by the networks.  <H5>  Support for Specific Projects </H5>   These include:    -- encouraging the application of generic technologies to  target industrial sectors in the less favoured regions or in  regions of industrial decline;    -- heightening awareness of these technologies and helping  to  train companies adopting them, emphasising the transnational  element;    -- providing technical support for companies, especially  SMEs, potentially able to use these technologies, through  technology transfer networks and advanced-technology centres;    Twin approaches can be followed:    1) identifying technologies suitable for widespread adoption  in regions of lagging development or industrial decline, and  promoting the use of these technologies in the sectors concerned;    2) identifying a need common to a group of companies in a  given sector or region where the companies are prepared to  finance the solution. This encourages the identification and  possible adaptation of available technologies to deal with the  need detected.    The planned projects shall act as a catalyst, and must also:    -- be model projects in that they employ a comprehensive  'systemic' approach to the introduction of technological change,  covering, for example, management, training, industrial design,  and market assessment;    -- provide an optimum combination of skills across frontiers  and between regions and partners of differing special skills;    -- involve industrial sectors or technologies chosen to  guarantee a significant economic impact;    -- help to reduce regional disparities in the availability  of  technologies;    -- be based as far as possible on existing infrastructures;    -- include provision for follow-up and evaluation, based in  particular on stated and readily verifiable quantitative aims;    -- ensure feedback of the experience gained; preferably  directly by the companies benefiting from the scheme, in order  to maximise the multiplier effect.  <H5>  Improving the Understanding of the Process of Innovation </H5>   -- Monitoring innovation in Europe (European Innovation  Monitoring System) and evaluation of support measures;    -- Strengthening concertation and the exchange of experience  between Member States and the Commission in the field of  innovation policy and technology transfer.    A second Annex outlines a budget for the SPRINT programme  (1989-94), allowing expenditure of Ecu 41.5m for strengthening  networks, Ecu 20m for accompanying measures, Ecu 34m for  specific projects for intra-community innovation transfer, and  Ecu 13.5m for monitoring innovation and concertation between the  Member States. Total budget, Ecu 109m.</p>

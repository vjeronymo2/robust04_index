			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats loses favour Textiles leader Coats Viyella was the biggest casualty in the FT-SE 100 Index constituents yesterday as the company came out with a set of results that looked good but failed to retain the market's enthusiasm. The shares dropped 20 to 260p on turnover of 7.8m, far above average, in spite of a Pounds 150.3m profit at the top of the range of analysts' estimates. Analysts said that once the benefits of acquisitions and currency had been stripped out, the underlying business had declined. Also the company predicted flat sales in most of its markets, while material prices were creeping upwards. However, more enthusiastic observers pointed out that the stock had jumped from 259p just over a week ago. SG Warburg reduced its 1994 estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 160m.</p>

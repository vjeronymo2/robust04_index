			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Will the boom continue in central Europe?  -The Emerging Investor Central Europe's fledgling stock markets astonished all but a tiny handful of canny professionals last year as word of large paper profits attracted local and foreign money into Warsaw's tiny stock exchange. Warsaw's boom was followed by similar forays into Prague and Budapest as the price earnings ratios of Polish shares rose to western levels and investors piled into Hungarian and Czech shares hoping for a similar ride. Few expect Warsaw, with its puny 22 stocks, to repeat last year's average 700 per cent capital gain. But last year's easy profits have already attracted the attention of traditional left-wing thinkers among the re-vamped former communists who dominate the left of centre coalition government formed after general elections in September. In parliament last week Mr Leszek Miller, the labour minister, who faces strong demands from his party's trade union backers for higher pensions and social spending, called for a capital gains tax and Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, said his ministry was exploring the practicalities of a small transaction tax on share dealings on the Warsaw bourse. However, Mr Borowski quickly added that the government as a whole was convinced that public finances had more to gain from continued growth of the stock market than from new taxes. Pointing to the 3,000bn zlotys raised for the state treasury from the recent privatisation of Bank Slaski he sought to educate the government's own political supporters by warning that taxes which depressed share prices would lead to a fall in the expected revenue from privatisation. Many foreign investors, who moved in when they noticed the market take off in the first half of 1993, have in any case already taken their profits. Big players in emerging markets, like Salomon Brothers, expect a substantial market correction to reduce share prices which no longer bear much relation to the future earnings capacity of the enterprises concerned. A correction will be painful for thousands of latecomers to the Warsaw bourse but is unlikely to be either very deep or prolonged. The Polish economy expects another year of 4 to 5 per cent growth in 1994. The new government has indicated it will maintain the tight fiscal and monetary stance dictated by the IMF, and hopes are rising for an agreement on Poland's Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.7bn) commercial bank debt. The latter would improve Poland's access to future bank borrowing and raise its overall investment profile. On the privatisation front some 20 to 30 'National Investment Funds' are being created to manage more than 360 state companies to be privatised in the first round of mass privatisation. They will be run by foreign and Polish-based investment managers. Throughout the region, 1994 should be the year when privatisation really takes off. The Czech Republic has emerged as the clear leader in mass privatisation through its voucher privatisation scheme with shares in more than 1,300 companies distributed between 8m voucher holders. Most deposited their vouchers with a dozen investment funds to manage. This has left the funds free to become the main buyers and sellers of shares, on and off the stock exchange, building up controlling stakes in chosen companies as they do so. A second round of privatisation, involving more than 600 companies, has started. Czech fund managers are already seeking qualified managers for their new assets, in one emblematic case recruiting a former vice chairman of Chrysler to restore the fortunes of Tatra, the Czech heavy truck maker. This year, given the high cost and difficulty of obtaining finance from the banking system, many companies in central Europe will be tempted to take advantage of booming stock markets to seek a stock market quotation and make public share offers to raise cheap equity capital. At this point the stock markets will cease to be the glorified casinos they have been up to now and start to perform their basic economic function - providing a channel for capital from investors to enterprises. In many cases initial public offerings from newly privatised companies are expected to provide a relatively cheap entry for investors. On the Prague stock exchange, officially opened last April, trading only really began in June after shares from the first wave of voucher privatisation were finally transferred to their new owners. By December 16, the last session of 1993, securities worth more than Kcs9bn (Dollars 310m) had been traded. Trading at the twice weekly sessions is heavily concentrated on a small number of popular stocks. The rival over-the-counter RM-System, established shortly after the stock exchange, offers periodic share auctions through its computerised system, but both systems as well as market operators have faced teething problems. Only a handful of companies are fully listed and analysts say investor protection is weak and information inadequate. Some shares are already considered overpriced, though most analysts remain bullish about prospects for 1994. Budapest's stock exchange is also on an upward trend with the BSE index hitting record highs. Brokers are banking on the influx of foreign money continuing. So although the BSE index is 50 per cent above year ago levels it may have some way to go. At 1230, the index is barely above the peak of March 1991, a substantial fall in dollar and real terms. Prospects for earnings growth in the medium-term, however, are good and the climate for new issues is promising too. The privatisation authorities appear ready to price offerings competitively. The performance of Pick, the salami producer, has provided an alluring precedent for investors. Its shares have more than tripled in price, from Ft1,200 at flotation in late 1991, to Ft4,200 now. Many analysts, however, remain sceptical that 1994 will be a boom year for the Budapest stock market. Overshooting budget and current account deficits have pushed up interest rates and are likely to draw investors back to the government paper market, which in any case dominates turnover. Even after a fivefold increase in total post-tax earnings for listed companies as a whole the average p/e ratio, based on estimated 1993 post-tax earnings and year-end total capitalisation of Ft82.4bn (Dollars 820m), of the 28 firms on the exchange stands at 20.8. Liquid shares suitable for institutional investors are particularly expensive. Fotex, the retailer, is on 22 times 1993 earnings. The figure is better - 12.6 - if the 10 lossmaking firms are excluded. But the market is still not cheap. Higher share prices are also attracting a rash of initial public offerings. The end of last year saw a batch of four small new issues. Credit Suisse First Boston, the most active international investment bank in Budapest, once focused on corporate bond and commercial paper markets but is now turning its attention for the first time to IPOs.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq is closing its embassy in Australia as part of  a second round of closures of missions in middle-ranking  countries. Financial reasons are being cited, according to  Australian officials.    The first round of closures occurred six months ago. Iraq's  missions in Australia, South Korea, Argentina, and Hungary are  among the closures in this second round.    Australian officials say the Iraqi Government plans to  maintain some properties in Australia, but it is yet to decide  how it will be represented in Australia. Australia does not  maintain a mission in Iraq, but it is represented via Amman in  Jordan.</p>

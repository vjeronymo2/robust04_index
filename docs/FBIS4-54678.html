			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Lech Walesa by TV Polonia head </F> Leszek Wasiuta to mark Constitution Day on 3 May; place not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Wasiuta] Mr. President, we celebrated Emigres' Day  yesterday. Would you ever think of emigrating?    [Walesa] No, I never took such a possibility into account.  There is always a chance things can be improved.    [Wasiuta] But in the past you were pressed to leave the  country, right?    [Walesa] And that is why nobody ever succeeded in doing that  and never will [as heard].    [Wasiuta] Recently, more and more young and educated people  have left Poland. They emigrate. They are leaving for reasons  different from those common during communism, but this makes  Poland a poorer country. What do you think about it?    [Walesa] Well, here one can see the difference between  generations. My own generation was to some extent educated by  teachers who had themselves lived during the Second Republic,  where the homeland was more important than anything else,  regardless of the costs of living here. Now we talk about being  Europeans. We say that this country opens up, that efforts to  stress differences do not make much sense. This induces young  people brought up this way to look for places where life is  better, where they can get more.    [Wasiuta] What is wrong with that?    [Walesa] Well, it is happening at a bad time because the  country needs to catch up with Europe as quickly as possible.  It needs solutions because it is behind a little. If more  valuable people leave, this is a loss for the country. Of  course, later, after a hundred or so years, this loss will be  compensated for, but it means that our chances to catch up with  the world are reduced.    [Wasiuta] A hundred years is a long time. Mr. President,  today we are celebrating the 3 May Constitution. This is a  celebration for those who never accepted Poland's loss of  sovereignty, national dignity, and independence. Do you think  those people have won the battle?    [Walesa] Yes and no. Again one should ask how one can win,  how one can build up patriotism or take care of the nation, of  the state, when this state is Europe or, rather, the fact that  we are striving for Europe. That is why certain things will  have to be reevaluated. I think that certainly in 200 years  Poland and other countries will differ from one another only in  their folklore and past history, but we will really be one  Europe. Whether this will be better or worse, who knows? But  that is what we are striving for.    [Wasiuta] Mr. President, after the signing of the treaty in  Vilnius, the Polonia, or the Polish minorities in Lithuania and  other neighboring countries, have had their rights guaranteed,  but there are countries where the Polish minorities do not have  such guaranteed rights, and these people look longingly at  Warsaw and at you, Mr. President. What can be done in this  regard for Kazakhstan, for instance?    [Walesa] Of course, we must make every effort to make sure  that people of Polish origin, wherever they live, can enjoy  similar solutions, but this depends not only on their mother  country, but also on the countries they live in. When we reach  European living standards, this will not constitute a great  problem, but now there are still big differences, both economic  and political, and, as regards security, so the problem lies in  the differences in levels, and efforts will have to be made to  keep a careful watch on places where the principles worked out  by Europe are not observed. And, of course, in extreme cases,  we will help people return, although, as I say, in an open  pluralistic Europe, the same goal may be reached from different  points, and there is no need for massive translocations when  borders are open. They are necessary, and people aim for that,  but only when differences in living standards are very big, in  fact [sentence as heard].    [Wasiuta] Mr. President, as I have already said, the Polonia  throughout the world looks at Warsaw with expectation and at  you, Mr. President, also with hope. They expect to get moral  support. They look at what is happening in Poland from a  specific point of view. What can Poland, a country still on its  way to prosperity, offer the Polonia today?    [Walesa] As you have said yourself, the Polonia is different  in every country. There is a Polonia that would like to do  business because it has the money, and there is a Polonia that  would like to make money out of the mother country because it  has no money. So, they are terribly different. One should  divide them logically into three groups, and, depending on the  groups, on the different levels, they ought to be dealt with  accordingly. The rich Polonia should be dealt with in a  different way, they should be given a chance to do good business  here, while the other Polonia, the older one, should be dealt  with in a different manner, rather like tourists: They ought to  be shown things. And the rich Polonia that would like to make  money doing business with Poland should be treated differently.    At present, we do not do enough in this respect, we do not  show enough interest in these matters, but I want to say, too,  that, while we are setting our country in order economically,  politically, and socially, we will have more and more time to  deal with other matters. That is bad because it could be the  other way around: First set the country in order, and then it  would be easier to do the reforms. Yes, but we have approached  the problem from another direction, and that is why we do not  have good contacts and do not take proper care of the Polonia.  But, if the Polonia--for the ball can be returned a different  way--if the Polonia organized itself better and forced certain  solutions on its mother country, that would suit us much better.  But the question again is, which Polonia? The one that expects  something or the one that can do something?    [Wasiuta] And from which we also expect support. Thank you  very much for the conversation, Mr. President.    [Walesa] Thank you very much.</p>

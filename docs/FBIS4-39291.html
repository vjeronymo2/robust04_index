			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is prepared to increase supplies of  low-enriched uranium to South Korea from the present 40 tonnes  to 100 tonnes per year, Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets said at a meeting with that country's Minister for  Trade, Industry and Energy Kim Chol-Su in Moscow Friday.    To quote Soskovets, Russia was ready to increase coal  supplies to South Korea from 400,000 to 1.5-2 million tonnes.  Moscow, he said, was willing to form a joint venture with South  Korea in the Neryungri coal field in Yakutia and grant the  Korean side the right of ownership of a section of that deposit.    Soskovets said South Korea was making "only negligible"  investments in Russian industry (a mere 27 million US dollars  last year).    Soskovets stressed that Russia was a dependable partner and  Korean private companies which invested in Russian industry  would receive dividends.</p>

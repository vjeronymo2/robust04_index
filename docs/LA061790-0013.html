			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUD ART, LOUD FOOD AT THE NEW BORDER GRILL;  </P> <P> THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT AIMS TO OVERWHELM -- AND SUCCEEDS  </P> <P> "She's not usually this quiet," confessed the proud mother. Quiet? The kid  looked hypnotized.  </P> <P> Probably she was just overwhelmed. Imagine being about a year old and immersed  in the new Border Grill. The dominant color is construction-site orange. The  walls and the ceiling, a jumble of panels that angle down threateningly close  to the tables at one point, are covered with huge, brightly colored, cartoon  drawings by the London artists Su Huntley and Donna Muir, who have also done  album covers for Sting.  </P> <P> They look like party-time graffiti from a Mexican roadhouse, mostly showing the  traditional Judas figure of Mexican folk art. With his satanic ears, Judas  looks rather like a tomcat who has turned into a hardened sinner, defiantly  puffing on cigars and consorting with skeletons and fallen women. There are  also naive drawings of planets and rockets, and the wall over the bar  (separated from the dining area by an orange fence of artfully clumsy planks)  is covered with big, crudely drawn faces of people getting sloshed, whether  maniacally, lustfully or despairingly.  </P> <P> The table settings are assertive and vivid themselves: midnight-blue water  jugs, artlessly fashioned beer glasses in loud colors. The restaurant is loud  in the literal sense too, of course, like every restaurant Susan Feniger and  Mary Sue Milliken have ever owned, notably City Restaurant.  </P> <P> So of course the 1-year-old was staring around the place bug-eyed. She was  overwhelmed, like us. This was like Pee-Wee's Playhouse with food.  </P> <P> Border Grill clearly means to overwhelm. The menu aims at the same broad,  aggressive impact as the decor, a rough immersion in the loud flavors and  bright colors of Mexico, above all the less familiar dishes of Mexico -- as the  original Border Grill on Melrose has always done on a smaller scale (it's  recently been upgraded with similar murals and some of this menu). The result  is basically irresistible.  </P> <P> Take panuchos. These come four to a plate, each consisting of two tiny,  paper-thin tortillas sandwiching a filling of black beans, topped with some  smoky grilled chicken, some salsa, a slice of avocado and a few rings of  delicious pickled onions. Sometimes, I swear, there's a little dollop of  something that could be a sort of black pepper salsa. They're impressive: rough  and elegant at the same time.  </P> <P> Or take the specials. One night there was a bread soup -- not a tortilla soup,  but a bread soup. It was as far from cliche Mexican food as you can imagine,  consisting of bread cooked to mush in stock that had an insistent walnut-like  aroma of oregano and the Mexican herb epazote. It looked like a mess (or maybe  baby food; the baby did look at it appraisingly), but it was impossible to stop  eating.  </P> <P> Everybody liked that one, but I can't say everybody at my table liked the  spinach salad with lentil dressing. I thought it impressively earthy, though:  spinach with a dressing of perfectly cooked lentils in lime juice, all topped  with browned garlic chips.  </P> <P> The usual Mexican seafood appetizers (cocteles, ceviches, salads) can be  ordered separately or on a big chilled seafood assortment, where they come in  little rectangular porcelain pots, looking like so many miniature bathtubs. One  of the  </P> <P> ceviches is shrimp in a light, somehow exhilarating sauce of garlic, lime and  cilantro; swordfish ceviche comes in a richer, sweeter one of oregano, olives  and tomatoes. The octopus salad and raw oysters topped with a little bit of  onion sauce are also a lot of fun.  </P> <P> One of the best appetizers is the simple and unpretentious enchiladas frescas.  They're just little corn tortillas dipped in a sauce of ground mild red peppers  and wrapped around a crumbly white cheese, and they have the true bittersweet  taste of Mexico.  </P> <P> However, not everything here is Mexican. Milliken and Feniger reached down to  Peru for the anticuchos: two tiny skewers of grilled beef heart. The little  chunks of heart have a wonderfully smoky flavor and are more tender than you'd  expect. Incidentally, the avocado corn relish on the side is probably a bit  hotter than you expect.  </P> <P> There's a Caesar salad, quite appropriate since the Caesar was invented in  Tijuana. The version here, which is slightly quixotic by local standards, is  fresh and pleasant and seems to be the original Caesar's Cafe recipe. Sparing  the anchovies but leaning into the garlic, it mostly tastes of lemon juice and  olive oil.  </P> <P> Just about everything on the appetizer side of the menu is impressive in one  way or another. The Oaxacan pickled pigs' feet salad, however, is a bit  disappointing. In its savory hash of vinegar and red and yellow sweet peppers,  the chopped (practically minced) pigs' feet are so polite they're not much more  than a texture. Of course, that may be exactly how a lot of people want their  pigs' feet.  </P> <P> The most impressive entree proves to be the most baroque, octopus veracruzana.  Red snapper veracruzana is of course a classic Mexican dish, which Mexican  restaurants in our part of the world unaccountably make into a very dull dish.  This dish has nothing in common with them. The octopus is dressed with red and  yellow peppers, black olives and yellow grapes (!) on a bed of rice sopping  with a wild, slightly sweet sauce full of cumin and (of all unexpected,  curry-like spices) turmeric.  </P> <P> Ironically, the best thing after that operatic extravaganza is the simple  grilled fish, which is always smoky and perfectly cooked, often arranged on  some odd foundation, such as guacamole mixed with salsa and lime juice. If you  want a wilder fish, there's one wrapped in tortillas along with olives and  pieces of potato. The whole satchel of stuff is then fried. This is what you  might call the sloppy-sexy school of Mexican cooking.  </P> <P> There's a lot of that style around here, the sort of thing that would horrify a  French chef (actually, probably all of Mexican cooking would horrify a  traditional French chef). The epitome is the chicken chilaquiles: chicken and  corn masa mixed with sliced onions and the odd pepper, baked in some tortillas.  It comes out a sort of savory mush, served with a tart tomatillo sauce and a  rather pedestrian tomato sauce. Exotic comfort food.  </P> <P> The grilled and vinegared turkey, a dish already known at City Restaurant, is  also groomed for a rugged, South of the Border look, sliced into big irregular  leaves. Sabana, a thin steak evidently marinated in lime juice, also has an  apparently conscious weirdness. It's very tasty, but the lime juice gives it an  odd, puffy texture some people truly hate.  </P> <P> The braised lamb shanks are served in a hearty, rough-and-ready way, the  shanks, with the meat practically falling off them, stuck in a bowl of sweet,  dark-brown lamb broth flavored with lots of oregano. The bland hunks of  unmeltable Mexican cheese floating around in it are apparently for color and  texture contrast only.  </P> <P> Everybody liked the braised duck, a very fat-free skinless duck topped with  soft, boiled onions. The pile of lentils on one side had a nice bit of lime  flavor. On the other side was a stunning contrast to this carnal, earthy  assembly: an ethereal salad of oranges and jicama sliced paper-thin.  </P> <P> Some of the most unpromising things turn out to be great, like the red bean  stew, a vegetarian dish of red beans, slightly tart, very rich, not at all  bitter. There are some chunks of carrots, squash and plantain floating around  in it, more for contrast than anything else.  </P> <P> Great stuff. But it must be said that the tacos are a real disappointment. The  Yucatan lobster tacos (there are several other fillings available) have plenty  of lobster on them, along with some salsa and guacamole; perhaps too much --  they're a soggy mess. The griddled tacos include a lamb taco that's always sold  out, even as early as 7 in the evening, so I assume they're good. The carnitas  model, though, is pretty pedestrian, especially at $12 for a small plate.  </P> <P> The chicken pibil may be all too authentic. It's genuinely steamed in banana  leaf, but extremely bland. Spices might help, some black beans on the side  would surely help, but as it is, this dish is just steamed chicken with rice  and some middleweight tomato and cilantro sauces.  </P> <P> The dessert list is a whole menu on its own and includes some stupendous  treats. The lime pie is positively furry with tan curlicues of shredded toasted  coconut; it looks like a Muppet. The Mexican chocolate cream cake is a savagely  rich chocolate concoction dosed with cinnamon and clove.  </P> <P> The blueberry pie has a graham crust, but oddly only the top crust. Still, it  is filled with smashingly good blueberries. There's a nice guava cheese tart,  the obvious Latin American dessert combination of cream cheese and guava  preserves encased in flaky pastry, a very foreign-looking tart about half an  inch high.  </P> <P> The safest bets among the desserts are the ices -- things like light and  refreshing tequila-and-lime ice spotted with chia seed, served in big, tall  glasses. The rest of the desserts, however, are on the not-so-overwhelming side  of the Mexican spectrum, the sort of sweets that taste like breakfast rather  than dessert. Fried plantains with strawberries. An unfrosted walnut cake. A  dense upside-down cake is a whole lot like coffee cake topped with pecans,  dried apricots and prunes.  </P> <P> They don't serve breakfast at Border Grill, but they do have a weekend brunch  with all sorts of Mexican egg dishes, including a papadzules, an exotic  Yucatecan deal where hard-boiled eggs are wrapped in tortillas and topped with  pumpkin seeds. If you want to avoid eggs, you can have pancakes made from  batter that includes banana chunks, served with shredded coconut, guava jam,  coconut syrup and cream.  </P> <P> So what do we think? We're overwhelmed. Time will tell whether this kind of  loud, sleeve-tugging cookery wears well (the panels of cartoon art feel pretty  temporary to me). But for the time being, we're impressed.

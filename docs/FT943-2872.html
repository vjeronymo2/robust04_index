			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Austria alters course on bank adviser The Austrian finance ministry said yesterday it had hired international consultants Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton to advise it on the sale of part of its 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest bank. Last week, it was reported that the ministry had engaged J. P. Morgan, the New York investment bank, for the delicate assignment. This latest twist in the long-running saga over Creditanstalt's privatisation comes only three days after CS Holding, the Swiss financial services group built around Credit Suisse, withdrew its offer for a stake in the bank, citing the increasing politicisation of discussion of the issue. CS was also thought to be annoyed that JP Morgan, a strong rival of CS's investment banking subsidiary First Boston, was selected to assess the bids. Sources close to the government say JP Morgan was never actually engaged, a posi-tion confirmed by JP Morgan. The appointment of Booz, which is not in the investment banking business, may be an attempt by the Austrian finance ministry, which has been supportive of the CS Holding bid, to bring the Swiss back into the running. However, CS said yesterday its decision to withdraw was firm. That leaves only a so-called Austrian consortium, headed by Italian-controlled Viennese insurance group EA Generali, with a concrete bid lodged. The German insurance group Allianz has also expressed an interest, and the Austrian federation of Raiffaisen bank co-operatives is thought to be interested. Its merger proposal with Creditanstalt last year was rebuffed by the finance minister, Mr Ferdinand Lacina. Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, expressed his confidence in Mr Lacina yesterday, saying the minister had 'properly handled' the matter. It was now a matter of finding more interested parties, which would require more time.</p>

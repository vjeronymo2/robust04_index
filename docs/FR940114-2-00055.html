RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. The USEPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which the USEPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved MSWLF permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by the revised Federal Criteria to the extent the State/Tribe MSWLF permit program allows such flexibility. The USEPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the revised Federal Criteria apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. At the same time, Ohio proposed modifications to current regulations that will facilitate full approval of its solid waste program. The rules contained in the proposed revisions to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), Chapter 3745&hyph;27, add definitions and requirements that are no less stringent than portions of the revised Federal Criteria. The specific revised Federal Criteria that Ohio will incorporate are identified in the Ohio Solid Waste Program Application for U.S. EPA Authorization, October 1993. The USEPA reviewed Ohio's application and has made a tentative determination that the combination of Ohio's existing MSWLF permit program and the incorporation of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will be adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. The Ohio application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA has also received the proposed revisions to the regulations for review. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), December 23, 1993. Review of the finalized OEPA regulations will occur prior to the USEPA's final determination of program adequacy. If the OEPA regulations, when fully promulgated and effective, are essentially unchanged from proposed and are comparable to the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA may approve the Ohio solid waste program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require USEPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribal MSWLF permit program, the USEPA Region 5 may schedule an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, the USEPA promulgated revised Federal Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the revised Federal Criteria. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that the USEPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill these requirements, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. The USEPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop adequate programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to the revised Federal Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, the USEPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator who fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined above. The USEPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. The USEPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF permit program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF permit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in the revised Federal Criteria, USEPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993, USEPA published a final ruling which modified the effective date of the landfill criteria for certain classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). Thus, for certain small landfills that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, the Federal landfill criteria will not be effective until April 9, 1994, instead of October 9, 1993. The exact classifications of landfills and details on the effective date extensions are contained in the final rule. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. State of Ohio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1993, Ohio submitted an application for program adequacy determination. The USEPA has reviewed Ohio's application and has tentatively determined that the combination of the State's existing permit program and the incorporation of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will ensure full compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ohio regulations, contained in OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27, currently contain the following elements that are considered equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Consideration of other Federal laws (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.3); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Location restrictions for floodplains, fault areas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.11, 258.13, 258.14, and 258.15);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Operating criteria for daily cover material, disease vector control, air criteria, access restrictions, and liquids restrictions (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.21, 258.22, 258.24, 258.25, and 258.28);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

Financial assurance criteria for closure, post-closure care, and allowable mechanisms (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.70, 258.71, 258.72, and 258.74). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed modifications to the OEPA Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations contain the following elements that are considered equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Groundwater monitoring applicability, systems, sampling and analysis, detection monitoring program, assessment monitoring program, assessment of corrective measures, selection of remedy, and implementation requirements (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.50, 258.51, 258.53, 258.54, 258.55, 258.56, 258.57, and 258.58);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Closure and post-closure care requirements (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  40 CFR 258.60 and 258.61); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Financial assurance criteria for corrective action (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.73).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The elements of the revised Federal Criteria to be incorporated into the Ohio permit program (1&hyph;8 above) are contained in the proposed regulations currently under promulgation by the OEPA. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, December 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of implementation of the revised Federal Criteria, Ohio is incorporating a ``unit concept'' into its current landfill permitting process. Currently, large areas of unprepared land are permitted for a MSWLF facility as opposed to discrete areas or units prepared for actual waste placement. Landfill owners and operators will be designating ``existing units'' at MSWLF facilities according to a specific procedure and guidelines established by the proposed OEPA regulations. The procedure involves a clear delineation of the limits of waste placement, design components, significant boundaries, and what the owner or operator designates as an existing unit or new unit(s) at a MSWLF facility as of April 1994. The guidelines require that all areas designated as an existing unit are geographically contiguous and the unfilled areas of the existing unit meet, at a minimum, specific design requirements which are equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria. The revised OEPA regulations, when effective, will then apply to existing units, which have been designated by the landfill owner or operator, as well as all new units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised Federal Criteria require a final cover system with an erosion layer underlain by an infiltration layer comprised of at least 18 inches of earthen material with a permeability less than or equal to any bottom liner system or no greater than 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> &hyph;5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cm/sec, whichever is less. Ohio's final cover design allows for a composite liner involving a flexible membrane liner and a geocomposite clay liner in lieu of 18 inches of recompacted clay. The geocomposite component of the final cover must be demonstrated to have a permeability less than or equal to 18 inches of recompacted clay with a permeability of 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> &hyph;6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cm/sec, which exceeds the Federal Criteria. The use of an alternative final cover design to achieve an equivalent reduction in infiltration is allowed pursuant to 40 CFR 258.60(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the revised Federal Criteria require unfiltered groundwater samples to be used in laboratory analysis. Currently, Ohio regulations require sampling and analysis procedures which ensure monitoring results that provide an ``accurate representation'' of groundwater quality. This requirement can be interpreted to require unfiltered samples. The USEPA intends to revisit this issue during a proposed rulemaking. If the proposed rulemaking upholds the ban on field filtering, the State will be required to incorporate the provisions of 40 CFR 258.53(b) into its policy regarding groundwater sampling and analysis procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ohio program will differ from the revised Federal Criteria with respect to the general effective date of the requirements. The planned effective date of the currently proposed Ohio regulations, which incorporate the Federal Criteria, is April 1994. The rulemaking process in Ohio is extensive, involving the widespread circulation of draft regulations to all interested parties, public comment periods and hearings, and legislative review and approval, a process which takes a minimum of 8 to 12 months. The USEPA understands that State law cannot be retroactive and feels that an effective date of April 1994 for revised State rules incorporating the Federal Criteria will be adequate. However, as stated previously, the effective date of the revised Federal Criteria remains October 9, 1993, unless a facility qualifies for the extension granted to certain small MSWLFs. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993). All landfill owners and operators in Ohio were notified directly by USEPA that MSWLFs will be regulated under both existing State rules as well as the revised Federal Criteria contained in 40 CFR part 258 from October 9, 1993, until the date that the revised Ohio rules are fully promulgated and effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously discussed, the USEPA has a final draft of the proposed OEPA regulations. If the OEPA regulations, when fully promulgated and effective, remain unchanged from proposed and adequately incorporate the revised Federal Criteria listed above, the USEPA may approve the Ohio solid waste program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public may submit written comments on USEPA's tentative determination until March 1, 1994. The USEPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination that are received during the public comment period and during any public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments will be the basis for a final determination of adequacy for Ohio's program. The USEPA will make a final decision on whether or not to fully approve Ohio's program by April 29, 1994, and will give notice of it in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the revised Federal Criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA explained in the preamble to the final revised Federal Criteria, the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA expects that any owner or operator complying with the provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by the USEPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this tentative approval will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

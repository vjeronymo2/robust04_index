			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kerry Wong and Ivan Tong] </F>   [Text] Mainland authorities asked some co-underwriters of  the Tianjin Bohai Chemical public offered to take up shares  offered to avoid an undersubscription, it has been revealed.  Sources at the underwriting pool said that Peregrine Capital  and S.G. Warburg had been asked by the Beijing authorities to  take up a portion of the shares they had underwritten.    Officially, the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry's  340-million  H-share issue was oversubscribed 0.25 times. However, a source  suggested the issue could have been undersubscribed by as much  as 30 per cent, if it had not been for the late applications  which came as the offer was due to close.    The Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry's issue marks the  weakest  of the H-share subscriptions, receiving only 340.86 million  share applications compared to Shanghai Petrochemical, the next  lowest, whose $2.9 billion share issue last July was 0.74 times  oversubscribed.    The Tianjin Bohai public offering closed at noon on May 6,  but the number of applications seemed to fall short of the  amount offered early in the morning, sources said. Some of the  co- underwriters received calls from the mainland authorities  requesting them to file more applications.    The issue's sponsor and lead underwriter, Jardine Fleming,  said it had not been approached by the authorities to take up  any positions. "We are acting as an agency broking house. It  is not our style to support the issue by taking up positions for  ourselves before the offering has closed," said Gerry Yim,  associate director of Jardine Fleming corporate finance.    But one of the underwriters said: "The mainland authorities'  attempt to whitewash the subscription indicates its unrealistic  attitude to H-share issues and a high expectation of the  merchant banks.    "It is not facing up to the problems and still believes that  everything about H-share listings must go right."    However, Mr Yim said they were not aware of some  co-underwriters being asked by the mainland authorities to take  up the subscriptions. He added they had closely monitored the  subscription and communicated with the Beijing authority  throughout the offering. "We have done our best as a sponsor and  underwriter," said Mr Yim.    Under the current underwriting system, the lead  underwriters,  Jardine Fleming and China Development Finance, an offshoot of  the Bank of China, were to take up the shortfall in shares if  the issue was undersubscribed. But they appear to have been  bypassed, with the co-underwriters being asked to pick up the  extra shares. The underwriting syndicate comprised eight  co-underwriters and six principal sub-underwriters.    One local merchant banker suggested there were two ways to  prevent an undersubscription of an initial public offering. A  simple method was for major shareholders to ask their "friends"  to apply for the shares. Alternatively, underwriters would  request their fund management divisions to subscribe to the  shares.    Under Stock Exchange of Hong Kong rules, underwriters can  direct their associate operations, such as fund management arms,  to acquire shares during the initial offer period and the  information does not have to be disclosed.    It is considered a whitewash or face-saving approach to  subscribe for the shares at the last minute and take positions  and sell the shares when they think the time is appropriate.  Very often, the major shareholder or some financial advisers  would be the market makers and the downside risk is therefore  lessened.</p>

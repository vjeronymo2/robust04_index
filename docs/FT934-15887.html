			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Russia may vote on constitution RUSSIA may put a new constitution to a referendum at the same time as new parliamentary elections scheduled for December 12, Mr Sergei Filatov, head of the presidential administration, said yesterday. A final draft of the constitution to replace the communist-era document defended by the old parliament would be drawn up by November 5 by a constitutional convention which was set up in the summer. The convention was formed from parties, interest groups and regional authorities chosen by President Boris Yeltsin after the old parliament refused to adopt a new constitution. Although Mr Filatov expressed a preference for a December 12 referendum, he said the other option would be for the constitution to be adopted by the state duma, or lower chamber, to be elected in December. He also held out the possibility that the federation council, designed as the upper chamber of a new federal assembly, could be directly elected at the same time. Thanking foreign governments and international organisations for their support during the crisis, President Yeltsin yesterday invited them to send observers to the parliamentary polls, which he has claimed will be free and fair. However, the holding of fair elections will depend in large part on whether the authorities will allow opposition communist and nationalist parties not involved in Sunday's violence to take part. It will also depend on whether they keep their promises of 'equal media access' to all participants in the elections. A council is to ensure equal access to television but it is not clear how effective this will be. Mr Filatov said the Russian Communist party, headed by a moderate called Mr Gennady Ziuganov, may also be outlawed even though it was not included on the list of eight parties banned last Monday. Mr Vladimir Solodin, head of the information ministry department which imposed the censorship ordered and then cancelled by Mr Yeltsin, yesterday spelt out the authorities' dilemma over banned newspapers. Although he accepted that Pravda might soon be unbanned, he explained that the real problem for the authorities would be controlling more extremist papers such as Den (Day) which openly promoted violence and anti-Semitism. Part of the problem for the government was that the press law enabled banned papers to re-register under new names. Mr Solodin apologised to two newspapers banned by accident because his department had little time to set up the emergency restrictions. President Yeltsin won a qualified endorsement yesterday from the leaders of 32 European democracies, meeting at the Council of Europe summit in Vienna, writes Edward Mortimer in Vienna. The leaders deplored the loss of life in Moscow 'which resulted from the resort to violence provoked by the opponents of reform', and declared their 'solidarity with the supporters of the reform' under Mr Yeltsin's leadership. Talks on redeschuling Dollars 26bn of Russian debt to western commercial banks will be continued in the weeks ahead, the Deutsche Bank chairman of the steering committee representing 600 creditor banks in the 'London Club' said last night, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. 'Substantial progress' had been made in talks in Frankfurt on Thursday and yesterday between the creditors and representatives of the Russian government. President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia brought his war-torn country into the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday, risking the anger of many citizens who accused him of forcing it back into Moscow's grip, Reuter reports from Tbilisi. Mr Shevardnadze announced the unexpected move after meeting Mr Yeltsin in Moscow.</p>

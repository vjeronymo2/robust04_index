			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: Nato must not start to move goal posts Sir, The news that Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, has advocated an out-of-area role for Nato ('Nato ready to step outside its borders', May 22) must be met with some degree of alarm. Having just returned from a visit to both Nato and Shape in Brussels, my impression is that Nato has lost an enemy and has yet to find a role. Off-the-record briefings from senior military personnel displayed internal disagreements over whether Nato becoming a global policeman would require a total renegotiation of the treaty itself or not. My view is that the 1949 treaty enshrined the principle of an attack on one is an attack on all, at a specific time with a specific enemy in mind. Now that the enemy is no more, it is simply not good enough for Nato to start changing the goal posts. If Nato member states want to engage in peacekeeping exercises beyond their collective border, then our elected representatives should renegotiate the treaty.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 4 April carries in its  regular 31-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic.    The studio announcer says that "after bringing in fresh  forces from Serbia and Montenegro and mercenaries from Russia,  Romania, and other places, the chetniks continued their fierce  attacks on Gorazde."    Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Becic reports that "many of  them [enemy troops] today remained in the woods in front of the  defense lines on Lastan and Popovaca. The warmongers and  chetnik commanders simply replaced them with new criminals. The  defenders are paying no attention to this, and are readily  responding to infantry attacks which follow after every savage  shelling. They have repelled 10 such attacks. On the other  part of the front, on the route towards Rogatica [words  indistinct]. The defenders on the free parts of the Rogatica  municipality have repelled several extremely fierce infantry  attacks, supported by tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket  launchers. The aggressor also attacked the areas between Mecic  and Ustipraca and the area of the 1,207 m high Mt. Gostunj. He  suffered losses in all of these attacks. This is confirmed by  the fact that 200 blood donors arrived in Cajnice today from  Jagodina. As nightfall approaches, the chetnik attacks are  intensifying. No one has the time to count all the shells, but  according to a rough estimate, over 10,000 shells have landed by  1700."    The studio announcer reads a report from the 7-South  Operative Group, and says that "chetnik shells killed [stradati]  12 people as they were unloading a humanitarian aid truck in the  operational zone of the Croatian Defense Council Usora Brigade.  There were small arms' provocations and sniper fire in the  operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade. The aggressor  also attacked with antiaircraft weapons in the area of Maglaj.  A regrouping of the aggressor forces was sighted in this area."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the Serbian  aggressor is still [word indistinct] on artillery attacks.  Today, recoilless guns, mortars, portable rocket launchers from  Cadjavac and from the direction of Omerbegovaca pounded the  defense in the region of Vranovaca. Chetnik antiaircraft guns  fiercely shelled Djukici."    An unidentified correspondent from the Srebrenica Press  Center reports that "the aggressor, using antiaircraft guns and  antiaircraft machine guns from Kopresko and Visica Brdo, is  relentlessly shelling the border areas of Sutjeska. He is using  60-mm mortars to sporadically shell the region [name  indistinct]. [Words indistinct] the aggressor's antiaircraft  guns and antiaircraft machine guns are shelling the outskirts of  the town. A concentration of manpower and equipment has been  sighted in the region of Jasenova, where the aggressor has  captured two demilitarized zones."</p>

Projected Impact Based on the Proposed FY 1995 Actuarial Model <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Assumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this impact analysis, we model dynamically the impact of the capital prospective payment system from FY 1994 to FY 1995 using a capital acquisition model. The FY 1995 model, described in Appendix B of this proposed rule, integrates actual data from individual hospitals with randomly generated capital cost amounts. We have available capital cost data from cost reports beginning in FY 1989, FY 1990, FY 1991 and FY 1992 received through the December 1993 update of the Hospital Cost Reporting Information System (HCRIS), interim payment data for hospitals already receiving capital prospective payments through PRICER, and data reported by the intermediaries that include the hospital-specific rate determinations that have been made through January 1, 1994 in the Provider-Specific file. We used this data to determine the proposed FY 1995 capital rates. However, we do not have individual hospital data on old capital changes, new capital formation, and actual obligated capital costs. We have data on costs for capital in use in FY 1992, and we age that capital by a formula described in Appendix B. We therefore need to generate randomly only new capital acquisitions for any year after FY 1992. All Federal rate payment parameters are assigned to the applicable hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this impact analysis, the FY 1995 actuarial model includes the following assumptions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medicare inpatient capital costs per discharge will increase at the following rates during these periods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s50,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Average Percentage Increase in Capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Fiscal year  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Costs per discharge <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 1994  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5.70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> &bull;The Medicare case-mix index will increase by 1.5 percent in FY 1994 and FY 1995, and 2.0 percent in FY 1996 and later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Federal capital rate as well as the hospital-specific rate will be updated by the 2-year moving average increase in Medicare capital costs per case, net of case-mix change increase, between FY 1990 and FY 1992. The proposed FY 1995 update for inflation is 2.22 percent (see Addendum, Part III).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consistent with the budget neutrality constraints provided in section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act, estimated aggregate Medicare payments for capital costs in FY 1995 will equal 90 percent of the amount that would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis. The budget neutrality adjustment factor will be applied to the Federal and hospital-specific rates only and not to the hold-harmless state payment for old capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Tiny, constant point in an uncertain time - London In an uncertain world, there is something almost reassuring about the ability of Tiny Rowland to hang on to his position as chief executive of Lonrho. An attempt by fellow joint chief executive Dieter Bock to strip the 76-year-old Rowland of his executive duties at the mining and trading group foundered when non-executive directors refused to back the German pretender. The Pounds 5.5m a year package which Rowland costs Lonrho - including the Pounds 2m spent on running the group's Gulfstream private jet - will be scrutinised by the remuneration committee set up by Bock, but Tiny lives to fight another day. The FT-SE 100 did not prove quite so resilient as the redoubtable Rowland, but still managed to hang on to some of the gains made in the previous week's surge through the 3,200 barrier. Profit-taking and renewed concern about interest rates helped the index shed 34.8 points on Thursday, but the market steadied yesterday to close the week at 3,222.7, down 42.4 on the week. In spite of some twitchiness about the timing of the next increase in interest rates, the City continues to be pleased by the strength of the recovery in corporate performance. The chart shows that, of the changes made by analysts to their profit forecasts for individual companies, the proportion which are upgrades rather than downgrades remains comfortably above 50 per cent. The market's performance is all the more impressive, given that the start of the heavy reporting season of interim results included some disappointments. Rolls-Royce, the aero engine and industrial power group, increased profits by 29 per cent, thanks mainly to the effects of cost-cutting and restructuring. But the group said it did not expect to see any improvement in its markets until 1996. Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group, fell after the company warned that tough competitive and economic conditions persisted and were unlikely to improve in the second half. However, this gloom did not extend across the whole market and second-line stocks proved more buoyant. On Tuesday, when profit-takers knocked more than 15 points off the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index - which includes both the top 100 companies and the next 150 by market capitalisation - actually gained nearly 7 points. Share prices of housebuilders rose sharply after companies reported that new house sales had recovered last month after a poor June and July. Persimmon, the UK's eighth-biggest housebuilder, said it had sold 250 homes in August, 25 per cent more than August last year. Market sentiment was also bolstered by news of two large takeover deals, which have important implications on both sides of the Atlantic. The proposed Pounds 1.88bn purchase by SmithKline Beecham of Sterling Health from Eastman Kodak of the US will create the world's biggest consumer drugs business. Pharmaceutical stocks rose as the market pondered the wave of mergers and takeovers which have been transforming the healthcare market. The industry is consolidating in response to pressure from customers - employers who pay health insurance premiums in the US and governments elsewhere - to cut healthcare costs. The deal doubles the size of SmithKline Beecham's over-the-counter operations and makes it the world's biggest maker of OTC medicines, outselling Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. The combined group would have OTC sales of about Dollars 2bn.( Pounds 1.2bn) The pharmaceuticals companies are also keen to sell formerly prescription-only medicines over the counter because it allows them to extend the product-life of their drugs. This has become increasingly important for the drugs groups because patents on half of the 50 top-selling US medicines will expire in the next four years. Defence is another global industry which must consolidate in the face of rapidly falling spending by governments. The process took a huge step forward when Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the top three US defence contractors, unveiled plans for a Pounds 6.4bn merger. European defence companies are acutely aware of the need for consolidation, but the process faces much greater political barriers. However, Vickers this week emphasised that it was on the look-out for international partnerships. Having recently won a follow-on order from the UK government for 259 Challenger 2 tanks, the group said its Pounds 1.5bn defence order book made it a much stronger and more attractive partner when considering collaborative projects. The logic of international consolidation can extend to the most unlikely of industries. Service Corporation International, North America's largest funeral group, last month successfully bid Pounds 113m for Great Southern Group, the UK funerals company. It waited until the market had closed yesterday to reveal that it has now won control of Plantsbrook, another UK-quoted funeral company, with a recommended offer worth Pounds 193m. The Texas-based SCI gained control of Plantsbrook by purchasing the 46.3 per cent stake in the UK company owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest funeral business. SCI said it was anxious to avoid Plantsbrook falling into the hands of Loewen, the Canadian funeral group which had been interested in acquiring Great Southern. Given that SCI has now acquired the only two quoted UK funeral companies, scope for further consolidation is clearly limited. Yet the hope that trends in the healthcare and defence industries will lead to further big takeovers will continue to help market sentiment as traders await the inevitable increase in interest rates.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US declines to use Super 301 weapon The US yesterday unilaterally disarmed itself of its most feared and controversial trade expansion weapon: Super 301. The provision of US law once required the US trade representative to name 'unfair' trading nations, list their most egregious trade practices, and, using the threat of sanctions, negotiate them out of existence. Apparently, Mr Mickey Kantor, the current representative, became convinced that further unilateral action would be counterproductive. This is particularly true since the broad 'framework' approach with Japan - the real target of Super 301 - had finally yielded market openings in insurance, government procurement and flat glass, announced on Saturday. The law expired in 1990, but Mr Kantor resurrected his own milder version last March. To reduce the stigma associated with Super 301, he said he would list trade practices instead of unfair trading countries. Yesterday he declined to list even those, saying they were already being negotiated in other forums. He made clear that 'the single most important component' of US trade strategy was the successful implemention of the Uruguay Round. Mr Kantor did list a number of practices which he said could in the future 'warrant identification as priority foreign country practices'. These include the EU Utilities Directive, under which the US has already levied sanctions in response to the preference given EU suppliers in government procurement projects of telecommunications products and equipment. The Super 301 law has been controversial since its introduction in 1988 trade legislation. US trading partners said it poisoned the environment for multilateral negotiations under way in the Uruguay Round. A study published last month by the prestigious Institute for International Economics said the use of US unilateral trade weapons had been 'neither as powerful a market-opening crowbar as its supporters assert nor the unmitigated disaster for the global trading system that critics feared'. It found that 'aggressive unilateralism' did not typically lead to trade wars, as had been feared, nor to discrimination against third country exporters. But it expected that Super 301 would be less effective in the future. President Bill Clinton promised to revive Super 301 during his election campaign. Mr Kantor moved to institute his own version of the law when US-Japan trade talked failed in March. This headed off introduction of a tougher version in Congress. As an alternative, the IIE report recommended 'aggressive multilateralism' - making use of the dispute settlement provisions of the new World Trade Organisation (which will come into being next year) to enforce global trade rules. This is clearly what the administration intends, except in the case of trade barriers not covered by the new rules.</p>

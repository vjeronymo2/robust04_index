			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 25 February  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Human Rights Violations Claimed    2. Government-Serbian Ties Cited    3. Mufti Interviewed on Israelis    4. Copts Urged To Denounce Butrus-Ghali    5. Butrus-Ghali Trial Urged    6. Release of Hamas Leader Urged    7. Yusuf Wali Castigated  <H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CLAIMED </H5>   A 400-word report on pages 1 and 7 cites a statement by the  Egyptian Organization for Human Rights claiming irregularities  in police handling of confrontations with and arrests of  extremists.  <H5>  GOVERNMENT-SERBIAN TIES ALLEGED </H5>   A 350-word report by 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn appears on  pages 1 and 7. Abu-Husayn starts out by saying: "Our  government has committed a new crime against the memory of  Bosnian martyrs, thus refuting all its claims of seeking to stop  the Serbian massacres of Bosnian Muslims. Our government  continues to deal with European companies exporting weapons to  Serbs. It even allowed the Serbian military attache in Cairo to  engage in supplying his countries with its military needs in  weapons and hardware through a gun-running network of companies  in Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries in the region."  'Abd-al-Sattar then summarizes a DER SPIEGEL report to the  effect that "Serbian authorities have made Cairo their center  for contacts in the region and for providing supplies to the  Serbian war machine with the help of the Serbian military  attache in Cairo."  <H5>  MUFTI INTERVIEWED ON ISRAELIS </H5>   A 2,700-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page 6 includes  Hilal's telephone interviews with Mufti of the Republic Muhammad  Sayyid Tantawi and Ahmad Jamal Abu-al-'Aza'im, a leading  Egyptian psychologist. The topic of the interviews is a  conference held recently in Dar al-Ifta' or the house of Islamic  legal opinions, of which the mufti is the head. The conference,  organized by Abu-al- 'Aza'im, was attended by Israelis. Hilal  is opposed to their presence in this "impregnable Islamic  bastion" and questions both the mufti and the psychologist about  this event. He writes:    "I said: The Israelis [were] in Dar al-Ifta'. Why, Your  Eminence?    "His eminence the mufti is quoted: `By God, my son. I do  not know of their participation in the conference, and I did not  notice them in the hall when I delivered the opening speech on  "Islam's Way of Resolving Conflicts."'"    The mufti then explains that he granted Abu-al-'Aza'im's  request to use the Dar al-Ifta's conference room without  inquiring about the identity of the delegates. Asked what he  will do if Abu-al-'Aza'im requests using the conference room for  another conference, the mufti is cited saying: "After what  happened, I will ask him about the identity of the delegations  he will invite." Hilal presses the mufti further:    "I said: `If, among the delegations, there is an Israeli  delegation, will you refuse to hold the conference in  Dar-al-Ifta?'    "His eminence the mufti said: `Listen, my son, do not ask me  who entered Dar al-Ifta' and what his identity or religion was.  But ask me what Dar al-Ifta' will tell them.'"    Jalal then asks the mufti about his speech to the conference  and the mufti says: "I only delivered the opening speech and  welcomed the guests. If you want to learn more, get in touch  with Dr. Abu-al-'Aza'im."    Jalal does that, phoning Abu-al-'Aza'im, who reacts to his  questions with a call for dialogue as a means of ending  hostilities in the region. The psychologist says: "Frankly  speaking, enmity between us and Israel is a mere psychological  wall that we are trying to demolish so that everyone may live in  peace."   <H5>    COPTS URGED TO DENOUNCE BUTRUS-GHALI </H5>   A 600-word column by Dr. Muhammad Muru appears on page 6  under the headline "Conspiracy against Egyptian Copts." Muru  writes: "Sectarianism is an old imperial game that never goes  out of fashion. Egypt, which remains a major obstacle to the  imperialist and Zionist scheme, is facing a multiple threat.  Turning Copts against Muslims in Egypt is an old policy that  was pursued by British imperialism and by American and Zionist  imperialism more recently. As part of this scheme, Muslim  sensitivities are provoked so that they turn against Copts,  making them hostile to the national cultural endeavor and swear  allegiance to the Western imperial scheme."    Muru reviews the history of Prime Minister Butrus-Ghali, a  Coptic politician, who, hated by the nationalist movement, was  assassinated in 1910 by a fellow Copt. The slain prime minister  is the grandfather of the current UN secretary general, with  whose policies Muru disagrees: "Today, Butrus-Ghali, the  grandson, acts in a similar manner that provokes every Egyptian.  The Coptic Egyptian UN secretary general does not hide his  sympathies with Israel, describes UN Security Council Resolution  242 as not binding, and acquits himself as a hardliner in  affairs concerning the blockade of Iraqi children and the Libyan  people."    The UN secretary general, Muru adds, "plays a suspicious and  insolent part in the continuing massacres against the Bosnian  people."    Muru then reasons that the Copts should denounce the  "crimes"  of the UN secretary general, as their grandfathers denounced his  grandfather's, "so as to foil the imperialist scheme aiming to  foment hostility between the country's two religious  communities."  <H5>  BUTRUS-GHALI TRIAL URGED </H5>   A 1,100-word report by Khalid Yunus on page 7 concerns a  seminar held by the Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia on  Monday 21 February. He writes: "The seminar held by the  Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia last Monday on the  subject of `UN Legal and International Responsibility Toward the  Bosnian Issue' called for staging a popular trial of the United  Nations and its Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali and for the  formation of a preparatory committee to make arrangements for  the trial within two months."    The seminar, Yunus adds, was attended by "a large number of  international law experts and political figures, led by Labor  Party leader Ibrahim Shukri."    Addressing the seminar, Labor Party leader Shukri is cited  as  saying that "the trial of the United Nations and its Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali is an urgent necessity in view of UN  positions and resolutions that only serve Serbian schemes."  <H5>  RELEASE OF HAMAS LEADER URGED </H5>   An unattributed 350-word column entitled "Palestinian  Issues:  Vatican and Shaykh Yasin" appears on page 8. The unidentified  columnist notes that the Vatican is marking the holocaust.    The writer asks: "What is curious is that this is the first  time the Vatican is marking this occasion, which is taking place  at a time when the truth about this presumed pogrom is starting  to come out. Studies appearing even in the West speak of a big  lie behind this story that has been touted for decades and been  used by champions of Zionism to flagellate the world into a  feeling of guilt so that they may earn undeserved compensation  for an alleged tragedy."    The columnist wonders why the Vatican should feel sympathy  with a tragedy that "even if it is true" happened decades ago  but overlooks the "living tragedy" of the Palestinian people.  The columnist then asserts that the health of Ahmad Yasin,  58-year-old spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance  Movement--Hamas, "is seriously deteriorating as he languishes in  an Israeli jail." The writer concludes: "Where are those who  negotiate and mediate with Israel? Why don't they call for the  release of the paralyzed shaykh?"  <H5>  YUSUF WALI CASTIGATED </H5>   AL-SHA'B continues its long-running campaign against Yusuf  Wali, deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture,  livestock and fisheries, and land reclamation. A 2,200-word  report by Salah Budaywi headlined "Wali and the Zionists Prepare  a 45-Clause Plan To Promote the Idea of a Middle East Market"  appears on page 10.    Budaywi notes that the "Higer Zionist-Egyptian Agricultural  Committee held its 18th session in Cairo late in the week before  last." He then highlights a 25-point protocol on agricultural  cooperation that was signed by both sides and calls for the  establishment of joint scientific research centers and training  programs.    Throughout his report, Budaywi attempts to make the point  that such cooperation with the "Zionist entity" is designed to  ensure regional supremacy for the latter. For example, he  writes: "The two sides agreed to request assistance from  Washington in implementing a joint program in the framework of  the Middle East market. The program, involving the United  States, Egypt, the Zionist entity, and the Palestinians, aims at  reclaiming desert areas in the Middle East and improving  agriculture production. The program is designed to give the  Zionist entity and its experts the upper hand."</p>

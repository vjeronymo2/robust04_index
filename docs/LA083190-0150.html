			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 GERMANYS SIGN TREATY ON UNIFICATION  </P> <P> One day before the anniversary of the war that drove them apart, the German  states signed a sweeping treaty today meant as a final blueprint for bringing  them together.  </P> <P> German leaders met in a 17th-Century palace of German princes to sign the  document, which seeks to reconcile the stark differences between two societies  that will form one nation Oct. 3.  </P> <P> The pact will allow East Germany to retain its liberal abortion law and gives  Western investors more rights to buy East German land, a measure economists say  is necessary to rescue the nation's dire economy.  </P> <P> It also calls for Berlin to become the capital of a united Germany, guarantees  some social programs for jobless East Germans and recognizes the five states  East Germany will become in a united nation.  </P> <P> The treaty leaves many crucial decisions on uniting the nations to the new  government that will be elected to lead both nations Dec. 2.  </P> <P> The 900-page document was signed by West German Interior Minister Wolfgang  Schaeuble, and East Germany's top unity negotiator, Guenther Krause.  </P> <P> Earlier, the cabinets of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German  Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere formally approved the pact.  </P> <P> "Today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to German  unification," De Maiziere said.  </P> <P> The parliaments of the two nations likely will approve the treaty next week.  </P> <P> The signing took place on the eve of the 51st anniversary of World War II. On  Sept. 1, 1939, Hitler's forces invaded Poland, and France and England declared  the war that eventually split Germany.  </P> <P> The treaty promises that the new united Germany will respect the borders of its  European neighbors.  </P> <P> The pact reconciles some fundamental legal and political differences between  the two nations that followed vastly different paths after they were carved  from the conquered Nazi empire.  </P> <P> Schaeuble said the goal of the broad accord "was to again standardize what had  been 45 years of developing separate systems of laws and differing economic and  living conditions."  </P> <P> The treaty itself was not necessary to German unification because East Germany  already has voted to merge with West Germany.  </P></p>

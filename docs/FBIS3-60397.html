Many more are down from the same causes.    The dead comprise mainly old men and women as well as  children living under squalid conditions at the camps, four  miles from Koboko town along Moyo-Koboko road.    The death occurred between last week and mid this week,  according to Red Cross workers at the camps. "Between five to  six people are dying here daily," said a Red Cross volunteer  from Arua who is involved in the operation.    On Monday August 16 alone, nine people died in one camp.  Four  others had died the previous day while another four died on  Tuesday. The adults are mainly dying of meningistis while  children are dying of measles.    Aid workers however expressed fear that the death toll might  rise because of the unhygienic and poor sanitary conditions at  the camps.    By Thursday the 30,000-plus refugees living in the two  camps,  had no toilets. Pit latrines had not been dug. They were also  faced with an acute water shortage. The British charity  organisation Oxfam, was still surveying nearest possible source  of water for them.    Besides, refugee families are crammed in poorly built  grass-thatched huts, while others are sleeping under trees.  Tents have been given out to some but many have not yet received  any.    RC officials distributing the food say though the bombing  had  ceased at the southern Sudan border town of Kaya, more refugees  were still coming in. Four truck-loads arrived at the Koboko  camps mid this week.    The refugees are mainly of the Kakwa ethnic group of  southern  Sudan. Their dialect is almost similar to that of Uganda Kakwas  in Koboko. But they complained that SPLA [Seychelles People's  Liberation Army] fighters, mainly Dinka, confiscated and looted  their property as they fled to Uganda.    Sudanese Anglican Bishop Semmey Solomon has also sought  refuge at Koboko. He is now staying with some Ugandan priests at  Nangilia parish.</p>

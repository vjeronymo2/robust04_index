Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Argentine  President Carlos Menem, according to Foreign Ministry officials.    The loan will be provided for Argentina's program to improve  sanitary conditions along the Reconquista River, which runs  north of the capital of Buenos Aires, the officials said.    The loan is part of Japan's plan to expand its Official  Development Assistance (ODA) to 900 billion to 1 trillion yen  over a five-year period from 1992.

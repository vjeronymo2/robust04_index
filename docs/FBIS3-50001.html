The situation, which Mr. Mikhaylov described as "critical,"  arose after members of the Riot Police Squad shot and killed two  counterterrorist commandos ("Red Berets") in an unauthorized  operation in a Sofia neighbourhood last Friday [14 January]  night. Assuming full responsibility for the tragic incident, Mr.  Mikhaylov handed his resignation on Sunday [16 January] but the  cabinet unanimously rejected it by secret ballot yesterday.    Mr. Mikhaylov said that this "tremendous gaffe committed by  the members of the Riot Police Squad," paralyzed the Interior  Ministry services. "We must do something to help them get over  this shock. I think we have got enough people who can get things  out of this shock situation," the minister told his interviewer.    Mr. Mikhaylov said that the Riot Police Squad will be  reorganized and may be replaced by two other units with  different functions. "We will probably consider a shift of  control over stand-by units," the minister said in his interview.    Before the passage of the Judiciary Act, there is no method  by which the crime control institutions could work like a single  mechanism fighting crime, in his view. Mr. Mikhaylov said that  Mr. Nikolay Slatinski MP, chairman of the National Assembly  Committee on National Security, with whom he conferred today,  promised him cooperation in this direction.    Cooperation among the state institutions in crime control  was  high on the agenda of the meeting today between senior members  of the National Assembly Committee on National Security and the  Ministry of the Interior.    Crime in Bulgaria has reached a level which jeopardizes the  very integrity of the state, Mr. Slatinski said after the  meeting. The Interior Ministry officers cannot cope with the  situation on their own because it involves a struggle for  dominance between major economic groups. According to Mr.  Slatinski, it is not a separate force or institution that should  tackle this problem but all competent institutions should agree  on cooperation.    "It is a pity that things had to get that far before my  colleagues could realize why our committee was pressing so  urgently to prioritize national security legislation," Mr.  Slatinski said. Asked whether organized crime groups may already  have a lobby even in parliament, Mr. Slatinski answered that he  would not commit himself to such an assertion which is insulting  to his fellow MP's. Still, the stalling of laws concerning  national security made him suspect some connection between  economic groups and politicians.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SHOVING INCIDENT 'UPSETS' BUSH  </P> <P> President Bush is "most upset" that a Secret Service agent shoved his senior  adviser on Soviet affairs when she was lined up in the receiving line in San  Francisco to say farewell to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a spokesman  said today.  </P> <P> Condoleezza Rice was shoved by the agent and told to get behind the rope with  the lesser VIPs, even though she wore a pin designating that she was a member  of the U.S. delegation.  </P> <P> "The President is aware of it and most upset about it," White House Press  Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. "It should not have happened. The  Secret Service is reviewing it."  </P> <P> The agency spokesman said: "We're looking into it. We have to talk to a number  of people. There are two sides to every story."  </P> <P> Fitzwater noted that reporters have experienced similar situations on the road  when they are pushed behind barriers. To which one quipped: "Yeah, but we don't  get the President upset about it."  </P></p>

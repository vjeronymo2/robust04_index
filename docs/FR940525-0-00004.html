			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 905.146, 905.147, and 905.148 of the regulations provide terms and conditions under which shippers may ship organically grown Florida citrus fruit, as Special Purpose Shippers, with a conditional release from certain grade requirements issued under &sect;905.52 of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the provisions concerning special purpose shipments were made effective in 1978, there were no laws governing organic fruit and vegetable growers in Florida. A ``Special Purpose Shipper'' was defined under the marketing order as one who had certified that they would handle only citrus fruit which they knew from their own personal knowledge was produced on trees on which only compost, non-acidulated fertilizer such as rock phosphate, dolomite, or ground limestone is used, and to which no chemical insecticide or fungicide had been applied. However, the State of Florida now requires all organically grown fruits and vegetables to be certified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended redefining the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' in &sect;905.146 to mean a person who handles Florida citrus fruit that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically grown under Florida law. This definition reflects that organic fruit has been certified under Florida law, and also provides additional assurance that shippers claiming organic status and utilizing the grade standards for organic fruit qualify to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Florida law, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licenses independent third parties to act as certifying agents. Growers who intend to sell organic fruit make an application to a certifying agent. The certifying agent inspects and certifies a grower's acreage as being in accordance with Florida law and issues the grower a certificate. The certificate number is transferred to a trip ticket which accompanies any shipments of fruit grown on the certified acreage. When the handler receives the shipment, a copy of the trip ticket is provided to the state inspector indicating that the fruit is certified organic and can be packed using the applicable organic grade standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee also recommended that &sect;905.146 be revised to require Special Purpose Shippers to certify that they will limit their shipments of organically grown citrus fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruits. This replaces the requirement that only outlets registered and approved by the committee could receive such fruit and ends the requirement that receivers of special purpose shipments complete the applicable sections of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language in &sect;905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for clarity, and procedural safeguards are being added to &sect;905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates of Privilege.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the exemption provisions for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Departmental view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form, taking about .04 hour to complete each report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

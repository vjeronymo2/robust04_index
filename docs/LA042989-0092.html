			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS PITCHER SETS HIGH SCHOOL RECORD WITH HIS 51ST CONSECUTIVE VICTORY  </P> <P> Brenham's Jon Peters pitched the fifth no-hitter of his career and remained  unbeaten as a high school pitcher Friday night, winning his 51st game and  setting a national record for consecutive victories.  </P> <P> Peters struck out 11 in five innings and ended the game on a dramatic note by  driving in the final run in a 10-0 victory over A&amp;M Consolidated. Peters'  fifth-inning single ended the game on the 10-run rule.  </P> <P> Peters broke the record of 50 consecutive victories by Timmy Moore of McColl,  S.C., who attended the record-breaking game and threw out the first pitch.  </P> <P> "I never thought we'd come this far to break this record," Peters said after  being mobbed by his teammates at first base. "I'm just glad it's over. Now  maybe we can relax and just play baseball.  </P> <P> "We still have a chance at another state championship and that's what we're  aiming for now."  </P> <P> The Cubs have won an unprecedented three consecutive Class 4-A titles.  </P> <P> Moore set the record in 1977-80, pitching for McColl, but he didn't know he had  a national record until last year when Peters' streak was publicized  nationally.  </P> <P> Peters tied Moore's record April 21 when he pitched a two-hitter.  </P> <P> Peters, who has signed a scholarship agreement with Texas A&amp;M, has not lost  a game since the final game of his Little League career when Brenham lost to  Taiwan in the semifinals of the 1985 Little League World Series.  </P></p>

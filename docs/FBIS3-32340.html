			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 6 Feb (AFP) -- In an interview  published by the local newspaper LA JORNADA, Zapatist rebel  leader "Marcos" said the Mexican guerrillas intend to negotiate  an "autonomy law" for Indians and discuss "the agrarian topic."    In the interview conducted in the mountains of southeastern  Mexico, the military strategist of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) said the rebels do not intend to take  over power with weapons, which they have obtained "without  foreign support." He said the main "detonator" of the 1 January  Chiapas uprising was the land problem and, especially, reforms  to Article 27 of the Constitution, by which the government of  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari limited the existence of  ejidos [a form of land tenure] in the area inhabited by more  than 1 million Indians.    "These reforms canceled all legal possibilities of having  access to land," and they "closed the door on Indians surviving  in a legal and peaceful manner," according to "Marcos." He added  that "the agrarian problem should once again be discussed."  Salinas' reforms should be eliminated as "a first step in  opening wider discussions aimed at keeping the countryside in  mind."    He added that during the dialogue with the government, the  date and place of which has still not been decided, the EZLN  will call for the establishment of an "autonomous region similar  to what the Basques or Catalans have [in Spain]" in order to  attenuate the Indian communities' "distrust" toward the  government. "We must negotiate an autonomy statute where our  government and our administrative structure will be acknowledged  by the Mexican government and we may live together without  anyone interfering with us," "Marcos" asserted.    After denying that the Chiapas Catholic Church had supported  the guerrillas ("there was not even consent"), the rebel leader  stated that the "Zapatist thunder of thousands" of Indians came  after the "failure" of legal mechanisms to guarantee  participation, self-government, and food self-sufficiency in the  region. "If the Indians decided to organize cooperatives, right  away they were lambasted. If they decided to organize to demand  land, they were rejected. If they organize to take over land by  force, they are killed. They have no health facilities; they  are dying," he commented.    Although he denied that the Zapatists intend to take over  power by force, the guerrilla leader did say that the EZLN does  favor "a national revolutionary movement" and that their demands  "are nation-wide [nacionales]."    With respect to the origins of the weapons under guerrilla  control and reports that they had been training for the past ten  years, he indicated that the weapons were obtained by  "stockpiling bit by bit" -- "black market" weapons seized by the  police from drug traffickers, weapons taken from the "white  guards [guardias blancas]" (paramilitary) working for the  region's farm owners, and rudimentary hunting weapons used by  the peasants.    "Marcos," whom reporters describe as a 40-year-old mestizo  pointed out that the weapons in the hands of the EZLN consist of  (Russian manufactured) AK-47 and (U.S. made) M-16 rifles, German  UZI machine-guns, as well as lower caliber hunting rifles. He  also added that the EZLN "originated as a self-defense group."    The rebel leader, whose identity is still not known, said he  is a "by-product" of the 1968 Mexican student movement and  "everything else that came afterwards, mainly election fraud."  He did not specify when he decided to go to the southeastern  mountains but did indicate that he takes orders from an Indian  group that makes up the EZLN "General Command." "Marcos" added  that he became "subcommander" only after being a junior  lieutenant, lieutenant, second captain, and then first captain.</p>

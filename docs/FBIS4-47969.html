			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The cease-fire in Liberia's ethnic conflict between  two factions of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy  in Liberia] has apparently failed to take hold. Frontline  commanders of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn soldiers and Alhaji  Koromah's Mandingo forces signed a deal late on Friday [6 May]  to cease hostilities and allow African peacekeepers to move into  the battle area. But there seems to be some doubt about whether  the signatories had the authority to agree to a cease-fire, and  clashes have continued. Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report  from Monrovia:    Troops of the African peacekeeping force deployed along the  Tubmanburg highway confirmed today that four fighters have been  badly wounded there in renewed fighting. They said two  fighters, one from the Krahn and one from the Mandingo side,  were badly wounded, one with fragments of grenade in his right  thigh, another with his wrist chopped off. They confirmed that  units of the African peacekeeping force were prevented on  Saturday from going into the area by the fighting.    Frontline commanders of the opposing sides signed a  cease-fire agreement on Friday and pledged to allow a free flow  of traffic to all people residing in the area. They also  pledged to give troops of the African force free passage in and  out of western Liberia, which is controlled by ULIMO, which has  for the past two months been beset by ethnic clashes. However,  Thomas Ziah, a die-hard supporter of the Krahn faction leader  Roosevelt Johnson, told me at his residence, with Johnson by his  side, that Krahn frontline commanders who signed the agreement  on Friday had done so without their authority.    It seems likely that the current round of fighting will  further narrow prospects to any breakthrough in talks on Monday  between the two ULIMO faction leaders, Roosevelt Johnson and  Alhaji Koromah.</p>

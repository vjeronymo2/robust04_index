			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Two more held for Austrian bombings The Austrian police have arrested two more suspects bringing to four the number of people held in connection with last week's letter-bombing campaign in Austria. Several people, including Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's Social Democratic mayor, were injured in the campaign which was aimed against human rights activists and politicians sympathetic to the plight of immigrants. Two men, both with connections to an illegal Austrian neo-Nazi organisation, were arrested last Thursday, and since then investigations have focused on the shadowy world of neo-Nazi groups in Austria and Germany. The German police are co-operating closely with the Austrian police in the search for possible German neo-Nazi links in the bombing campaign. Nothing is known of the latest suspects as the authorities are maintaining a news blackout on their investigations. Until now, Austria had been relatively free of the racist violence seen elsewhere in Europe. Many Austrians have grown increasingly concerned at the large influx of immigrants since the collapse of the communism in eastern and central Europe and the onset of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, but the letter-bomb campaign shocked a public unused to political violence and brought widespread sympathy for the victims.</p>

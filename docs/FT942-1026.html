			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Euro-sceptics warn PM to hold out There was unmistakeable euphoria among Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday over Mr John Major's blocking of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the new EU president. But there was also a warning for the British prime minister: he must be prepared to use the veto again or risk losing their support. Britain's Euro-sceptics, who outnumber Euro-enthusiasts in the Conservative party, are delighted but could quickly turn on Mr Major if he allows another federalist to take Mr Dehaene's place at next month's European summit. Mr Michael Carttiss, a leading Euro-sceptic summed up: 'If in July the prime minister gives way to another federalist he will be finished.' It is a view also shared by some centrist backbenchers. 'If by standing firm Mr Major secures the appointment of a president who is acceptable to both wings of the party he will have done himself enormous good,' said another Tory MP. 'But if the prime minister caves in to another federalist he will be in a worse position.' Sir John Hannam, secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, said: 'If the use of Britain's veto leads to the appointment of a compromise candidate, as appears to be the case, then this should satisfy the Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans.' Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, remains confident that the issue of a replacement for Mr Jacques Delors, EU president, will be quickly resolved, and that a candidate acceptable to all 12 EU states can be found. Speaking on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost he said there was no question of Britain accepting a renewed bid by Mr Dehaene, who stood for the 'out-of-date' ideas of government intervention and centralising power in Europe. By making it clear he will not accept Mr Dehaene as EU president, irrespective of whether Belgium puts his name forward again, Mr Hurd hopes the Euro-Sceptics will continue to be pacified. Downing Street was pleased that Mr Major's stance was praised yesterday by so many leading Euro-sceptics. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor and a critic of the government, said: 'The prime minister's insistence that the next president of the European Commission should be acceptable to all member states will have the support of all Conservatives.' Mr James Cran, another Euro-sceptic, predicted backbenchers would be 'humming the government's tune'. He said: 'The prime minister listened to his members, most of whom will applaud what he has done. The role of the UK is to act as a sceptic.' But the Euro-enthusiasts of the Tory Positive European group had a warning of their own: 'The Euro-sceptics are a fickle group' said one pro-European Tory MP. 'They have backed him before only to castigate him once he backs down. And Mr Major will have to accept a federalist of some sorts at the next summit'. The government climbdown earlier this year over qualified majority voting enraged the Euro-sceptics who were led to believe that the prime minister would resist the new voting procedure. A number of backbenchers believed that the prime minister had little option but to use the veto since the Conservatives had made it an issue in the European elections. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, yesterday said the Corfu summit showed that the Tories were the only party prepared to use the UK's veto. But having used it once, the prime minister may be under pressure to use the veto again as the price for the continued support of the Euro-sceptics.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial] </F>   [Text] "The bad loan issue has already peaked out. We would  like to dispose of the issue in another two years." These words  were spoken by the majority of the banks in announcing earnings  reports for the year ending in March 1994, but despite thoughts  of "danger passed and God forgotten," the financial system is  still plagued by old and new problems that threaten its future.    Certainly, in comparison to fiscal year 1992, the total of  failed loans and extended loans held by 21 city banks, long-term  trust banks, and trust and banking companies was 13.57 trillion  yen, which appeared to show a peaking out of such problem loans.  Sales of loans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co.  increased significantly, while transfers into the loan  amortization special accounts which represent an indirect form  of amortization "were effected to the maximum" along with direct  amortization, bringing the total value of loans disposed of to  3.46 trillion yen.    The Ministry of Finance [MOF] increased options for early  disposal of bad loans by authorized special-purpose companies to  absorb bad loans of affiliated nonbanking institutions. Although  we can appreciate such strenuous joint government and  private-sector efforts, the Japanese financial system still  represents a "Pandora's box."    The old problem consists of the aid being extended to the  housing loan companies, which have a very fragile structure. The  seven housing loan companies are in the process of undergoing a  10-year restructuring program, but delays in recovery of asset  values have caused widening deviations from projections. Since  fiscal year revenues and profits have failed to grow because its  share of the home loan business--which is their primary source  of income--has been diverted to the public Housing Loan  Corporation, loans extended to the housing loan companies will  have to undergo decisions on reductions and exemptions of  liabilities and extension of new loans within a year of the  initial aid actions.    Institutions facing difficult situations include weakly  structured agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial  institutions. Whether action is taken to either save or  liquidate them through the use of public funds which were  supposedly suspended, the situation is such that the housing  loan companies, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial  institutions and MOF and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries--which are the supervising agencies--can no longer  postpone action "by allowing time to idly pass by."    The problems are not limited to the housing loan companies.  There is the risk that hidden bad loans will surface because of  the failure of businesses whose loans were subject to reduced or  exempted interest payments. In the last fiscal year, Nippon  Trust Bank was forced to avoid a recurring loss by using an  emergency, evasive manipulative action which accounted for an  indirect amortization action as a special loss rather than as  other recurring expenses.    The new problem is represented in the fact that the Japanese  financial system has undermined the efficiency of the capital  distribution function. Amortization of loans through the use of  undeclared profits in stocks required supporting the stock  markets through the use of government-created stock valuations.  As a result, the new issues markets have been distorted by  restraints on issues at market prices and capital markets have  been compromised in terms of their capital-raising functions. A  good example of that situation is that many city banks which are  awaiting establishment of securities subsidiaries have hesitated  to issue preferred stock based on a feeling of being constrained  by the MOF's Securities Bureau.    Thus, the financial institutions have regressed to ancient  systems. Banks rely heavily on indirect financing and securities  firms are hesitant about the moves toward securitization. If  direct financing fails to function properly, capital including  the average business will not be able to take risks.    The absence of risk capital caused banks and securities  firms  to assume a negative stance saying, "There is no requirement,"  relative to the MOF's Banking Bureau's program for promoting the  liquidity of bonds. However, banks no longer have the financial  strength to assume market risks which need to be placed  somewhere. We believe that structural deficiency is reflected in  the slow pace of loans referred to as "hesitancy to loan" and  "hesitancy to borrow," especially as the substance of the  capital investment recession.    The regression to ancient systems on the part of financial  institutions has delayed the recovery of and undermined the  Japanese economy. If financial institutions decide to sit back  and relax in this period of "financial disaffection" until the  disposal of excessive loan problems, it just may prove that they  will have failed to take essential, timely actions.</p>

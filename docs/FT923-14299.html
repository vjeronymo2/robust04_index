			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government moves to quash speculation over sterling and ERM devaluation THE GOVERNMENT moved yesterday to quash speculation that a decision to move sterling into the EC exchange rate mechanism's narrow band might be accompanied by devaluation. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a parliamentary written answer that sterling would move to the narrow band 'in due course' at the current central rate of DM2.95. His reply foreshadowed a detailed defence later this week of sterling's place in the ERM by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Lamont plans to use a speech in London on Friday to emphasise that the mechanism offers the prospect of permanent success in the fight against inflation. He will argue that any move to devalue the pound or leave the ERM to give a short-term boost to the economy would wreck that ambition.</p>

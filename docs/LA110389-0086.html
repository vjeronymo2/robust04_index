			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> HENDERSON OPTS FOR FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson filed for free agency Thursday, five days after leading the  Oakland Athletics to their first World Series championship in 15 years.  </P> <P> Henderson, the A's left fielder, who was the most valuable player of the  American League playoffs, returned to his hometown of Oakland on June 20 when  the New York Yankees traded him for pitchers Eric Plunk and Greg Caderet and  outfielder Luis Polonia. His agent, Richie Bry, said Thursday that Henderson's  first choice was to re-sign with the A's, the team he began with in 1979.  </P> <P> Nine other players filed Thursday, increasing the number of free agents to 55.  Also filing were Bob Brenly, Mike Krukow and Candy Maldonado of the National  League champion San Francisco Giants; Bob Forsch, Greg Gross and Dan Schatzeder  of the Houston Astros; Frank DiPino of the St. Louis Cardinals; Sal Butera of  the Toronto Blue Jays; and Don Aase of the New York Mets. A total of 116  players are eligible for free agency and they have until Nov. 13 to file.  </P> <P> Henderson rejected a $7.2-million, three-year offer from the Yankees before  they traded him to Oakland. He is believed to be asking for more than $3  million a year.  </P> <P> "I have a meeting scheduled with Sandy Alderson on the 15th of November in San  Francisco," Bry said. "I would say that all things being equal, Rickey  certainly would like to stay in Oakland and finish his career there. His home  is there and his family is there. This may be his last major contract and so he  has to capitalize on it for his family."  </P> <P> Henderson hit .247 with the Yankees with 25 stolen bases. With the A's, he  batted .294 with 52 stolen bases in 58 attempts. He stole eight bases in the  playoffs and three more in the World Series, batting nine for 19 against San  Francisco with a double, a triple and a home run.  </P> <P> "I have a starting figure, which I'm not going to disclose, and I have a rather  set pattern of dealing with free agents, which I think is extremely fair to the  home club if the player wants to go back," Bry said. "I do not try to create a  bidding war. That's not my philosophy of doing a free-agent contract. "Once you  begin discussions with other clubs, it's not shopping. If some club meets a  predetermined figure, which may be higher and which may not be, then the player  signs. You don't run back and forth trying to run one club against the other."  </P> <P> Henderson said two weeks ago that he might go back to the Yankees for the right  money.  </P> <P> "I had a great time in New York," he said. "I would consider going back, but I  hope I'm back here."  </P> <P> Bry said Thursday that Henderson would deal only with Oakland for the time  being.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned," Bry said, "I'm glad to give Sandy whatever time he  feels he needs."  </P></p>

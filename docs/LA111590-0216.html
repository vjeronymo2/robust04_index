			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> FAIR FARM: IT OFFERS A LOT TO LEARN  </P> <P> Crops of peanuts, kiwis and rhubarb -- rarely seen in Orange County -- mingle  with the traditional crops of corn and lima beans on a small farm in the middle  of urban Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The unusual crops were planted because the children who visit this one-acre  farm on the Orange County Fairgrounds are fascinated by them, supervisor Kevin  Arnett said. And this farm exists to fascinate children.  </P> <P> Centennial Farm was an employee parking lot in the corner of the fairgrounds  when fair officials decided to turn it into an educational tool. Tours of  students and adults come through three times a day now to see something that is  rapidly disappearing from urban Orange County.  </P> <P> "We grow everything," Arnett said. "Anything we can try to grow, we grow  because of the interest to our kids."  </P> <P> On the tours, guides usually ask the children where they think bread or  Cheerios come from. The children usually can trace their food only as far as  the store, Arnett said.  </P> <P> About 25 to 30 crops are rotated as the seasons change, Arnett said. Eggplants  the size of small onions are starting to hang over their wire supports and  bright orange pumpkins look ready to take away.  </P> <P> Most of the crops have historical significance, Arnett said. "Lima beans at one  time were the number one crop in Orange County and strawberries are now the  number two crop."  </P> <P> The food goes to low-income employees at the fairgrounds, some of whom actually  help grow it, and to two local shelters for the poor, Arnett said.  </P> <P> Students who visit the farm are offered chicks for free, while other animals,  such as pigs, rabbits, sheep and goats are sold to local youths for their use  in 4-H and Future Farmers of America, Arnett said.  </P> <P> Baby chicks are hatched almost daily in the incubators, and all the animals are  tame enough for the children to pet and hold.  </P> <P> The Fair Board has budgeted $100,000 each year for planting the crops,  maintaining the animals, acquiring antique farm equipment and building  permanent structures such as the livestock pens and the barn.  </P> <P> The farm sees a wide variety of students, with those from preschool to second  grade the most predominant visitors. Because of its design -- wide, level roads  that make it easy on wheelchairs -- the farm is also popular among special  education classes, said Michelle McKnight, a part-time employee who schedules  and conducts tours.

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / The tone of racial abuse: The perils and frustrations of being a black man in South Africa At the sight of me, the white policeman flew into a rage, gesturing wildly, his eyes burning as I approached. Although his language was mostly Afrikaans, I could still recognise the tone of racial abuse. Seeing the pistol strapped to his waist, I abandoned plans to ask him for directions to Johannesburg's World Trade Centre, where historic talks on a new constitution for 'a democratic, non-racial South Africa' were taking place. I jumped back into the car and, trembling, drove on to find another way to the centre. I had read the books, seen the television pictures and spent time talking to friends and contacts, yet nothing adequately prepared me for South Africa. In a country where colour is everything, the first thing I had to contend with was being black. That incident was to be the first of many ironies and inconsistencies during my two-month stay. South Africa had fascinated me since I first became aware of apartheid as a child in Uganda. Although discouraged by anti-apartheid campaigners from visiting South Africa, questions kept churning in my mind. What had apartheid done to the non-white population? Was it true that the blacks in South Africa were better off than those in the rest of the continent - an argument that was often used by government officials to justify the regime? What did it mean to be called an honorary white? The 1980s had brought the first cracks in the gospel of apartheid. In 1990, formerly proscribed parties were no longer banned and Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress was freed. Negotiations between former enemies began and last year the date for the first non-racial election was set: April 27 this year. I felt it was time to witness the changes at first hand. The first of the many ironies became apparent in the suburb I was to visit with two white friends. It used to be termed a 'white' area until the Group Areas Act was abolished in 1989. I had seen several black people in the area. Society had really changed, I thought, but reality soon dawned when I learned that most of the blacks I had seen were domestic staff working in the area. In the course of my stay, it was commonplace to be ignored by white people as only my white colleagues were spoken to. When I was not being ignored I was being insulted. A manager at a gold mine on the outskirts of Johannesburg decided to repeat slowly everything he told the other journalists, so that I could understand. I learned to cope with such petty aggravations - but there were more significant ones to come. I asked a white woman in Johannesburg about visiting Durban. She looked surprised and said: 'You must be careful of going to Durban as it is full of low-class black people.' A white male colleague tried to explain and said simply: 'You see, you are not from here. You are a black from overseas.' I was supposed to feel heartened by such sentiments. Yet, on several occasions this distinction was important. Just outside Johannesburg a white man refused to let me use a public phone as he had a series of calls to make. When I asked where the next phone was he looked up and said: 'Oh you must come from Britain. Here, come and use the phone.' Even more startling was the extent to which apartheid had taken hold in the minds of black people. Among professionals, only around 5 per cent of management positions and less than 1 per cent of senior executive positions are occupied by black people. Yet, at a conference I attended for black managers and executives, the agenda was derailed as delegates argued about who was black and who was not for the purposes of affirmative action. On learning you are a visitor, almost every white South African you meet is eager to impress upon you how things have changed. The frequency and promptness with which it is said, is almost convincing until you ask them if they have been to a township, or had extensive contacts with black people, other than their domestic staff. The reply is often a mumbled 'no' as the conversation is moved on. White guilt for the evils of apartheid appears to be the new disease. On a visit to a tea estate in the north-east of the country, one white manager told me: 'We were among the first companies to introduce affirmative action in South Africa nearly 12 years ago. Today nearly 70 per cent of the management staff is black.' But not one of the 10 or so senior management present was black and none of the management appeared to have noticed the fact. Cape Town, home of the country's parliament, proved to be more friendly than Johannesburg and more or less incident free. For the first time I began to feel as relaxed as one can ever be in a foreign country. But as I left South Africa, all I could feel was an overwhelming sense of anger, and frustration at the humiliation any black person still has to endure; and because after more than 30 years of independence, South Africa had squandered the opportunities which few other countries on the African continent could match. The frustration came from trying to understand how the world could have let apartheid happen, and how the consequences of the experiment will last for generations.</p>

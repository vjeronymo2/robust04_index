			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRAY'S TIME RAN OUT AFTER FIRING OF HARTER  </P> <P> On the day Dick Harter was fired as the Charlotte Hornets' coach, 7-foot center  Stuart Gray knew his days on that expansion team were numbered. So there were  no surprises Thursday when Gray was traded to the New York Knicks for a  second-round draft pick.  </P> <P> Gray, a former Kennedy High standout, was acquired by the Hornets from the  Indiana Pacers at the urging of Harter, who had worked with Gray while employed  as a Pacer assistant. But Harter was fired Jan. 31 and replaced by Gene  Littles.  </P> <P> Gray played in only one of the Hornets' next eight games -- for eight minutes.  </P> <P> "Once Dick was gone, (Charlotte management) wanted a witch hunt to get rid of  anyone he brought in," Gray said from New York on Friday night. "I was one of  them. (Jerry) Sichting (who was cut on Thursday) was another. And I don't think  they're through yet."  </P> <P> Gray, who averaged 2.6 points and 3.4 rebounds for the second-year Hornets, is  expected to back up Patrick Ewing with the Knicks.  </P> <P> Gray and his wife, Ruthanne, moved into a new home in Charlotte, N.C., just  last month.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to sell it," said Gray. "I like Charlotte. I have no  problems with Charlotte per se. It's the team that kinda disappointed me. The  (Charlotte) people, though, are great. They've really accepted the team there."  </P> <P> The Hornets are in last place in the Western Conference's Midwest Division. The  Knicks, on the other hand, lead the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division.  </P> <P> "I feel really good about the trade," said Gray, who plans to suit up for  Sunday's nationally televised game against the Detroit Pistons.  </P></p>

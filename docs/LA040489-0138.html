			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RIOT FOLLOWS MICHIGAN NCAA WIN;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN FANS' 5-HOUR RAMPAGE CAUSES DAMAGE, INJURIES  </P> <P> Thousands of fans went on a wild, five-hour rampage in the streets early today  to celebrate Michigan's first NCAA basketball championship, leading to eight  arrests, widespread property damage and several injuries.  </P> <P> It took riot-equipped State Police, Washtenaw County deputies, city police and  security officers from the University of Michigan until about 4 a.m. to control  the estimated 5,000 rowdy fans who wildly celebrated Michigan's 80-79 overtime  win over Seton Hall.  </P> <P> "The area's been cleared," Lt. Craig Roderick said in the predawn hours today.  "There's damage all over the place. We have not documented it, but it is  extensive to both public and private property."  </P> <P> He said eight of the rowdy fans were arrested and an undetermined number of  others were injured from flying beer and liquor bottles as well as rocks.  </P> <P> During the spontaneous celebration, an awning on the China Gate restaurant was  pulled down, a main traffic light was destroyed and a Detroit television  station van had its windows smashed and tires slashed.  </P> <P> At least one car was overturned, numerous windows were smashed, street signs  were torn down and the pavement was littered with glass from broken beer  bottles.  </P> <P> One Ann Arbor police officer was rushed from the scene shortly after the melee  began and was successfully treated for chest pains, Roderick said.  </P> <P> Shortly after Rumeal Robinson made two free throws to guarantee Michigan its  first national basketball title, thousands of Michigan fans stormed out of  restaurants, bars and dorms to begin their celebration.  </P> <P> Police responded quickly, blocking off a central part of the campus to  vehicular traffic. Within an hour, campus and city police called for  reinforcements from State Police and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "It's a mess," Roderick said as the size and activity of the crowd swelled. For  the next couple of hours, it was pretty much a standoff between police and the  fans.  </P> <P> Fireworks filled the sky, at times, and some of the fans stripped off their  clothes while perched on rooftops along South University Road on campus.  </P></p>

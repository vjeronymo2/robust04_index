			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices paid at wool auctions this week increased steadily, and with offerings declining in the closing stages of the selling season it became more difficult to imagine a setback. The Australian market indicator reached 587c/kg on May 5, a new peak for the season. Nervousness about stockpile offering to be offered by fixed schedule from July dissipated some time ago and the market is inclined now to assess this as a potentially strengthening rather than a weakening factor. The wool using industry is keeping busy but there is eagerness to see new business coming through at the higher prices now being paid for wool. After a long quiet period it is hoped that the latest dearer price trend is finally bringing out more buying interest. Currency volatility affecting the US and Australian dollars has disturbed price calculations during the past week.</p>

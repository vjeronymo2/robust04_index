			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, Muslim Brotherhood </F> spokesman, by reporter Muhammad Raghib; place and date not given]    [Text] [Raghib] Can you comment on President Mubarak's  remarks on the Muslim Brotherhood at the Book Fair?    [Al-Hudaybi] President Mubarak does not want to recognize  the  Muslim Brotherhood as a legal entity and says that he does not  know of anything called the Muslim Brotherhood. I do not  understand this, because the Brotherhood is a fact and a reality  known to every Egyptian who knows its long history. How can the  president not know about our existence?    [Raghib] How do you explain the president's nonrecognition  of  the Brotherhood?    [Al-Hudaybi] I do not know yet on what basis the president  denies our existence. He always stresses that he will never  recognize us, now or in the future. There is no way or  opportunity to meet him and discuss this issue and, at least, to  find out his reasons for not recognizing us.    [Raghib] Is there any hope that the Brotherhood will  participate in the national dialogue?    [Al-Hudaybi] Various and differing statements have been  issued by the Presidential Office. All of them call for the  political forces to participate in the dialogue. When Dr.  Usamah al-Baz, Foreign Ministry first under secretary and  director of the President's Office for political affairs, was  asked whether the Islamic groups will be invited to the  dialogue, he said it is a political and social necessity to  invite them and that all groups will be invited as long as they  adhere to the Constitution and the law and not to violence.  Ibrahim Nafi', chairman of the board and chief editor of  AL-AHRAM, also referred to this point in several articles he  wrote. We deduced from these articles that he had received  political instructions to emphasize the participation of the  political forces in the dialogue.    [Raghib] Do we understand from this that the optimistic  statements that came out at the beginning prompted you to  prepare to participate in the dialogue?    [Al-Hudaybi] We did in fact begin to prepare for the  dialogue. We participated with all the other opposition parties  in all the meetings that were held specifically to prepare for  this dialogue. We signed the opposition parties' statement  addressed to the regime.    [Raghib] Putting aside the nonrecognition, what is  preventing  you from submitting whatever action programs you have to the  dialogue if you are not able to participate in it?    [Al-Hudaybi] Like any active force in the nation, we could  contribute our ideas, cultural views, and capabilities on the  issues that will be raised in the dialogue, just like any  popular force that is active in issues that are of concern to  the people.    [Raghib] What is the reaction inside the Muslim Brotherhood  to your exclusion from the dialogue?    [Al-Hudaybi] We definitely regret this stand. We were hoping  that the dialogue would be a genuine national one, because such  a dialogue would embrace all the active forces in the homeland.  If you exclude one active force, you are contradicting the  principles of the democratic system. It would also mean that  the dialogue would encompass just a part of the homeland, not  all of it.    [Raghib] What has your group decided since the recent stand?    [Al-Hudaybi] We have no choice now but to obtain a license  to  register the Muslim Brotherhood Party. Issuing a license is not  in the hands of the Parties Committee [in the People's  Assembly], but is well within the powers of the president of the  republic himself.    [Raghib] But the regime opposes the establishment of an  Islamic party, so that the Copts will not ask to establish a  Christian party.    [Al-Hudaybi] The regime's justification is weak and  politically motivated. I believe there is no harm in  establishing a Christian party vis-a-vis an Islamic party. In  1948, and before the parties law was issued, the Muslim  Brotherhood was religiously and politically active without the  Copts demonstrating against it. On the contrary, relations with  them were very good, and they still are.    [Raghib] We all know about the Muslim Brotherhood's activity  before the revolution and until it clashed with the regime in  1954, when an edict dissolving it was issued. Why does the  group insist on engaging in political activity?    [Al-Hudaybi] Political action has always been part of the  Muslim Brotherhood's policy. We have no choice here; passages  in the Koran and Sunnah [Prophet Muhammad's sayings and deeds]  contain many provisions concerning government and politics.  Since the group was established in 1928, those of our religion  have proved their patriotism at all times.    [Raghib] Are you seeking to gain power?    [Al-Hudaybi] All political forces and parties seek power;  this right is not exclusive to a certain party or group. But  this should be done in a legitimate way through genuine  democracy and free elections. It is the right of every Egyptian  political force to seek power, and we are one of them.    [Raghib] The current Muslim Brotherhood is accused of being  an extension of the group's prerevolution military wing. What  about this? What about the linkage between the Muslim  Brotherhood and the acts of violence?    [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi forcefully denied this accusation,  saying it is intended to discredit the Muslim Brotherhood. He  said the current leaders of the group have nothing to do with  anything related to a military or underground organization. He  added:    [Al-Hudaybi] We work publicly, and I reject any linkage  between violence and the Brotherhood. It is well known that we  condemn terrorism and violence.    [Raghib] What about internal differences within the Muslim  Brotherhood?    [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi denied the existence of any blocs or  trends within the group, but he stressed that there is freedom  of opinion. He said it is impossible for the whole group to  have the same opinion.    [Raghib] What about your relations with Muslim Brotherhood  groups abroad?    [Al-Hudaybi] The Islamic Brotherhood emerged in Egypt.  People in various Arab and non-Arab countries then accepted its  principles either through books or immigration. They shared the  group's thought and policy and established groups in their own  countries. Here, we find great similarity in thought and way of  acting, but every group adapts according to the circumstances of  its country.</p>

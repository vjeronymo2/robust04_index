			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> SOVIETS SUSPECTED IN LOSS OF MISSILE PART  </P> <P> The Pentagon is investigating the loss of a flight data recorder from a  long-range atomic missile test in 1987 and there is a possibility the Soviets  may have recovered the device, the Pentagon said. The recorder would contain  valuable information about the performance of the Minuteman 2 missile,  according to the CBS Evening News, which first reported the story. The missile,  which carried a dummy warhead, was launched July 7, 1987, in a test shot from  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California toward Kwajalein Atoll in the western  Pacific. U.S. officials recovered 400 pounds of debris from a lagoon the next  morning and shipped it to the United States for analysis, CBS said. But the  45-day long analysis turned up no sign of the flight data recorder. CBS said  U.S. officials believe the Soviets, using a small submarine, took the nose  cone's classified package before the Americans got to the site.  </P></p>

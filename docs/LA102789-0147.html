			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER'S LATEST PARK PLAN REJECTED  </P> <P> The city's Recreation and Parks Commission has rejected the latest plans by  Mola Development for a new public park near the Hellman Ranch property and  wetlands.  </P> <P> Commission members turned the plan down because they felt it was confusing and  it seemed to contain inflated cost estimates.  </P> <P> The proposed park would be located on the southwest side of the city on land  adjacent to the Hellman Ranch property, where Mola Development has plans for a  new residential project.  </P> <P> Mola representative Kirk Evans agreed to prepare a more coherent cost analysis  in time for the next commission meeting, scheduled for Nov. 1.  </P> <P> But according to Evans, the estimated cost of developing the 15-acre park is  higher than the $1.1 million that was originally agreed upon because commission  members "are adding things onto it that weren't there before."  </P> <P> If the company included all the city's wishes, the cost of the park would  skyrocket to $1.9 million, he said.  </P> <P> The original plan, approved by the City Council in August, featured nine tennis  courts, a 3,300-square-foot duck pond, restrooms, two basketball courts and  landscaping, Evans said.  </P> <P> The revised proposal for park amenities, drafted by the park commission last  month, calls for eliminating the duck pond and one of the tennis courts and  adding a racquetball court, more grass areas, a sand volleyball court and two  horseshoe pits.  </P> <P> In addition, the proposal called for a 2,000-square-foot community building  complete with restrooms and a kitchen, a gazebo, a raised viewing area near the  adjacent wetlands, more parking spaces and a storage area.  </P> <P> Mola architects estimate that the commission's changes will increase the cost  of the project by $800,000, but according to Gregory Weiler, commission  chairman, part of the reason the cost is so high is that Mola's prices are  high.  </P> <P> "We may require an audit of this proposal by the city's Finance Department  before we can approve it," Weiler said. "The commission is very disturbed with  these numbers." MICHELLE NICOLOSI  </P></p>

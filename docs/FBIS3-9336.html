While 53 percent of those questioned believe Gypsies ought  to  be singled out, other minority groups cited as deserving special  legal attention are Vietnamese citizens living in the Czech  Republic, in the opinion of 6.3 percent, refugees (according to  5.8 percent) and skinheads (4.2 percent).    Thirteen per cent of respondents said they felt repeat  offenders and criminal elements should be placed lower on a  hierarchical scale before the law.    As regards the respondents' level of education, seventy-one  percent of people with basic education hold the above views, as  opposed to 56 percent of those with a school leaving certificate  and 50 percent of higher educational students.    The view that Romanies should face tougher laws seems to be  linked to indifference to the preservation of Romanies'  distinctive lifestyle. Only six per cent of people questioned  consider more care should be taken to respect Romanies' rights.    The poll was conducted by STEM, the Prague Empirical  Research  Center, in March. 1,627 people over the age of 18 were  questioned. A STEM poll carried out last May showed that only  one percent of Czechs trusted Gypsies and 72 percent said they  would find it very hard to tolerate having a Romany neighbor. As  many as 88 percent then said a Romany son- or daughter-in-law  would be totally unacceptable.</p>

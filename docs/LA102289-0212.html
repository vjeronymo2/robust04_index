			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA RUNS DOWN WASHINGTON ST., 23-21  </P> <P> A 53-yard run by Washington State's Steve Broussard may have been the game's  big play -- for Arizona.  </P> <P> Broussard raced down the sideline on the first play of the second quarter after  Alvin Dunn intercepted a George Malauulu pass.  </P> <P> Defensive back Richard Holt dragged down Broussard 10 yards from the goal line  and the Cougars had to settle for a field goal.  </P> <P> "The biggest key for the defense was stopping the run," Arizona Coach Dick  Tomey said after No. 22 Arizona held off the No. 15 Cougars, 23-21, Saturday in  a Pacific 10 Conference game.  </P> <P> Washington State "did some damage late and had two key plays, but Richard Holt  did an unbelievable job of running Steve Broussard down from behind."  </P> <P> Arizona, 5-2 overall and 4-1 in the conference, kept its Rose Bowl hopes alive  by holding the Cougars (6-2 and 3-2) to 67 yards rushing and intercepting four  passes from Aaron Garcia, who was sacked six times.  </P> <P> Darryl Lewis had two interceptions, and the second came with 1:37 left in the  game after the Cougars had driven to a first down at the Arizona 27. Garcia was  sacked the play before and hit by a blitz when he threw the interception on  third and 20.  </P> <P> Jeff Hammerschmidt's interception set up Doug Pfaff's third field goal, a  28-yarder that put the Wildcats ahead 23-19 with 5:03 left. Washington State  registered a safety with seven seconds remaining when Arizona punter John Nies  ran out of the end zone.  </P></p>

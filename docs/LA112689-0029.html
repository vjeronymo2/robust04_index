			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX AND IQ  </P> <P> The Constitution guarantees "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" to all  citizens, not just those who are "normal" and thereby declare themselves  non-handicapped and in some way superior.  </P> <P> The mind-set that by virtue of a three-digit IQ we are dominant beings elected  to oversee selective reproduction is not unlike the reasoning some half-century  ago when only the blond and blue-eyed were to be allowed to procreate.  </P> <P> As the writers of "L.A. Law" are so eloquently attempting to illustrate, the  mentally retarded can be quite capable of making decisions regarding  responsible sexual behavior if they are afforded the simple luxury of an  unbiased education.  </P> <P> Happily, some of my favorite people are dark-eyed. And some are mentally  retarded.  </P> <P> KATE CAHILL  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (AFP)--Chinese movie-maker Yin Li  confirmed Friday he had been blocked from travelling to the  Cannes Film Festival by the Chinese authorities, in a protest at  the screening of "To Live," a film by a fellow director that had  not received Beijing's official approval.    Yin, speaking by telephone, said he had been advised of the  decision on Thursday, three days ahead of the screening of his  own film, "The History of Xinghua," in the French Mediterranean  resort.    "The producers and the two leading actors of my film were  also informed that their exit visas from China had been  refused," he said.    Yin, 36, said he felt victimised by a decision that had  affected another film-maker, Zhang Yimou, who made "To Live."    "He's the one who's sick, and I'm the one getting the  treatment," he said.    The bar on Yin, which was initially reported in Cannes  Thursday, came after Zhang announced that he would not attend  the Cannes premiere of "To Live."    "Because my film ... has still not received its censors'  visa  in China, I am unable to come to the Cannes festival. I regret  this very much," a statement released by Zhang in Cannes said.    Zhang is director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern."    "To Live" tells the story of three generations of a family  living through the China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including  the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.    "The Story of Xinghua," filmed in northern China last year,  won approval for screening abroad from the Chinese censorship  board. The movie recounts the story of a grocer who makes a  fortune selling stones stolen from the Great Wall, but succumbs  to a tragic death in a treasure hunt under the wall.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / BBC and Pearson in TV launch The BBC and media group Pearson yesterday announced their plans to push ahead with the launch of two 24-hour European satellite television channels in January. One will be devoted to news and the other to entertainment. BBC Prime - a subscription service concentrating on drama, comedy, light entertainment, natural history and children's programming - will replace the BBC's existing European general programming. BBC World, to be financed by advertising, will offer news on the hour backed by current affairs, documentaries and factual programmes. Both channels, aimed mainly at continental European cable television networks, will be launched on January 26. Neither will be available in the UK although the BBC hopes to launch a 24-hour television news service for Britain. The launch is the first fruit of the strategic alliance announced earlier this year between the BBC and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Under the deal Pearson has agreed to meet the estimated cost of the two-channel venture of up to Pounds 30m, with the BBC contributing broadcasting expertise and programmes from its library. Mr Bob Phillis, chairman of BBC Worldwide, the corporation's international operating arm, said yesterday that there would be 'full transparency' and that the venture would pay market prices for BBC services and library programmes. At the moment the venture is a 50-50 one between Pearson and the corporation but talks are said to be at an advanced stage to bring in one or more additional investors who will hold a total stake of 20 per cent. Cox, the Altanta-based media group, is believed to be a potential partner. It founded UK Gold, a library channel for UK cable and satellite with the BBC and Thames Television, now a Pearson subsidiary. Neither the BBC nor Thames would give a projected breakeven date for the venture. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames and managing director of Pearson Television Holdings, said, however: 'This is not going to be profitable in two years' time.' It is believed that the timescale being envisaged is from five to seven years, although much depends on how quickly the new channels are accepted on European cable networks. The hope is BBC World will be in 10m homes in two years. The number of cable network subscribers is rising, according to figures from the Independent Television Commission. However, penetration levels - subscribers as a proportion of the population covered by the spreading cable networks - have increased only marginally. By October 1, 779,461 homes were connected to modern cable networks, a 50 per cent increase from last year. Most cable companies offer telephone services, and the number of lines installed by October 1 was 570,656. Nynex CableComms, one of the biggest cable operators, yesterday launched new low-cost phone services for business customers, to include free local calls to multisite subscribers with three or more Nynex lines per site. The average cloaks considerable variation in the performance of the 74 cable franchises.</p>

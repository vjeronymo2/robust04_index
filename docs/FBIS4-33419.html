			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The newspaper GRANMA today  published a commentary on the upcoming Ibero-American Summit,  describing it as a challenge and a commitment for participants.  The summit is scheduled to begin on Tuesday in Cartagena de  Indias, Colombia.    GRANMA, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of  the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that the time has come  to efficiently and independently revive, reaffirm, and establish  in concrete the course Ibero-America must follow.    The newspaper underscored the fact that the conference will  be held as a result of the U.S. Government's call for another  presidential summit, which will be held in Miami in December,  for the purpose of attacking, discrediting, and overshadowing  the results of the Ibero-American movement that is under way.    This situation creates for the presidents the undeniable  need  to reach a clear and definitive commitment in Cartagena that  will strengthen the community of Ibero-American nations and  establish a specific integration program, GRANMA said. Further  on, the commentary stated that this commitment is the only way  the countries attending the Miami summit can arrive as a group  that shares strong bonds and common goals.    GRANMA said that in Cartagena the presidents will not be  able  to avoid the issue of the U.S. economic and trade blockade  against Cuba, including the Torricelli Law, regarding which a  statement was issued at the past summit and two resolutions have  been issued by the UN General Assembly.    The commentary emphasizes that Cuba participates in these  forums with the moral and political authority it draws from its  huge efforts and social projects, which have achieved goals  which, for many, still constitute dreams or hopes and its proven  desire for integration.    Ibero-America knows, the newspaper underscored, that our  country is an unyielding champion of principles, such as  nonintervention, sovereignty, and self-determination, which are  not only deeply rooted but legally established and universally  accepted in international relations. The Ibero-American  countries, the commentary concludes, will once again have an  opportunity to examine urgent regional problems and the effects  and consequences that other worldwide problems have on this part  of the world, because, for them, this fourth summit is their  summit.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITER FAILS TO SEE ALL DIMENSIONS OF SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> I thought that I saw an exciting, hard-fought Super Bowl this year between two  evenly matched teams. After reading Bob Oates' analysis, I guess I stand  corrected.  </P> <P> First off, Oates states that Cincinnati peaked at midseason and that it  remained in this game only by virtue of San Francisco "misplays" (which  amounted to zero turnovers).  </P> <P> Then he pondered the question, "Will Super Bowl XXIII be remembered for the  49ers' mediocre performance in the first three quarters?"  </P> <P> I managed to pick up a pair of three-dimensional glasses to watch the halftime  show.  </P> <P> I'd like to know where Oates was able to find a pair of one-dimensional glasses  to watch the rest of the game.  </P> <P> PATRICK HUNT  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

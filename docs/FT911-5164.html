			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hunting declines 20% to Pounds 38.5m - Fall of Pounds 5.4m in defence division damages group performance HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil company, saw its pre-tax figure fall by more than 20 per cent from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 38.5m in the year to December 31. Turnover grew by 3 per cent to Pounds 771.3m, helped by increased sales of crude oil in Canada. The main reason for the profits fall was the defence division where operating profits slid by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said that this included rationalisation costs as 500 jobs were cut and a plant closure provided for. Small benefits had come from the Gulf crisis - for instance through orders for bomb retarders. But the much publicised use of Hunting's JP233 airfield attack weapons had been drawn from the forces' stocks, which were not significantly depleted. As expected, the JP233's contribution would fall back this year, Mr Miller said. This would be partly offset by new contracts, such as managing the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston, and international collaborations. In the non-defence areas, oil and technology declined to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 12.7m), in spite of the increased turnover of Pounds 399m (Pounds 327m). Recession in the UK hit sales of specialised products, such as the Hammerite range. Aviation was the only one of the three core divisions to improve, making Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.6m). The disposal of non-core businesses depleted the profit from other activities, which fell to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 5.2m). A couple of subsidiaries and property valued at Pounds 20m remained to be sold. The write-down in the value of assets for sale accounted for most of a Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 6.3m) extraordinary charge, said Mr Miller. Also included were the trading results of sold or for sale businesses and the related interest paid. This left Pounds 900,000 of interest received in the ongoing businesses, notably from the defence division. Fully diluted earnings per share were reduced to 23.5p (31.8p) and a recommended final dividend of 6p makes a total of 10p (9p). The retained profit dwindled to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 13.4m). COMMENT It will be nice to get a set of results from Hunting which are easy to compare with what has gone before. Last year's pre-tax profit, following the merger of three family-controlled companies, showed a 42 per cent increase, but on a pro forma basis. This time, figures that were above the line last year - including some interest paid - have been put below because of the disposal programme. The group's problem, however, remains the same: will aviation and oil and technology make up for the decline in defence? If yes, then when? The problem becomes more acute this year with the JP233 falling away, disposals delayed and parts of the group hit by recession. Compensating defence export orders remain a matter of optimism and a serious step-up in the non-defence businesses may not come until 1993. With pre-tax profit forecast to decline to Pounds 35m, a prospective p/e of 8, yesterday's closing price of 177p is supported by a yield of 7.5 per cent.</p>

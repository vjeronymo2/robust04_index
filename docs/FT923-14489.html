			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Mexican bank privatisations raise Dollars 12.9bn THE MEXICAN government has privatised its eighteenth and last bank by selling 66.3 per cent of the shares in Banco del Centro for 869,381m pesos. The privatisations will have raised 38,665bn pesos (Dollars 12.9bn) when all payments are made, far more than expected. The average bank was sold for 3.068 times book value and 14.75 historic earnings. In the US and Europe, banks are typically sold for 2.2 times book value and 14 times historic earnings, according to the Mexican Finance Ministry. The government sold 70.7 per cent of Banamex, the largest bank by assets, for 9,706bn pesos; 56 per cent of Bancomer, the second largest, for 8,559bn pesos; and 51 per cent of Serfin for 2,827bn pesos The most expensive bank relative to earnings was Banorie, which went for a multiple of 23.7. The bank sales appear to have been free of the corruption and string-pulling that have plagued many developing-country privatisations. But questions were raised when the winning bidder for Banco Somex pulled out, after his investors balked at the price he was to pay. The bank was immediately awarded to the second highest bidder.</p>

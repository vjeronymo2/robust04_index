			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: S&amp;N The market took a curiously grudging view of yesterday's results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle. If there was a reason for marking the shares down by nearly 1 per cent it was probably the 11 per cent fall in brewing profits. But if that was the worry, it was scarcely logical to mark up Bass by a similar amount. The weak beer market is a problem for everybody. A more plausible explanation is that Scottish has outperformed the sector recently on the back of its purchase of Chef &amp; Brewer. Having presumed that the deal would be made to work, investors were unlikely to be excited by news that everything is going according to plan. The 5 per cent like-for-like increase in turnover at Chef &amp; Brewer is certainly encouraging, but that probably flowed naturally from the economic upturn in the south of England and a better motivated management. The harder part is yet to come. In particular, Scottish will have to raise the profile of some its brands in the south if it is to reap the full benefits from the deal. McEwan's is not yet highly-prized by beer drinkers in Surrey. Scottish has other things going its way. There is still lucrative scope to increase food sales in its pubs; continental recovery and heavy bookings at its new Center Parc at Longleat promise to underpin growth in leisure profits. But it will take a year or so to prove that the Chef &amp; Brewer deal was as canny as its decision to get out of hotels and buy Center Parcs. The market does not look in a mood to countenance failure.</p>

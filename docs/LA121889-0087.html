			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPAN, U.S.S.R. TREATY TALKS FAIL  </P> <P> Japanese and Soviet negotiators trying to draft a treaty to formally end their  World War II hostilities wound up talks today with "absolutely no new points of  contact," a Foreign Ministry official said.  </P> <P> Although both governments have expressed a desire to improve their chilly  relations, the Japanese official said neither was willing to compromise on a  territorial dispute over several islands in the southern Kurile chain held by  the Soviets since the end of the war in 1945.  </P> <P> "There were absolutely no new points of contact," said the Japanese official.  He said the Soviet delegation called Soviet possession of the islands a  "postwar reality" and urged Japan to "assume a stance that recognizes the  results of the war."  </P></p>

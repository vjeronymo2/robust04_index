			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Jan (EFE) -- The newspaper LA RAZON  reported today that alleged Bolivian drug "kingpin" Isaac  Chavarria was arrested by the Special Antinarcotics Force  (FELCN) during a vast operation that included the arrests of  another 43 "important" drug traffickers.    According to LA RAZON, Chavarria's arrest was announced by a  "source close to the U.S. Embassy in La Paz."    The Interior Ministry announced that it will summon a news  conference within the next few hours to provide details about  the antidrug operation that led to Chavarria's arrest.    The Santa Cruz police department has reported that 18  persons  have been arrested over the last few hours in antidrug  operations conducted in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments.    During these operations the police confiscated several of  Chavarria's properties in Okinawa, a town settled by Japanese  immigrants located 40 km from Cochabamba.    Chavarria, a private pilot who is around 45 years old, was  involved in the "narcopictures" and "narcovideos" political  scandal that occurred at the end of the 1980's, which compelled  political parties to achieve agreements and bury investigations  on the alleged connections between political leaders and drug  traffickers. [passage omitted]    According to U.S. Embassy sources in La Paz cited by LA  RAZON, Chavarria became one of the largest drug traffickers  after Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez was arrested, and is presumably  one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the Colombian cartels.</p>

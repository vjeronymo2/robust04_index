			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Security comes with a lower income Sir, I have received from Barings and the TI Group an offer document for my Dowty shares. It promises me, in large type, 'greater security of income'. Not until an obscure small-type appendix, 29 pages later, does it reveal that my dividend income will fall by 40 per cent. I have the experience to spot this, and to judge whether the offer - in my particular circumstances - may, even so, be a good one. How many Aunt Agathas do? Why does the financial industry accept standards of behaviour that many people would regard as acceptable from a second-hand car dealer?

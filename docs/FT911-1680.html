			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Evans the candidate fights history  -Tory prospects for the Monmouth by-election THE WOMEN filling envelopes and ticking off charts in the Conservative central committee rooms in the little market town of Usk must be hoping Henry Ford was right when he said history is bunk. Mr Roger Evans, a 43-year-old London barrister with a five-star Welsh name, is defending a 9,350 Tory majority in this stunningly beautiful constituency at the bottom end of the Welsh marches, the golden triangle encompassed by Monmouth, Abergavenny and Usk, where the money of Wales lives. History is against Mr Evans. Not since October 1945 have the Tories won a by-election in Wales. And he is the third Mr Evans in a row to fight a by-election for the Tories - other Evanses lost in Ribble Valley and Neath. Four years ago, Sir John Stradling Thomas, whose death earlier this year precipitated the by-election on May 16, saw the opposition divided almost equally. Labour was slightly ahead of the then SDP candidate with 13,037 votes to ll,313. For either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to mount a challenge to the Conservatives, it must effectively wipe the other out. The contest has taken on additional significance coming so soon after the local council elections, and indications are that Labour's 38-year-old Huw Edwards, another good Welsh name and another outsider - he is a lecturer at Brighton Polytechnic - is taking votes in handfuls from the Liberal Democrats' Mrs Frances David, the only local among the three. An early poll suggested that Labour was winning not only this contest within a contest but also shading the Tories for first place. Labour is strongest where the constituency butts on to Newport and the bottom end of Gwent's industrial valleys, where the voters work, or get a living from, the nearby Llanwern steelworks or the new town of Cwmbran. Mr Edwards has not only to hold this base but also win votes from the disgruntled farmers who live in and around Welsh-sounding villages such as Llanfoist, Llantilio and Llangwm. Welsh sounding, but very English, with a lot of the voters commuting to Cardiff and Bristol. Apart from the market towns like Monmouth, Ragland, Abergavenny and Usk, Mr Edwards also has to win votes in the neat estates of Chepstow, where the Severn bridge touches down in Wales, which because of its cheaper housing has become something of a dormitory for Bristol. It is a big hill to climb. The poll tax has disappeared as an issue, and the main concern outside the farms, where there are worries over the drop in incomes, appears to be the future of the health service, which Labour is working to the full. Strangely, the Conservatives appear to campaigning in a low key, almost offhand. Welsh secretary Mr David Hunt has visited the constituency, as has party chairman Mr Chris Patten, but there is no evidence of the urgency needed if the party is not to suffer another Ribble Valley, where a much larger majority went up in smoke. Visually, too, there is a strange apathy among the Conservatives. As a country area the Tories normally put their candidate's window bills on posts, rather like estate agents' boards, along the roadside. In 1987 they were everywhere. Now, in most places, they are heavily outnumbered by the For Sale signs outside the houses of those seeking to move on. By contrast, Labour's headquarters in a former school in Chepstow is bursting with life. Not only are many big names paying a visit - Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Jack Straw, Dr Jack Cunningham, Mr Tony Blair, Ms Glenda Jackson  -but backbench MPs aplenty are there. Both the Greens and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists. are represented by Mr Mel Witherden, who has refused to be photographed in one of the many markets in case it offended his vegetarian supporters. Presumably, he would be happy with the farmers in their cabbage fields. If Mr Evans is looking for an omen there is one that might just come in handy. When the Tories last won a by-election in Wales, all those years ago, it was in Monmouth. The winner, the redoubtable Peter Thorneycroft went on to become Chancellor of the Exchequer and chairman of the Conservative party, and held the seat for 21 years. If he had known that perhaps even Henry Ford might have drawn a different conclusion.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / French drugs chief calls for new regime France requires a new industrial policy for its pharmaceuticals sector, said Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, president of Elf-Sanofi, yesterday. The company, France's second largest drugs group is a subsidiary of state-owned Elf Aquitaine, the oil concern due to be privatised at the beginning of next year, Paul Abrahams writes. French drugs groups' profitability over the last 20 years had been negligible compared with those of British or American companies, said Mr Dehecq. 'The lack of success has not been due to lack of innovation. Prices in France have been too low. There is no other reason for it. We must have a new convention between government and industry,' he told the Financial Times. Mr Dehecq said the government must pay higher prices for innovative products. To compensate for additional spending on new products, it was imperative a way was found to lower the prices of older drugs. The possibility of reducing the number of prescriptions should also be addressed. The government understood that innovation had to be rewarded and was leaning in this direction, added Mr Dehecq. Snip, the French pharmaceuticals manufacturers association, expects to conclude negotiations aimed at holding back drugs spending growth. France spends more per capita on drugs than any other European country. During the first six months this year, it spent Dollars 108 (Pounds 72.40) per head, compared with Dollars 46 in the UK. French doctors prescribe five times as many items as British doctors and six times as many as their Danish counterparts. However, French prices are among the lowest in Europe. The French market was the world's third largest last year, worth Dollars 12.26bn. For the first three quarters this year it grew 6 per cent, according to IMS International, the market research group.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Macedonia paves way for end of dispute over name MACEDONIA has agreed to join the United Nations with the temporary prefix of 'former Yugoslav republic,' opening the way for its nomenclature dispute with Greece to be settled through international arbitration. UN recognition, even under the interim name, will make it possible for Macedonia to resume full-scale trading with western Europe after a year of problems in securing credit from banks abroad because of its uncertain status. A UN Security Council resolution, proposed by Britain, France and Spain, also provides for Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairmen of the Yugoslav peace process, to supervise a swift arbitration procedure to find a compromise name, such as New Macedonia, acceptable to Greece. Although Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek prime minister, launched the idea of arbitration, he faces a difficult task this weekend in persuading his party's nationalist faction to accept the UN resolution. Talks on confidence-building measures, based on proposals put forward last year by the European Community, are to be held in parallel with the arbitration process. The main obstacle to a rapprochement between the two neighbours is Greece's insistence that Macedonia should change its flag, which carries an emblem associated with King Alexander the Great. Greece also wants Macedonia to change its constitution, to avoid implying that there is a Macedonian minority living in northern Greece. Macedonia is anxious to get guaranteed access to the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, its nearest outlet to the sea.</p>

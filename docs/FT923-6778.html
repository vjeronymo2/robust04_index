			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Norway studies options to assist Uni Storebrand THE Norwegian government is studying 'options' to help Uni Storebrand, the insurance company, out of its financial difficulties. However Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, yesterday ruled out the government becoming a 'major owner' of Uni Storebrand, but he did not rule out 'indirect' intervention should Uni need it. Uni Storebrand's shares closed yesterday at a new low of NKr15.50. State intervention in Uni Storebrand is being considered because the authorities believe a NKr1.5bn (Dollars 263.1m) to NKr2bn capital expansion planned for the autumn will fail due to uncertainty surrounding the company since it acquired a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia last year. Uni Storebrand joined forces with Hafnia in an unsuccessful bid to take over the Swedish group. Meanwhile, turbulence continued to affect Scandinavian financial markets in the wake of Wednesday's decision by Hafnia to suspend debt payments and restructure its operations. In Norway, the Oslo share index fell 3.5 per cent over investors' fears that the Norwegian government could be forced to increase its interests in Norwegian financial institutions. Den norske Bank A-shares dropped 38.5 per cent to a record low NKr2 as free shares fell 50 per cent to NKr3. Analysts said that DnB's half-year results presented on Wednesday were far worse than the market had expected. In Copenhagen the Danish KFX index of the country's 20 leading shares fell 1.08 to 79.28, which is the first time it has closed below 80. The index has fallen by 20 per cent in the past 10 weeks. The share values of Denmark's largest insurance group Baltica Holdings, in which Hafnia holds a 34.5 per cent stake, fell 6 points yesterday in Copenhagen to 395. In Stockholm, Skandia shares fell SKr2 to SKr69. Expansion policy fails, Page 12 Prolific likely to part from parent, Page 16 World stock markets, Page 29</p>

While the party has not changed its basic policy of  supporting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition  government, its members are beginning to lament that "You end up  being the bad guy for working hard to sustain the  administration; all your efforts are wasted," (according to a  leading Shinseito member.) Some members have even called for a  revision of political strategy focused on the next round of  political realignment.    However, meanwhile, the ruling parties have to cooperate to  steer through the current Diet session. It is still difficult  to draw up a vision for the future. As the polarization in the  ruling parties gets under way, Shinseito, which still needs to  go into electoral cooperation with the ruling parties for the  upper house elections of July 1995 and lower house elections  under the single-seat constituencies system, is bound to be  plagued by lingering concerns.    At a general meeting of Shinseito Diet members on 4 March,  Norio Sugiyama, in charge of the budget in the House of  Representatives, said: "If something goes wrong, this Diet  session may see the end of the administration. The Liberal  Democratic Party has replaced its executive members [of the  Budget Committee] with hardliners, and is poised to boycott  committee deliberations. If we are always criticized whether or  not we do anything, we might as well become Buddhas."    One upper house member also said, "There is the question of  quantity and quality in the cabinet. The prime minister chose  quantity. While we will still support the administration, we  may not work as hard as before." He hinted at the possibility  of a subtle change in the party's political stance in the future.    Shinseito realized even at the time of the inauguration of  the administration that a confrontation with the social  democratic and liberal forces might surface sooner or later.  However, the truth is, it wants "things to stay as they are at  least until the lower house elections under the single-seat  constituencies system," (according to a senior party official.)  Others are optimistic that a decisive split can be avoidable  through electoral cooperation among all the ruling parties,  saying "Support or opposition to the cabinet reshuffle will not  be the determining factor for a decisive polarization. Even the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, the Democratic Social Party,  and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] are not one monolithic group."    For better or for worse, Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is  still the key person in the party. He has not appeared in  public since the afternoon of 2 March, after the prime minister  announced he was giving up plans to reshuffle the cabinet.  Ozawa did not also attend the plenary session of the House of  Representatives on 4 March, where the government's key policy  speeches were delivered.    There is speculation that Ozawa is making a silent protest  to  the prime minister. However, one of his close aides explained,  "He is not angry. He is thinking of the next step, and is quite  irritated that he cannot see clearly what the future holds."    It would be interesting to see what strategy Ozawa will come  up with to deal with the next act of the political drama after  his advise was not heeded in the decision process on the cabinet  reshuffle, a crucial "turning point of the administration."</p>

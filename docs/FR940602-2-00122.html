			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each of the Funds is a registered open-end management investment company. The Adviser serves as the Funds' investment adviser, and the Distributor serves as the Funds' principal underwriter. In accordance with the terms of an exemptive order, certain of the Funds offer multiple classes of shares with front-end sales loads, and in certain instances, contingent deferred sales charges (``CDSCs''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Each of the existing Funds has adopted a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Oppenheimer Management Corporation, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19821 (Oct. 28, 1993) (notice) and 19894 (Nov. 23, 1993) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Trust is a registered unit investment trust that will offer units in series (``Trust Series''), each of which will contain shares of one of the Funds that normally are offered with a sales load and U.S. Government zero coupon obligations (``zero coupon obligations''). The Trust's objective is to provide protection of capital while providing for capital appreciation through investments in zero coupon obligations and shares of the Funds. Each Trust Series will be organized pursuant to a trust indenture which will incorporate a master trust agreement relating to the entire Trust and which will name a qualified bank as trustee (the ``Trustee''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Each Trust Series will be sponsored by the Sponsor, who will perform the functions typical of unit investment trust sponsors, including: depositing fund shares in the Trust Series; acquiring zero coupon obligations and depositing them in the Trust Series; arranging for the evaluation of the zero coupon obligations by an independent evaluator (but not shares of the Funds since the Funds calculate net asset value daily); offering units to the public; and maintaining a secondary market in units. The Sponsor expects to deposit in each Trust Series substantially more than $100,000 aggregate value of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares. Simultaneously with such deposit, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor registered certificates for units which will represent the entire ownership of the Trust Series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Units of the Trust Series will be offered to the public initially at prices based on the net asset value of the Fund shares selected for deposit in the Trust Series plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained therein plus a sales charge. The Trust Series will redeem units at prices based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. With the deposit of the securities in the Trust Series on the initial date of deposit, the Sponsor will have established a proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Trust Series. The Sponsor will be permitted under the trust agreement to deposit additional securities, but will maintain the original proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Trust Series. Fund shares may be redeemed only to meet redemptions by unitholders or to pay Trust Series expenses in the event that distributions received on Fund shares prove insufficient to cover the expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Trust Series will be structured so that each Trust Series will contain a sufficient amount of zero coupon obligations to assure that, at the specified maturity date for such Trust Series, the purchaser of a unit will receive back the approximate total amount of the original investment in the Trust Series, including the sales charge. The Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for Trust Series units based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations and the net asset value of the Fund shares, but is not obligated to do so. In the event that the Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market, the trust agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct the Trustee to sell zero coupon obligations from any Trust Series until shares of the Fund have been liquidated, unless the Trustee is able to sell such zero coupon obligations and still maintain at least the original proportionate relationship to unit value and, further, that zero coupon obligations cannot be sold to meet Trust Series expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The sales load that normally would be applicable on sales of underlying Fund shares will be waived. The Sponsor and the Distributor will rebate to the Trustee any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees they receive on shares of the Funds held by the Trust Series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants have taken certain steps to reduce the impact of the termination of a Trust Series on the Fund deposited therein. First, the Trust Series will, with respect to all unitholders still holding units at the scheduled termination and to the extent desired by such unitholders, transfer the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust Series to the investor in lieu of redeeming such shares. Second, the Fund will offer all such unitholders the option of investing the proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in Fund shares at net asset value ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  without the imposition of the normal sales load). The Fund also will offer unitholders the option of investing all distributions from the Trust Series during the life of the Trust Series in Fund shares at net asset value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 12(d)(1) generally limits acquisition by an investment company of shares of a registered investment company in the following ways: (1) The acquiring company may not acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of the acquired company; (2) the securities of the acquired company may not amount to more than 5% of the value of the assets of the acquiring company; and (3) securities of the acquired company and all other investment companies may not represent more than 10% of the assets of the acquiring company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A major purpose of section 12(d)(1) is to prevent the duplication of costs and other adverse consequences to investors incident to the pyramiding of investment companies. This proposal is structured to eliminate the pyramiding of expenses. No sales charge or distribution fee will be imposed on Fund shares deposited in the Trust. No investment advisory fee will be charged with respect to the Trust Series since they will be unmanaged, and no evaluation fee will be charged with respect to Fund shares in the Trust Series. Another concern addressed by 12(d)(1) is potentially abusive control problems that could result from the concentration of voting power in a fund holding company. To address this concern, applicants have agreed that shares of a Fund that are held by a Trust Series will be voted by the Trustee in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust Series are voted. Another concern underlying section 12(d)(1) is the possibility of large-scale redemptions of shares of the underlying fund. The trust agreement will, however, permit the Trust Series to sell Fund shares only when necessary to meet redemptions or pay Trust Series expenses. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor will have any discretionary authority to determine when shares of the underlying Funds are to be sold or to substitute shares of another Fund for those deposited in a Trust Series. The threat to a Fund from large-scale redemptions is further reduced by the fact that each Trust Series is prohibited from acquiring more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 14(a) requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. Applicants recognize that by withdrawing certificates representing the entire beneficial ownership of the Trust Series, the Sponsor may be deemed to be reducing the Trust Series' net worth below the requirements of section 14(a). Applicants intend to comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, which provides an exemption from section 14(a), except that the Trust Series would not restrict its portfolio to ``eligible trust securities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUR READERS WROTE LETTERS THROUGHOUT 1990 EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWPOINTS ON A  VARIETY OF ISSUES. HERE ARE CONDENSED VERSIONS OF SOME OF THOSE LETTERS TO HELP  US REMEMBER THE EVENTS THAT MATTERED TO ORANGE COUNTY READERS THIS PAST YEAR.  WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE READERS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR VIEWPOINTS  AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THEM AND OTHERS IN 1991.;  </P> <P> WOULD DISNEY GIVE PROFITS FOR ROADS?  </P> <P> Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, is expecting federal government assistance  to build roads and solve traffic problems in Anaheim or Long Beach before he  can consent to building a new Disneyland Park.  </P> <P> This is a charming idea. Since we in Orange County are unable to find federal  money to solve our existing freeway problems, Eisner, if successful in  obtaining federal money, might consider sharing Disneyland profits -- so we can  solve our traffic problems.  </P> <P> DAVID G. BAKER, Yorba Linda  </P></p>

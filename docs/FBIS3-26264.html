Local officials said the investment made up 30 percent of  the  province's entire investment in fixed assets.    Hubei overfulfilled its targets of opening and installing  190,000 new telephone lines, increasing generating capacity by  1.46 million kw, and completing 2,600 km of new high-grade  highways in the past year.    In addition, the province has also opened 50 domestic and  overseas air routes.    The Tianhe international airport in this provincial capital  has finished its extension work and will go back into operation  next month. Two other airports capable of handling Boeing jets  in Enshi, the prefectural seat of Enshi, and in Shashi, a new  light industrial city, have also been completed and have gone  into use.    The improved investment environment has greatly enhanced  Hubei's appeal to overseas investors. Foreign investment keeps  pouring into the province's major cities of Wuhan, Huangshi and  Yichang.    Meanwhile, statistics show that Hubei approved the  establishment of 2,188 new foreign-funded enterprises last year,  943 more than in the previous year.</p>

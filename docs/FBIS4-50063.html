			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] China's antiterrorism unit has been brought into  public view for the first time. The secretive government cell  has been called in to refute rumours that renegade soldiers were  involved in the massacre of 24 Taiwan tourists in Zhejiang  province.    The Ministry of Public Security unit, which is believed to  have been set up after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989,  has never been officially acknowledged, except, by necessity, in  confidential international police work. Revealing the unit in  connection with the boat tragedy apparently reflects the  seriousness with which Beijing is treating the incident, which  brought cross-straits relations to their lowest point since the  late 1980s.    He Ting, head of the unit, answered reporters' questions in  Hangzhou on Monday. He said there was no evidence of army  accomplices in the tragedy on Qiandao Lake on March 31. "This  case is 100 percent without any military involvement," he said.    A total of nine mainland experts, two of them from the  Ministry of Public Security in Beijing, are testifying in the  trial of four suspects in the incident.    He Ting's first public appearance has become something of a  sideshow, with reporters plying him with questions on everything  from international terrorist groups based in China to attempts  on the lives of senior Chinese leaders. The antiterrorist unit  is also in charge of investigating aircraft hijackings.  According to a report in Ming Pao, one of He Ting's first  assignments as antiterrorism chief in 1989 was to investigate  and handle the extradition from Japan of a Hebei Province man  who claimed political asylum after hijacking a mainland plane to  Japan.    In the five years since then, he has earned a reputation for  taking a hands-on approach. This included taking charge of an  armed assault on the hideaway of a gang of heavily-armed bandits  in the Shanxi capital, Taiyuan.</p>

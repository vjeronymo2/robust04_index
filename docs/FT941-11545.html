			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US bulls drive aluminium and copper still higher Money from US investment funds continued to flood into the metals markets yesterday, helping to boost prices on the London Metal Exchange and taking aluminium to its highest level in 16 months. Copper also benefitted from the buying spree, and rose to a five-month peak. US funds have more than Dollars 25bn under management and most of their investment is technically-based, pointed out Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. Consequently, when the aluminium price broke through Dollars 1,270 a tonne yesterday, more buying by the chart-watching funds was triggered. Aluminium stocks are at record levels and will take about a year to be whittled away even if the output cuts in prospect following the weekend deal reached by some of the big aluminium-producing countries take place. Yet the price for three-month metal continued to ignore the negative factors and last night closed on the LME at Dollars 1,276.50, up another Dollars 15 a tonne. Mr Arnold said he did not share the euphoria that had enveloped the aluminium market after the deal, because there was too much scope for cheating and for the deal to unravel, but he could see aluminium's price rising to between Dollars 1,300 and Dollars 1,400 a tonne. As copper for delivery in three months rose Dollars 46.50 to Dollars 1,935 a tonne on the LME Mr Arnold said: 'The funds certainly did some copper buying today'. He suggested that eventually, when the market's fundamental weakness asserted itself, copper's price would dip to 80 cents a pound (Dollars 1,763 a tonne) before an improving world economic performance took it back to 95 cents (Dollars 2,094 a tonne) at the year-end.</p>

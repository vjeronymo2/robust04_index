			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Excerpts] The office of the Democratic Unionist Party  [DUP] leader has issued a statement saying that this year's  independence anniversary comes while all of Sudan is suffering  under the yoke of al-Turabi's [National Islamic] Front, shackled  by all sorts of restrictions that conflict with this great  anniversary and make independence lose its true meaning.    The statement says that oppression, coercion, displacement,  imprisonment, and torture are the main characteristics  dominating the people of Sudan. The regime is also fanning the  flames of the civil war, which it falsely calls jihad, and  flagrantly encroaching on the rights of the Sudanese in ways  that the Sudanese people have never experienced before, even  during the era of colonialism. [passage omitted]    In a similar statement, the Ummah Party said the  independence  anniversary comes at a time when the military regime in  Khartoum, despite international condemnation for human right  violations, is continuing the oppression, pursuit, physical  liquidation, and torture of its opponents. The statement said  the regime is continuing to fan the flames of the civil war,  which is a scourge that is crushing citizens in the south.</p>

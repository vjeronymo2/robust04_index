			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Enforcing a punishing regime for offenders: Alan Pike examines the efforts of charities to divert young people from a life of crime TWELVE teenagers from Chatham, Kent, are unlikely to be among the first to hear the news when Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, announces plans for a new generation of secure schools for young offenders shortly. They will be climbing a Welsh mountain as part of a motivational training course run by Fairbridge, a charity working with young people from disadvantaged inner-city backgrounds. Many of Fairbridge's clients are offenders, including some likely candidates for Mr Clarke's new schools. Fairbridge is one of a number of charities that try to divert young people from crime. A group of the biggest - the Children's Society, National Children's Homes, Rainer Foundation and Howard League for Penal Reform - have been pressing unsuccessfully for a meeting with Mr Clarke ahead of his announcement. They want to tell him that they fear the government is in danger of making a serious and expensive mistake if more young offenders are locked up. During the 1980s there was a strong shift away from custodial sentences for young people. The number of 14 to 17-year-old males sentenced to custody fell from 7,700 in 1981 to 1,400 in 1991. There were two major reasons for that. Custody seems to increase the likelihood that a young person will reoffend, and it is also very expensive  -the average weekly cost of a community penalty or probation order is only 5 per cent of a custodial sentence. The charities believe the law already provides for the tiny group of offenders who must be detained. They fear that the development of new secure schools would encourage more frequent use of custody. They say this would be at best a waste of money. At worse, says Ms Frances Crook, director of the Howard League, it might mean 'a rise in the number of children found hanging from their cell bars'. Follow-up studies of young people completing the eight-day Fairbridge course, which involves canoeing, abseiling and rock climbing, show that around 60 per cent have gone on to jobs, education or further training. A remarkable 85 per cent to 90 per cent retain contact with the charity. 'It becomes more difficult to define and calculate success at times of high unemployment,' says Mr Steve Mellors, manager of the Chatham project. 'If someone who has spent five of the last six years in prison slows down his reoffending rate, I regard that as success. 'But in the better economic climate of 1985-86, more young people went into jobs as a result of our Chatham scheme than were placed in employment by the Chatham, Rochester and Gillingham Jobcentres.' In financial terms the cost of the charity's course - around Pounds 400 - would keep a teenager in a young offender's institution for a week. A Department of Education report described the Fairbridge approach as an excellent model reaching young people most in need of help. Yet the proportion of Fairbridge's income received from the public sector has declined since the mid 1980s. Mr Michael Butler, the charity's southern regional manager, says its work would be immeasurably enhanced by only an extra Pounds 1m a year from the government. That compares with suggestions that the new network of special schools could cost Pounds 75m to develop. The message that leaders of the voluntary sector want to give Mr Clarke is: 'Most young offenders grow out of crime as they become more mature and responsible. They need encouragement and help to become law-abiding. Even a short period of custody is quite likely to confirm them as criminals, particularly if they acquire new criminal skills from more sophisticated offenders. They see themselves labelled as criminals.' Until an explosion of media attention to youth crime last month united government and opposition in calls for tougher penalties, the sector believed ministers had already grasped the message, for the words quoted above words come from the 1988 Home Office green paper Punishment, Custody and the Community.</p>

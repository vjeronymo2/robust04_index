			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> EDUCATORS VOW TO RAISE CAP SCORES  </P> <P> Teachers, administrators and school board members say they have recommitted  themselves to helping students raise their California Assessment Program test  scores.  </P> <P> District students placed near the bottom of the list on recent CAP tests when  compared to other Orange County districts.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should ever be below the 50th percentile," said school board  president Nancy Zinberg. "We should have a stated goal of the 75th percentile,  or better."  </P> <P> Almost 1,300 La Habra students in grades three, six, and eight were tested in  the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science and history/social science.  </P> <P> While scores achieved by third graders were in the top 25% of statewide  rankings, scores for older students were lower. Eighth-graders fared worse in  1989 than in the previous year in three of four categories.  </P> <P> A series of strategy meetings is being conducted to intensify efforts to  prepare students for the tests, officials said.  </P> <P> In October, the board expressed disappointment with low scores on tests taken  last April.  </P> <P> "Considering the special efforts of teachers and administrative staff towards  each student doing well on the CAP tests, these results were completely  surprising and unexpected," Supt. Richard Hermann said.  </P> <P> "The specifics do not include a major curriculum overhaul, rather a re-focusing  and realignment of CAP skills with the academic outcomes and expectations of  each major subject," Hermann explained.  </P> <P> "One of the things we are working on is development of test-taking skills,"  said Rosemary Herendeen, director of staff development and curriculum. "We need  to put more emphasis on accuracy rather than speed."  </P> <P> Although Hermann pointed to apparent inconsistencies between the low CAP scores  and what he described as better than average scores on other tests, such as the  Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, he emphasized: "We will not make excuses.  Rather, we will re-focus our efforts and look to this year's tests as an  opportunity to show major improvement."  </P> <P> According to Gary Mantey, principal at Washington Middle School, "We're asking  our teachers to work smarter, not harder."

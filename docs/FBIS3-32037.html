Here is a report on the  plans of the new ministers, to whom we wish lots of success.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] First, we will  interview Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. What are  your first measures going to be?    [Burelli] Work.    [Reporter] What are your plans?    [Burelli] Reinforce or restore Venezuela's image abroad,  which has recently deteriorated.    [Enzo del Buffalo, nominee for chief of the Central Office  of  Coordination and Planning of the Presidency] We will try to  conduct profound reforms in the basic industries and oil  sectors. We will try to complement those reforms with policies  consonant with the current circumstances in order to stabilize  the foreign exchange rate, control inflation, and reduce fiscal  deficits through austerity measures already announced.    [Rafael Angel Montero Revette, nominee for defense minister]  We will review the Armed Forces plans and above all, we will  reactivate and improve the Armed Forces social welfare plan.  This includes the areas of health and housing, so our soldiers  can live and work under better conditions.    [Abdon Vivas Teran, nominee for president of the Venezuelan  Investment Fund] We will strengthen the privatization process.  We will try to promote it on the basis of solid, technical,  conceptual, and at the same time participative plans. We  believe that participation will serve to increase the state's  efficiency, distribute wealth, and make the productive apparatus  more efficient.    [Ciro Anez Fonseca, nominee for agriculture and livestock  minister] My priorities will be based on the president's  interest to encourage productive sectors, particularly the  agricultural sector, which has suffered difficulties during the  past few years which we hope to resolve in the near future.    [German Luis Soriano, nominee for tourism minister] One of  the most important activities in the country's economic  development in the next few years will be developing tourism as  an activity that not only will create new jobs but will also  help develop important regions in the country that have been  neglected in the past.    [Juan Nepomuceno Garrido, nominee for labor minister] The  social welfare plan must be defined by the president of the  Republic. So far we have not.... [pauses] I know his opinion  and he knows mine, we both know what the country's current  situation is. You can be sure that President Caldera will have  in me a faithful, loyal minister, who is willing to work, follow  his policies, and lead the country to a path of well-being.    [Ruben Creixems, nominee for justice minister] What was not  done in 20 years cannot be done overnight. We must, however,  work hard to attain our goals.    [Julio Sosa, nominee for finance minister] I believe  balancing the budget is fundamental to curbing inflation, or at  least reducing it to an acceptable level. [end recording]</p>

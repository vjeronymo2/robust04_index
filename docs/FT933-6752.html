			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Canada election likely in October MS Kim Campbell, Canadian prime minister, is likely to call soon for an October general election, Reuter reports from Ottawa. With 1.6m Canadians unemployed, the campaign is expected to focus on who can best put people back to work and curb public debt, without cutting costly welfare services or raising taxes. Ms Campbell, who succeeded Mr Brian Mulroney as Conservative leader and became Canada's first woman prime minister two months ago, is expected to announce the election in the next week or two. It will probably be held on October 18 or 25. Ms Campbell, a 46-year-old lawyer, has criss-crossed Canada in recent weeks, meeting voters, to try to distance herself from Mr Mulroney, who was very unpopular when he stepped down in June. She will explain her economic policy to Toronto businessmen tomorrow. Opposition leaders have accused her of party political campaigning on taxpayers' money and want her to call the election as soon as possible so that all parties may enjoy free media time. Under Canada's British-style parliamentary system, Ms Campbell automatically became prime minister on winning the party leadership in June, but her party's mandate to govern is to run out this autumn. Opinion polls show Ms Campbell to be far more popular than Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberal party leader.</p>

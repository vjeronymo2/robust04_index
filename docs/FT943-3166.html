			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Mirror group plans cable TV channel Mirror Group Newspapers will announce today that it plans to launch a national cable television channel. The channel, which may be launched early next year, will provide entertainment 24 hours a day and will show only British-made programmes. It is the first significant move into television by the popular newspaper group since the death of former owner Mr Robert Maxwell, who had cable and satellite interests. The management team at MGN, lead by chief executive Mr David Montgomery, has been seeking a way into the television market for some time. MGN did bid for a contract to provide a news channel for London cable subscribers but it was awarded to Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail. Channel One, which has moved into Channel 4's former headquarters in Charlotte Street, will be launched this year. MGN's subscription-based channel, which will be delivered by satellite to the cable networks, will not be available to satellite viewers. It is not thought that MGN will have to increase its borrowings to launch the channel. Agreements have been reached in principle with cable operators such as Comcast, US West and Southwestern Bell. The channel may be available in more than 500,000 homes at the start. The cable industry, which is forecasting about 1m subscribers at the end of the year, is determined to increase the quality of 'cable exclusive' programming. New consortium sets sights on Channel 5, Page 9</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Excerpts] A total of six tons and 875 kg of packed  marijuana, 19 kg and 650 grams of seed of the same drug, and  seven kg of poppy seed, with a total market value exceeding 7  million new pesos, were seized yesterday by agents from the  Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]. They were  engaged in antidrug operations in 10 of the nation's states,  which enabled them to capture 21 presumed drug dealers,  including a Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent.    During the activities, the federal agents under orders from  Commander Adrian Carrera confiscated 13 automotive vehicles used  to transport drugs, and five heavy caliber firearms.  Concurrently, the PGR personnel destroyed a marijuana and poppy  plantation located on an area of 50,000 square meters and  containing about 450,000 plants. It was situated in the  mountains of Guerrero State.    This accumulation of drugs was intended for the narcotics  markets in the states of California, Texas, and Arizona, and  represented millions of doses.    The department's local office in Baja California, headed by  Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacios, reported that, in a simultaneous  operation conducted with public safety personnel in Tijuana, the  PJF seized one ton, 348 kg, and 600 grams of marijuana  discovered on the streets of Guadalupe Victoria in that town's  Colonia Guerrero. Arrested in the operation were Samuel Mendoza  Valdez and Ubaldo Campa Mejia who, according to preliminary  investigation 561-94, were waiting for other members of their  criminal organization to arrive with a vehicle to smuggle the  drugs into the United States.    In that same state, in the vicinity of Tijuana, a shipment  of  cannabis indica weighing one ton and 74 kg was intercepted. It  was being carried by Gonzalo Banuelos Montano on a fifth wheel  type truck, hidden under hundreds of drums of gypsum from  Tonala, Jalisco. [passage omitted]    Another ton, 236 kg, and 900 grams of marijuana was seized  by  federal agents in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where they arrested  Miguel Angel Loa Rodriguez, Gabriel Melchor Ontiveros, and  Griselda Garcia Nunez. They were carrying the drugs in the false  bottom of a platform installed on a pickup truck. Confiscated  with the drugs were two rifles, a 22 and a .410 caliber, as well  as a 22 caliber revolver, concealed in the back of the vehicle's  cab. Presumed to have been heading for San Antonio, Texas, the  subjects were captured on a trail near the Rio Grande. [passage  omitted]    According to the state representative, Joel Ortiz Hernandez,  in the municipality of Tecpan de Galeana, located in Guerrero's  sierra area, approximately 450,000 marijuana and poppy plants  were destroyed and incinerated.</p>

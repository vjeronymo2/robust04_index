			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japanese out in front Sir, Your coverage of UK car production statistics for 1993 highlighted Rover overtaking Ford as the UK's biggest vehicle manufacturer and noted the industry made the highest number of units since 1974 ('Car output at highest level for nearly 20 years', March 2). The figures, however, told another and more dramatic story about the rapid structural change taking place in the industry. Rover's creditable but modest increase of 30,000 units (+7%) was in fact more than offset by the 80,000-unit drop in output from the total of Ford, GM and Peugeot and therefore overall production from established players in the UK was down 50,000 units. Far from matching performance of 20 years ago the companies, which then made up the UK industry, are now operating at little better than two-thirds the 1970s' levels. The one reason for the reversal of the long-term decline of the British motor industry has been the superb performance of Japanese transplants - Nissan, Toyota and Honda - which together raised unit production last year by 136,000 units - no less than a 75 per cent increase. The three groups accounted for nearly a quarter of all cars produced in the UK and sailed past GM and Ford with combined output of 316,000 units compared with GM's 274,000 and Ford's 301,000. Thank heavens for the policies that made the UK the most attractive European location for inward investment Stephen Rowlinson, Merton Associates, 70 Grafton Way, London W1P 5LE</p>

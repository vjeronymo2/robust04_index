			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Karl van den Broeck: "Budget for Humanitarian </F> Operations Reduced -- 1.7 Billion in 1994 to Just 1 Billion in  1995"]    [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix of the CVP  [Flemish Christian People's Party] is keeping his hand on the  purse strings. He believes that the cost of humanitarian  operations is too high. By the end of 1994, the Belgian UN  troops in Yugoslavia and Rwanda will have cost him 1.7 billion  Belgian francs. In 1995, the Defense Ministry intends to  earmark just 1 billion Belgian frnacs for such expenditure. Any  extra costs will have to be found from "other sources." In the  meantime, the sale of army equipment is going well.    Although the cabinet may have already decided last Friday [1  April] to prolong humanitarian operations in Croatia and Bosnia,  Minister Delcroix firmly intends not to allow his budget to be  derailed by the international commitments of the Belgian Army.  DE MORGEN learned yesterday from the minister that in 1995 just  1 billion Belgian francs will be set aside for financing the  activities of UN troops.    "In 1994, we will end up spending 1.7 billion Belgian  francs," said his spokesman. "The cost of the operation in  Rwanda will be 613 million Belgian francs. The commitment in  the former Yugoslavia (Belbat, Bosnia Road) will amount to 1  billion." As the argument goes: "If the government were now to  comply with a possible request by the United nations to make an  additional effort, then the money would have to come from  `elsewhere.'" In the past, the costs of foreign contracts were  often shared by the Defense Ministry and the Development Aid  Ministry, or the European Union offered a financial helping hand  (e.g. in Somalia). It would appear that in the long term,  Delcroix only wishes to remain active in the former Yugoslavia.  One billion Belgian francs per annum is not enough to keep the  1,000 permanent troops in the field. The mission in Rwanda is  due to end in November 1994. Meanwhile, Bosnia Road, the mission  involving army engineers in the region around Sarajevo, was  extended Friday until October 1994.  <H5>  Sales </H5>   In the meantime, the Defense Ministry has also adjusted the  estimated revenue generated by selling off army property and  equipment. At the end of 1993, it was anticipated that such  sales would total 3.5 billion Belgian francs. The new estimate  is 4 billion by 1997.    Nonetheless, 1993 was a disappointing year. It had been  hoped that income totaling 600 million Belgian francs might be  generated, but since the only money coming in was the result of  sales of light equipment, the actual revenue totaled just 250  million.    However, there is light on the horizon. DE MORGEN has  learned that the negotiations with Chile on the sale of the  superfluous Mirages are "promising." A letter of agreement has  been signed in which Belgium guarantees not to look for another  buyer before June. Chile has 2.5 billion Belgian francs  available for the Mirages.    Delcroix also seems firm in his intention to sell the Hawk  missiles to Turkey, despite the strong criticism from Agalev  [Flemish Environmental Party], the VU [Flemish People's Union],  and the peace movement. After all, the new law governing arms  deals prohibits the sale of military equipment to any country  which is involved in a civil war.    "We must not be hypocritical," says Delcroix's spokesman.  "Turkey is a NATO country. If we ask that country to keep its  armed forces up to date, thereby helping to guarantee the  collective security of the alliance, then we cannot refuse to  supply it with arms. Either we must regard Turkey as no longer  being a NATO partner or we must behave like a full partner of  that country. The government certainly has no plans to drop  Turkey."    No information about the price that Turkey is prepared to  pay  for the Hawk antiaircraft missiles is currently available.    The sale of military properties should also accelerate in  the  coming months. Some properties will be sold by public auction,  others privately. "That depends on the Finance Ministry. We,  at the Defense Ministry, are not allowed to dispose of our  property ourselves."    Could the proceeds from such sales not be used to boost the  budget allocated for humanitarian uses?    "No," said the spokesman, "it was already decided previously  that the 4 billion Belgian francs generated by the sales would  not be used to fund personnel or operations. The armed forces  still have a very long list of equipment that has to be  purchased in the context of rearming the Belgian Armed Forces.  That is our priority if we want to ensure that our armed forces  remain ready for action in the future."    "The proceeds of the sale of military equipment will be used  to this end. The revenue generated by sales of the real  property will go toward modernizing the remaining barracks."</p>

These were the words of  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, after  his talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. This is  Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for Croatian radio news from Geneva.    Churkin believes that tomorrow's meeting of all interested  sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina must bring progress. However, it is  too optimistic to expect that the agreement will be signed  tomorrow, Churkin said. He believes that the talks should go  along the line of the EU [European Union] proposal. Too much  effort and time have been invested to introduce fundamental  changes at this point, Churkin believes. Unfortunately, there  are still forces that want war. Churkin said that President  Tudjman's proposal, brought up in Bonn, was interesting,  especially the part concerning access to the sea.    The Russian Federation obviously supports the EU's stance,  and, judging by the news from Moscow, so does America. The  behavior of the Muslim side is in complete contravention of the  European Twelve's stance. Their response to the peace  initiative is negative. The opinion prevails that the Muslims  would like the UN Security Council to take over the  negotiations, which both the EU and America oppose.    The problem is a European one, and consequently it should be  dealt with in Europe, Croatian Minister Mate Granic said. An  absolute cease-fire should come into effect in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a political solution should be found in  line with the EU's proposal. This is Croatia's stand, about  which Vitaliy Churkin has been informed.</p>

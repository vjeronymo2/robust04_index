			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING ON REDISTRICTING  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court justices ought to have their heads examined for their  decision on redistricting in Los Angeles County ("High Court Clears Way for  Vote in 1st District," Metro, Dec. 11). The whole theme of America is based on  freedom and equality -- where each and every person has an equal chance  regardless of race, color, religion, sex or age.  </P> <P> America is a melting pot of all people on this planet.  </P> <P> Why do Latinos need to have "their" district? Aren't they Americans of Latino  descent just like the rest of us who are proud Americans descended of European,  African, Asian and every other country of this world?  </P> <P> If you don't like who your elected representatives are, then vote them out, but  don't create ethnic "ghetto government" for "Latinos only." That's un-American  and will only divide people.  </P> <P> ROGER WEST  </P> <P> El Monte  </P></p>

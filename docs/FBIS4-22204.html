			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The </F> Problems of Aviators Will Be Solved Expeditiously"]    [Text] On 2 April of this year, General of the Army Defense  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy paid a planned working visit to  Myrhorod, the headquarters of a Ukrainian Air Force division.    In order to gain a real understanding of the situation among  the military and the problems facing the people wearing shoulder  boards, the chief of the War Office [kerivnyk viyskovoho  vidomstva] invited Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Valeriy  Shmarov to accompany him on this visit.    Together they inspected the airfield and the aviators'  military town, visited the barracks, the soldiers' mess, and the  military trade store. Virtually everything was of interest to  the minister and the deputy prime minister -- the conditions in  which personnel live, whether the store carries fresh bread,  what the soldiers and officers are fed, and whether they have  all the necessities.    The representatives of the government also visited the homes  of some aviators and met with the residents of the military  town. There is no shortage of problems here. The deputy prime  minister and the defense minister promised to solve some of  these problems expeditiously. Thus the officers and soldiers  [o/s] would receive their pay in the next few days, and  according to the defense minister's instruction, the pharmacy in  the town will be opened in a week's time.    In order to check the combat readiness and training of the  aviators, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy issued an order  commanding the air units on duty to fly. The section commander,  Maj. Mykhaylo Moroz, and Senior Airman Volodymyr Kovpakov  performed their task efficiently. The handsome SU-27s they flew  rose into the air exceeding the accepted standard, and the  fighter pilots performed their training exercise successfully.  The defense minister thanked them for doing a good job.    Such visits to the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  enable us to gain first-hand knowledge of the situation in the  military and persuade us of the need to focus our attention on  army problems.</p>

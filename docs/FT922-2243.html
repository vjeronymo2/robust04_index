			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: The Rise and Fall of Little Voice - Theatre Jim Cartwright's new play at the Cottesloe opens in the dark with some dissonant music, screams and a harsh Lancashire voice in the background. When the lights go on, a garish-looking woman is sick in the sink. Then the fuses blow because the electricity system in this northern English town, 1992, cannot bear the record player and the electric kettle being turned on at the same time. There is lot of swearing and some brutality. The Rise and Fall of Little Voice proceeds in this provocatively disagreeable way for about 20 minutes. Yet since Cartwright is one of the most promising English playwrights, it is worth holding on: there are surprises to come. Little Voice has at least one startling coup de theatre and, in this production by Sam Mendes, outstanding performances all round. The title is Cartwright's longest so far. His previous plays were called Bed and To in that order, but even Little Voice can be abbreviated to LV, and usually is. LV is the daughter of the garish-looking woman, Mari Hoff. She is called Little Voice because nobody could hear what she said as a child or, perhaps more accurately, because she never tried to speak up. She has been left a collector's gem of long playing records by female vocalists by her father, Frank. Mari's main memory of Frank is how embarrassing it was at the registry office to sign off as Mr and Mrs F Hoff, which broadly speaking is what Mari then did. LV not only listens to the LPs incessantly - fuses permitting; she learns from them. The theatrical coup comes when she is overheard (not by her mother) singing to herself. Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, Cilla Black, Gracie Fields, Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf, Marilyn Monroe, she can do the lot. It may seem an odd mix, but if you see the play you will understand why. The clue is Gracie Fields: Cartwright is a consciously north country writer. LV is played by Jane Horrocks. It is an immensely challenging part. Not only does she have to go through the whole singing repertoire; she also has to play the mixture of hurt little girl and potential star. Some of Ms Horrocks's facial expressions are superb. In the singing role I thought that she flagged slightly as the show went on. Given confidence and audience support, however, this could grow into an unforgettable performance. The play has its imperfections. There is an excess of sentimentality. The romantic sub-plot about the equally little-voiced British Telecom engineer who is as devoted to lasers as is LV to singing does not quite work. The suggestion at the end that LV has risen, fallen and risen yet again under the BT influence is at odds with the title. The sight of the mother, drinking Alka-Seltzer from a dirty milk bottle because it is less filthy than the cups in the sink, over-pushes the squalor. I did not enjoy watching Alison Steadman playing this part, but I admired her performance - and her commitment to stick to it - no end. The minor part that comes off like a charm is George Raistrick as Mr Boo, the slightly Asian-looking impresario who presents LV at the local club. As John Osborne keeps reminding us, it is always useful to have a spot of music hall. As a play, Little Voice is not quite as good as To, which was shown at the Young Vic 18 months ago, largely because it is less well structured. But one has begun to look forward to whatever Cartwright comes up with and to anything directed by Sam Mendes. Cottesloe, Royal National Theatre. In repertoire. 071 928 2252</p>

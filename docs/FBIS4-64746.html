			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "German Development Aid for West </F> Bank"]    [Text] Bonn, 4 May -- The Federal Republic is  concentrating its development aid for the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip on infrastructure projects, training and advanced  training, and the development of an administration. With German  aid, five local organizations for water supply and sewage plants  will be set up. In addition, a project to improve waste disposal  in the Gaza Strip is being prepared. By the end of 1992, the  territories occupied by Israel were granted development aid  totaling 173 million German marks [DM]. In addition, there is  Germany's share of DM185 million in aid granted by the European  Community. Last year, the Federal Ministry of Economic  Cooperation and Development made a new pledge of DM36.2 million.  Of this sum, DM15 million will go to drinking water supply  projects in Nablus and Ramallah. The UN Relief and Works Agency  for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) received DM14.5  million from Bonn. The current projects include a vocational  school in Beit Hania, a polytechnical school in Hebron, and a  waste disposal project in Bethlehem. Projects of church and  private organizations and of political foundations are also  promoted. Development cooperation has in the past been faced  with the problem that, because there is no state as a partner,  communities must be won over for individual projects. The Bonn  Development Aid Ministry says, however, that this has restricted  the volume of possible aid. Bonn's new pledges this year  include DM10 million for technical cooperation and, for the  first time, DM10 million in capital aid. Germany also helps  finance European Union aid programs totalling DM500 million and  a World Bank aid program totalling $2.4 billion.</p>

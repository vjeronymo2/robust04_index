			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH WILLING TO SEND EMERGENCY FOOD TO SOVIETS  </P> <P> President Bush said today that he would be willing to provide emergency food  supplies and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, saying, "I worry about the  Soviet people during the bleak winter coming up."  </P> <P> Bush made his suggestion in advance of a two-hour meeting with Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose country is reeling under political and economic  turmoil.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that the United States has  not been asked for food or money. But U.S. officials said last week that they  are preparing contingency plans in case of a Soviet request.  </P> <P> Bush, during a morning news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher, appeared sympathetic to the plight of America's onetime chief  adversary.  </P> <P> "We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's a real need  there," Bush said.  </P> <P> Although U.S. law limits direct economic aid to Moscow, Bush said the United  States could help alleviate food shortages, for example.  </P> <P> "And that's the right and humane thing to do as a country moves toward us and  relations are greatly improved. And I would want to try to help," he said.  </P> <P> Food rationing will begin next month in Leningrad, the country's second-largest  city. Some smaller cities have been rationing for more than a year. In Moscow,  some items such as sugar are restricted. The City Council is debating whether  to issue coupon booklets.  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TALK OF an impending rights issue, along with the availability of large lines of stock in the equity market, depressed a futures sector already disappointed with the lack of a further cut in interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Taking its cue from the strong overnight performance of Wall Street, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened firmly at 2,837. But with disappointment on the interest rates front still very much a feature, the contract traded in a tight 10-point range for the rest of the morning, with the favourable unemployment figures making little impact. The availability of sizeable amounts of stock in the cash market led June lower, with many of the big insitutions unwilling to buy the future. Talk of a rights issue late in the day helped cause a sell-off that saw the contract fall to the day's low of 2,815. The usual bargain hunting helped June off the bottom and it closed at 2,818, down 10 from Wednesday's close, with the premium to the cash market having fallen to a mere two points. Turnover was poor, reaching 7,746 lots by the official close. In traded options, volume fell to 32,777. However, the FT-SE 100 and the Euro FT-SE 100 options were busy ahead of today's expiry of the May index options. They traded 8,762 and 6,331 lots respectively. Land Securities was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,205 contracts dealt.</p>

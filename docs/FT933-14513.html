			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke trip aims to smooth tensions MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, unveils a further facet of his chancellorship next week when he visits Germany to strengthen economic relations between the two countries and smooth over any residual tensions between the Treasury and Bundesbank. After Mr Clarke, the friend of industry, and Ken Clarke, the 'straight from the shoulder' political chancellor who tells voters of possible tax increases and welfare cuts, the public will be presented with a chancellor who beats the drum for Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. In a packed two-day schedule Mr Clarke will dine with industrialists and bankers in Frankfurt on Sunday, lunch with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-designate, on Monday and meet Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, in his home city of Munich later that day. In Munich the chancellor will give a speech that is expected to develop the UK's ideas for improving Europe's international competitiveness through supply side policies. UK officials played down suggestions that the chancellor would be pushing for German interest rate cuts. But while Mr Clarke's trip may lack a specific policy goal, it will mark a notable change of style from that of Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. The Euro-sceptic Mr Lamont made no secret of his lack of enthusiasm for meeting European finance ministers. He also mishandled relations with the Bundesbank, nearly provoking a walk-out by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German Bundesbank president, at last September's meeting of EC finance ministers and central bank governors in Bath shortly before sterling was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. There is no record of Mr Lamont ever visiting the Bundesbank as chancellor, whereas Mr Clarke will meet Germany's independent central bankers less than two months after moving into 11 Downing Street. Mr Clarke's meeting with Mr Waigel will be his third in a fortnight, after bilateral talks with the German minister in Tokyo last week and Monday's economic and finance ministers' council in Brussels.</p>

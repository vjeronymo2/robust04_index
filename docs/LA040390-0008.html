			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON FUNDING FOR ART  </P> <P> I am responding to Buchanan's article in which he criticizes federal support to  the National Endowment for the Arts because that money is being used to destroy  a "Christian" U.S. and "re-create it in a pagan image." He states that we  should not subsidize artists that he judges have "contempt for the public."  </P> <P> Following this peculiar logic, Buchanan's mythical "common man" (I would  include women in the equation) should be even more outraged at the far greater  amount of tax dollars spent for weapons systems that are in today's world the  strongest expression of "contempt for the public."  </P> <P> But you won't hear the sanctimonious Buchanan challenge the military-corporate  cartel he so fervently serves. He would rather work hard choking artistic  freedom.  </P> <P> STEVE TARZYNSKI  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

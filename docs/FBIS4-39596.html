			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has no clear budget policy today,  while the draft budget it has submitted is simply a statement of  expenses, Federation Council chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told  journalists today. He believes the draft budget has no purpose.  Shumeyko compared it to porridge spread thinly on a plate.  Answering a question about the Federation Council's proposal to  increase military expenditure, Shumeyko said that this is a  demand put forward by life itself.</p>

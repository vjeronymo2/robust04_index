			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Brock to run again for US Senate Mr Bill Brock, former US trade representative, announced yesterday he would challenge Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland in November's mid-term elections. Mr Brock, who served one term as senator for Tennessee in the 1970s, would, if elected, become the first senator since 1879 to have represented two states in Congress. Credited with rebuilding the Republican party apparatus after the Watergate debacle as chairman of the Republican National Committee, Mr Brock was appointed US trade representative and later labour secretary by Ronald Reagan. Mr Sarbanes, who has been expected to take over as chairman of the Senate banking committee after the retirement of Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan, has won more than 60 per cent of the vote in his last two campaigns. His voice has been heard most often on macroeconomic and budgetary issues. Nevertheless, he maintains a low profile, and could be vulnerable to a Republican challenge. In Maine, meanwhile, Congresswoman Olympia Snowe, a Republican representing the state's northern congressional district, announced she would run for the Senate seat left empty by the retirement of Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader.</p>

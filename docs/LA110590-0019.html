			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GILDER DECLARED JAPAN WINNER AFTER FINAL ROUND RAINED OUT  </P> <P> Bob Gilder, leading by one point after three rounds, was declared the winner of  the $538,000 tournament at Ayamacho, Japan, Sunday after rains washed out the  final round.  </P> <P> Gilder had 115 points (38-39-38) to 114 for Bob Tway after three rounds on the  6,796-yard, par-72 Japan Classic Country Club course.  </P> <P> Gilder earned $73,000.  </P> <P> This was Japan's first PGA tournament using a scoring system that awards two  points for a par, three for a birdie and one for a bogey. The highest score  wins.  </P> <P> France's Jean Van de Velde, who led after the first round, tied for third place  with Japan's Hyoshinori Kaneko and Yoshiyuki Isomura at 113 points.  </P> <P> An Australian-New Zealand PGA team was declared the winner based on total  strokes after its title match against the U.S. team was rained out in a  $1-million tournament at Inagi, Japan.  </P> <P> Australia-New Zealand and the U.S. had 20 points apiece from match victories in  round-robin play, but the Australia-New Zealand team had the best total stroke  score, 1,261.  </P> <P> The U.S. stroke score was not counted because Wayne Levi withdrew because of a  back injury after playing only nine holes Thursday in the Americans'  opening-day match against the Europeans. With each individual match victory  counting two points, Europe beat the Americans, 8-4.  </P></p>

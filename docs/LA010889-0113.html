			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANNERS SEEK SOLUTION TO SUBURBAN GRIDLOCK;  </P> <P> CONGRESS IS URGED TO SHIFT FOCUS FROM INTERSTATE PROJECTS TO LOCAL FUNDING TO  CUT TRAFFIC PROBLEM  </P> <P> It was the postwar American Dream. When Congress approved the Interstate  Highway System in 1944, it paved the way for about 44,000 miles of new roads  that would link cities from coast to coast and whisk commuters from suburban  homes to downtown jobs.  </P> <P> Now the interstate system is virtually complete, a monument to America's love  affair with the automobile. But in the nation's rapidly growing suburbs,  drivers face more woes than ever. From Orange County to Long Island, millions  of motorists are caught up in massive traffic jams, fighting their way through  streets that were never designed to handle so many cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stop-and-Go Commute  </P> <P> For a growing number of Americans, the drive from their home to a nearby  shopping center has come to rival the ordeal of a stop-and-go commute to work.  Unforeseen 40 years ago, suburban congestion has become the fastest-growing  traffic problem in America today.  </P> <P> But it is only recently that Washington has begun to take notice. Federal  highway programs have been primarily designed to build freeways, leaving state  and county governments to resolve congestion on local streets. This year,  however, Congress will start drafting a new blueprint for the nation's  $14-billion federal highway program, and experts predict that metropolitan  gridlock will at last be a prime target.  </P> <P> "Clearly, we're facing problems in the suburbs that were not envisioned years  ago," said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), the chairman of the House  Public Works and Transportation Committee. "As we decide the future of the  highway program, we have to be aware of the need for solutions. . . . The  economic health of the nation depends on it."  </P> <P> Indeed, the failure of suburban streets to handle the growing number of cars  has caused heavy traffic jams on the nation's interstates, as many motorists  now use freeways to travel 2 to 3 miles as part of their daily commute. That,  in turn, has made it difficult for millions of trucks across the nation to  maintain on-time deliveries for their cargoes, causing delays and economic  problems for a multitude of businesses.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, this local problem becomes a barrier to interstate commerce," said  Robert Farris, director of the Federal Highway Administration. "All of these  transportation issues are interrelated, and we've got to start looking at them  simultaneously."  </P> <P> For those reasons, Anderson's panel will hold hearings on myriad transportation  problems this year, including suburban congestion, crumbling bridges, crowded  interstates, mass transit needs and the environmental consequences of building  more highways. If all goes as planned, Congress will approve a new Surface  Transportation Act in 1991, the first of the "post interstate" era.  </P> <P> The distinction is important because a broad coalition of transportation  experts and state and local officials is urging Congress to shift its attention  away from freeway projects. In particular, they want federal funds now  earmarked for highway work to be distributed with fewer strings attached so  cities and suburbs can have greater flexibility in devising ways to relieve  their jammed streets.  </P> <P> Few of them doubt the importance of maintaining and upgrading the interstate  system, which represents a multibillion-dollar investment, but they argue that  other needs are equally important.  </P> <P> On the local level, this could mean more projects to widen suburban boulevards,  synchronize traffic lights, launch light-rail systems and experiment with  van-pooling programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reducing Truck Activity  </P> <P> In California, planners say, it could speed up completion of toll-road projects  in Orange County and efforts to reduce congestion on Victory Boulevard in the  San Fernando Valley. Programs to reduce the number of trucks on the Long Beach  and San Diego freeways could also benefit.  </P> <P> "We are past the point in this country where we can just keep building freeways  to reduce congestion," said Jim Beall, a San Jose city councilman and member of  the "Transportation 2020" task force, a national study group created by  transportation officials to find new solutions for traffic problems. "We  shouldn't have to spend money on freeways just because that's the only way  Washington says the money can be spent."  </P> <P> In drawing up the new plan, many experts say, it is crucial that Washington  avoid trying to devise one cure for suburban congestion, because its forms and  causes differ substantially from one community to the next across the nation.  </P> <P> "There is no magic bill that Congress can pass into law that will solve this  problem," said Francis B. Francois, executive director of the Assn. of State  Highway and Transportation Officials. "If there are 50 different metropolitan  areas with the problem, then 50 different answers are needed. What works in Los  Angeles won't work in Boston, and that's why there needs to be more flexibility  in the system."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicting Needs  </P> <P> But getting Congress to agree to such sweeping changes may not be easy, given  the conflicting needs of urban and rural communities, said one House  transportation aide. States such as Idaho and Montana are heavily dependent on  federal funds for their roads, and they might oppose a new division of funds  that focuses more on metropolitan problems.  </P> <P> It may be even more difficult to increase federal spending on road programs, as  members of Transportation 2020 and some in Congress have urged. The blue-ribbon  group has suggested that annual spending by all levels of government on highway  projects, now some $63 billion, eventually be increased to $100 billion, to  maintain bridges and roadways.  </P> <P> That may be unlikely, however, given the federal government's reluctance to  spend all the money now being raised for highways.  </P> <P> Since 1956, the sole source of funds for the program has been the federal  gasoline tax, which goes into a special account called the Highway Trust Fund.  In recent years, Congress has withheld spending about 10% of the money flowing  into the trust fund to help offset the nation's $155-billion budget deficit.  Currently, while $14 billion is distributed annually for highways, there is an  unused surplus of about $13.6 billion in the fund.  </P> <P> </P> <P> House Rejection Cited  </P> <P> Anderson and others would like to see that money freed up for transportation  projects, including about $1 billion for work in California. But they have lost  several House votes to exempt the highway funds from budget cutbacks.  </P> <P> Another potential barrier to increased transportation spending would be a  proposed hike in the federal gasoline tax, now being discussed by members of  Congress as a deficit-fighting measure. Highway advocates fear that such an  increase in the 9 cents per gallon federal tax would discourage many states  from raising their own gasoline taxes and thus retard the growth of locally  sponsored transportation programs.  </P> <P> In California, transportation officials are watching these battles closely.  </P> <P> "We're going to be monitoring Congress carefully, to see how they change the  highway program," said Robert Best, director of Caltrans, the state's  transportation agency. "What happens in Washington matters very much to us  here."  </P> <P> Few dispute the need for change. Federal, state and local officials agree that  the current highway program is geared to a bygone era of sleepy bedroom suburbs  and commuters heading for distant, downtown jobs. In the last 30 years, there  has been an explosive growth in the size and economic importance of American  suburbs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth in Jobs Soar  </P> <P> From 1960 to 1980, the number of jobs located in the suburbs grew from 14  million to 33 million. More than 25 million commuters drive every day from a  suburban home to a suburban job, or 38% of all trips. Not surprisingly, the  suburb-to-suburb commute has become the nation's most prevalent route of daily  transportation, according to a demographic study by the Eno Foundation for  Transportation.  </P> <P> As a result, state and local officials are demanding that the federal highway  program keep pace with this shift.  </P> <P> "I don't think a lot of people are expecting that there will be a great deal  more money from the federal government," said Monte Ward, government affairs  director for the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But if local  governments had a freer hand in spending these funds, it could make a real  difference."  </P> <P> Orange County, where traffic congestion has become a way of life, is a case in  point. Local officials are committed to freeway improvements but they are also  eager to use federal funds more creatively on other efforts.  </P> <P> Currently, the county is moving forward with plans, using federal funds, for  three toll roads that would give motorists an alternative to traffic-choked  freeways.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rail Service Possible  </P> <P> In addition, county officials are considering opening commuter rail service on  the existing Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail corridor. Under the plan, commuters  could ride from Irvine to downtown Los Angeles or from San Juan Capistrano to  downtown Santa Ana.  </P> <P> To do so, however, would require a more flexible use of federal money,  diverting highway funds to improve stations and acquire rail cars, Ward said.  Under the present federal program, he noted, mass transit funds "are geared  toward traditional patterns in the East, where suburban areas surround the big  city."  </P> <P> In Southern California, where suburbs have grown without a definable city  center, "we don't compete well for those funds," he said. "It's another reason  why there should be more freedom to move funds around."  </P> <P> Finally, a more flexible federal program could allow the county to spend more  on streamlining the traffic flow on key arterial streets such as Beach and  Katella boulevards.  </P> <P> "Right now, federal highway programs don't allocate much money to such  projects, but if they did, you could make these kinds of decisions," he said.  "You could decide that it might be more important to synchronize traffic  signals on Beach Boulevard than to spend all of your money on freeways."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditions May Worsen  </P> <P> Without these improvements, experts believe traffic congestion in Orange County  and other suburban areas will worsen. Eventually, local, state and federal  officials will have to work together on ways to link housing growth with  transportation and plan future development throughout these regions, they say.  </P> <P> "I think the public is concerned about congestion, even though they haven't yet  pegged it as a national issue," said Ray Barnhart, former head of the Federal  Highway Administration.  </P> <P> "But if we don't take intelligent steps now, we're going to be looking at a 50%  increase in Los Angeles traffic over the next 30 years. If we do nothing to  expand the capacity down there, you might as well shut the community down."  </P></p>

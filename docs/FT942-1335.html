			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise may start buying Lasmo shares Speculation mounted yesterday that Enterprise Oil could next week begin buying shares in Lasmo, its unwilling bid target, as the deadline draws near for acceptance of its Pounds 1.7bn bid. Enterprise, which almost two months ago launched its hostile all-paper bid for Lasmo, is allowed to buy up to 10 per cent in the market. It is believed that Enterprise has set aside Pounds 150m for share purchases if it is not confident it can reach 50 per cent through straight acceptances. Meanwhile, the rival oil explorers yesterday exchanged what are expected to be their final shots in the bid battle before shareholders make up their minds next week. Both companies reiterated their arguments for and against the offer. Mr Rudolph Agnew, chairman of Lasmo, said acceptance of the offer would mean giving away a disproportionate share of assets and future growth for an 'inadequate share in an enlarged company'. Enterprise accused Lasmo of repeating 'the same tired assertions'. It said an enlarged company offered better gearing to the oil price through the warrants being offered to shareholders, and greater financial strength to exploit assets. It is expected to send a detailed document to Lasmo shareholders tomorrow. The argument will now be carried directly to institutional investors, with both sides spending the last seven days canvasing for support. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, is currently in the US doing the rounds of institutions. Enterprise's shares fell 10p to 413p, while Lasmo shares were steady at 149p.</p>

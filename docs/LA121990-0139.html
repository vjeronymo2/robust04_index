			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOSS RESIGNS AS PREMIER OF LEBANON  </P> <P> Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a veteran of Lebanon's turbulent politics, resigned  today to make way for a broad-based government that will try to end 15 1/2  years of civil war.  </P> <P> But Christian and Muslim militia chieftains voiced dissent that could undermine  peace efforts.  </P> <P> Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who formed his government last Nov. 25, presented the  resignation of his 14-member Cabinet to President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite  Catholic. Hrawi asked Hoss to stay on as caretaker prime minister.  </P> <P> The new Cabinet will be charged with drafting a plan to disband the private  armies that have fought Lebanon's civil war since 1975. It is expected to  include members from the main warring militias as well as political parties.  </P> <P> However, the two strongest militias -- Christian chieftain Samir Geagea's  Lebanese Forces and Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party  -- expressed doubts about the plan.  </P> <P> "The way the president is dealing with the question of a new government  indicates he might bring in an untidy government that would stumble upon its  first steps," Jumblatt's party said. "This could create a dangerous power  vacuum."  </P> <P> Jumblatt, a member of the outgoing Cabinet, has publicly accused Hrawi of  corruption and favortism. Hrawi's aides countered by charging Jumblatt with  "corrupt deeds" in his Ministry of Public Works.  </P> <P> The Lebanese Forces militia said in a statement that Geagea "will not take part  in the new Cabinet.  </P></p>

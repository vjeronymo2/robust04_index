			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The National Front [BN] has petitioned Sabah  Governor Tun Mohamed Said Keruak to allow it to form the new  state government. Meanwhile, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Joseph  Pairin Kitingan is losing more Sabah United Party [PBS] state  assemblymen, including his deputy and strong supporter, Datuk  Bernard Dompok. PBS, which narrowly won the state election on  18 and 19 February, has now lost 21 state assemblymen. The  party now has only 10 state assemblymen left, while the number  of BN state assemblymen has risen to 44. Many more PBS state  assemblymen are expected to quit the party, and Datuk Pairin  Kitingan is expected to announce his resignation as chief  minister before he faces a no-confidence motion at the State  Legislative Assembly which sits on Friday.

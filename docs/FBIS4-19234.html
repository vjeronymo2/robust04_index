			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fy"-signed report: "Worried About German Armament"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 13 April -- State Secretary Schoenbohm, who  is responsible for armament issues in the Defense Ministry, has  come out in favor of amending the German armament export  regulations and harmonizing the regulations in Europe. The  current situation makes it almost impossible to preserve key  capacities for defense technology and to deepen armament  cooperation in the European Union [EU]. Speaking to the  participants in the annual meeting of the Defense Technology  Association, Schoenbohm said that Bonn is striving for an  agreement with France, Italy, and England about which countries  are to be excluded from supplies with armament goods and in  which countries armament goods may be delivered.  Unfortunately, the positions are still far apart, both because  of economic interests as well as because of ideological  differences. Germany cannot uncouple itself by pointing to its  "special" moralism, its past, or the Constitution when Europe's  security is involved. "Do we want to found a new German special  way of moralism by pointing to this past?" Schoenbohm asked. It  is necessary to remain a reliable partner of the international  community. Specific security policy action is oriented toward  interests.    Schoenbohm pointed out that the German defense budget went  down by 18 percent from 1989-93 if the inflation rate is taken  into consideration. In 1995, the decline will probably grow to  25 percent. Since cutbacks of personnel and operations are  hardly possible, saving was affected all the more in financial  means for investments and research. From 1989-93, these means  went down by 43 percent and will have declined by 55 percent by  1995. By 1995, the means available for procurement will even be  60 percent lower than those in 1989. The decline in orders by  the Bundeswehr caused German armament industry to lose half of  the 280,000 jobs by the end of last year. This year and next  year, industry expects the loss of another 40,000 to 60,000 jobs.    Schoenbohm also thinks that this development is dangerous  because the imminent loss of armament technology skills in key  branches creates undesirable dependence on other states and  destroys the preconditions for having Germany participate in  cooperation projects in the field of armament. After all, an  efficient German armament industry is also an essential element  for Germany's ability to function in the Alliance.    The state secretary said that the future of German armament  industry lies in systems technology and high technology, command  and weapons operations systems, sensors, and electronics.  Together with the industry, the Defense Ministry is trying to  work out the minimum capacities in defense technology, predict  their utilization during the planning period, and determine  fields of equipment that must be taken care of at all costs. In  the future, aspects of armament technology and armament  economics will be taken into account in Bundeswehr planning to a  greater extent than so far, the state secretary said.</p>

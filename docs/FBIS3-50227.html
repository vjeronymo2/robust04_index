			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov on the national </F> budget" -- recorded]    [Text] My fellow countrymen: I address you at a very  important time for the development of our country. It is now  more than one year since this government assumed the leadership  of the country under conditions that were very difficult  regarding both the international and domestic situation.  Despite this, in 1993 we achieved important results in  implementing the government program. Annual inflation decreased  15 percent. The fall in industrial output was sharply  decreased. A provisional trade agreement was signed between  Bulgaria and the European Union. Agreement was reached with the  London Club on settling our foreign debt. A decision was  adopted on settling the so-called bad debts of the state  enterprises that date before 1991. Some 43 percent of the land  was restored to former owners, and an additional 23 percent was  allocated for provisional use. We saw the beginning of market  privatization. All the conditions for rapidly carrying out the  first stage of mass privatization were prepared, despite the  fact that the relevant bill has already been delayed five months  by the parliamentary commissions. We have fulfilled the promise  to compensate for 95 percent of the income of pensioners and  those who work in the state sector affected by inflation.  Without this those people would have found themselves in a much  more serious situation than existed in December 1992.    I do not say that there were no shortcomings in our work,  but  it is irresponsible to claim that nothing was accomplished  during the past year.    At the beginning of 1994 we face a significant test -- the  adoption of the 1994 state budget. In this sphere the  government completed its work on time. The draft budget was  prepared and submitted to the National Assembly at the beginning  of December 1993. This draft is the cornerstone of the  government's intentions in economic policy.    We fully realize that despite the achievements, the  country's  economy is still unstable. This requires us to implement  balanced measures aimed at restructuring, stabilizing,  maintaining, and developing the social welfare system and apply  funds prudently. One of the cabinet's basic goals, in addition  to the struggle against inflation and the economic crisis, is to  resolve the issue of the country's foreign debt to commercial  banks. In this way we will relieve our economy of the burden of  its total isolation vis-a- vis the international financial  markets.    The achievement of the economic policy goals proposed by the  cabinet depends to a large extent on the support our country  receives from the international financial community. This  applies not only to the scope of the aid we will receive, but  also to the timing of receiving it.    In the course of the discussion on the budget in the  National  Assembly and outside it demands were voiced by separate  departments and public sectors to receive far more resources  than envisaged by the budget. When such demands are voiced  those who make them act purely from their own limited interests  without taking into consideration the general national balance.  Such a course is very easy and perhaps even very profitable  from a political point of view. An impossible situation would  emerge, however, if we all head in the same direction.    This government was elected on the basis of an  anti-inflation  program. Despite the views of some that it has not shown  sufficient will to govern, the government has in fact followed  this anti- inflation policy until now. The government will  continue to follow this policy with determination, despite the  unpopular measures that are occasionally necessary.    It is very easy to release the anti-inflation brakes and  give  everyone much higher pensions and wages, free medical services,  free medicines, free higher education, and cheap apartments,  heating, and electric power, all subsidized by the government.  This is possible only if parliament relieves the government of  the responsibility of struggling against inflation.    Either we wage this struggle, or by implementing the  aforementioned benefits we will slide down the slope of  accelerated inflation. There is no middle way. Let those who  want a policy that leads to accelerated inflation have the  courage to say so clearly and openly.    The draft budget is being discussed by the relevant  parliamentary commissions and it will soon be included in the  National Assembly agenda for its first reading. It must be  pointed out that several important factors for the country  depend on the final adoption of the budget at the second reading  no later than 16 February. The government has already taken  those factors into account in various agreements that it signed.    The first is the receipt of the financial aid from the G-24,  which will meet on 4 March in Brussels to discuss financial  issues. We expect aid from them to the tune of $300-330 million  for financing the country's balance of payments on condition  that the implementation of the government's economic policy  begins on the basis of adopting the 1994 draft budget. However,  the G-24 countries need a minimum of two weeks to prepare their  meeting and assume their commitments. Precisely this determines  the term that I have mentioned, namely, adopting the budget no  later than 16 February.    Signing a new agreement with the IMF is another significant  source of financing the country's process of reforms. This  could be implemented by mid-March, if the budget is adopted by  16 February. On this basis, even before the end of March the  country could receive the first part of the financial aid, which  amounts to about $150 million, and an additional $100 million  from the World Bank structural restructuring loan. By about the  same time -- 22 March -- and under the same preconditions a  meeting of the Paris Club will take place. We expect from this  meeting not only officially to reschedule the payments of our  foreign debt at better conditions, but also to obtain an  additional reduction of 50-60 percent on a bilateral basis. For  this we are relying on France's active support.    If this entire chain reaction is not put into effect because  we do not adopt or we delay the adoption of the Budget Bill,  everything we achieved in the past year will lose its  importance. The disruption of this chain of favorable  opportunities that we have prepared by not adopting the 1994  Budget Bill on time, will result in a sharp worsening of our  balance of payments, the dollar exchange rate, accelerated  inflation, and generally, an economic crisis in 1994. I would  like to remind you that in addition to this financial aspect  there is a social one: Everyone can imagine what effect all  this will have on socially deprived circles and how pensions,  grants, medical services, education, culture, the police, and  the army, on which the country's security depends, will be  affected. In such a case, if the adoption of the budget is  delayed after 16 February, or if the Budget Bill is not adopted  by the National Assembly, the government will not be held  responsible for the consequences. The government's task ends  here, namely, with ensuring this chain of favorable  opportunities. From this point on the responsibility belongs to  parliament. Therefore I appeal to politicians to adopt the  budget by mid-February. Afterward, everyone may act in  accordance with his own understanding. However, now, those  politicians in and outside parliament who cause a delay in  adopting the budget or prevent its adoption will be betraying  the interests of their people and, because of their malice and  political shortsightedness, they are prepared to ruin the  country if they cannot rule it. It is not in this way that one  could assume power in the country.    The last opportunity to adopt the budget on time will be if  it is put on the National Assembly agenda on Thursday [27  January] or Friday [28 February]. The two Mondays and Tuesdays  before 16 February must become regular working days for the  National Assembly.    I appeal to the National Assembly members not only to adopt  the Budget Bill rapidly, but also to show a responsible and  competent approach during the debate.    The alternative to adopting the budget is obvious --  immediate new parliamentary elections. Simultaneously, the  sociological polls and the experts imply that this is an  illusionary alternative, unwanted by the political forces and  the voters. The elections will immediately mean that the  country will be in the midst of a desperate political crisis  that will lead to economic chaos and delayed reforms.    There are only those two alternatives. No compromise is  possible. You must select one of the two alternatives in the  next few days. It was my duty today to warn you all about this,  so that tomorrow there will be no misunderstanding as to who  defended the national needs and who must bear the responsibility  for causing the premeditated economic-political disaster in our  country. Let us rally this time around the necessity to adopt  the budget on time, and thus demonstrate that we are a nation  that merits respect, and one that can understand and defend its  common interests. Otherwise we will be at the end of the line.  In such a case the difficulties that we have experienced in the  last three years will be in vain, and the next government will  have to begin everything anew.    Thank you very much.</p>

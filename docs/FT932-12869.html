			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Indonesia tries to attract more foreign investment MR MAR'IE Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, said yesterday his government planned to improve incentives for foreign investors in response to increasing competition for capital from China, Vietnam and India. The government is expected to streamline industrial licensing procedures, extend the periods for which foreigners are allowed to lease land and continue to liberalise the economy as a whole. 'We recognise that on a competitiveness rating we are now rather behind, especially compared with China,' Mr Muhammad, appointed minister in last month's cabinet reshuffle, said in an interview. 'We have to improve the whole investment climate . . . We will do it soon.' Investors have complained about corruption and bureaucracy in granting factory licences in the provinces and have also urged the government to give them more secure land tenure. Economists expect the lease periods of 30 years normally granted to foreigners to be increased to 50 years. The authorities are anxious to maintain investment to provide work for 2.5m people who enter the jobs market every year. Mr Muhammad said the government would further deregulate trade and industry, and liberalise the hitherto protected agricultural sector. The government had set a target of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent economic growth a year, the minister said. Mr Muhammad also recognised investor concerns over the parlous state of the banking system, dominated by state banks which are burdened with non-performing loans. 'We have to improve the quality of their productive assets,' he said, stressing the need for 'better management, especially in their credit analysis, in monitoring outstanding credits - that's very, very important and critical'. New laws governing the capital markets are also being drafted, Mr Muhammad said. Changes would allow foreigners to increase their holdings in companies which have listed only a portion of their shares on the stock exchange.</p>

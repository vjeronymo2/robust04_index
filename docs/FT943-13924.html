			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Into the 21st century - Video / Nigel Andrews has fun playing with a new toy I have seen the future and I have almost got it to work. My life has been transformed in recent weeks by the acquisition of a CDi Digital Video machine. Welcome to the wonderful world of advanced interactive home viewing. Technophobic teething troubles mean that I am still striving to master the intriguing game Caesar's World Of Boxing, in which you programme your own pugilist and watch him battle in glorious live-action colour. And I am also settling slowly into the other game requiring use of a remote-control joystick, Voyeur. In this you roam around a US presidential contender's mansion eavesdropping on possible would-be murderers. A computer-enhanced Robert Culp plays the politico, and a flotilla of semi-recognisable TV actors occupy the guest rooms. Using your handset, you zoom in and out picking up clues, highlighting evidence, or punching up your choice of tell-tale dialogue scenes. My mastery of this games universe is limited as yet. But I have screened the CDi feature films without problem and I can announce: you might as well throw out that steam-driven VCR now. This system comes closer than any previous small-screen viewing experience to providing the resolution, hi-fi colours and sound quality of a cinema. So far the Philips CDi people seem to have tied up Paramount and Polygram alone as major product sources, so the movie catalogue is small. Top Gun, Naked Gun 2 1/2 , Ghost, The Crying Game and a couple of dozen more. But for the first few days of using this machine, what you watch hardly matters. You are startled that faces look real and humanly coloured rather than blobbed in with video-pink; that night time scenes are not invisible to all but badgers; that grain and blurriness are things of the past. A favourite movie scene that on the VCR looked scarcely better than a home video - let us say, Frank Drebin's lobster-terrorised White House dinner with the Bushes in Naked Gun 2 1/2 - now plays like something out of Visconti. Since this machine has been handed to me on indefinite loan by the Philips CDi promotion people (its high street cost is Pounds 550), I should probably moderate my enthusiasm lest there are cries of bribery and corruption. I also hesitate, as a film critic, to trumpet a viewing device that might encourage even more of you to stay away from cinemas. But a breakthrough is a breakthrough. And with movie CDs as with music CDs - to which they are near-identical in size, shape and price (Pounds 15 per film) - you have unprecedented intervention powers. Scenes are 'chapter-headed' so that you can jump straight to them. There is a freeze button, producing a perfect image not an imitation of a distressed blancmange. And when you press the final stop button, that is it: you do not have to look at the ceiling for five minutes while the tape rewinds. With my credibility as a cassette-recommender under threat, I must now turn 180 degrees and argue for such virtues as VCR viewing still has. The main one is range. There is movie life outside Paramount, and in the foreign film department July offers riches aplenty. Pick of the month is Farewell My Concubine (Artificial Eye), Chen Kaige's epic of modern Chinese history, escorting us through 50 sumptuously dramatised years from 1920 to the Cultural Revolution. Other sensory feasts have made the journey from large screen to small. Juzo Itami's Tampopo (Electric) is a Japanese comedy about food, sex and Buddhism. Fassbinder's Effi Briest (Connoisseur) is a hieratically handsome version of the classic German novel. And on a new video label called 'Dangerous To Know' you might try Hamlet and A Midsummer Night's Dream: two kitsch-rich Shakespeare adaptations by Anglo-Italian director Celestino Coronado, a sort of bantamweight Derek Jarman. But it is no good. I cannot stay away from the CDi. I am now playing an interactive disc called The Worlds Of . . ., which features several pop groups I have never heard of called 'Sultans of Ping', 'Ugly' and the like. Coaxing my handset's mushroom-shaped control button, I dodge about between groups and between songs. I can also answer quizzes, choose bits of interview and even play a hide-and-seek game with the 'Sultans' on the Tokyo subway. Amazing. I was only just getting used to the 20th century, and now here is the 21st.</p>

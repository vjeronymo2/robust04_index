			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Pay plight of young people Sir, Your article on the pay falls experienced by under 21-year-olds, when compared with older workers ('Under 21s slip behind in pay', January 14) highlights a big issue - and the fact that there has been 'no evidence of systematic falls' since young people were removed from wages council protection should not be used to detract from its significance. Young people are in an increasingly precarious position. In addition to low pay we have seen in recent years the removal of income support from 16-17-year-olds, introduction of student loans, decline of the Youth Service, continual changes in education and more generally rising homelessness and unemployment. Young people are the future of the country and we ignore their plight at our peril. Sam Johnston, acting national secretary, National Council of YMCAs, 640 Forest Road, London E17 3DZ</p>

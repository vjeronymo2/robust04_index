			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> I am a 16-year-old who likes classic rock, especially Paul McCartney's and  David Bowie's. But I also enjoy such recent groups as Depeche Mode and Ziggy  Marley.  </P> <P> It would be a bad idea for David Bowie to vow to never sing any of his old hits  in concert again. If I paid to see Bowie or McCartney or any other of the "10  artists who should follow the lead of David Bowie," as stated in Hilburn's  article, I would definitely want to see them perform some of their old, classic  hits.  </P> <P> Sure, the recent works of these artists are great too. But what would a  McCartney concert be without an old Beatles tune, or a Bowie concert without  something from his Ziggy Stardust days, or even a Prince concert without  "Little Red Corvette"?  </P> <P> MELISSA HIDALGO  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

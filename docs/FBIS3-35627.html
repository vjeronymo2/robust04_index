			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The strategic command staff exercise in Ukraine's  territorial defense ended today.    [Unidentified correspondent] The five-day exercise was held  under the supervision of the commander in chief, Ukraine's  President Leonid Kravchuk. The main events took place on maps  at the Defense Ministry's training headquarters. This first  conceptual training involved all of Ukraine's ministries and  state departments. Understandably, the main organizational  measures on territorial defense are taken by security  organizations. Operational groups of the Defense Ministry, the  State Committee for Protection of State Borders, the Security  Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard,  and the Civil Defense went over the entire package of issues  related to defense of our state's territory.    At today's session, Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk,  commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, was promoted to  colonel general. Also today, after summing up the results of  the strategic command staff exercise, the commander in chief,  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, approved the country's  territorial defense plan.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] We proceed from the premise that  Ukraine is a peaceful state and will pursue a peaceful policy, a  policy of friendship, cooperation, trust, and fulfillment of all  international commitments. Therefore, we conclude that we  cannot have enemies, since we do not threaten anybody, do not  have any territorial claims against anybody, and pursue a  peaceful policy, overcoming all obstacles on the way toward  nonnuclear status. This is the concept. But life itself is  much more complicated and manifold than a concept. Therefore,  we cannot rule out the possibility that somebody could develop  an urge to test their power on our state and our people, and we  must prepare to defend our state and our people, which is  envisioned in our concept.    The strategic task we set before ourselves today is the  defense of Ukraine, and the readiness of both the armed forces  and others for this sacred task of state defense. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: In for the long haul It is too early to tell whether the US discount rate cut at the start of this month will succeed in injecting vigour into the domestic recovery. But the early July drop in new car sales hardly bodes well, while yesterday's figures on June industrial production and May business inventories confirm the weak backdrop against which the rate cut decision was taken. A decline in industrial output was inevitable after the June unemployment figures. Only a small portion of the latest 0.3 per cent drop can be put down to the effect of last month's rail strike on coal supplies. The disturbing aspect is the heavy fall in output of cyclically sensitive goods like motor vehicles and construction equipment. Nor do the inventory statistics point to a rapid recovery in output. Inventories are at their highest level since March last year. May's 0.1 per cent rise was accompanied by a 0.2 per cent drop in business sales, while stocks are particularly high in the flagging retail sector. There is not much in these figures to steer market speculation away from the possibility of another rate cut later in the summer. That would leave the dollar under continuing pressure, though yesterday's fall was more a reflection of worries about a possible Bundesbank tightening today. Moreover, if the latest rate cut does fail to do the trick, there must be some doubts about the ability of the US economy to respond to short term rate cuts at all. A sharper fall in long rates may be needed to rekindle activity in the residential mortgage market. But that is harder to orchestrate when the budget deficit is ballooning, the currency is weak and the appetite of Japanese investors has waned.</p>

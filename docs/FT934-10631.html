			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Queens Moat has say on valuations THE TWO firms of chartered surveyors under scrutiny for valuing Queens Moat Houses' assets at figures that differed by nearly Pounds 500m used the same basis to prepare their figures, the company said yesterday. Both Weatherall Green &amp; Smith and Jones Lang Wootton compiled their valuations on an open market, willing seller basis, Mr Andrew Coppel, QMH's chief executive said yesterday. Weatherall produced a final valuation of Pounds 1.35bn for the 1992 accounts. Within four months, Jones had submitted an alternative figure of Pounds 861m based on the same financial information. The details will add to the controversy following the release of QMH's restated 1991 and 1992 figures, which has triggered an examination of the two firm's valuation certificates by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Mr Barry Clarke, RICS assistant secretary general, said a decision was expected 'within days' from its assets valuation standards team. QMH issued a statement yesterday and wrote a letter to RICS clarifying the position. It said Weatherall had prepared a 1991 valuation of Pounds 2bn and a draft valuation for 1992 of Pounds 1.86bn. The latter was presented to banks in April this year and did not take into account the changed circumstances of the group. At the board's request, Weatherall supplied a revised figure in May of Pounds 1.35bn, qualified because it was based on unaudited financial information. In June the board commissioned Jones to produce a new valuation. Its Pounds 861m figure was delivered in September and accepted by the board. It is believed that the professional fees for the two firms were in excess of Pounds 500,000. When asked whether the board was tempted to encourage the surveyors to produce a lower valuation figure, Mr Coppel replied: 'Absolutely not. It would not have been in shareholders' interests to minimise the valuation.' It also emerged yesterday that Mr Donald Jackson, who used to work for Bird Luckin, QMH's former auditor, carried out tax work for the company after retiring. And both Mr Allan Porter, former deputy finance director, and Mr Maurice Hart, a former non-executive director, had previously worked for Bird Luckin.</p>

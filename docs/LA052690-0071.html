			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> STARLIGHT SHINES WITH A FIRST-RATE SONDHEIM 'FOLLIES'  </P> <P> Haunting, daunting and ravishing. That's what "Follies" is at the San Diego  Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim's tender ode to old entertainers and their memories marks a  turning point for Starlight Musical Theatre, which has made its reputation on  dependable if unremarkable productions of old warhorses like "Carousel," which  will make its fourth outing at Starlight in July.  </P> <P> Though Starlight, in its 45 years, had never tackled Sondheim, Sondheim  aficionados need not worry. Top-notch casting, which ranks among Starlight's  best, and sensitive direction by William Pullinsi, makes this story of retired  performers haunted by memories of their youth a vibrant portrait of life that  summons up tears and smiles, simultaneously.  </P> <P> As for Starlight patrons for whom a good show still means a sentimental story  with hummable tunes, let "Follies" be your bridge to a fresh way of looking at  the evolving American musical. The show is nearly 20 years old but new to San  Diego.  </P> <P> Sondheim is not asking you to do away with old-fashioned entertainment in this  show. He celebrates it by having the entertainers do period-style numbers such  as "One More Kiss," "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" and "Love Will See Us  Through."  </P> <P> But the difference between this show and the old standbys is that, instead of  using art to while away your time, Sondheim fashions "Follies" into a great  mirror that helps you look at your own life -- past, present and future.  </P> <P> James Goldman's script is ostensibly about four long-retired performers -- Ben,  his wife Phyllis, Buddy and his wife, Sally, all of whom grow to question their  choices.  </P> <P> The group is brought together at a final reunion with dozens of other singers  and dancers who used to perform at the Weissman before the theater is to be  demolished.  </P> <P> The crumbling Weissman, often thought to be modeled on the old Ziegfeld  Theatre, reflects the way our own bodies fade and will eventually fail over  time. The poignancy comes from seeing the youth of these players' dream-selves,  played by young actors, juxtaposed with the aging ones.  </P> <P> Ben (played with ironic panache by Dennis Kelly) reaches out his arms for Sally  (portrayed with exquisite radiance by Teri Ralston). But it is the young,  dream-self of Sally (the irresistibly ingenuous Christine Hewitt) who comes to  him for her kiss while the older Sally stands a few feet back with arms  outstretched; thus we know that Ben is reaching out for the Sally of his youth,  not of his present.  </P> <P> Vincent and Vanessa (rendered with stylish flair by Starlight's co-artistic  directors Don and Bonnie Ward) do a dance shadowed by their younger selves (the  graceful Reina Bolles and Jason Gonzales). It tugs at the heart to see the  young pair occasionally switch partners with their older and now-slowed  counterparts in Danny Herman's graceful choreography.  </P> <P> Among the many sumptuous delights of "Follies" comes from seeing seasoned  performers sing some of Sondheim's best show-stopping numbers. It is worth  catching the show just to hear the incomparable Marilyn Maye pour warm milk and  honey over that marvelously bittersweet and funny ode, "I'm Still Here."  </P> <P> Silver-haired Helen Geller, too, can stop traffic with her "Broadway Baby."  Gloria Marinacci Allen brings fragility and unexpected depth of power to "One  More Kiss" with Leslie Beauvais, complementing her beautifully as the young  Heidi who joins her in a duet.  </P> <P> Ron Beattie as Buddy, the performer turned salesman, sells "The Right Girl" and  "Buddy's Blues" with a force that is uncannily at one with the character he  plays. Old San Diego favorites Ole Kittleson and Pat White summon up old times  with the old-fashioned number "Rain on the Roof."  </P> <P> In "Follies," the crumbling set on which the Ghosts of Showgirls Past walk the  boards plays as large a role as any of the characters; Ken Holamon's design,  originally designed and built by and for the San Jose Civic Light Opera, brings  the story of passing time home with a one-two punch.  </P> <P> The one glaring hole in the technical support came from a sound system that  brought unintentional humor when it crackled as some of the performers  embraced.  </P> <P> But despite such minor technical glitches, the only real folly in this  "Follies" would lie in missing it.  </P> <P> "FOLLIES"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim.

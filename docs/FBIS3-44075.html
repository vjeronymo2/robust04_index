			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Government in Cotonou on 19 </F> January; read by Government Spokesman Marius Francisco --  recorded]    [Text] At the extraordinary summit of the heads of state  and governments of 14 countries of the franc zone, held in Dakar  on 11 January, it was unanimously decided to devalue the CFA  franc by 50 percent against the French franc. In a radio  communique issued after its sitting of 12 January, the cabinet  announced this important decision to the people of Benin and  expressed its fear of abusive price increases, which will  seriously erode the purchasing power of our hardworking people.  On his return from Dakar on 12 January, the head of state  explained in detail the reasons for the decision taken by the  heads of state and government and invited all economic actors to  be circumspect and show solidarity in order to spare our people  the negative effects of the devaluation.    It should be recalled that since the 1980s, African  countries  in general and the franc zone in particular, have been facing an  unprecedented economic crisis due to the collapse of commodity  prices. Instead of carrying out economic adjustment programs,  they unfortunately preferred to become indebted. Wages became  disproportionate and budget deficits became staggering. At a  time when trade barriers are disappearing, especially in Europe,  an overvalued currency is a serious handicap to development.  Aid donors, France in particular, understood this so well that  they decided to be firm with franc zone countries, in order to  encourage devaluation as the last possible solution. The  message was perfectly clear. The heads of state meeting at  Dakar understood it as well -- the African peoples also  understood it. Unfortunately, it is regrettable to observe  that some traders, businessmen, and industrialists -- eager for  easy and immediate gain -- have tried to take advantage of this  situation to bring our hardworking people to their knees.  Anarchical price hikes and the closure of some shops can be  observed in all our major towns, in spite of the government's  preparedness to hold discussions with the business community.  Nothing justifies the 50, 100, and even 150 percent price  increases over the prices prevailing before the devaluation,  except the desire to get rich quick by riding on the backs of  our people, who have already been hard hit by the world economic  crisis. This is a bitter observation, because the advent of  democratic renewal has ushered in an era of trust between the  government and the business community. The anti-nationalistic  adjustments made by some members of the business community today  strengthens the conviction that democracy can only be maintained  and developed by the organization of a relentless fight against  a nostalgia for dictatorial power and the enslavement of the  people. This is why the cabinet, concerned about the legitimate  interests of the people and desirous to maintain the social  balance needed for the pursuit of its structural adjustment  program, has taken today the following conservation measures:  1) The banning of price increases in Benin by decree dated this  day; 2) the freezing at 11 January levels, throughout the  country and until further notice, of the prices of the following  essential commodities: rice, sugar, cement, tinned tomatoes,  milk, bread, school supplies, pharmaceutical products, khaki,  locally-made toilet and household soaps, locally-brewed beer,  and edible oil. It must be stated that state offices and  companies like the Benin Water and Electricity Corporation, the  National Petroleum Products Marketing Company, the Joint  Benin-Niger Railway and Transport Organization, the Cotonou  Autonomous Port, the Posts and Telecommunications Office, and  the SONAR [expansion unknown] are of course complying with the  prevailing measures on prices and stocks; 3) the systematic  control of prices and stocks of the products concerned in  commercial houses and marketplaces by joint teams composed of  workers from different public administrations.    To mitigate short-term inflationary effects and reduce  unemployment, the government has decided on the following  compensatory measures: 1) Tariff reform, which will be  implemented in conjunction with members of the business  community; 2) essential commodities will be supplied in the  country, to the tune of 2 billion CFA francs; 3) the budgetary  credit initially set up under the primary school rehabilitation  scheme will be doubled; 4) procurement of textbooks for schools  and colleges will be carried out; 5) half the amount of the  duties and taxes paid on goods which arrived at the port before  the devaluation will be reimbursed upon presentation of the  relevant documents; 6) the setting up of a social fund of  between 1.5 and 2 billion CFA francs, with French financing for  labor-intensive urban works, a school dropout resettlement  program, an urban sanitation program at Porto-Novo and Cotonou;  7) a salary increase has been decided upon in principle and the  terms of its implementation will be discussed by the ministers  of the civil service, labor, and finance with the workers; and  8) the agricultural sector will be boosted to benefit its prime  actors -- the peasant farmers. The minister of rural  development is authorized to pursue the execution of the  emergency plan that he submitted to the cabinet and to implement  that plan over the short and medium term.    To enable the inhabitants of our towns and villages to be  well informed on the ins and outs of the 50 percent CFA franc  devaluation, the cabinet has requested: 1) The ministers of  trade and tourism, health, finance, interior, security and  territorial administration, and rural development together to  organize working sessions in those districts with prefects,  subprefects, and mayors; 2) that all its members inform their  respective personnel concerning the objectives of the  devaluation and the various measures arising from it; 3) that  the minister of culture and communication instruct the General  Directorate of the Radio and Television Corporation with a view  to the correct presentation by local language announcers of the  contents of this communique on radio and television, stating  clearly that the CFA currency symbols have not changed.    Finally, the cabinet instructed the ministers of trade and  tourism, the interior, security and territorial administration  to see to the active participation of the district trade  structures in the effective implementation of measures barring a  rise in prices.</p>

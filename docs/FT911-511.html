			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets: Oh no, postman's knock again - Serious Money THE NIGHTMARE is this. I am trapped in a room with no doors or windows, only a letter box through which junk mail from financial companies pours unceasingly. It reaches my waist, then my neck. I am finally suffocated by a bumper package on life insurance. We are all on somebody's mailing list. The vast majority of banks and building societies is either tied to, or owns, a life company. A credit card bill, it seems, is not complete without an accompanying leaflet and brochure. It is hard to escape this onslaught. Commercial breaks on television seem dominated by the financial sector. Open a magazine or Sunday newspaper - and the chances are a leaflet from an insurance company will fall out. The TV adverts are primarily about name recognition. Few people, confronted by an advert for Eagle Star, will say 'Good Lord. It has all become clear. I will ring up and insure my life tomorrow.' But a financial adviser will find it easier to sell an Eagle Star product, if the client knows the name. However, the expense of these campaigns needs to be watched. Nationwide Anglia, a mutual building society, did not have the cash to notify its depositors of the abolition of some of its accounts. But it could afford to finance the TV campaign in which a bearded father reads aloud a pretentious letter to his son. The tide of junk mail is mainly directed at selling specific products. Much of it is depressing. 'What would happen to your wife and family if you died, Mr Jenkins?' or 'How would you cope if you fall seriously ill?' Absolve your worries with a monthly premium. The alternative approach is to promise riches. Save just Pounds 40 a month, we are told, and in 25 years, we will have a sum equal to the Gross National Product of Canada. It is tempting to throw the material straight in the bin, or better still, take it down the recycling plant, in the hope that it is turned into something useful. Before you do, check that the material is not from a company with whom you already have a relationship. If it is, check again to see if the glossy brochures relate to a product you already use. Changes in terms and conditions may be hidden in the small print. One popular tactic is to trumpet some new service such as free travel insurance (which you did not ask for) while sheepishly mentioning some adverse development to the existing service in a later part of the document. If you are tempted to buy a with the illustrations or projections provided in the brochure. These are only designed to meet the standards of the regulators, not the consumer. If you are being offered a savings-related product, the chances are that the company will give an illustration of the kind of sum you will receive after a certain number of years. This will probably be based on an assumed 7 or 10.5 per cent growth rate. But do not forget inflation. Write back to the company and ask them what the real value of that sum would be, assuming 5 or 7 per cent annual inflation respectively. The figure will not sound quite so impressive, especially if you compare it with the total of the monthly or annual payments you are being asked to make. Also ask the company about its charges. Recent Money Management figures showed the effect of charges for a 29 year old man paying Pounds 30 a month into a 10 year unit-linked plan. On growth of 7 per cent a year, a policy without charges would earn a sum of Pounds 5,161. But someone who bought a policy from the company with the highest charges in the industry, Swiss Pioneer, would earn just Pounds 3,463. That is less than the total (Pounds 3,600) of his contributions. The illustration the company will probably give (but only with the cooling off notice) will be based on figures from the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation. This will show expenses only as a percentage deduction from the investment return. Such an illustration is too obscure. Do not be satisfied with it. On such a policy, the industry average level of charges eats up Pounds 875 of your money (assuming a 7 per cent annual investment return) and Pounds 1,102 (assuming 10 per cent growth). Going back to the subject of inflation, 7 per cent annual investment growth and average industry charges would in nominal terms be worth Pounds 4,286 in 10 years time. Assuming 5 per cent inflation, that would be worth just Pounds 2,631 in today's money. The really impressive payouts come over longer periods. The same 29 year old man paying Pounds 30 a month over 25 years might be enticed by the prospect of a Pounds 29,689 payout at the end, based on a 10.5 per cent investment return. That compares, however, with Pounds 40,317 if no charges were applied and Pounds 35,300 if the lowest charges in the industry (from London Life) were used. But if one assumes 7 per cent inflation over 25 years, then the value of Pounds 29,689 in today's terms is just Pounds 5,470. The policyholder would have paid in Pounds 4,543, if one applies the same 7 per cent discount to the annual contribution of Pounds 360. So all that saving earns a real profit of just Pounds 927. You may not have the time to waste on analysing your junk mail. But you should ask these questions before buying one of these products, just as you should check the mileometer and brakes on a second hand car.</p>

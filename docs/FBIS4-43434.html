			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "Berlusconi: Now the Target </F> Is Bossi"]    [Text] Rome -- Clarification: a key word, borrowed, or  inherited (with all the consequent ambiguity) from the First  Republic. [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi called for this  clarification, in his usual tone, which allows for no  objections, acting since Sunday evening [12 June] like the  leader of what will become the single party of the center-right.  "There is only one thing that I can say: As things stand,  there must be a clarification, first and foremost within the  League," the prime minister replied to a journalist who tried to  goad him with [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's latest  outbursts. In fact Berlusconi is aiming directly to separate  the League's two leaders. On one side the "reasonable"  [Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni, his deputy at the Palazzo  Chigi [government seat] (and to think that until a few weeks ago  he was averring: "Rather than allow a League member to become  interior minister, I will drop everything..."). And on the  other, the unpredictable Bossi.    An attack on the League for the sake of necessary  "governability" and the essential "clarity" between government  partners. This is Forza Italia's latest task. The successful  attack will be followed by another strategy: first, an  electoral reform to introduce a pure single-candidate system,  (that is, without the 25 percent elected proportionally) with a  single round; then, the building of the single party, led, of  course, by supreme leader Silvio Berlusconi. Defense Minister  Cesare Previti told LA REPUBBLICA: "I dream of seeing a great  party united under the same name...." After the elections the  members of the team have set to work. And the first step toward  what Maroni described as "a three-way integration of Forza  Italia, the National Alliance, and the League" is the exclusion  of the restless Bossi. The prime minister's political adviser,  Domenico Mennitti, explained: "The balance of forces has  changed; the European elections obviously clarified any  uncertainties about the identity of the majority's linchpin. In  March we were blood donors, but now... The real problem is that  the League has already performed its tasks: It has brought down  the old system and brought federalism into Italian politics."    Mennitti's theorizing continued: "The fact is that the great  political earthquake is still under way: The country's  political geography has not yet been established. We will see a  great many more changes both on the Right and on the Left...  With a pure single-candidate system, the cake will be cut in  two, and there will be many surprises." Could Bossi become a  leader of the progressive alignment? "Why not? He has great  political flexibility, but he is someone who has to operate on  his own: He is irritated by negotiations, mediation; he is  someone committed to struggle.... For the present, however, it  seems to me that he is merely creating great ideological  confusion: Liberalism and laborism are not the same thing.  When he has clarified his ideas, we will all understand things  better. At last we now have before us a year in which to  ponder, a year without elections. But let this be clear: We do  not want to reform a party, but to govern an alignment." To  this end Mennitti is planning a conference and a magazine.    To govern an alignment. In which there will be room also for  "Catholics, nonconfessionals, socialist-liberals." This idea  horrifies League minister Francesco Speroni: "I would like to  know from Mr. Berlusconi whether that gang of former Christian  Democrat and former Socialist scoundrels that are trying to join  with him are doing so on their own initiative or with his  consent... But as far as we are concerned, he can be reassured:  There has already been a clarification, and it is a positive  one. If he is demanding it as government leader, he is entitled  to do so. But it is incorrect for the leader of a political  force to demand to know who is in charge in another party. He  cannot ask whether Bossi or Maroni is in charge here." And yet  this does indeed seem to be the question of the moment. This,  as long as the two League leaders are not planning to share the  roles, in the hope of causing difficulties for their allies,  breaking free with a superlative "one-two." Those who know them  well rule out the possibility of rifts between them. And  yesterday the interior minister himself shelved the issue until  Sunday [19 June]: "In Pontida [League rally venue] there are  never any pauses for reflection for the Northern League. In  Pontida there is always a return to the attack. The same will  apply next Sunday... I think it will be a very interesting  meeting, useful in order to see where the League will go in the  near future." Some say, with Berlusconi. And others, such as  the League's lower house floor leader, Pierluigi Petrini, see it  "on the Left side" in the near future.</p>

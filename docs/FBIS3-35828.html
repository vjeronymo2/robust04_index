When explaining the meaning of the document, Vladimir  Isakov,  chairman of the State Duma's committee for lawmaking and court  and legal reform, said that "the chain of lawmaking has been  broken".    "There are facts when non-legislative bodies cancelled or  suspended the laws, which disorganizes the work of the legal  system," he said.    The declaration is called on to put an end to these negative  developments and designate the principles of legal continuity.    According to Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State  Duma, individual provisions of the draft still "need to be  substantially elaborated".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: ``Today Russia Could No Longer Construct </F> the Buran'']    [Text] The shop for the production of tiles  from refractory ceramic material, which constituted the basis  for the thermal shielding of the Buran multiply reusable  spaceship, has been closed down at the Tekhnologiya Scientific  Production Association (NPO) at Obninsk. The Tekhnologiya NPO  was the developer and the sole producer of such material in the  former USSR. After the actual shutdown of the Buran program  there was no call for the unique technology and numerous  attempts of the directors of the NPO Tekhnologiya and NPO  Energiya to offer the Obninsk thermal shielding material for use  in civilian projects (including construction) for the time being  have fallen through. At the International Aerospace Show  MAKS-93, which was held in Moscow during the period 31 August  through 5 September, the NPO Technologiya exhibit with  representative ceramic material attracted the interest of  specialists. However, the Obninsk ceramics also attracted  interest at last year's Moscow Air Show '92, but this never led  to the signing of real contracts.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Long campaign to mop up every poll-tax defaulter: Provisions will be needed to cover many severe budget shortfalls THE GOVERNMENT says it is determined to close all legal loopholes open to people who refuse to pay poll tax. But behind the ringing battle-cries from ministers, a large number of local skirmishes is being fought by an army of harassed council officers. A survey of councils by the FT provides further evidence of their difficulties and highlights the differing degrees of success among councils in collecting the cash. Haringey: there are about 160,000 names on the poll-tax register, and of those about 70,000 have not paid this year or are seriously behind in their payments. A further 30,000 are in arrears. The Labour-led council has collected Pounds 12m of the Pounds 49m due this year, and expects to be Pounds 15m short at the end of the financial year. Last year a shortfall of Pounds 15m meant that Pounds 61.85 had to be added to the local poll tax. The council is block-booking courts to pursue non-payers, although only one has been jailed so far. Lambeth: an officer said the Labour-led authority's finances were in such a mess because of internal difficulties and snags with computer systems that it was unable to say how many people had not paid and how much was still owed. Kensington: the council could not give figures for the number of defaulters because the population of the borough has a 50 per cent turnover rate each year, and many people on the register are no longer liable for the charge. Nevertheless, the borough had a high collection rate last year. Westminster: the Conservative-led council has one of the lowest poll tax levels in the country, at Pounds 36. Yet it also has 25,000 people on the register who have not paid anything this year. That is almost 17 per cent of the total number registered, though some may have moved. About 88 per cent of the total due this year has been collected. The council did not incorporate any allowances for non-payment into this year's charge and does not foresee the need to do so when the charge level is set in March. Southwark: the Labour-led authority has so far collected 58 per cent of the Pounds 43m it is due to raise this year. Of the 175,000 people registered 110,000 are in arrears. Last year allowance was made for 20 per cent non-payment, adding Pounds 64 to the charge. 'This year the collection rate is about the same, and getting harder,' the council said. Camden: the council has already taken all complete non-payers registered through the court process, and has secured 58,245 orders, representing 44 per cent of its 131,917 total of people liable to pay poll tax. So far this year 65 per cent of the Pounds 58m target has been collected. It is likely that a surcharge of Pounds 60 to Pounds 70 will be added to next year's bill to cover non-payment. The council added that the surcharge also covered business rate defaulters. 'There has been a bigger shortfall of business rates than we expected,' it said. 'It is an index of the recession and the way businesses have been hit.' Liverpool: poll tax difficulties have been made particularly acute for the Labour-led city council because of computer difficulties and a long industrial dispute. The Labour-led council faces a total of Pounds 45.6m (66 per cent) in uncollected poll tax bills this year and is having to build in a Pounds 11.3m non-payment provision into its budget target. Warrington: of 135,000 people liable for the charge, 12,699 have not paid anything this year and the council has made a 5 per cent provision in its budget for non-payment. Officials are reasonably confident of achieving 95 per cent collection this year. The poll tax is still likely to increase by about Pounds 15, however. Chesterfield: about 6,000 people (8 per cent) have paid nothing this year. The local authority has made a 5 per cent budgetary provision for non-payment. Next year the Pounds 263 poll tax is likely to be increased by 5 per cent to 6 per cent to cover non-payment. Bristol: the city's poll tax of Pounds 369 is among the highest in the country, and the Labour-led council does not hide the difficulties in collection. 'The population has proved to be highly mobile . . . a considerable number have simply disappeared off the face of the earth,' the council said. Almost 100,000 people have been issued with summonses over the past two years for non-payment or near non-payment. The figure may rise by 50,000 by the end of the current financial year. The total of 150,000 compares with 596,000 who are registered for poll tax. The council faces Pounds 25m in accumulated arrears over the two-year period. Newcastle upon Tyne: the city council says 14,400 of its 220,000 people registered for poll tax have paid nothing. It has made a 5 per cent provision for non-payment. Manchester: 78 per cent of the council's expected figure for this year has been collected so far. Next year's poll tax will not be increased to cover the 1991-92 shortfall because the council can borrow for up to two years to cover this. It will, however, have to be increased to cover the amount written off from the 1990-91 non-collection - about 11 per cent to 12 per cent of the total. That will add about 5 per cent to next year's bills. 'There seems to be a general feeling abroad that the poll tax has been abolished and they don't have to pay, which isn't true, of course,' the council said. 'We will be going for the money to the death - and beyond. I can see us still collecting poll tax money in 1995.' Birmingham: an assistant treasurer responsible for collecting poll tax said: 'The new figure for the poll tax is going to be political dynamite.'</p>

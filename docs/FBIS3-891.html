The report of the coup was circulated after the distribution  of a hand-written statement in Djibouti city. The report was  carried by AFP three days ago.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Ahmed Dini stressed that he is  in  constant contact with the other members of the political and  military leadership, who told him that the "information leaked  by the government and the quarters colluding with it are  absolutely baseless." He went on: "Under the interception  policy pursued by the government of President Hassan Gouled  Aptidon, it is trying to fabricate a coup and problems inside  the opposition, instead of working to solve the country's  endless problems."    Asked about the military situation in north Djibouti, he  said: "On 3 March government forces tried to infiltrate our  positions in the Mabla area between Tadjoura and Wabekh [as  transliterated], but they were forced to return to their bases  after suffering heavy losses in lives and equipment." [passage  omitted]    Concluding his statement, Ahmed Dini Ahmed said: "A few  weeks ago I made extensive contacts with most leaders of the  Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy and decided in  principle to hold an emergency meeting on 20 March to discuss  military and political developments in the light of my visit --  the first of its kind -- to Belgium, Germany, and Italy."</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Ralston may spin off baking subsidiary RALSTON Purina, the consumer products company which last week acquired the UK Ever Ready battery business from Hanson for Dollars 227m, announced yesterday it is considering the spin-off of its baking subsidiary to shareholders. The subsidiary, Continental Baking Company, claims to be the nation's largest wholesale baker of fresh delivered bread and sweet baked goods, and makes about 250,000 direct sales calls and deliveries each day. Its brands include the 'Wonder' bread products and 'Twinkies' cupcakes. The bakery business was bought by Ralston in 1984 from ITT, the big conglomerate. In the year to end-September, it had sales of around Dollars 1.97bn, and total assets of around Dollars 765m. Its operating profit was around Dollars 140m, after environmental and restructuring charges of Dollars 17m. The 'demerger' plan will be reviewed by directors of Ralston, based in St Louis, on May 28. Even if it is approved, tax clearances and other technical matters will take sometime to resolve, and the transaction would probably not take place for another nine to 12 months. However, Ralston said the demerger, if completed, would probably involve a dividend of up to Dollars 600m being paid from Continental Baking Company to Ralston. The stock market immediately marked Ralston shares Dollars 1 1/4 higher, at Dollars 48 3/4 , while Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, affirmed its debt ratings. Ralston's proposed moves come amid a modest spate of demergers in the US - ranging from Union Carbide, with its industrial gases business, to Dial Corporation with its financial services division. Ralston said the aim of the move was 'to enhance shareholder value by focusing more specifically on its other core businesses'. The bakery market in the US - in common with the UK - is a mature industry, with total sales of Dollars 7.4bn and static volumes in 1991. Continental saw lower volumes in 1991, although higher margins meant operating profit was flat.</p>

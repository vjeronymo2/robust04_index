			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Brittan defends BA decisions Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday rejected charges by Air France that he had applied a double standard in favouring recent takeover bids by British Airways, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. Mr Bernard Attali, Air France president, has threatened legal action over Sir Leon's clearance of BA's takeover of Dan Air, and his failure to prevent BA's plan to take just under 50 per cent stake in the French regional airline Transport Aerien Transregional (Tat). But Sir Leon's officials suggested that Mr Attali was misinformed, specifically in his charge that the anti-trust directorate should have included Dan-Air's air charter business before determining that the deal did not fall under the EC merger threshold of Ecu250m (Pounds 203m) annual turnover. Officials said that since BA was not acquiring Dan Air's air charter business, it would have been wrong to include it in its merger calculation.</p>

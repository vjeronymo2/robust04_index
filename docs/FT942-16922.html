			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Bonds: Finland surprises with FRN The international bond market sprang back to life with the launch of a handful of large deals in a range of currencies yesterday. However, in spite of the apparent resurgence in new issue activity, syndicate officials complained that investors generally were slow to take up the new deals as market conditions remain fairly unsettled. The Republic of Finland continued the trend for floating rate paper, tapping the market with a Dollars 1.5bn, five-year floating rate note. The bonds will have a coupon of three-month Libid, and will be priced at 99.68 to give a yield of five basis points below three-month Libor. Based on yesterday's Libor figure of 4 per cent, for example, that would mean a yield of 3.95 per cent, although the actual coupon level has not been set yet. The size of the deal took the market by surprise, and the issue was seen by some syndicates as being quite aggressively priced - particularly since the borrower is not considered to be in line for a credit-rating upgrade in the immediate future. 'It (the pricing) could have been more generous by a couple of basis points,' said one floating rate note specialist. Goldman Sachs, the lead manager, noted healthy demand for the issue from investors in east Asia, including central banks and government agencies. The bonds are due to break syndicate today. Attractive swap opportunities once again lured a couple of borrowers into the Eurolira sector, with the Kingdom of Sweden increasing its new issue to L150bn from L120bn due to strong demand. Sweden's issue is structured in a similar fashion to the recent L170bn deal from Bank Austria, in that the bonds have a 10-year maturity but are callable after a specified time - in this case, three years. BCI, the lead manager, quoted a yield-to-redemption of 9.33 per cent, and a yield based on a three-year maturity of 9.64 per cent, using a late afternoon price of 98.70. BCI said that demand came mainly from Italian domestic institutions. Elsewhere in Europe, borrowers tapped the French franc and D-Mark sectors with fairly substantial issues, in spite of the continuation of difficult underlying market conditions. Province of Quebec issued FFr5bn of 10-year bonds, which were priced to yield 65 basis points over the French government bond. The spread widened out slightly to 66 basis points while the price of the bonds fell back from a re-offer price of 98.63 to 98.25 by late afternoon - which meant that the bonds were trading outside fees. One of the joint book-runners pointed out that Province of Ontario is keen to diversify its funding programme, and had swapped the proceeds. In the D-Mark sector, Commerzbank Overseas Finance launched a DM500m, five-year deal which was aimed primarily at retail investors in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries.</p>

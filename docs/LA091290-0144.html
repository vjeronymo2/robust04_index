			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUTY EARNINGS: KARCHER ENTERPRISES SEES SALES INCREASE IN 2ND QUARTER  </P> <P> Despite discounting to stay competitive, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said  Monday that it earned $5.1 million during its second quarter ended Aug. 13, up  8.5% from earnings of $4.7 million last year.  </P> <P> The Anaheim-based operator of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain said sales for the  quarter rose to $125 million, up 1.7% from last year's $122.9 million.  </P> <P> The company called the figures "encouraging, considering the heavy competitive  discounting" among fast-food chains over the summer that hurt industry profits.  </P> <P> For the first six months of Karcher's fiscal year, the company earned $10.3  million, a drop of 1% from last year's $10.4 million.  </P> <P> Given the improvement in second-quarter earnings, the company said it expects  to show stronger year-end earnings for 1990 than it did in 1989.  </P> <P> Sales for the first six months rose 3.8%, to $282.1 million from $271.7  million.  </P> <P> Sales increased this year despite Karcher's selling or franchising 40  company-owned restaurants in Arizona, the company said.  </P> <P> Karcher owns, franchises or licenses 554 restaurants in the western United  States and Japan.  </P></p>

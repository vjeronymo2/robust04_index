			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / US calls for action on UN troops MS Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday called for an overhaul of the way in which the UN takes decisions on peacekeeping, and said the US would use force unilaterally where its vital interests were at stake. Ms Albright said UN decision-making must be 'overhauled' so that no foreign troops were sent 'in harm's way without a clear mission, competent commanders, sensible rules of engagement and the means required to get the job done'. However, the US would not abandon its right to act alone. 'President Clinton will not hesititate to act as a commander in chief to protect America and Americans,' she said, citing such examples as the US intervention in Panama, pursuit of terrorists, and President Ronald Reagan's decision to apprehend the hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship. This was the third Clinton administration foreign policy address this week, setting the stage for his appearance at the UN General Assembly next Monday. The speech echoed a Senate foreign 1relations committee report in August. It said troops going into arenas of war must be given clear mandates from the beginning of operations and a realistic time frame of action so operations may be properly planned and implemented. Congress has grown concerned about US involvement in Somalia and plans in Bosnia. A House appropriations committee this week approved Dollars 383m for future peacekeeping operations, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. It attached a requirement the president inform the committee 15 days before sending troops to an international humanitarian effort. He would have to state the estimated cost of the operation, how it will be funded, its projected duration, scope and goals.</p>

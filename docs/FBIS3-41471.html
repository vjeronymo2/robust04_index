Enterprises that work with dangerous waste should register  themselves at local governments to get licenses for its use and  transportation, under the amendments.    The inspectorate established businesslike cooperation with  the Customs Department, which is provided with the list of  dangerous substances, Roska said. Customs officers also inform  regional inspectors on any suspicious cargos, he said.    Customs officers together with the regional inspector, for  example, recently detained 15 railway containers with phenolic  waste, which the Belarus-based Ruta firm was sending to its  Latvian partner Service SPB.    Roska said that Service SPB must have planned to sell the  waste as cheap heating fuel. When burnt, phenolic waste  produces toxic foul-smelling fumes that are harmful to nature  and people's health.    The Basel convention also forbids interstate transportation  of phenolic waste, Roska said. The cargo was returned to  Belarus 6 January.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: TODAY, A WOMAN'S PLACE IS AT THE MALL  </P> <P> There was a time when women got away from it all by climbing in the car,  driving to a gas station and putting air in the tires. Their kids could go to a  playground and their husbands could hang out at barbershops or bars, but women  never really had a place of their own to escape to . . . until malls.  </P> <P> Any time of the day or night, there's a procession of women whose blank faces  are illuminated by the neon lights as they shuffle through the maze of shops as  if they're returning from a war. Occasionally they pause to stare into a  window, but mostly it's someplace to be where they don't have to worry about  walking into the headlights of a moving car.  </P> <P> Malling has become a verb. It's what women do when they see mushrooms growing  out of the bathroom carpet. It's what they do when their husbands are watching  38 consecutive hours of football and they feel a desperate need to see some  form of life. It's the only activity that seems to help when MTV has them  talking to the toaster. Malling is a lot like cruising without a car.  </P> <P> I mall every weekend. I know when the plants there are too dry and need  watering. I know how many times the same store goes out of business and when  "Final Sale" really means final. I know how many candles I can inhale before I  pass out and when the pet shop needs to change the sand in the litter boxes.  </P> <P> Hey, I even know Victoria's Secret.  </P> <P> I'm not the only mallie. There's a whole city of us who don't know one another  by name but who are drawn to this retreat just to get away from the routine at  home.  </P> <P> Some mallies start off their day walking or jogging. They have a little  breakfast, sit on the benches and read the paper, and then break for lunch.  Sometimes they go home to shower and then return in the evening.  </P> <P> Actually, if it weren't for checking their mail at home, there would be no  reason to leave a mall. Everything is there . . . dentists, doctors, lawyers,  accountants, food, clothing, florists, bookstores and social activities.  </P> <P> Future anthropologists will undoubtedly poke through the remains of shoe  stores, card shops and wicker furniture emporiums and wonder what we did in  these huge indoor tunnels. They probably won't begin to understand why we got  in our cars, drove to a parking lot the size of Maryland and malled away our  hours.  </P> <P> They'll never know it was our Main Street, our front porch after dinner, our  favorite soda fountain, our town's only street light that beckoned us.  </P></p>

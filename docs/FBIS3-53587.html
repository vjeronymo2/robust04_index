Mourad Madaoui who is following the  proceedings sent us this report:    [Madaoui] During his intervention, RCD Secretary General Dr.  Said Saadi assessed the situation in the country and said that  it has not changed for two years. Moreover, Saadi said: We  have returned to the period of President Bendjedid's  resignation. This is what Saadi says and infers from the  stances of the sides steering the dialogue. He wondered about  the way the RCD could participate and about the form of its  abstention, if the council prefers not to take part.    As usual, Said Saadi was aggressive in his intervention and  strongly criticized the National Dialogue Commission's [NDC]  method of work, affirming that it did not take into account the  proposals put forward by some parties despite the successive  meetings. The RCD secretary general added that the NDC's role  has changed as it is now only directing the dialogue, thus  overlooking the political role entrusted to it. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Shamir insists loan funds will not be used in occupied territories PRIME MINISTER Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said yesterday none of the funds Israel hopes to receive from US-guaranteed loans would be used for Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. 'The funds we shall obtain through the loans will be devoted only, and entirely, to the purpose of absorbing the olim (immigrants) and not for building settlements,' he said. Mr Shamir said he thought his declaration would satisfy Washington, which is linking approval of Israel's request that it guarantee Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loans to some form of a freeze in settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'We will speak to (Washington), and we will see if it satisfies them,' Mr Shamir said after a speech to an Israel Bond corporation conference. Israel's ambassador to the US, Mr Zalman Shoval, said on returning from Washington yesterday that there would be tough bargaining over US-imposed settlement limits. Mr Shoval said: 'We are only at the beginning of a very long process of negotiations, and I definitely expect there will be difficulties. However, I do hope a way will be found for us to get the guarantees.' This week there were claims that Israel and Washington had reached a compromise that no new settlements would be built after Israel completes 9,000 already started in the disputed territories. But Israeli officials said the announcement was premature. Mr Shamir called the reports 'incomplete and inexact,' and said the US had shown 'a certain willingness' to compromise in Israel's favour. In another development, leaders of the opposition Labour party yesterday endorsed an agreement with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party setting the stage for early general elections on June 23. 'We will recommend holding the election on June 23,' Labour's parliamentary chairman Mr Haim Ramon said. Mr Shamir proposed early elections after losing his majority in parliament last week when the far-right Tehiya and Moledet parties quit the coalition in protest at perceived concessions to Palestinians in US-brokered Middle East peace talks. The elections had been originally scheduled for November.</p>

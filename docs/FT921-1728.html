			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Chicago trading of German bond futures poised to go ahead THE Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, and the Deutsche Terminborse, the largest options exchange in Europe, have signed a memorandum of understanding which should clear the way for German government bond futures trading in Chicago. The bund is currently traded at the DTB, which also trades futures, and the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Under the agreement, the two exchanges said they would examine the possibility of creating reciprocal offset and clearing systems for the bund future. Design and modification of the contract's terms, trading hours, price information sharing and marketing are also to be agreed upon. German banks, which have already shifted most of their bund trading from Liffe to DTB, support a Chicago link for the bund. German bank officials said bund trading at the CBOT would offer arbitrage opportunities and, because of time differences, extend the hours during which they could trade. The CBOT, home of the 30-year US Treasury bond future, the world's most active futures contract, has for some time pursued listing international bond contracts. Several years ago and again late last year it negotiated with Liffe on the bund contract, but those talks were inconclusive. Mr William O'Connor, the CBOT chairman, said that the memorandum, which was completed at last week's annual meeting of the Futures Industry Association, was the basis of 'a potentially long and broad relationship between the two exchanges.' For the DTB, an electronic exchange which competes for bund business with Liffe, it is an opportunity to draw trading volume to its market. It also would provide an international trading and clearing link for members of both exchanges, said Mr Joerg Franke, chief executive officer of the DTB.</p>

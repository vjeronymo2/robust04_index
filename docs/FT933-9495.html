			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Canada's Liberals turn up the heat: The ruling Tories look vulnerable, but it is early days yet IF contributions to political party coffers are a guide, Canada's business community is preparing for a change in government later this year. A list of donors to political parties published last month shows that donations to the Liberal party, which has been in opposition since September 1984, jumped by 11.5 per cent last year to CDollars 7.6m (Pounds 3.95m), with almost half coming from business donors. By contrast, contributions to the ruling Progressive Conservative Party slipped by 4 per cent. The Liberals' improved financial fortunes mirror a perception in political circles that the Tories face an uphill battle to win a third consecutive mandate in the next election, which is expected in late September or October. Before the Tories swept into office in 1984, the Liberals had been in government for 42 of the previous 50 years. But for most of the past nine years, they have been plagued by internal dissension and weak leadership. Liberals hold 79 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons. Even now, opinion polls show that while the Liberals are ahead overall, Ms Kim Campbell, who took over as Tory leader and prime minister in mid-June, is far more popular than the Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien. Ms Campbell has begun an effort to shake off the legacy of her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. Her performance at the Group of Seven industrial nations' summit in Tokyo last month made a good impression at home. Since then, her advisers have persuaded members of the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, to reverse an increase in their expense allowances. Ms Campbell was expected yesterday to propose tighter rules for parliamentarians' pensions, and a shake-up in the pervasive (but unpopular) system of political patronage. Ms Campbell indicated last weekend that she plans a number of other policy initiatives before setting an election date. According to one senior adviser, the Campbell-led Tories will further try to distance themselves from the Mulroney era by unveiling an adjustment assistance programme for companies and workers hurt by the free-trade pact which Mr Mulroney negotiated with the US in 1989. Despite these Tory initiatives, the Liberals' mood is more upbeat than it has been in years. The Liberals are well ahead in the polls. And the party believes Ms Campbell will not be unable to shake off the impression that, in the words of one Liberal MP, she is 'Mulroney in a skirt'. The party will lose no opportunity in the coming campaign to remind voters that, under Tory rule, Canada has suffered a deep recession and massive job losses. They will argue that privatisation and free trade have brought more costs than benefits. Moves by both Mr Mulroney and Ms Campbell to reform the generous social security system will be cited as evidence that the Conservatives are squeezing public spending with little concern for 'ordinary' Canadians. 'The main issue is to tie Campbell to her predecessor's record,' says a Liberal pollster. While Ms Campbell is promising to eliminate the CDollars 35bn-a-year federal budget deficit within five years, Mr Chretien is aiming to cut it to only 3 per cent of gross domestic product, from 5.2 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the Liberals are the most likely beneficiaries of recent developments among smaller political parties. Support for the left-leaning New Democratic Party, which has 43 seats in parliament, has withered, mainly as a result of the unpopularity of NDP provincial governments in Ontario and British Columbia. Disaffected NDP voters are more likely to shift their loyalties to the Liberals than to the Conservatives. Another point in the Liberals' favour is that the Tories' strength in Quebec has been sapped by the emergence of the separatist Bloc Quebecois as a federal party. Mr Mulroney, who is from Quebec, relied heavily on nationalist forces not only for votes but also organisational support in the 1984 and 1988 elections. The Liberals have addressed at least some of the internal problems which handicapped them in the last two elections. Although they remain divided on many economic and social issues, they have worked hard to present a more cohesive platform to the electorate. Talk in some quarters of tearing up the US-Canada free trade agreement, as advocated in the 1988 campaign, has evaporated. One pollster with ties to the Liberals sees one of his main tasks at the moment to guard the party against over-confidence. With ideology playing a relatively small role in Canadian politics, voters' minds can change quickly and often. Observers point to recent experience in the province of Alberta. Having rid themselves of an unpopular premier, the Tories came from behind to score a resounding victory in the June provincial elections.</p>

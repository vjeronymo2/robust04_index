[Correspondent Dukesh Baimbetov] Today, after a meeting at  the Republic's Ministry of Defense, the U.S. military delegation  headed by William Perry was received by Kazakhstan President  Nursultan Nazarbayev. As is known, during the recent visit of  Kazakhstan's leader to the United States the sides signed a  number of documents between the two countries on economic,  political, and military issues.    President Clinton and Vice President Gore have charged me  with paying particular attention to the practical implementation  of these programs, Perry said. Today, in particular, issues  were discussed regarding the United States in the conversion of  defense industry enterprises in Kazakhstan, inspecting the  territory of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and the  allocation of aid to its population. Incidentally, the first  aid has already arrived. The Americans brought with them very  valuable diagnostic equipment and medicines. They also spoke  about tripartite space cooperation between Kazakhstan, the  United States, and Russia.    [Begin Nazarbayev recording] There is nothing to delay on  the  part of the Kazakh side. At the present time, we are holding  talks with Russia. We hope that we will sign these agreements,  in which all the issues will be agreed upon, this month.    We have reached agreement both with the United States and  with Russia that Kazakhstan will be compensated for the cost of  the highly enriched uranium that is in the warheads.

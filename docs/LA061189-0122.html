			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Kurdish rebels accused Iraq of razing several towns and forcibly relocating  19,000 people in a drive to stamp out the Kurdish identity and carve a security  zone along the Iranian border. Diplomats and others in Iraq said the government  has moved up to 500,000 Kurds and destroyed about 3,000 villages over the past  few years in a major relocation effort. They said the plan is to cut the rebels  off from sympathizers and to break up the tight-knit Kurdish clan system. "The  Iraqis are pressing ahead with their mass deportation plan, and they're getting  away with it," said a spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a leading  rebel group. In Tehran, Iranian President Ali Khamenei pledged to support the  Iraqi Kurds in their fight with the Baghdad regime.  </P></p>

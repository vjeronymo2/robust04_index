			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Carlton It is tempting to view Carlton as an entertaining investment with reasonable growth prospects and a splash of recovery appeal thrown in for free. Its interim figures, showing a 16 per cent profit improvement and continuing progress on most fronts, seemingly contradict those who have chewed away at Carlton's shares since the start of the year. The newly-consolidated Pickwick is contributing nicely. New video products appear to be faring well. Strong sales forecasts for the Aladdin video should also help polish up profits. Carlton TV is already producing encouraging results as the advertising market shows signs of life. The company's stakes in Central, GMTV and ITN further confirm just how formidable a force Carlton will be in terrestrial television - particularly if the government were to relax the takeover rules applying to TV franchises. Even recent scare stories, which have so undermined the shares, contain more scare than story. Although alternative film distribution channels may eventually present a threat to Carlton video business, the big Hollywood studios are unlikely to risk them just yet. Nevertheless, despite all Carlton's attractions and its sub-market rating, it is doubtful whether the shares deserve to move much from here. Reuters, another unfashionable media giant, has fallen to a lower historic earnings multiple than Carlton. Reuters' growth prospects may be questioned, too, but there is no disputing the greater reliability of its income stream.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS CONGRESS;  </P> <P> A GUIDE TO ISSUES FACING CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT 22 RACE  </P> <P> Overview  </P> <P> The Democratic primary in Congressional District 22 features two political  newcomers vying for attention in a predominantly Republican district that for  the past 18 years has been represented by the low-key incumbent, Rep. Carlos J.  Moorhead (R-Glendale). David Bayer, director of adult education in Burbank, has  gathered more money and endorsements in the race than his opponent, teacher  Thomas G. Vournas. Bayer has emphasized his abortion-rights stance and his  support for a national health program, while Vournas has stressed programs to  aid poor children and workers and to strengthen the nation's infrastructure.  </P> <P> Contenders  </P> <P> David Bayer, 46, was a Peace Corps volunteer and professor in Peru before  becoming a teacher. He is endorsed by the California Democratic Party. Raised  in New York, he received a BA degree from Bowdoin College, a master's degree in  science from Cornell University and a doctorate from the University of San  Francisco. He and his wife, Rosa, a special education teacher, live in Burbank  and have a grown son who serves in the U.S. Navy.  </P> <P> Thomas G. Vournas, 66, of Altadena received his bachelor's degree from USC in  comparative literature and accounting and did graduate work at Columbia  University and the Sorbonne. He served as a U.S. Navy officer in World War II  and taught public school for 40 years. He and his wife, Grethe, have three  grown children, two in theatrical professions and one entering medical school.  </P> <P> Republican Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, Libertarian William H. Wilson and Jan B.  Tucker, representing the Peace and Freedom Party, are unopposed in their  primaries. Their names will appear on the general election ballot in November.  </P> <P> Questionnaire  </P> <P> Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and  were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space.  </P> <P> Q. Do you believe that there will be a "peace dividend" as a result of reduced  tension with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations?  </P> <P> If yes, would you generally be most inclined to use the dividend to: a) spend  more on domestic needs, b) reduce the deficit, c) cut taxes?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes. Spend more on domestic needs.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes. Infrastructure and education, if it is not eaten up by the  savings &amp; loan bailout.  </P> <P> Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of  supplies and imprisonment of dealers and users will ever significantly reduce  the level of drug use in the United States?  </P> <P> If no, what should be done?  </P> <P> Bayer: No. More money, smaller classes, better trained teachers to educate  people so they can change their communities, to control them and to build  meaningful lives not tied to the profit motive.  </P> <P> Vournas: No. Inner city must be totally restored economically, educationally  and aesthetically. Head Start programs work -- kids stay off drugs, do better  and finish school, and go on to higher education.  </P> <P> Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing drugs?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes, if drugs are closely controlled and addicts are closely monitored  in treatment centers.  </P> <P> Q. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the federal government is supposed to cut the  budget deficit to zero by 1993. Is that a realistic goal?  </P> <P> Briefly explain your answer.  </P> <P> Bayer: No. Small budget deficits in and of themselves are not dangerous. When  they become unmanageable relative to anticipated revenues, no money is  available to rebuild the infrastructure, educational systems, mass transit.  </P> <P> Vournas: No. The Administration has just realized the deficit is $60 billion  more than what they figured. Not unless bigger cuts are made in the defense  budget and a progressive and fair increase in income tax is levied.  </P> <P> Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more  difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land  prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers  to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property  prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and  Ventura counties refuse such so-called "up-zoning"?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes. The price of land has increased and the profits of owners have  risen when they haven't added any value to the land. Such profits cannot be  tolerated.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes. Certain seashores, canyons and mountain land belongs to all of  the American people. This land must remain wild and pristine. Resorts, gated  communities and golf courses are used by the rich.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support President Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut to  stimulate economic growth?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support capital punishment?  </P> <P> Bayer: No, but no parole or pardons for murderers.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first  three months of pregnancy?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support President Bush's policy of seeking to maintain good relations  with China's current regime despite its violent suppression of the  pro-democracy movement last year?  </P> <P> If no, what specific measures should the United States take against China?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes. Pro-democracy movement was only possible because we have had good  relations with China.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support removing China's most-favored-nation trading status because  of the regime's repressive policies?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's proposal to shift foreign  aid from traditional allies, including Israel, to newly emergent democracies in  Eastern Europe and drug-fighting nations in Latin America?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you favor opening up additional parts of the California coastline to oil  exploration under any circumstances other than a national emergency?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Congress has passed legislation that would expand tax credits for low-income  parents with children in day care and create school-based day-care programs for  "latchkey" children of middle-income families. President Bush has threatened to  veto the legislation, which will cost $27 billion, unless its cost is  dramatically reduced. Do you support the President?  </P> <P> If no, briefly explain your answer.  </P> <P> Bayer: No. We must invest in children at an early age when they are being  formed. Over the long run, we will save money with less dropouts, less crime,  less drug abuse, etc.  </P> <P> Vournas: No. The need is great. Our children need to be protected and kept off  the streets in programs where they can learn and study, play and be creative.  </P> <P> Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase if the proceeds were  dedicated to improving transportation?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase to reduce the deficit?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support limiting the amount of money a candidate for national office  can spend on the campaign?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Would you support at least partial taxpayer-financed campaign funding as  part of a reform package that limited spending?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms that U.S. senators and  representatives can serve?  </P> <P> If yes, what should the limit be?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes. Senators, one six-year term. Representatives, one six-year term.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you favor more control over the availability of handguns to the general  public?  </P> <P> If yes, what specific controls?  </P> <P> Bayer: Yes. Review purchaser's criminal record, require purchaser to state  reason for purchase, require two-week training period.  </P> <P> Vournas: Yes. There must be a good reason to buy them, a long waiting period  and re-licensing every year with an adequate fee.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the current program to build a "Star Wars" anti-missile  system?  </P> <P> If yes, do you think the program is adequately funded?  </P> <P> Bayer: No.  </P> <P> Vournas: No.  </P></p>

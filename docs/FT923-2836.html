			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Colliery closure will cost 1,400 jobs BRITISH Coal will close Trentham colliery in Staffordshire with the loss of 1,400 jobs, it announced yesterday, Juliet Sychrava writes. The closure of Trentham, near Stoke-on-Trent, will leave only one pit, Silverdale, in the North Staffordshire coalfield. It is the eighth colliery to be threatened with closure this year, as British Coal prepares to trim production to meet the anticipated lower demand in new contracts with the electricity industry expected to be signed shortly. British Coal said Trentham, which produced more than 2m tonnes a year but has lost Pounds 20m in the current financial year, had no future.</p>

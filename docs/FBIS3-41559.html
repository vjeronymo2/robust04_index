The officials cited improved sewage systems along side  rivers  flowing into the bay. They also said the sewage treatment rate  improved to around 65 percent in fiscal 1990 compared with 43  percent in fiscal 1979.    The agency surveyed chemical oxygen demand as the indicator  of water pollution in the bay.    The Tokyo Bay assessment was released Friday as part of an  annual nationwide survey of water pollution in lakes, rivers and  seas.    The quality standard in western Japan's Seto Inland Sea  stood  at 78.2 percent in 1992, the same as the previous year, the  survey said.    The national average quality standard in sea areas hit 80.9  percent, a slight increase of 0.7 percentage point over the  previous year, according to the survey.    The average river water quality standard stood at the same  level as the previous year, 75.4 percent, it said.    The quality standard for lakes and marshes improved by 2.3  percentage points to 44.6 percent, the survey reported.</p>

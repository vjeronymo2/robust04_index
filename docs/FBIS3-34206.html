			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 6 Feb (PANA) -- The Sudanese interior  minister, Brigadier 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammed Husayn, said on  Sunday that there was no connection between gunmen who assaulted  a mosque in the Sudanese capital and the Takfir and Hijra  Islamic fundamentalist organization. He told a press conference  in Khartoum that investigations so far have revealed no link.    Takfir and Hijra Islamic group first originated in Egypt  during the Sadat era and was famous for terrorist activities.  The members regarded all Moslems of today as "infidels."    Husayn said the death toll in the attack on worshippers at  the Khartoum Ansar Souna mosque on Friday had risen to 16 with  20 injured. The motive of the gunmen is still not known. He  said two of the suspected gunmen, who were West Africans, have  been killed in a shootout with security forces. The third  suspect, a Moroccan whom he identified as Muhammad Abdullah  al-Khilayfi, was injured.    Husayn said the gunmen, who were originally three, first  attacked a police station at Umbadda neighbourhood, injured two  policemen and took five Kalashnikov rifles and a Yugoslav gun.  They seized a pick-up truck from a civilian at gunpoint outside  the police station and drove back home where they collected  their personal effects and headed for the mosque. Husayn said  before they reached the mosque, the gunmen neutralised a police  station along their way to make their operation smooth. The  minister said during a shootout on Saturday with the security  forces who had tracked them down, a fourth person, a Yemeni,  appeared with the group.    The Yemeni and the Moroccan, Muhammad Abdullah al-Khilayfi,  were critically injured and cannot be interrogated at the  moment. The minister said the security agencies are also  holding a Palestinian student for suspicion of involvement in  the massacre. He added, however, that interrogation so far has  not linked him to the massacre.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Germans and French scheming EC reform FRANCE and Germany are preparing potentially far-reaching reforms to strengthen the position of big powers in the European Community. The proposals, to be presented at the special EC summit on October 29, threaten to open up old wounds over institutional reform already inflamed by the debate over the Maastricht treaty. France and Germany want to ensure that an enlarged Community remains capable of decisions. But along with the UK, they also fear their influence being diluted. A broader impulse in Paris and Bonn - not necessarily shared in London  - is to maintain momentum towards European integration at a time when doubts about European economic and monetary union are growing. Smaller EC members such as Luxembourg and Denmark are said to be 'appalled' at French and German pressure to introduce new rules for majority voting in the EC council of ministers, arguing that the reforms could relegate them to second-class EC membership. They warn that French and German efforts to streamline the EC and make it less bureaucratic risk upsetting the delicate political balance which - since 1958 - has made it a Community of equals preserving the need for unanimity on some important issues. Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria fear that an argument over institutional reform could alienate domestic public opinion already sceptical about joining the EC. They are worried about the impact on enlargement negotiations and possible delay of their planned entry into the Community by January 1, 1995. 'Do the Germans know what they are doing?' said one senior Nordic official who said Bonn had set an informal deadline of March 1 for settlement of the institutional questions. British officials predict a 'vigorous debate', but argue that Germany's determination not to delay the enlargement negotiations is likely to triumph over its interest in wide-ranging institutional reform. The French and German proposals for reform are still in draft stage, but one senior official said French and German positions appeared to be 'very closely co-ordinated'. He said the ideas appeared similar to two papers drawn up by Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman of the German Christian Democrat Union, and Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French member of the European Parliament. These papers do not enjoy official status, but are believed to represent strands of thinking within the French and German governments. Among the proposals are: A voting system in the council of ministers requiring both a majority of member states and a majority taking into account their populations - condition that would strengthen unified Germany. A maximum 10-member European Commission, to be selected by the Commission President from nominees by the member states, and approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Under this plan, the Nordic countries could no longer boast to their public that they had preserved the right to send a commissioner to Brussels.</p>

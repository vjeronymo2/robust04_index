			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Row with generators threatens 12 pits DOUBTS ABOUT the future of 12 reprieved coal mines have increased following the insistence by the two main electricity generators that British Coal cut prices below world levels to reflect stocking costs. 'There is no reason why our shareholders should have to pay stocking costs for coal we do not need immediately,' said an executive of one generator. The hardline approach by National Power and PowerGen will anger ministers because the government has said it will subsidise output from the 12 to meet the difference between production costs and sale prices. Unless British Coal can increase sales by 15m tonnes a year it is likely to have to start closing the pits. They were reprieved less than two months ago after a public outcry over ministers' plans for further sharp contraction of the mining industry. The generators' case for lower prices is based on their argument that anything they buy will have to be added to stockpiles already big enough to meet the needs of power stations for six months. British Coal has already negotiated to sell 40m tonnes of coal to the generators this year and 30m in each of the next four years. These sales will, however, provide a market for only the 19 pits which British Coal considers its core mines. With extra sales to household and industrial markets looking limited, the generators are British Coal's main hope for sustaining the 12 reprieved pits. The company has already offered to cut the price to between 90p and 95p a gigajoule - a measure of thermal efficiency - less than two thirds the price in the core contracts. But that figure compares with a price of about 86p for coal traded in Rotterdam, where most coal imports to Europe are bought and sold. Neither PowerGen nor National Power is likely to make any final decisions on extra purchases before serious negotiations begin between them and British Coal in the autumn. At these negotiations the generators are likely to insist on prices lower than 80p. Some British Coal executives believe the company will have to struggle to sell even 8m additional tonnes a year to the generators. That makes closures among the 12 almost inevitable. In a white paper on coal in March this year, the government promised subsidies for output from the 12 but was unspecific about how they should be paid and on what basis they should be calculated. Negotiations between British Coal and the government on the subsidies are at a preliminary stage. On the day the white paper was published, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, indicated that up to Pounds 500m would be available for subsidies.</p>

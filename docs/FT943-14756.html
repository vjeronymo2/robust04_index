			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (7): Heavy spend ahead - Infrastructure Argentina's once all-embracing public sector has vanished, leaving in its place newly-privatised companies to manage the country's energy supplies, telecommunications systems and transport infrastructure. These companies are now spending heavily to rebuild infrastructure collapsing after decades of neglect. Telefonica de Argentina, which provides telephone services in the south of the country, alone invested Dollars 925.3m last year. Signs of activity are everywhere: Buenos Aires has become an obstacle course as the new gas, telephone and water companies dig up its streets. Like most utilities, Metrogas, the Buenos Aires gas company operated by British Gas, is financing its investment programme from cashflow and debt. It has prepared a Dollars 300-350m five-year debt programme. The utilities are young companies, so their debt burden is still reasonably light: Telefonica's long term liabilities may have risen by half to Dollars 348.2m last year but they still represented just under 10 per cent of its balance sheet. Most state companies were privatised with guaranteed dollar-linked prices pitched high enough to generate ample revenues - as their clients now realise only too well. But the day will come when companies and investment banks must find private backing for new infrastructure projects, such as roads and power stations, which provide low returns and long maturities. Bankers are unclear how this can be done. Until February, when the US Federal Reserve increased dollar interest rates, companies could raise finance reasonably cheaply overseas. Now, the outlook is less certain. In June, the government had to drop a planned Dollars 150m IPO of its remaining 25 per cent stake in TGN, a privatised gas pipeline company, because of insufficient demand. However, investment bankers in Buenos Aires are confident that capital markets will still support infrastructure projects. For instance, just as the government postponed its flotation of TGN, Paribas was able to organise the flotation of 45 per cent of power generator Capex, raising Dollars 163.6m. Capex is not only a brand-new private gas-fired generator but it has still only built one-third of its planned capacity. Paribas adds that it was able to sell Capex stock at the upper end of the price range - shares were oversubscribed three times - thanks to heavy demand from specialist investment funds in the US and UK. A few weeks later, a consortium of five Argentine energy companies and Tenneco Gas of the US announced they would start building a Dollars 600m gas pipeline to Chile next year. The US government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation will lend Dollars 200m and provide Dollars 200m in insurance for the project. Banks and equipment suppliers will provide additional backing. British Gas and two Chilean utilities are to handle the distribution of natural gas in Chile. There is always the risk that companies will fail to meet investors' expectations. Neither of Buenos Aires' two electricity distributors have ever made money. They blame theft from widespread illegal connections. Already at least two loss-making privatised companies, one of them the flag carrier Aerolineas Argentinas, have had to go back to the government to renegotiate their contract terms. Spain's state-owned carrier now owns 85 per cent of Aerolineas, and is trying to sell at least 25 per cent of the loss-making airline in a private placement. Techint, an industrial conglomerate, has asked the government to lower mandatory investment in its Trans-Pampa freight railway. The railway has not performed as expected, due in part Techint says, to heavy flooding in the Pampas.</p>

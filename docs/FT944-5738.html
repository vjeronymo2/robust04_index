			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Hopes for growth hormone Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals producer, hopes to be able to begin commercial sales of its growth hormone in the US early next year. This statement was made after the US International Trade Commission dismissed complaints by Genentech, the US bio-tech group, that Novo Nordisk's product infringed Genentech patents. The Danish company said it already marketed the growth hormone, known as Norditropin in 50 countries.</p>

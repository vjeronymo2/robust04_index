			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Moscow protagonists fear revolt by regions: The struggle between Yeltsin and parliament is not the only conflict in Russia THERE is one thing the two sides in the conflict between president and parliament in Russia can agree on - the danger of the disintegration of Russia. They both fear the pulling away from a weakened centre by the 88 regions and republics of the federation, and their establishment as autonomous or even independent states. There is much evidence that this is happening. A series of meetings of rebel councils (regional parliaments) over the past week brought together leaders of councils hostile to President Boris Yeltsin's banning of parliament last week and produced demands to reverse the decision and to hold simultaneous elections for the presidency and parliament on pain of strikes, withholding of taxes and cutting the Trans-Siberian railway. A meeting in Moscow brought together nearly 60 of the council leaders of republics and regions - with some 14 chief executives, a significant number given they were Yeltsin appointees. . Militant leaders of the regional lobby have appeared. Mr Aman Tuleev, head of the Kemerovo Regional Council, and President Nirsan Ilyumzhinov, newly elected leader of the republic of Kalmykia, have taken the national stage to denounce Mr Yeltsin and support the parliament, Mr Ilyumzhinov looking a little improbable in that role since he abolished his own Supreme Soviet earlier this year (he says with its agreement) and has espoused the most extreme free market principles. Plans to form both a Siberian and Urals Republic, which predate the present political crisis, are said to be advanced. Further, since on all available opinion polls Mr Yeltsin's stock has gone up with the voters countrywide, it is legitimate to ask how far the regional councils reflect the opinion of the people they govern. The region of Nizhny Novgorod, well known for its espousal of market ideas, illustrates the strains between the governor, Mr Boris Nemtosov, and the leader of the council, Mr Valery Christianin. These two men are close politically and personally - yet the former has broadly supported Mr Yeltsin and the second presided over a session of his council on Tuesday which passed a motion condemning the president's actions and said his writ did not run in the region. Closer examination, however, reveals that the division is more apparent than real. The meeting of the council on Tuesday substantially toned down a much fiercer resolution taken immediately after Mr Yeltsin's decree last week. Tuesday's vote merely calls on the president and the parliament to obey the law - though it repeats the call for simultaneous elections. Mr Evgenny Zakablukovsky, an aide to Mr Christianin, said yesterday that Mr Nemtosov and Mr Christianin were sitting together after the vote and were laughing together: nothing seemed to have changed between them. If Mr Yeltsin wins his struggle with the parliament, he may find that the more extreme voices in the regions quickly drop their rhetoric of the past few days. However, the basic problems will remain. The centre's weakening grasp on the regional economies will strengthen only when it demonstrates its ability to take and to give in the interests of all. Senior ministers are out in the regions this weekend carrying the message that government can and will govern: they have a sceptical audience, but not one that is wholly lost to them yet.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 127;  </P> <P> QUAKE BREAKS  </P> <P> Earthquakes can't be prevented, but their destructive consequences can be  reduced. One sure way is to bring existing buildings up to seismic safety  standards.  </P> <P> The least-safe buildings in California are the 175,000 living units built of  unreinforced masonry walls, like brick. Current law permits required seismic  safety improvements made in these buildings to be excluded from reassessment  for property tax purposes for 15 years. That makes sense.  </P> <P> It also makes sense to have buildings made of other materials brought up to  seismic safety standards. Proposition 127 is a constitutional amendment on the  Nov. 6 ballot that would allow seismic safety improvements that are made in  such buildings to be excluded from property tax reassessment. It's a fair  measure that deserves voter approval.  </P> <P> Taxing seismic safety improvements on the grounds that they add to a property's  value is a clear disincentive to making necessary, even life-saving changes.  Strengthening a building so that it has a better chance of standing up in an  earthquake is obviously in a different category than, say, adding a swimming  pool or an extra room to a home. There is no reason for such seismic safety  improvements to be taxed the same way.  </P> <P> Local governments would lose some revenues by excluding seismic safety-related  improvements from tax reassessments. But local governments also face tax losses  when buildings collapse or are badly damaged in an earthquake. Proposition 127,  unanimously endorsed by the Legislature, is an important public safety measure.  We urge a yes vote.  </P></p>

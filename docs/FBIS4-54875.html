			<p>BFN     [Text] We were hoping that this evening we would discuss  the continuation of the peace process with the contact group --  [word indistinct] that the chetniks would have withdrawn from  Gorazde in accordance with the ultimatum. This was stated today  by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.  Unfortunately the chetniks have not withdrawn. Second, it is  (unacceptable) that the United Nations should make arrangements  with the aggressor's representatives, and help them transport  their tanks from one location to another so that they can go on  killing civilians somewhere else. That is why we will demand  today that Yasushi Akashi tenders his resignation, Haris  Silajdzic added. The decision to demand Akashi's resignation  was made today at the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency. This demand will be presented to the contact group,  which is to arrive in Sarajevo this evening to revive the peace  process.</p>

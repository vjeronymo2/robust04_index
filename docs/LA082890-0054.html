			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. KEENE SUPPORTS CARPENTER'S 'REVERSE STING' CLAIM;  </P> <P> TRIAL: MAJORITY LEADER TELLS JURY OF A 1986 CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE FORMER  LEGISLATOR SAID HE WOULD 'HAVE SOME FUN' WITH UNDERCOVER AGENT'S OFFER OF  $20,000.  </P> <P> Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter confided four years ago that he believed he  was the target of a sting investigation and said he was "going to have some fun  with it," Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene testified Monday.  </P> <P> Keene (D-Benicia) told a federal court jury that he dismissed Carpenter's  statement because the senator had many "idiosyncrasies" and was known to do "a  certain amount of fantasizing."  </P> <P> Carpenter is on trial on four charges of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy  as a result of a long-running FBI sting investigation into corruption in the  state Capitol.  </P> <P> Central to his defense is the contention that he knew all along he was the  target of a sting, knowingly took $20,000 from an undercover FBI agent and then  laughed at him. In recent months, Carpenter has maintained that he was  conducting his own "reverse sting" of federal authorities.  </P> <P> Much of the case against Carpenter revolves around a 1986 bill planted in the  Legislature by the FBI that would have given a $1-million tax break to a dummy  Alabama shrimp-importing firm seeking to open a processing plant near  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Keene was among 10 witnesses called as the defense began presenting its case.  </P> <P> At the time of his conversation with Carpenter, Keene said, the Legislature was  rife with rumors of a possible undercover investigation because of earlier  charges of corruption involving state legislators. Senators would joke among  themselves, he said, patting each other down in a supposed search for hidden  tape recorders.  </P> <P> Keene said Carpenter's comment about a possible sting came just before a vote  was scheduled in a Senate committee on the shrimp bill.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a bit too lighthearted to be taken seriously," Keene told the  federal court jury. "I didn't pay any attention to it. It didn't direct my  action at all."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Gerard Hinckley suggested that his client was a "Walter Mitty"  sort who sometimes imagined himself to be something other than what he was.  </P> <P> Keene agreed, saying, "Paul had very many creative ideas that were good ideas  and many creative ideas that didn't stand up well."  </P> <P> Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Nuechterlein, Keene  testified that Carpenter said nothing about calling authorities about the  $20,000 payment offered to him in connection with the shrimp bill. Instead,  Keene said, "He told me he was going to have fun with it."  </P> <P> According to evidence presented by federal prosecutors, Carpenter accepted the  money and promised in several tape-recorded conversations to take action to  help the shrimp bill win passage in the Senate. He did not vote for the measure  when it was on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> Also called to testify were Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los  Angeles) and Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), who said they could not recall  Carpenter ever approaching them for help in winning approval of the bill.  </P> <P> In one taped conversation, Carpenter told undercover agent John E. Brennan that  he had pushed Greene to take the measure off the inactive file in the Senate.  </P> <P> But Greene told the jury, "I don't recall any conversation with Sen. Carpenter  at any time regarding that bill."  </P> <P> Similarly, Carpenter aide John Shahabian said at one point that Carpenter would  go to Roberti to arrange to have the bill heard in a more favorable committee.  </P> <P> "I have such an absence of recollection on that bill, I feel pretty confident  that Sen. Carpenter never talked to me about that bill," Roberti said.  </P> <P> In an attempt to shake the testimony of Shahabian -- who is now cooperating  with the government -- the defense called Doris Morrow, a former aide to the  senator who testified she has lived with Carpenter since before the  investigation began.  </P> <P> She told the jury that she overheard a key meeting in Carpenter's office in  which Shahabian told the senator about the $20,000 contribution and requested a  cut for himself.  </P> <P> Morrow testified that Carpenter suggested it could be a setup but Shahabian  insisted it was legitimate. Her statements contradicted Shahabian, who said  that Carpenter never raised the question of a sting. Shahabian had testified  that he did not recall Morrow being present when he met with Carpenter.  </P> <P> The prosecution sought to undermine Morrow's testimony by pointing out her  close ties with Carpenter, noting that she began dating the senator nearly a  decade ago, before he hired her and at a time when he was married.  </P></p>

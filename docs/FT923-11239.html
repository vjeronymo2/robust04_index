			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Suited to the high life ALL OF France has been panic buying this month as the lorry drivers' blockade led to fights in supermarkets and queues outside petrol stations. But the well-shod shoppers on the rue Cambon in Paris have been fighting for something else - Chanel suits. We are not talking about summer suits for a sultry July day, but winter suits, costing at least Pounds 1,200 each. Chanel's autumn collection arrived at its flagship shop at rue Cambon a couple of weeks ago - and the shop has been besieged ever since. Before I moved to Paris I always wondered why no Chanel shop I visited had the groovy jackets that I had swooned over in Vogue magazine. The answer is that they sold out before they got to the shop. Shopping at Chanel is not like ordinary shopping. First, you have to be rich enough - or, like me, crazy enough - to spend Pounds 1,200 on a suit. Second, you must go to 31 rue Cambon to spend it. Chanel owns 68 shops worldwide, but these tend to sell its classic styles. The really good stuff is only sold at rue Cambon. Perhaps, like me, you expect to be able to saunter into rue Cambon for your outfit early in the season - perhaps September for the autumn collection, or February for spring - after you have flicked through the fashion magazines. Forget it. Chanel receives just one delivery of each style, each season. Once it sells out, it cannot be re-ordered - and the best styles sell out immediately. This is because the rue Cambon vendeuses tip off regular clients in advance, and also send them a catalogue. If they spot anything they want, the clients ask their vendeuse to reserve it. (They can cancel the order, but if they cancel too often, the vendeuse might not be quite so helpful next season . . .) That is why the hottest lines - certainly those in standard size 38s and 40s  -never get into the shop, and that is why rue Cambon will be virtually bare by September. You might think that this sort of behaviour went out of fashion at the end of the boom-time 1980s or that, even in France, where Chanel is a national institution, the recession would have dented demand for Pounds 1,200 suits. Not so. Chanel deliberately cultivates an aura of exclusivity, and it is house policy to under-produce the collection. The policy works. I had coveted a black boucle Chanel suit with funky gold zips ever since I saw it at the pret a porter show in April. As soon as supermodel Linda Evangelista sashayed along the catwalk, I knew that I had to have that suit - whatever it cost. Chanel posted its catalogues three weeks ago. The collection arrived at rue Cambon on the following Monday. I hit the shop at opening time on Tuesday - and got my suit. It was the last one left in a 38 and, judging by the squeals in the stockroom, my vendeuse had to fight another sales assistant for it. She returned triumphant to tell me how lucky I was to have the honour of spending most of my disposable income on it. Another woman was almost in tears, having pointed to jacket after jacket only to see the vendeuse shake her head and mutter the fatal word 'fini'. Chanel, at 31 rue Cambon, had already sold most of its winter collection, in July, after just one day on sale.</p>

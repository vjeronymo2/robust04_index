			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance under 10.550 and are subject to the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart V and final rule-related notices published at 48 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29114, June 24, 1983 and 49 FR 22676, May 31, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies which conflict with its provisions or which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by State or local governments. For disputes involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurements by State agencies and sponsors, this includes any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts 3015 or 3016.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best serves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 250.30 of the current Food Distribution Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations sets forth the terms and conditions under which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributing agencies, subdistributing agencies, and recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies may enter into contracts with commercial firms for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing donated foods and prescribes the minimum requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be included in such contracts. Part 252 sets forth the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conditions under which the Food and Consumer Service (FCS)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and commercial firms may enter into National Commodity Processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NCP) Program contracts for the processing and distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated donated foods to eligible recipient agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 29985) which would amend the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution Program regulations to strengthen provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the processing of donated foods and to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniformity between provisions governing State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, Part 250, and those governing NCP Program, Part 252.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule provided a 60-day comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule addresses those provisions regarding food service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management companies, contract renewal, requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing contracts, liquidated damages, alternate value pass-through systems, invoice information, substitution of donated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food, time frames for processors to pay refunds, refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications/performance reports, and list of contracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that a typographical error in the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on May 25, 1993, (58 FR 29995) misidentified section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(k)(3) as section 250.30(k)(4). The Department apologizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any inconvenience this may have caused in reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule for comment. Throughout this final rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct section number will be referred to when discussing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of that proposed rule in order to avoid further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion. However, the Department recognizes that the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 250.30(k)(4) is obsolete, in that it requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributing agencies to notify processors of the total amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> donated cheese they can receive during the 1988&hyph;1989 school year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this requirement is no longer pertinent to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program operations, the Department is removing this language from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received a total of 41 comment letters from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributing agencies, local school food authorities, commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food processors, a State school food service association, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private sector representative, the American Commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution Association, and the American School Food Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Food Service Management Companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 250.3 and 250.30(a) of the proposed rule would revise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of ``processor'' and associated requirements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove the blanket exception from the State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for commercial food service management companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed rule would revise the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``processor'' to exempt any commercial enterprises which handle,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare, and/or serve products or meals containing donated foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site solely for the individual recipient agency under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the removal of the blanket exception for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial food service management companies from the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``processor,'' twenty-five comments were received. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters supported this proposal for the reasons set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble of the proposed rule. The Department proposed this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change because of problems identified in the past when food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service management companies use commercial facilities to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items for the various school food authorities under contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

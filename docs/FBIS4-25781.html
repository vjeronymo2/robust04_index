			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Will WTO Reduce or Enhance </F> U.S. Sovereignty?"]    [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Washington never  lost a war or won a treaty. To some lawmakers on capitol hill,  this is still true.    The treaty is the final pact of the Uruguay Round talks of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Signed on  April 15, it will create the World Trade Organization (WTO), a  global trading system supposedly based on sound principles.    Within the WTO, Washington will not enjoy veto power. With  only one of 117 votes, some lawmakers are worried that the  country will be out-voted by third world countries, its  sovereignty reduced, and its laws undermined.    This is the key argument of wto opponents in congress, who  have stepped up their opposition, saying that the Uruguay Round  agreement should not be allowed to sail through congress like a  ship passing in the night.    "I'm not worried about sovereignty. I'm worried about losing  it," said Jesse Helms (D-NC), member of the senate foreign  relations committee. "The United States gets one vote, but it  will pay 20 percent of the budget for it."    The Clinton administration, which stresses that Washington  will be the prime beneficiary of a better world trade system  under WTO, says people like helms should listen carefully to  thoughtful trade experts.    "Our sovereignty is enhanced because a substantially  improved  dispute-settlement system will permit us to enforce rights more  effectively while at the same time preserving our own trade  laws," Rufus Yerxa, deputy U.S. trade representative, told a  senate hearing today.    Lawmakers who oppose the WTO often compares it with the  United Nations, where Washington enjoys the right of veto. They  are worried that if the U.S. loses a case in the WTO, it will  either change its laws to pay compensation or face trade  retaliation from abroad.    "We are transferring substantial power to an international  body that can coerce the United States to change our behavior,"  argued House Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA).    The U.S. has won many GATT cases on important issues such as  Japan's barriers to imports of agricultural goods, South Korea's  beef quotas, the European Community's oil fee subsidies and  Norway's procurement practices.    According to officials here, a WTO dispute-settlement panel  recommendation does not automatically change U.S. law. If the  U.S. loses a case, it is the sovereign right of the U.S.  Congress to decide what to do with the prevailing decision.    Some congressmen don't believe this. "This is a plethora of  red tape that means nothing," Senator Helms said. "It's not  going to happen."    "We are still going to have problems with countries under  this agreement; I don't think there should be any illusions  about that," Rufus Yerxa admitted at today's hearing. "This is  the best we can do."</p>

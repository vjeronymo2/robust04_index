			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Newmarket realises more assets Net asset value at Newmarket Venture Capital was unchanged at 62p over the 12 months to December 31. The split between investments and net current assets, however, was greatly different as the company continued its programme of asset realisation begun in 1990. At the end of the period investments made up 63 per cent (86 per cent) of net assets with quoted shares and unquoted investments falling from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 11.6m. There was a pre and post-tax loss for 1993 of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 1.32m) giving losses per share of 0.43p (3.65p). Details of the company's voluntary liquidation and distribution of assets are expected to be sent to shareholders in May this year.</p>

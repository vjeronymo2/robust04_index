			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Iraqi Central Bank Governor Tariq Talib al-Takmaji  has denied the tendentious rumors circulated by hostile sources  on Iraq's intention to take steps pertaining to the Iraqi  currency's value.    In a statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent, the  governor said: Recently, there have been tendentious rumors  circulated by hostile propaganda sources. These rumors are  aimed at undermining the legendary steadfastness of the good  Iraqis who have proudly stood fast for three and a half years  under an unfair and cruel embargo, which was imposed by the  forces of evil and tyranny. These forces are still boasting  about their defense of human rights.    Al-Takmaji added: These rumors include reports on the Iraqi  currency. Some parties alleged that there is an intention to  replace the present currency with another currency worth  one-tenth the present currency's value. The evil ones also say  that the state will possess 90 percent of the public's balances  deposited in the Iraqi banks, as well as other vicious rumors.    Al-Takmaji continued: These rumors-- which are circulated by  familiar trumpets whose approaches are well known--are not  reasonable, and I vehemently deny all these rumors. I also  affirm that there is no intention to influence the legal value  of the Iraqi currency or change its denominations, knowing that  there are rumors that claim that the government intends to  devaluate the dinar to one-tenth of its value.    He added: On this occasion, I would like every citizen to  thoroughly examine these rumors. After our perseverance for  more than 40 months, the dinar cannot be devaluated to  one-tenth, and the people can be assured about their deposits in  the banks.    Al-Takmaji continued: Some people who circulate these rumors  try to compare Iraq with some former Soviet states or some East  European states. However, such a comparison should not be made,  and these people know this fact better than others do. Even if  these people cite the current exchange rate of the dinar, they  are also well aware that this exchange rate does not reflect the  dinar's real value; it is only a reflection of a situation  dictated by temporary circumstances. This situation will  inevitably change when the embargo ends, God willing.</p>

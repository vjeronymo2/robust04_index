			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Bush spurred by hopes that Saddam is nearly finished PRESIDENT George Bush insists, probably honestly, that he is not seeking a military showdown with President Saddam Hussein or seeking to manipulate the situation in the Gulf for his own domestic political advantage. The political key to the present increase in tension lies far more in the additional damage that could be done to Mr Bush during the next three months by Mr Saddam, rather than the punishment that can be inflicted on the Iraqi leader by US air strikes. The hollowness of the Gulf war victory, as it has come to be seen in US domestic political terms, was fully brought home to the administration last month when, for nearly three weeks, the Iraqis denied UN weapons inspectors access to the ministry of agriculture, in defiance of UN ceasefire resolutions. Baghdad presented the affair as a great national triumph, Mr Saddam went for a much-photographed swim in the Tigris, and US officials acknowledged that they had been been caught badly off balance. It was an event that the White House was determined should not be repeated in the run-up to November's presidential election, in which Mr Bush is already trailing Governor Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival. The timing of the weekend's revelations of increased US military preparedness in the Gulf owed more to the fact that the UN weapons inspection team was completing its latest searches in and around Baghdad than to the Republican party national convention which opened yesterday in Houston. As senior party members pointed out, the last thing they wanted was for Saddam Hussein to deflect national attention from the official launch of the Republican campaign and it was certainly not something Mr Bush would deliberately choose to happen. They also doubted whether there was a great deal of political advantage to be reaped by bombing Baghdad, but there was much to be lost by allowing Mr Saddam to claim another victory. Part of this damage-limitation exercise appears to have paid off already, with the present visit by weapons inspectors in Iraq apparently concluding without Baghdad challenging the UN's authority. However, US policy is also directed to the overthrow of Mr Saddam and longer-term planning to achieve that objective continues. Evidence of this is now emerging from what seems to be a US-led allied decision to establish an exclusion zone below the 32nd parallel in southern Iraq below which Iraqi aircraft will not be permitted to fly. It is a move that the US has been reluctant to make, despite powerful evidence of repeated violations of UN resolutions by Baghdad. Western forces stood by when, in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf war, Saddam Hussein stamped out the Shia uprising in the south. Mounting evidence that the Iraqi regime is now deploying both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft against the Shia may have tipped the US hand. Representatives of exiled Iraqi opposition groups last month called on Mr James Baker, then secretary of state, and last week evidence was produced to the UN Security Council of continuing atrocities in the south. What seems to have been holding the administration back is its determination to avoid become involved in the political dismemberment of Iraq and its fear that Iran would be the main beneficiary of any allied intervention on behalf of the southern Shias. Arab leaders in the Gulf are themselves divided over the wisdom of seeking to divide Iraq into three parts with the Kurds in the north, the Sunni Moslems in the centre, and the Shias to the south. Set against that is the conviction among some sections of the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein is now closer than ever to be being toppled. They point to a serious economic situation with inflation out of control and basic foodstuffs ever scarcer. The recent execution of an estimated 40 traders accused of making excessive profits is cited as evidence of the desperate state of the regime. It is argued that a further twist of the screw now, by giving protection to the Shias, could push the regime over the edge. The fall of Saddam Hussein in the next three months, whoever or whatever replaced him, would be a political bonus for Mr Bush. But if Mr Saddam is to survive, the administration is determined he should at least be quiescent.</p>

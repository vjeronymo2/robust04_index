			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: DIAGNOSING WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE  </P> <P> Have IBM-compatible personal computers gotten so complicated that you need  special software just to tell what equipment is in your machine and how it is  configured?  </P> <P> At least three publishers are betting that enough people will think so and buy  their new system-diagnostic programs.  </P> <P> Control Room from Ashton-Tate, Check It from TouchStone Software and System  Sleuth from Dariana Technology Group share some features, yet each is  different.  </P> <P> Of the three, Control Room ($129) is most clearly aimed at the casual computer  user. It writes an easily understood report about the computer and gives the  user control of some system settings.  </P> <P> Check It ($150) performs elaborate tests of your hardware and would be most  useful when searching out the cause of problems. It isn't hard to use, but some  of the information it imparts will be understood by only the more technically  minded users.  </P> <P> System Sleuth ($149) doesn't test things or control things. Instead, it does  the deepest system analysis, revealing which of your memory-resident software  programs are colliding with others, for instance, and giving exacting details  of how your memory is being used.  </P> <P> Control Room features a menu of function choices across the top of the screen.  You make your choice, and a screen full of information slides into position  sideways across your monitor. It is easy to use, with extensive on-screen help  available. That makes up for the slender manual accompanying it -- which gives  just a teaser of what the program does.  </P> <P> There is a "summary" screen that details facts about your computer's hardware,  the type and speed of its microprocessor and math co-processor, amount and type  of memory, hard disk size and speed, size and presence of floppy disk drives,  DOS version and serial and parallel ports.  </P> <P> A "memory" section tells you how your computer's memory is being used. It  shows, for instance, that Control Room, part of which is memory-resident, took  up 7.1 of the 124 kilobytes being used in my 640-kilobyte computer before I ran  my main application programs.  </P> <P> The "config" section shows you all of the utility programs and other  instructions that get loaded at start-up into your computer from the  "autoexec.bat" file. Without having to edit that complex file, you can tell  Control Room which programs to turn off next time you start the machine.  </P> <P> Another section lets you set the speed at which keys will repeat, the number of  keystrokes that can be typed ahead of the keyboard's ability to process them  (keyboard buffer size) and other factors. You can also create up to 60 macros  in which a series of keystrokes -- commands and text -- are assigned to a key  combination for playback at any time. The idea is to help speed up repeated  tasks that you perform at your keyboard.  </P> <P> Under "tasks," you can restore erased files or erase files to government  standards so that no trace of the old data remains. You can encrypt files to  keep them secret and scan diskettes for signs of viruses.  </P> <P> If you want to actually test your hardware instead of just identifying it,  Check It is the program to choose. It analyzes your computer and, at your  command, selectively tests virtually every component from memory chips to hard  and floppy disks to the keyboard, serial and parallel ports and the monitor.  Hard disk and memory testing is particularly rigorous.  </P> <P> One test even checks the second-by-second accuracy of the computer's clock and  calendar. Another will test your printer. Yet another tells whether your mouse  is working properly, if you have one.  </P> <P> Some major-brand computers, such as IBM and Compaq, come with their own system  diagnostic software that performs similar tests. But they don't report the  results as well. Many other computers do not include such software and the only  way to test them has generally been to have the dealer do it. Check It changes  that.  </P> <P> Another nice feature comes into play when a memory chip fails. There is a  graphic depiction showing you which chips have died. That can save either you  or your service person a lot of trial and error removing and replacing chips  trying to find the right one.  </P> <P> All computers have places in their memory called interrupts and special  channels for direct memory access. Check It tells you which are being used, and  that simplifies the installation of network cards and other system expansion  cards.  </P> <P> Check It's manual is thorough and easily understood, providing an excellent  tutorial on how your hardware works.  </P> <P> System Sleuth, for which version 2.1 is now available, takes a third approach  to diagnoses. It delves deeper into the internal logic of your computer's  various components but doesn't test them to the extent that Check It does.  </P> <P> The program has several uniquely useful features. One gives you a pictorial  representation of how your computer believes its internal system switches are  set. On older PC- and XT-style computers, such switches physically control the  way the computer works and what equipment it can use. They are notoriously  difficult to set properly, especially after you lose the book that shows how.  </P> <P> Newer computers don't have as many switches, relying on special "setup"  software to do the job. Either way, System Sleuth shows you what is going on.  </P> <P> While System Sleuth does not test the hard disk, it provides information  different from the other two programs. All hard disks are assigned a "type"  number, which you may need to know if you ever need to completely clean  everything off the disk and prepare it all over again for use with new  partitions and formatting. But unless you open up the computer, you seldom can  find that information -- and even then it may not be there. The sleuth reports  the drive type number and also tells you exactly how your hard disk is  partitioned -- as one big drive or several smaller "logical" drives.  </P> <P> If your computer has a habit of locking up in the middle of running programs,  it may mean that memory-resident programs are colliding with each other. System  Sleuth will give you a map of exactly what system resources are being used by  each such program loaded into your computer, and you can quickly see whether  and where interferences are occurring.  </P> <P> The program also displays in great detail how system interrupts are assigned,  as well as the uses of system memory. These are details that help resolve  potential conflicts when installing network and other system expansion cards.  </P> <P> The depth of System Sleuth's analysis makes it the most technical of the three  programs and thus the least easily understood by casual users. Skilled  technicians who are actively involved in configuring and trouble-shooting a  variety of computers will find it most useful.  </P> <P> It seems that IBM-compatible computers are complicated enough to fool all three  programs on occasion, however.  </P> <P> Control Room couldn't figure out that I had a third floppy drive connected to  one computer I tested. Check It thought part of the memory was bad on a Compaq  386S because a Compaq memory management program didn't work the way it thought  the program should. And System Sleuth died while trying to print a report on an  AT clone because of interference with printer control software.  </P> <P> TRACKING PC PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Control Room  </P> <P> A $129 program that describes the inner workings of the computer and controls  some of its functions.  </P> <P> Features: Prepares a descriptive report putting your computer's performance in  perspective, gives control of keyboard features, stores macros, restores  deleted files, encrypts sensitive data and wipes all traces of old data from  your disks in accordance with government standards.  </P> <P> Requirements: IBM PC or compatible, 384 kilobytes of memory, at least two  floppy drives, and DOS 3.0 or higher.  </P> <P> Publisher: Ashton-Tate, 20101 Hamilton Ave., Torrance, Calif. 90509.

Maps location of defective memory chips  for easy replacement.  </P> <P> Requirements: Most IBM-compatible PCs -- but does not work with Tandy 1000 or  2000 series computers because of their proprietary expansion slot design.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Most Knesset factions voted last night in favor of  a resolution stating that Jerusalem will forever remain a united  city under Israeli sovereignty. The Knesset asserts that Israel  will prevent any attempt to impair the city's status and  territorial integrity. Jerusalem and its environs are not a  political or a security issue but the very soul of the Jewish  people, the Knesset resolution affirms. The resolution was  initiated by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, and Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin endorsed it.</p>

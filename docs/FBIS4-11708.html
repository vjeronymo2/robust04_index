			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of the G-15 developing nations meeting in  the Indian capital, New Delhi, have called for a restructuring  of the United Nations in a way that it will take account of  significant changes that have taken place since 1945. In a  draft joint communique, which is to be approved by the summit  today, the leaders are also suggesting that the restructuring  should rest on the principle of democratization and transparency  in decision-making at the UN and all its agencies. The General  Assembly, according to the communique, should be revitalized, a  suitable formula that would ensure appropriate interaction  between the Security Council and the General Assembly designed.    The G-15 leaders are also calling for an expansion of its  membership. According to a Voice of Nigeria correspondent in  New Delhi, the draft communique is taking note of the current  world trade agreement and is expressing the hope that  liberalization, increased market access and expansion of world  trade would materialize. The draft communique is further  calling for a monitoring mechanism to ensure that during the  implementation of the GATT agreement the interest of developing  countries is adequately protected.</p>

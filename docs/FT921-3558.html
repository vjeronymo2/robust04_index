			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: L'Air Liquideto invest in east Germany L'AIR LIQUIDE, the French industrial gases group, has announced that it is to invest more than FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) in eastern Germany over the next three years, strengthening France's position as the region's leading foreign investor, writes William Dawkins from Paris. The group has acquired a site at Bohlen, near Leipzig, from the Treuhand privatisation agency, where it plans to open a plant next year. It also intends to expand three other east German acquisitions: Chemiehandel, an industrial gas distributor; and producers Tega Berlin and Tega Leipzig. L'Air Liquide forecasts 10 per cent to 20 per cent annual growth in the German market for industrial gases, of which it has 12 per cent. It has recently signed large contracts to supply nitrogen to Flachglas, the German subsidiary of Saint Gobain, the French glass maker and to Sow, a chemicals group near Bohlen. French companies had invested FFr7.7bn in eastern German privatisations by the end of January, far less than German investors - at FFr365bn, or just over 90 per cent of the total - but ahead of the US with FFr5.2bn and Britain with FFr4.45bn.</p>

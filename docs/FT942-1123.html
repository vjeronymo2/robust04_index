			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Eurofighter faces delay in delivery Deliveries of the European fighter aircraft to all four nations in the project will be delayed by up to a year unless Germany's politicians and industrialists can resolve a dispute about development costs by next Friday. The German defence ministry said the two sides were far apart and there was no prospect of the government agreeing to demands by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the German industrial partner, that an extra DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m) be found from public funds for the project. The dispute must be resolved before the German legislature goes into recess on Friday, or it will remain outstanding until the end of the year or early 1995, when a new government sets out its defence priorities. The Social Democratic opposition in Germany doubts the need for the Eurofighter after the end of the cold war. Supporters say it will meet western Europe's air defence needs until well into the next century. The project is already running more than two years late, in part because of political controversy in Germany. The four governments involved, whose development and initial production run are expected to cost Pounds 30bn, had hoped to sign a memorandum of understanding to complete development work this summer. That will not be possible unless there is a breakthrough in Germany. By current plans, Britain and Italy expect to start taking delivery of the Eurofighter in 2000, Spain in 2001, and the German air force in 2002. However, defence industry officials said this timetable would not be feasible unless the German row was resolved in the next few days. A spokesman for British Aerospace Defence, the UK's industrial partner in the project, said of the German dispute: 'We have made a commitment to the customer governments and we would not wish to see that change. We should remember that the longer the project takes, the higher the expenses will be.' Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, refused to pass Dasa's request for extra funding on to the German parliament until the government was satisfied the sum requested was reasonable. Dasa wants the defence ministry to supply about DM1.2bn - including costs carried over from 1992 - to guarantee the project's future. The defence ministry has said it cannot guarantee to put up more than DM520m. It may find an extra DM170m, but only if Dasa can provide accounts to back its argument that more public money is needed, a ministry spokesman said. The ministry has said it will meet costs arising from the government's 1992 decision to extend the production period. However, it was not prepared to pay for delays for which, in its view, Dasa was responsible. 'The question will be largely decided by how much industry is prepared to budge,' a ministry spokesman said. 'We're staying put.'</p>

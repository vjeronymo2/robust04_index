			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weathers data TRADING yesterday was dominated by the release of the US non-farm payroll data, which rose just 13,000 in June against analysts' expectation of a rise ten times that size, writes Rachel Johnson. The news hit the dollar briefly but the currency did not take long to revive as traders continued to target the Yen and the D-Mark as the currencies to shed ahead of next week's meeting of the G7 in Tokyo. As the US figures were much worse than expected, the question of whether the Federal Reserve's next monetary move should be to ease policy rather than the reverse began to preoccupy market participants. 'All the data - including the consumer sentiment survey from Michigan University - has been low, pointing to a different complexion for Fed policy,' said Mr Mark Hilliard, at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. With bearish sentiment aimed elsewhere, the dollar reversed its initial drop  -to the confusion of those who assumed that the poor economic data would drive down the currency for longer. Analysts reasoned that this was because the G7 meeting would produce little to celebrate in terms of a GATT breakthrough or concrete measures to boost world growth and employment. Speculation that the Bank of Japan would be forced to cut rates under G7 pressure to revive the locomotive economies caused the sharpest currency movement of the day. The Yen closed at Y108.75 to the dollar, after Y107.40 the previous day. But the fact that the Bundesbank had already done its bit for world growth by cutting its rates on Thursday did nothing to improve the sentiment surrounding the D-Mark, as the German economy remains in deep recession. The D-Mark closed at DM1.6960 against the dollar, as against a previous DM1.6990 on Thursday. There was currency fall-out from the latest round of European interest rate cuts. The Swiss franc suffered from sentiment that the Swiss Bank would like to cut rates again; and the French cut coming as late as yesterday caused confusion. Many had expected the Bank of France to ease on Monday, and were again caught out by the fact that the French did not ease after the Bundesbank's move on Thursday. Franc weakness was the result yesterday, with the currency closing at FFr3.383 against the D-Mark, after a previous 3.377. According to one economist, the Franc weakness was not so much the result of the lowering of the intervention rate as a perception in the markets that another quarter-point rate cut from the Bank of France was just a matter of time.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: London International economic developments, rather than domestic fundamentals, are likely to dominate the fortunes of the gilts market this week. With meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Bundesbank council and the G7, traders will be looking to see if the dollar's recent weakness leads to any co-ordinated changes in interest rates. However, Wednesday's monthly meeting of the chancellor and the governor is not expected to lead to any rate change. Last week's trading was again volatile, with a Wednesday rally on the successful floating-rate note auction, followed by a plunge on Thursday as the markets absorbed disappointing inflation implications in the purchasing managers index. According to Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, the current situation has 'very much the feel of a market which is unable to sustain upward momentum. The best one can say is that it is in a consolidation phase.' Economic data this week could create some inflationary concerns. While the annual rate of M0 growth in June is expected to fall, it will still be well outside the government's 0 - 4 per cent monitoring range. The consensus is that the annual rate of manufacturing production growth will drop from 3 per cent in April to 1.6 per cent in May.</p>

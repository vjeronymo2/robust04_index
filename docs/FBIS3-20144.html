			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis in Ioannina] </F>   [Excerpts] The EU [European Union] foreign ministers'  unofficial meeting began with some delay. The Yugoslav crisis  and the EU's enlargement are at the center of discussions.  According to reports, on the Yugoslav issue, the ministers  examined the possibility of appointing a special commissioner  for the area of Mostar.    The 12 ministers also discussed the issue of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's  countermeasures. The Greek side stressed that the issue is  primarily political and time should be allowed so ongoing  mediation efforts produce results. In the framework of the  discussion, the ministers discussed the recent letter by [FYROM  President] Kiro Gligorov to EU Commission President Jacques  Delors. [passage omitted]    The foreign ministers of many countries also referred to the  issue of Skopje as they arrived in Ioannina, and it appears that  our partners now recognize the political aspect of the issue  even though they continue supporting the lifting of Greece's  countermeasures. [passage omitted]    The issue of the EU's enlargement caused the first change to  the meeting's agenda. It is a change that could prove important  in its own particular way.    [Begin correspondent Simos Kedhikoglou recording] Despite  procedural difficulties, the issue of the EU's enlargement will  be at the center of the 12 ministers' discussions. A working  group has already been set up to examine all the parameters of  the problem. In addition, Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros  Pangalos is having bilateral contacts with his counterparts. At  the same time, the Greek presidency will present its own  proposal with the support of the EU Commission and its  president, Delors, in an attempt to seek a mutually acceptable  solution. Indicative of the importance of the issue of the EU's  enlargement are the remarks of the foreign ministers during  their arrival at Ioannina, where they did not refrain from  straightforward attacks against the countries that oppose the  enlargement, mainly Britain. EU Commission President Delors was  more reserved than all the others as he limited himself to a  meaningful hand gesture. The general spirit is one of reserved  optimism that the problem will be solved but there is an  understanding of the difficulties. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Boustead sells Singapore subsidiary for Pounds 12.8m BOUSTEAD, the manufacturing group, is selling its 65.4 per cent holding in Bousteadco, its Singapore-based subsidiary, to Jack Chia-MPH, for Pounds 12.8m. The reasons for the disposal are threefold: to eliminate a position where a substantial proportion of assets are tied up overseas which are difficult to control from London; a chance to refocus operations geographically and financially; and to use the proceeds to pursue acquisitions in the group's core business in the UK and Europe. In 1992 Bousteadco had sales of Pounds 39.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 900,000. At December 31 the group's shareholding in the company equated to a net asset value of Pounds 6.8m.</p>

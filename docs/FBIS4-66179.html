			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xie Jinhan (6200 6930 3352) titled: "Guizhou </F> Higher People's Court Work Report" -- (January 1, 1994 at  Guizhou's Eighth National People's Congress Second Session)]    [Text] Fellow delegates: [passage omitted]    Now I will report to the People's Congress for approval and  examination the overall situation and future views on the work  of the courts throughout the province:    1) Strengthening the "harsh crackdown" struggle, and  maintaining social stability    After ten years of the "harsh crackdown" struggle, Guizhou's  public order overall is stable. However, there are many factors  influencing the stability of the public order, and major  pernicious cases are on the rise, so that in some locales the  situation with public order is not good. Throughout the  province, courts are conscientiously working to implement the  essence of directives from Party central on maintaining social  stability, and are gradually strengthening their effect against  the enemy dictatorship, and punishing various types of criminals  in strict accordance with the law. Over the year as a whole,  some 14,109 criminal cases in total were accepted and heard, and  13,903 were tried and settled, while 15,470 criminals were  provided with legal services in the course of court decisions.  Among these, there were 5964 people who received sentences of  more than 5 years in prison, life imprisonment, or the death  sentence (including stays of execution), or some 38.55 percent  of the total criminals sentenced; 9166 people received sentences  of less than 5 years, detained labor, or were placed under  surveillance, while 248 people avoided criminal sanction, and 92  people were declared innocent.    In the course of launching the "harsh crackdown" struggle,  we  are stressing the proper handling of the following links:    1) Make the key crackdown points standout, vigorously  promote  the trying of major cases. Target the crackdown against  murderers, robbers, rapists, bombers, hooligans and other  serious criminal elements, particularly against the ringleaders  of other criminal organizations with a sinister social effect,  and against recidivists, and habitual offenders. For this type  of case, we must adopt intervention in advance, and after a case  is prosecuted, pay close attention to hearing and settling the  case, and strictly meting out punishment in accordance with the  law. For example, when former Shuigan Public Security Department  people's policeman Jiang Qianjun [5592 7816 6511] used a gun to  murder someone, this had a great social effect, the danger was  great, and the case was followed with great interest by the  masses. After the court accepted the case, only nine days were  required from the first hearing to the final state of the second  hearing, and the approval of the death sentence for him. At the  same time as the day-to-day type crackdown work is strengthened,  in order to frighten criminal elements, we must build up our  prestige, and in an organized and prepared manner launch a four  time province wide concentrated attack operation, and  concentrated pronouncing of judgements against a group of  criminal elements seriously harming the public order. It was  only during a pre-National Day unified effort, with the  provincial court and nine mid-level courts, 48 county and  municipal courts convening a comparatively large-scale meeting  for pronouncing judgement, that 119 people guilty of the most  heinous crimes were sentenced to death, and for the criminal  elements the law did not allow to remain, the swollen arrogance  of the criminal elements was attacked.    2) Continue to launch special struggles and stress bringing  things under control. In accordance with central and provincial  deployment of personnel, various local courts, under the unified  leadership of party committees, and closely integrated with  public security and procutorial organs, are launching, in line  with local conditions, special struggles such as "attacking  kidnappers," banning drugs, opposing robberies, and attacking  "train bandits," while stressing bringing things under control.  Various local courts are strengthening their efforts to bring to  trial these types of cases, and accomplishing rapid trying and  rapid resolution of cases, concentrated attacks, and on-the-spot  pronouncements. The entire province in total has sentenced 1944  criminals who abducted and kidnapped women and children, 163  drug dealers, 5475 thieves, and 1910 robbers. Through such  things as explaining the law, printing and distributing notices,  disseminating material, etc., they have galvanized the masses to  arise and resolutely struggle with criminal elements, and to  strengthen vigilance.    3) Increasing the force level of major attacks, ensuring the  quality of handling of cases. Throughout the province, courts  are unswervingly implementing the guiding policy swiftly and  seriously and in accordance with the law. For serious criminal  elements committing crimes guilty of the death penalty,  sentencing of the death penalty is resolutely carried out. For  crimes requiring stiff sentencing, criminals are being  resolutely sentenced to stiff penalties, paying attention to  overcoming and preventing the phenomenon of attacks with  insufficient force. For the year as a whole, among cases tried  and completed in one hearing, the proportion of those sentenced  to more than 5 years specified imprisonment up to the death  penalty rose 7.6 percent compared to 1992. At the same time, the  courts are conscientiously carrying out a policy of combining  suppression with leniency, and persisting in equal doses of  leniency and strictness. In order to properly utilize corporal  punishment and the relevant resolutions of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress, county courts have  strengthened their inspection and examination guidance, and are  conscientiously resolving issues of measurement of penalty in  convicting someone of a crime. No matter whether it is  concentrated attacks or special combat efforts, or normal trying  of cases, courts should persist in properly handling the facts  of a case, and master the legal criteria, and surely,  accurately, and relentlessly attack criminal elements.    4) Conscientiously carry out comprehensive measures for  managing participation in maintaining public order.  [comprehensive programs of public order] When severely punishing  criminals, courts at various levels should in a comprehensive  way give full play to their judicial functions, and  conscientiously carry out various linkup participatory measures  in terms of vigilance, education, management, construction, and  transformation. Over the year as a whole, in all there were 414  judicial meetings, some 401 cases where judicial suggestions  were put forward to relevant departments, and 7538 cases of  commuted sentences and releases on parole. In addition, in terms  of aspects related to publicizing legal institutions,  strengthening the people's legal work, guiding mediation of  disputes, education, setting an example, rescuing errant youths,  etc. they have worked very hard, and had a quite good social  effect. At the same time, by persisting in the goal of  responsible management, and establishing and perfecting a varied  system with peoples' courts carrying out comprehensive measures  for managing participation in maintaining public order, taking  the various operations and requirements of comprehensive  measures for participation in maintaining public order and  channelling them into the unit target responsibility system, and  strengthening management, during county and locally organized  inspections on reaching the goals of comprehensive management,  all examined courts achieved their targets, and many courts also  were appraised as Comprehensive Program of Public Order Red Flag  Units.    2. Severely attack serious economic crime, resolutely mete  out punishment for corruption, safeguard the economic order    Peoples' courts at all levels throughout the province, in  accordance with the Party Central's personnel deployment, are  actively launching an anti-corruption campaign, stressing major  cases as the breach, augmenting the force of attacks on economic  crime. Over the year there were a total of 1755 economic crime  cases accepted and heard in one hearing, with 1718 being  completed, and 1980 people were sentenced. Of these, those  sentenced to over five years, those receiving life sentences,  and those receiving the death penalty (including stays of  execution) totalled 752 people, or 37.98 percent of the total  number of criminals sentenced, an increase of 6.64 percent over  the previous year. Among the sentenced economic criminals, those  convicted of individual crimes involving more than 10,000 RMB  totalled 271, of which 22 people associated with crimes  involving more than 100,000 RMB. Through these judicial  proceedings, economic losses of 718,860,000 RMB were collected  and returned to the state.    In the struggle to attack economic crime, throughout the  province courts at all levels are paying attention to seizing  the key points, and vigorously bring to trial major cases. The  attack points are aimed at those cases where state workers,  particularly leading cadres, use their positions to engage in  graft, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and other  serious infringements on the interests of the state and people,  and undermine Party and government prestige. It is also aimed at  cases of major swindling, profiteering, manufacturing and  selling counterfeit goods, evading taxes and refusing to pay  taxes, etc., that seriously damage the market economic order.  During the year, there was a total of 515 tried cases of graft,  bribery, and misappropriation of public funds, and 636 criminals  were sentenced. Various local courts are paying attention to  properly mastering the work of trying major cases, and are  progressively perfecting the registering and reporting system  for major cases, and the timely grasping of the relevant  circumstances. Taking the initiative to strengthen relations  with inspection organizations, for those major economic crime  cases resulting in significant harm, having a major effect and  to which the society is paying great attention, courts are  resolutely promoting intervention, and painstakingly organizing  proper bringing of cases to trial, working closely together to  coordinate the launching of the anti-corruption campaign. Last  year at the end of October, the province's 29 counties and  cities one after another convened large-scale sentence  pronouncement meetings, to concentrate pronouncing of sentences,  and handled 80 cases of economic crime, leading to the  sentencing of 111 criminals. Among these, there were 20 major  cases that the county courts directly handled, with 30 criminals  sentenced. For this set of serious economic criminal elements,  relying on the law to mete out strict punishment, there were 12  people who received the death penalty, death sentence with a  two-year reprieve and forced labor, or life imprisonment, 11  people received sentences of more than 10 years, and seven  people received sentences of less than 10 years. The county  courts also specially convened press conferences, and reported  on the launching of the anti-corruption campaign, and on the  strict punishment of serious economic criminals. And through  using the news media, and providing widely disseminated  reporting, the momentum and social effectiveness of the attacks  on economic crimes will be extended.    Strict reliance on the law for handling matters,  conscientiously ensuring the quality of cases. The circumstances  of economic crime are complex, and have different  characteristics than normal crime: the facts of the crimes, such  as the monetary totals involved in graft and bribery are  difficult to thoroughly investigate; the stages involved in the  commitment of crimes are diverse, and proof is hard to obtain;  the basis of convictions are very closely related with policy  regulations, and in the process of the transformation of the  economic system, for behavior in the economic sphere it is  necessary to make clear distinctions between the criminal and  the noncriminal, and the difficulties here are not small. Thus,  throughout the province courts at all levels are firmly basing  cases on the facts, taking the law as the principle criterion  and being guided by the principle of "the first necessity is to  stand firm, the second necessity is to be cautious, and be sure  to be prepared," and strictly and properly involved the facts in  seeking proof, repeatedly do research to determine the nature of  an offense, and correctly mete out penalties, and be sure to  approach the judgement of cases by obtaining the experience of  history. The county courts, using issues that they encounter in  trying cases of economic crime, and on the basis of  investigative research and through case precedence discussions  and critical analysis, are drafting a series of concrete  stipulations suited to policies and laws, and are strengthening  their professional guidance for lower level courts; lower level  courts, for some cases that they have no preparation for, are  taking the initiative to request instructions and report on the  cases, preventing erroneous decisions.    In the wake of the deepening of the anti-corruption  campaign,  a series of major economic crime cases have been ferreted out  and investigated, and the number of economic crime cases  prosecuted in court will increase. Courts at all levels have  intellectually and in terms of judicial strength already  properly handled the making of the required preparations, and  for those major cases such as graft, bribery, etc., no matter  how many people are involved, all will be fully investigated,  and stern sanctions will be applied in accordance with the law,  and by no means will evil be tolerated as this is tantamount to  abetting it, and under no circumstances will we break our  promises to the people.    3. Comprehensive launching of economic, civil, and  administrative judicial work, giving full play to regulatory  functions, to develop market economic services    Throughout the province, under intellectual guidance  designed  to establish a socialist market economic system to provide legal  guarantees and legal services, courts are actively making great  efforts during the course of economic, civil, and administrative  judicial work to increase the strength of services, expand the  realm of services, and give full play to their regulatory  functions.    1) Economic judicial work has been developed to a  substantial  degree. Last year in economic judicial work there emerged a good  trend involving large numbers of accepted cases, large numbers  of completed cases, and large numbers of resolved disputes.  Throughout the province, courts hear a total of 10,679 cases  involving economic disputes, an 18.07 percent increase over last  year; in total, 9976 cases were resolved, an increase of 19.83  percent from the previous year. Among these, mediated cases  totalled 5980, a mediation rate of 59.94 percent, or a 4.5  percent increase over last year; Some 84.84 percent of the cases  were resolved within three months, a 1.23 increase over the past  year. In all there was a total of 337,911,900 RMB involved in  the resolved disputes, up 70.02 percent from last year. In  addition, there were 3784 cases applicable to paying for the  resolution of economic disputes, with a total value of 45,652,  400 RMB.    2) Civil judicial cases have progressively developed. Last  year, the overall number of civil cases totalled 56,276, with  53,452 cases settled, increases from last year respectively of  6.89 percent and 7.61 percent. The number of cases accepted  exceeded historical high levels, and there emerged a number of  new circumstances, new issues, and major changes occurred for  civil cases, in terms of the principal part, content and type of  litigation. Looking at the province as a whole, matrimonial and  family disputes, though they still occupied the leading position  in cases accepted (constituting 32,791 cases, or 58.27 percent),  cases frequently touch on issues dealing with contracts involved  one party (husband or wife) against the other or two party  (husband and wife) contracts, rent, and management rights  issues; personal and property damage compensation disputes have  already leapt into second place (constituting 1810 cases, or  10.32 percent), and investigation and obtaining of proof and  determination of compensation amounts have encountered major  difficulties; in various types of business, rent, and mortgage  disputes, due to the developing of the market economy, prices  change, and issues of cost, rental money, and mortgage amounts  become very difficult to try. In addition, there has been an  increase in the number of new types of cases such as celebrity  rights, book rights, real estate development, and labor  disputes, and cases touching on foreign countries, Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan. From this description it is evident that at  the same time as the number of civil dispute cases accepted by  peoples' courts involving the aspect of personal rights and  interests, the proportion of cases involving some aspect of  property rights and interests has increased substantially. This  change has meant that the relations between civil judicial work  and economic construction and the market economy are growing  more and more closely linked, and civil judicial work is  directly effecting the wider and wider expansion of the scope of  economic construction and market economic services.    3) Administrative judicial work is steadily expanding. Last  year, there were a total of 1602 administrative cases tried,  with 1532 cases settled. Among the settled cases, 370 judgements  maintained the original administrative conduct, while in 533  cases the ruling granted removal, with these two outcomes  totalling 64.95 percent of the cases; in 397 cases there were  judgements of recision, and changes to the original  administrative conduct, amounting to some 25.91 percent of  settled cases.    People's courts at all levels, in the course launching  economic, civil, and administrative judicial work, are using  judicial measures to adjust economic relations, and are  emphasizing the mastering of the following points:    First, steadfastly focus on the Party and state major  policies and plans, give prominence to key points of work.  Throughout the province courts are conscientiously implementing  various central policies touching on the deepening of reform and  the broadening of opening, the establishment of a market  economic system, the strengthening of macro-level regulation and  the maintenance of social stability, and conscientiously  focusing on the core in judicial work, and defining the key  points of work. Courts at all levels are conscientiously  implementing the party committee transmitted provincial court  leading party group "Views on Fully Utilizing Judicial Functions  To Strengthen State Macro-level Regulation, Opposing Corruption  and Maintaining Social Stability," taking as the main goal of  work having the socialist market economy provide legal  guarantees and services, and taking the key points for  consideration in working to be the difficult points and points  attracting attention that arise in reform and opening and the  development of the economy, strengthening economic, civil, and  administrative case judicial work closely related to macro-level  adjustment and the market economy, and ensuring the smooth  implementation of the center's major policy decisions. In the  course of work coordinated rectification of the financial order,  throughout the province courts in accordance with the law and in  a timely manner settled 4918 cases involving borrowing and  lending, recovering for banks and credit unions mature and  overdue loans totalling 843,913,000 RMB, and at the same time,  on issues touching on financial management they provided  judicial suggestions to relevant departments, and promoted the  standardization of call borrowing and credit activity.    Second, establish law enforcement concepts and judicial  principles that are suitable to a market economy. In order to  adapt to the developing and changing new circumstances, courts  at all levels are being guided by liberated thinking, and  replacing concepts, while strengthening investigative research.  When it comes to some current legally sluggish objective  circumstances, research issues of handling how to master  policies and suit the law, and establish law enforcement  concepts that are suitable to a market economy, upholding the  concepts of a national legal system and a unified market,  conscientiously resisting and overcoming local protectionism;  the concept of the equality of the positions of (legal) parties,  and the legitimate rights and interests of equally protected  Chinese and foreign litigants; it is necessary to affirm the  effectiveness of respecting the concept of the litigant's  autonomy of opinion, under the premise of inviolable legal  stipulations, and no harming of the legitimate rights and  interests of the state, society and other people, while  displaying consistency when it comes to real opinions held among  the litigants; protecting the concept of equitable competition,  realizing the superiorities and inferiorities of the main body  of the market, ensuring the orderly movement of the market  economy. At the same time, in the course of work upholding the  four principles, and correctly handling the relational  principles between the partial and the whole, establishing whole  concepts, and relying on the law in handling disputes; the  principle of using reform to promote development, through trying  of cases, implementing the promotion of reform measures;  carrying out policies and implementing unified legal principles,  and where the legal and policy stipulations are not clear, using  the principle of the "three favorables," seek truth from facts  in handling matters; the principle of comprehensively  administering, through launching such activities as judicial  suggestions, etc., and promoting the standardization of various  types of activities and social stablility.    Third, base ourselves on judicial procedures, increase  strength of services, expand the scope of services. Throughout  the province courts are continuing to overcome the phenomenon of  "handling cases in isolation," and at the same time as they base  themselves on judicial procedures, and handle more cases, and  handle cases properly, they are linking various working  characteristics of judicial work, increasing the strength of  services, and expanding the scope of services. In addition to  work such as continuing to launching the establishment of  judicial liaison stations, legal service offices and local  judicial liaison officers at large-scale enterprises, rural and  township enterprises and related departments, helping train  legal talent, systematizing contractual relations, integrating  judicial cases and issues that are found in the course of  investigative research, and timely putting forward of judicial  suggestions, they have also launched special services, such as  taking the initiative for financial departments to settle loans  on a legal basis, and actively assist enterprises in setting  debts on a legal basis, supporting tax organs in legally  collecting taxes, etc., and in the course carrying out these  various specialized services in assisting enterprises in setting  debts in accordance with the law, they were able to recover for  enterprises debt liabilities totalling 620,083,000 RMB, and to  resolve the large number of contradictions and disputes that  arise in the course of economic activity, maintaining the normal  economic order, and having an ameliorative social effect.    Fourth, strengthening execution work. Courts at all levels  are taking marshal cases as the major content of building  economic services, and are strengthening the work involved in  executing cases. Over the year as a whole there were 18,245  executed cases of various types, an 11.62 percent increase over  the past year in the total monetary amount of the executed case  target. Among these, executed civil cases amounted to 10,031,  and executed economic dispute cases totalled 3,519. Last year,  some new circumstances emerged for executing work: first, there  was a reduction in the number of cases executed. This because  since 1992, throughout the province courts have launched several  campaigns to concentrate on unification of execution, and have  put in order a large set of long-pending cases, while a great  many courts have basically cast off the millstone of "executing  difficulties," and executing work is heading towards  normalization and standardization. At the same time, courts at  all levels, are actively working diligently at linking aspects  of trying and executing cases, and investigation and executing,  and there has been a substantial increase in litigants  voluntarily carrying out their own obligations. Second, the  difficulties of executing cases are increasing. The principle  reason is that after the state strengthened macro-level  regulation measures, enterprise operating funds have normally  been tight, and some enterprises are in a production slump,  their benefits are not good, with the result that the phenomenon  of enterprises' chain of debt has again appeared, and this has  increased the difficulty of executing cases. Third,  administrative organs applications for case execution are  increasing, making up 21.65 percent of cases. In order to  support administrative organs in administering in accordance  with the law, ensuring the orderly carrying out of state  adminstrative management, a large number of courts are adopting  organizational and work-related measures, to ensure the  execution of these cases. The total execution mark target was  350,020,000 RMB, with the return and removal of illegal  construction amounting to 51,600 km2. [passage omitted]</p>

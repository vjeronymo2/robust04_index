			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Artistic lifeline for Names WITHIN THE next few weeks Lloyd's Names will receive a letter outlining the size of their personal liability to the losses of their battered syndicates. The word is that more people will be affected than last year, with a shortfall in excess of Pounds 2.5bn to be gathered in by the early autumn. In the last week many Names will have received another letter, this time from Sotheby's, the London auction house, offering condolences and offers of assistance. Sotheby's first became involved with Lloyd's six years ago in a very different financial climate. Then Names were flush with their gains and the art market was booming. Some cheques from Lloyd's went towards acquiring furniture, pictures, silver and the rest of life's luxuries. Sotheby's suggested that works of art might be used as collateral by anyone interested in accumulating the wealth needed to become a Name, or by Names keen to build up their investment. Sotheby's would do a valuation and offer a guarantee of up to 35 to 40 per cent of the estimated auction price of an object. But only just over 40 people took up the offer and the scheme languished. Of course Sotheby's was mainly interested in getting Names to buy and sell through its auction rooms. Around 1,200 Names are Sotheby's clients and they are the first to be approached under this new marketing exercise. The original scheme has been re-launched with refinements. Names who still want to invest in Lloyd's can use their works of art as collateral, up to 35 per cent of their value, to build up their investment, but this time Sotheby's will offer to store the works in its warehouse, which cuts insurance and other costs. Sotheby's also suggests that immediate liabilities can be met by selling works of art. Sotheby's will send a valuer, at no cost to the client, to price a Name's antiques. If the money must be raised by October Sotheby's can make an advance (at a price) on the works of art which it will auction when it thinks the market is strongest. The pressing problem in the art world at the moment is a lack of decent antiques to sell. Names are already being forced to supply such goods: in the good forthcoming furniture sales at Sotheby's this month some of the best lots come from Names.</p>

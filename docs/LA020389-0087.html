			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLARK, PACIFIC SYMPHONY MUSTER FAKE BEETHOVEN, REAL BRAHMS  </P> <P> Every once in a while, some not-so-good Samaritan comes along and puts a head  on the "Winged Victory" or provides the missing limbs for the Venus de Milo or  completes Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony.  </P> <P> Gimmickry invariably looms with each such effort. So does inevitable failure.  Nevertheless, the fleeting PR value carries its own irresistible reward.  </P> <P> This season's most modish mock-revelation has been billed as Beethoven's 10th  Symphony. Actually, it is nothing of the kind -- just a little orchestral essay  in the late-Beethoven manner "realized," rather clumsily and dutifully, from  assorted quasi-authentic sketches by a Scottish musicologist named Barry  Cooper.  </P> <P> The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic ventured the much-ballyhooed and  little-appreciated premiere last October. This was followed by disappointing  but well-publicized performances in London and New York, not to mention a  breathlessly hyped recording.  </P> <P> The unreasonable facsimile offered by the Pacific Symphony under Keith Clark  Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was heralded as the  West Coast premiere. Actually, that dubious honor had already fallen to San  Jose, which heard the ersatz symphony back in November.  </P> <P> Premiere or no premiere, the so-called 10th is a cautious and inconsequential  exercise in musical guesswork. It meanders prettily and naively for a while in  lyrical circles, then pops off for the obligatory contrast of some dramatic  naivete before returning meekly to andante basics.  </P> <P> Some of the piece sounds like Beethoven salvaged from the cutting-room floor.  Much of it sounds like the throat-clearing of a dull Beethoven imitator who is  forced to vamp until ready. At 16 minutes, this is a short piece but a long  vamp.  </P> <P> Clark and his charges gave it a ragged introductory reading. Significantly,  perhaps, the audience couldn't muster enough enthusiasm to recall the music  director for a single bow.  </P> <P> Matters improved in the major challenge of the evening, Brahms' First Piano  Concerto. The odd acoustical ambiance of Segerstrom Hall reduced much of the  rhetoric to mush. The orchestral impulses threatened to get flabby whenever  agitation beckoned. Internal intonation was often questionable. Still, the  spirit was willing and, most important, Horacio Gutierrez illuminated the solo  utterances with urgency, fluidity and rhapsodic grandeur.  </P> <P> The centerpiece on the program took the unaccustomed form of Joseph  Schwantner's "New Morning for the World," a setting of speeches by Martin  Luther King, Jr. First performed in Rochester six years ago -- with none other  than Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates as narrator -- it allows the  orchestra to vacillate between movie-music slush and instant bombast while the  soloist recites some poignant historical texts.  </P> <P> The intentions are obviously lofty. Unfortunately, Schwantner did little but  crank out prosaic busy-music to surround the uplifting prose.  </P> <P> On this occasion, William Warfield spoke the uplifting prose with clarity and  emotional point. The affect was intensified by understatement but compromised  by microphone echoes.  </P> <P> Clark exhorted the orchestra to make a mighty accompanying noise. The noise,  not incidentally, sounded blurry and distorted beyond the norm.  </P> <P> Once again, the specter of amplification clouded aesthetic and musical issues  in Orange County.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Greece to curb spending Greece's Socialist government yesterday presented a budget that attempts to curtail government spending in order to restrain a fast-growing public sector deficit. Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, economy minister, said preparing next year's budget had been 'a nightmare' because of a revenue shortfall that raised the government's borrowing requirement this year to 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product, against a target of 7.9 per cent. Although the budget projects a primary surplus, the borrowing requirement will drop only to 12.9 per cent of GDP as a result of high repayments due next year on domestic debt. Overall spending is forecast to rise by 9.3 per cent.</p>

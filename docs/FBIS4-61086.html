			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation </F> of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, by Anatoliy Baranov;  place and date not given: "Are Trade Unions a School for  Optimism"]    [Text] [Baranov] May Day is a time when Russian trade  unions are -- ex officio -- at the center of attention.  Therefore the first question I would like to raise with you,  Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade  Unions of Russia [FITUR], concerns the nature of May Day.    [Shmakov] We do not want to "surrender" this holiday to  anyone. It is our trade union holiday. Earlier it was called  the Day of International Solidarity of Working People, today it  is dubbed "the day of spring and labor," which is not altogether  correct. You may use the word "international" or you may  diplomatically refrain from doing so -- inner solidarity and  appreciation of the common problems which beset people today,  particularly people in Russia, are what is important. These  problems are the payment of wages on time, the retention of  jobs, and, in general terms, the stabilization of the economy --  simply so that your own plant can provide a livelihood -- jobs  and a pay packet which enables people to live a decent life.    Each region will mark the holiday in its own way, we do not  have a "mandatory program," each region itself determines how to  celebrate. In St. Petersburg, for example, a ceremonial session  of trade union activists will be held. Moscow and many other  cities are planning to hold rallies and processions. In the  capital an application has been lodged and accepted: There will  be demonstrations and rallies. People will asssemble at  Triumfalnaya Square at 0830, the procession will start moving  off along Tverskaya Street at 0915, and there will be a  30-minute rally outside the History Museum on Manezh Square at  1000.    A campaign to collect signatures in support of urgent trade  union demands has been organized in Moscow in the runup to May  Day. The main demands are the payment of wage arrears, job  guarantees, the pursuit of a proper employment policy, and  measures to prevent unemployment. Therefore these demands will  either be submitted to Duma representatives directly from the  platform or the rally will send a delegation to the president,  the Federation Council, and the government.    [Baranov] Will this be the "working people's spring  offensive"?    [Shmakov] "Spring offensive" is a good term, one taken from  Western practice. Over there it is the time for concluding  collective contracts. We do not set ourselves the goal of  conducting seasonal work in defense of working people's rights.  Different condition prevail here.    Our efforts this spring have been aimed at concluding a  general agreement. The negotiations were tough, but an  agreement was nevertheless signed 8 April. The main point now  is to ensure that it is implemented. But if it is not, we will  have to set a date for the offensive.    And, although the General Agreement-1994 was signed only  recently, we have set ourselves the task of signing a similar  Contract-1995 at the end of this year. That will be the  offensive: Our fiscal year runs from 1 January through 31  December, and, ideally, the General Agreement, sector  agreements, and collective contracts would be ready by its start.    [Baranov] A tradition has developed of late whereby the  country's budget is passed with a year's delay. Is the trade  unions' activity tied in with the activity of the budgetary  commissions of the upper chamber of parliament and the State  Duma?    [Shmakov] It should be. But there is no such practice  today. The principle, however, should be as follows: The  General Agreement constitutes a precondition of drawing up the  state budget. Once you have an agreement, the government and  employers assume material undertakings, and this must inevitably  be reflected in the budget. Otherwise you have the absurd  situation of an agreement with no resources to implement it.    [Baranov] What prevented such consultations being carried  out on time this year?    [Shmakov] Discussion of the budget has only just gotten  under way, and we were unable to delay signing the agreement.  And it is also time to accustom the government to the actual  idea of signing general agreements.    [Baranov] Does FITUR have political preferences?    [Shmakov] Trade unions cannot withdraw from politics  altogether -- politics permeates all our activity, but FITUR  cannot have political goals today. The trade unions rally  people on other grounds, first and foremost social and labor  grounds. But we are not indifferent to the policy a particular  government pursues, it is not all the same to us who wins the  elections. But today we have no strong leaning toward a party.  There is no party at present which is completely in tune with  the trade unions' tasks. But we do support those parties and  movements whose programs contain ideas similar to our own. And  we have not taken off the agenda the idea of either setting up a  party, like the Labor Party, geared toward trade unions or  enjoying closer cooperation with an existing party which is  ready to align itself with the trade unions.    [Baranov] Do the trade unions regard the Labor Party's plan  as a "nonstarter?"    [Shmakov] I would not put it that way. It is on the back  rather than the front burner.    [Baranov] Will the trade unions continue to transform or is  the restructuring process over, and can results be expected?    [Shmakov] Experience suggests that transformation is  necessary. The time of holding congresses is now under way in  trade unions, and the prevailing feeling is that every trade  union within FITUR should be more centrally organized.  Overdemocratization of trade union life has not been beneficial.  If we are to wage a proper struggle, rather than just go through  the motions, centralization and control are needed.    [Baranov] There are now strict access and exit arrangements  in the FITUR building. Is this the start of a strict internal  policy?    [Shmakov] This is an imperative of life. We should at least  control the situation in our own house. Commercial structures  have moved into the building, they have their own "headaches,"  ordinary thefts occur, which did not before. This has nothing  to do with the workers' movement.    [Baranov] But how in general can the workers' movement  develop in conditions of crisis? Strikes do not intimidate  employers....    [Shmakov] Strikes suit employers down to the ground. If  people do not report for work, that is another reason for not  paying out wages. Therefore the modern workers' movement and  trade unions first and foremost can only be sufficiently  effective when organized. I will not exaggerate. There will be  no very great accomplishments at the present stage, but certain  successes can be seen perfectly well. Our task today is to  direct the movement toward tackling economic problems. If the  wage of a worker in the forestry, textile, or machine building  industry is not paid, the root of the evil is the same, but  there are a host of ways of tackling it. But we advocate  resolving conflicts through negotiation. And implementation of  accords already signed is the number one problem. We have  learned how to draw up competent documents and learned how to  reach agreement around the negotiating table. But we still have  not learned how to implement what has been signed. That is  indeed a very big common problem....</p>

Aleksey Kondaurov told CRIME-PRESS on Thursday that all  officers of the former Security Ministry will have to pass  qualification tests before getting a new employment, however he  denied that this would be a "personnel purge".    "If anyone is to be dismissed, this would be done only at  his  own request or in connection with retirement", he added.    The new provisions for the counterintelligence service,  which  were approved by the Russian president and to who it will  directly report, entrust it with the struggle against all types  of espionage - economic, political, military and scientific.    Besides, the service will fight terrorism and drug  trafficking, according to Kondaurov who added that the service  will no longer engage in activities alien to counterintelligence  tasks.    The former Security Ministry anti-organised crime department  was transferred to the Interior Ministry, while the  investigation department became a part of the office of the  Russian prosecutor general. The former KGB investigation prison  in Lefortovo was also transferred to the Interior Ministry.    The service will consist of four major departments -  counterintelligence, military counterintelligence, economic  counterintelligence, terrorism and drug fighting, according to  Kondaurov.</p>

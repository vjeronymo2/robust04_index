			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Zimbabwe plans to seize whites' land Zimbabwe's government tabled a bill in parliament yesterday which would seize more than half the land owned by white farmers and distribute it to black peasant settlers, Reuter reports from Harare. The 4,500 white farmers fiercely oppose the bill, which would forbid them to challenge cases of unfair compensation in court. They stand to lose 5.5m hectares (13.6m acres) of their 10m hectares of prime agricultural land if the proposed legislation is passed without changes.</p>

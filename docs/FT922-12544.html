			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Trans-Europa success - Cinema EUROPA (15) Everyman, Chelsea Cinema VOYAGER (15) Curzon West End FINAL ANALYSIS (15) Plaza, MGMs West End SALMONBERRIES (12) Metro STOP] OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT (PG) Empire Orson Welles, summoned to Hollywood to make Citizen Kane, called cinema and its paraphernalia the 'greatest train set a boy ever had.' Cue the greatest love affair the cinema ever had. Before and after Welles's dictum, the 'rolling stock' of film through a camera or projector found a poetic rhyme in the rolling stock of trains trundling through exotic landscapes. There is a rhyme too in the very experience of filmgoing. Out there through the train window (the movie screen) unfolds the changing world. In here in the well-upholstered carriage (the auditorium), we the audience sit serene, attentive and invulnerable. Lars Von Trier's Europa, a train movie that would have thrilled Welles, is a mad, mad, mad, mad box of tricks. Into Germany at the end of World War 2 comes a gauche bespectacled young American (Jean-Marc Barr) hoping do his bit for the Marshall Plan. With his railway superintendent uncle's encouragement he will become a train guard and help to re-knit the damaged arteries of a defeated land. But he reckons without the 'Werewolves': Nazi-sympathising terrorists who plant bombs and recruit pretty women like Barr's new girlfriend Barbara Sukowa. And he reckons without the sinister liaisons between guilty ex-Nazis like Sukowa's railway tycoon father and carpetbagging American officers like General Eddie Constantine. This veteran Franco-Yank actor, who looks more weirdly majestic with each movie, now resembles a bullfrog seen through a magnifying glass. The third thing the hero and we reckon without is the blizzard of visual and dramatic effects director Von Trier hurls at us. The movie is in black-and-white and colour, often at the same time. The camera passes through walls, descends through solid floors or moves from a house into a train with no visible 'cuts'. Multiple back-projection creates a 3D-like 'layering' of scenes. And the film abounds in gloriously clever ellipses like the shot in which Barr and Sukowa, romancing on a midnight bridge, turn to the sky and water behind them, which then 'dissolve' into the giant face of the priest officiating at their marriage. Is it all just fun and flamboyance? The Dane Von Trier, who won a Jury Prize last year at Cannes and whose first film The Element Of Crime was a delicious Borgesian bagatelle, has enough fresh stylistic ideas to keep European cinema going until the next ice age. But Europa is also a cunningly crafted parable about Europe Now disguised as Europe Then. The broken boundaries and human flux in 1945 are much the same as those in 1992; only the historical crisis has changed. As Babel-like tongues battle to be heard on the building site of a new continent, Europa's gaggle of French, German and American actors for once vindicates Euro-pudding casting. Cultural confusion is the point in this film. And the gathering of the plot-threads into a trainbound climax, as clocks and bombs tick towards Judgment Day, makes not just for a satisfying thriller but also for an emblematic image of historical countdown. Trundling on rails of genius through stations of moviegoing bliss, Europa is in all senses - all good senses - the sleeper of the year. * * * The Euro-pudding problems solved by Europa are more obdurate in Voyager. German director Volker Schlondorff, adapting Max Frisch's novel Homo Faber, appoints an American hero (Sam Shepard) and looses him across the globe with a mid-life crisis, a French girlfriend (Julie Delpy) and memories of a German-Jewish old flame (Barbara Sukowa) now living in Greece. Before the pudding is fully set alight, a flags-of-all-nations supporting cast is stuck into it. As a result, the deliriously itinerant story - which includes an ocean voyage, a trans-Europe car journey and a plane crash - finds a storm of subtitles or foreign accents in every port. But then what would you expect from a director whose agent must have a sideline as a travel agent? Since winning native German acclaim for The Tin Drum, Schlondorff's films have been made in Beirut (Circle Of Deceit), Paris (Swann In Love) and New York (Death Of A Salesman). Somehow Voyager still has an intermittent wit and power. Perhaps it is the ironic awareness of rootlessness in the title and the sly jokes about a planet colonised by the transport industry. (The air stewardesses still announce 'Tonight's meal is. . .' when their passengers are squatting in the desert around a shattered fuselage.) Or perhaps it is Mr Shepard, harmonising diverse locales with the laconic, iconic grandeur he brought to The Right Stuff. Indeed if you can take the warring-tongues dramatis personae and the dotty ending - snake bites and dynastic revelations worthy of Aeschylus - Voyager is oddly likable. In Columbus year it reminds us that when man discovered the world was round, he also discovered that human problems are shared and circular in whatever place and with whatever accent they are found. Final Analysis, starring Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, is a mystery thriller. The thriller part is about a psychoanalyst who falls for a beautiful murdereress. The mystery is why it ambles on for two hours without once raising the hairs on our spines. We are in a moody, glossy San Francisco designed by Dean Tavoularis of The Godfather and photographed by Jorden Cronenweth of Blade Runner. Every plot device you can think of is lobbed at us by director Phil Joanou (State Of Grace) and writer Wesley Strick (Cape Fear): courtroom scenes, two sexy sisters sobbing on the shrink's shoulders (Basinger's sibling is Uma Thurman) and a climax atop a sinister lighthouse stylishly mocked up by Mr Tavoularis near the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet almost none of the film works. Partly because Basinger's femme fatale is about as interesting as a stocking advertisement come to life. Mainly because there are so many tic-like nods to other movies - Saboteur, Vertigo, Jagged Edge - that the film resembles an overanxious chicken browsing around the filmic farmyard shortly before being taken off to get the chop. Speaking of which, was it not Charles I who walked and talked two hours after he was beheaded? This is not a historical fact, I know, but a schoolboy solecism. But I recalled it during Percy Adlon's Salmonberries: a strange Sapphic romance between a chattery dyed-blonde German emigrant (Rosel Zech) and a taciturn androgynous Eskimo (kd lang). It takes place in Alaska, with a short trip to Zech's Berlin, where she re-traces her husband's death in a wartime shooting. The tableau-vivant style of Adlon's Sugarbabies and Bagdad Cafe is here married to a travelogue lyricism. The Alaskan snowscapes are gorgeous: wall-to-wall Melvillean whiteness tinged with sunset pinks and scored for distant wolf howls. And Miss lang, a Canadian singer-songwriter in love with lower-case lettering, is an iconic contrast to Zech's peroxide excitability. But eventually we ask, Where is it all going? And the answer returns, Nowhere. It walks and talks. It even enjoys the scenery. Yet two hours later it is as inert and silenced as the late King Charles. Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot, a 'comedy' directed by Roger Spottiswoode of Turner And Hooch, is a piece of germ warfare from Hollywood designed to empty or quarantine British cinemas over Easter. Sylvester Stallone is the LA cop who needs a new partner, Estelle (Golden Girls) Getty as his Mom accidentally becomes that new partner. Ho ho. Lots of chases, pratfalls and senior citizen gags. I laughed once, when I remembered a good joke from another, similar and better film.</p>

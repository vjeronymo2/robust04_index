			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Belikov and Viktor Litovkin report: "My Motherland </F> Is Vast, But Not for the Su-34"]    [Text] IZVESTIYA has secured the exclusive right to be the  first to talk in the Russian press about the new Su-34  front-line bomber. Some people have already nicknamed this  mysterious and top-secret aircraft the "Russian miracle."    "No, it is not a `miracle,'" Mikhail Simonov, general  designer for the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau and project  leader, told us, "but the Su-34 series-produced front-line  bomber, created in our firm. Its chief designer in the design  bureau is Rollan Martirosov, and in the plant -- Oleg Sobolev."    The Su-34 is designed to repulse an attack on Russian  territory and is to replace in the combat ranks the Su-24 and  Su-24M front-line bombers which have been flying for almost 20  years and to resolve certain other tasks. The fourth-generation  bomber has all the potential for doing this.    It has a practically unlimited flight range. Without  refueling in the air -- it is, nonetheless, equipped with such a  system -- the Su-34 can fly for 4,000 km without wing tanks! It  can easily be transferred in a matter of hours from one part of  the country to another where a threatening situation might  suddenly arise on the border.    Usually, Simonov said, it takes a combat aircraft a whole  week to fly from the Far East to Tajikistan, for example.  Sometimes an intermediate airfield will close owing to bad  weather, then fuel will not be delivered in time, then people  will forget to feed the airmen or will not give them an  opportunity to rest properly. The new bomber is not affected  either by weather conditions or by the time of day or night.    Despite any meteorological conditions, its fundamentally new  onboard digital computer and other radioelectronic equipment,  which, incidentally, is duplicated many times over, will  unerringly bring the aircraft to the prescribed region with an  accuracy to within one meter. The self-guiding and correcting  missile and bomb weapons -- the stocks suffice to fulfill any  tasks -- will hit even a well defended point target. At a range  from zero to 250 km.    But the main "charm" of the new bomber is its cockpit. It is  as spacious as the flightdeck of a Tu-134 passenger airliner,  and equipped with air conditioning. The pilot and the navigator  sit not one behind the other, in tandem, as is usual in any  two-seater, but side by side. They can get up from their seats,  stretch their legs, lie down in the aisle between the seats, do  physical exercises, and then pour borscht from a vacuum flask or  heat it and sit down to dine. There is even a toilet.    Everything has been done on the Su-34, Simonov said, to  ensure that even after a flight of 1,000 km the airmen are not  tired and are able to work above the battlefield as though they  had entered the bomber's cockpit a few minutes previously.    The new machine is equipped with an active flight safety  system or, as it is sometimes called, an artificial intelligence  system. It enables the plane to execute aerobatic figures at the  maximum ground speed (equal to 1,400 km per hour) and at the  lowest altitudes, to unerringly follow the contours of the  terrain, to hug [ogibat] the ground, and also to easily overcome  ground forces' air defense weapons. The bomber is as hard to  detect as a cruise missile, Simonov said.    The aircraft is "held" at a certain altitude from the  ground not only by the digital computer and the active safety  system -- a forward horizontal fin assembly is fixed to its  fuselage (it can be seen clearly on the diagram beneath the  large tapered wings -- author). This parries and suppresses the  bumpy air which arises with any high-speed aircraft at the  lowest altitudes and creates additional potential for the pilot  and navigator to carry out efficient precision bombing, to  maneuver under enemy fire, to suppress enemy fire weapons, and  to guard themselves against an enemy missile or a rock face  suddenly rising up in their path.    Moreover, an armored cockpit has been used on the Su-34 for  the first time in the world, with the possible exception of the  Su-25 ground-attack aircraft. Its 17mm thickness reliably  protects the airmen even against chance hits by bullets, shells,  or shrapnel.    Mikhail Petrovich Simonov spared no words in describing the  new creation of his design bureau. Whereas the Su-24 was  created, he said, in response to the U.S. F-111 strike bomber,  willy-nilly resembled it in some of its external features, and  conveyed a kind of pro-Western image, the Su-34 is unlike  anything else. It has its own appearance, its own build, its  own boldness, and its own purely Russian unpredictability. It  is our own Russian aircraft, which threatens no one but has been  created for itself and for our own satisfaction.    It really would be possible to speak about the new aircraft  at greater length. True, we cannot present everything here to  the general public. The majority of the bomber's performance  characteristics are classified, and our description of it is  being published only after it has been photographed above the  deck of the aircraft carrier Admiral Flota Nikolay Kuznetsov and  photographs of it have appeared in the foreign press with the  puzzling caption: "What is this? Is Russia deceiving us with  regard to its weakness?"    Incidentally, a recent issue of the British JANE'S DEFENCE  WEEKLY carried an article devoted to the Sukhoy Experimental  Design Bureau firm and its aircraft. It was published a few  days before information on tests of the Su-34.    "If the Su-35 (a heavy fighter which flew splendidly at last  summer's Dubayy Air Show -- author) appears at the Farnborough  Air Show, as Sukhoy is promising," the magazine writes, "the  greatest concern will be aroused, so commentators believe, by  the aspect that it will have taken the West unawares. Their  very best human and technical intelligence resources bear no  comparison with Russian craftiness. This at a time when  everyone reckoned that the former Soviet Union had been brought  to its knees. If this is so, Russia may have still more  surprises up its sleeve."</p>

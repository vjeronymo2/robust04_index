Speaking on the event, Mr. Michael Heseltine, president of  ECGD Board of Trade [title as received], said: "I am delighted  that ECGD is one of the first export credit agencies to restore  medium and long term cover for Vietnam. ECGD has enormous  potential and Vietnam is poised for major trade expansion and  economic growth in which ECGD can play an important role".    The British ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. Peter Williams, said:  "I am happy that this very necessary facility has been  reintroduced. By insuring British exports, I see it as an  excellent instrument to further increase the trade links between  Vietnam and the United Kingdom and thereby to further cement our  ever-increasing relationship in all fields".</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 Apparently clearing the way for a reelection bid in 1995,  President Lech Walesa has stepped up his criticism of the  governing coalition's largest party, the formerly communist  Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD), in an effort to boost his  sagging popularity.  Walesa has also put the government under  extreme pressure by blocking some of its important legislation  and appointments, while at the same time threatening to dissolve  parliament and call early elections.                             END SUMMARY      Walesa's reelection strategy appears to center on his past  credentials as an ardent anticommunist.  In recent  pronouncements, he has indicated that his decision to run will be  based on the country's need for a strong defender against the  threat of resurgent communism.  During a 30 March meeting with  journalists from the Catholic daily Slowo--Dziennik Katolicki,  Walesa said that he was becoming "increasingly more convinced"  that "once again" he would have to "fight for" the presidency in  the 1995 elections.  Referring to SLD members in the government,  he declared that "once again the Politburo wants to have all the  power" and suggested that legislators should present him with  "proposals on file-checking and decommunization" to investigate  possible collaborators with the former communist regime  (Rzeczpospolita, 31 March).  Walesa also suggested that other  possible presidential candidates, such as Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak, are not fit to handle the chaos that "times like these  will bring," saying that Pawlak has "no experience with people in  the streets, stone throwing, and strikes" and that "some people  can already smell gunpowder while some still cannot" (Warsaw  Radio, 30 March).      Walesa's Actions      In a flurry of activity before the Easter holidays, Walesa has  also blocked government-sponsored legislation and appointments,  challenging the government's legitimacy and accusing it of  communist-era tactics in response to SLD protests of his moves.      --On 25 March, Walesa rejected the governing coalition's  candidate for finance minister, Dariusz Rosati.  After the SLD  announced that the government would not withdraw Rosati's  candidacy, Walesa accused it of "still behaving as if" the  nomination "were a decision made by the Politburo"  (Rzeczpospolita, 31 March).      --On 30 March, Walesa threatened to "omit the Sejm" in passing  the Concordat with the Vatican if the SLD musters enough  parliamentary votes to block its passage (Rzeczpospolita, 31  March)      --On 31 March, Walesa vetoed the government's law replacing the  tax on large wage increases in state-run firms with a tax that  includes punitive measures against private firms that grant  similar wage increases (PAP, 31 March).      --The same day, dismissing government questioning of his  authority to dismiss Marek Markiewicz as head of the Polish  Television and Radio Council, Walesa named Ryszard Bender, a  member of the anticommunist Christian National Union, as  Markiewicz's replacement (PAP, 31 March).      --In a 31 March interview with PAP, Walesa threatened to dissolve  the Sejm if the governing coalition attempts to limit his powers,  saying that he would "tell the people" that "now we can see a  monopoly of the communist type being established.  Aren't you  afraid that communism is coming back?"      Popularity      Walesa's campaign against former communists comes at a time when  he is suffering from low popularity ratings.  According to the  Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS), 60 percent of respondents  in a mid-March poll agreed that the "president's actions weakened  the state" while only 17 percent disagreed (PAP, 28 March).  Suggesting that it would be an uphill struggle for Walesa to make  a bid for reelection, he finished fourth in a CBOS presidential  preference poll with only nine percent, behind SLD leader  Aleksander Kwasniewski's 17 percent and the eleven percent of  Pawlak and former Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski  (Rzeczpospolita, 29 March).      Implications      Portraying himself as an opposition figure battling against a  "communist" government, Walesa appears to be making an effort to  regain his base of support among staunchly anticommunist voters  from the ranks of the former Solidarity movement.  Despite the  SLD's victory in the fall parliamentary elections, its status as  a governing party during a time of continuing economic woes--and  Walesa's calculation that he has little to lose by alienating SLD  voters--has apparently made the party an easy target for the  president.  This strategy has been undermined, however, by  Walesa's frequent conflicts with virtually all the former  Solidarity parties and the Solidarity trade union, and his lack  of a strong political base outside of a group that he helped to  form, the small Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms, which  garnered only five percent of the vote in the fall elections.

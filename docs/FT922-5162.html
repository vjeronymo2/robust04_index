			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank raises stake Hongkong and Shanghai Bank yesterday purchased 5m shares in Midland Bank at 415p, raising its stake by 0.66 percentage point to 15.23 per cent. Hongkong Bank declined to identify the seller but said that the shares had been offered to it by an associated company. The bank said it was not the prelude to substantial buying of Midland shares. The Department of Trade and Industry has allowed Midland and Lloyds to trade in eachother's shares during ordinary business. Such activity would otherwise be illegal because of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's investigation into Lloyds' possible bid for Midland.</p>

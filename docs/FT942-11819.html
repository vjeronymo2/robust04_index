			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / People: No Roche at Morgan Stanley One of London's more charismatic market strategists, David Roche, 47, is leaving Morgan Stanley International, where has has established a reputation for forthright and accurate analysis and research covering areas as diverse as the ERM and the internal problems of the former Soviet Union. With Morgan Stanley since 1987, Roche is now setting up his own research bureau. Called Independent Strategy and based in Bond Street in the heart of London's West End, the new company will produce briefings and generate investment ideas for fund managers, in exchange for consulting fees. Roche says the break away from Morgan Stanley is happening on the very best of terms. As evidence of that, his erstwhile employer is to be one of Independent Strategy's first and biggest clients. Moreover, the move should suit both Roche and Morgan Stanley: 'It's absurd to think in this day and age that all research should be conducted in-house. I am moving from being Morgan Stanley's in-house general practitioner to being its external specialist,' he says. Roche argues that his strategy as an independent will be somewhat different, in that it will allow him and his colleagues to give a much tighter focus to their research and analysis. At Morgan Stanley Roche played a key role in re-organising the bank's method of research and analysis, forming industry teams from the previous geographically-based style. Among his more famous predictions was that the Berlin Wall would fall, but he has also made a name for himself by being particularly outspoken on east Europe and the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. Before joining Morgan Stanley Roche worked for J P Morgan as a portfolio manager looking at international asset allocation. His only worry in the new role is physical - he will be cycling much less than his current impressive daily round trip from west London to Canary Wharf.</p>

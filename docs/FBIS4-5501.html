			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Japan should in principle  try to maintain self-sufficiency in rice, despite its decision  to end the decades-old ban on rice imports, the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in an annual report  Tuesday [12 April].    To that end, the fiscal 1993 white paper on agriculture says  "a new control system" should be developed to ensure stability  in domestic rice production and balanced supply and demand.  The report does not mention any specifics of how such a new  system should operate, although a ministry official said it is  the first time for the ministry to use the phrase "new control  system" in reference to rice in its official reports.    "This reflects the view that it's no good to just stick to  the status quo," said Teruo Miyake, research division chief of  the minister's secretariat. Miyake made the comment when  reporters asked for comments on the existing rigid foodstuff  control system.    Under the Food Control Law, the government regulates  production and distribution of rice and bans commercial trade in  rice. The law was also the legal backbone of Japan's ban on  rice imports. Many consumer groups and farmers have criticized  the law and its underlying system as outdated, since it was  passed in 1951 when Japanese rice was in short supply. Under  the law, the government used to buy much of the rice crop for  resale to consumers at lower prices, but now buys less than a  fifth and oversees the independent distribution of an additional  40 percent. The remaining 40 percent is counted as being  consumed by the farmers and their extended families, but some is  distributed on the black market outside of government channels.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced last December the  partial lifting of the rice import ban as a concession to the  successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade  talks. But the food control law itself has been untouchable to  date. Japan has also pledged to eliminate the remaining  restrictions on imports of 12 agricultural products, including  dairy products and corn starch, and to reduce tariffs on  agricultural products. The report underlines the need for  measures to minimize the impact on domestic farmers of the  market-opening steps while promoting larger-scale farms to  compete with imports. It also proposes the use of new  technology and innovation to raise productivity under growing  international competition.    Regarding the import of beef, which was liberalized in 1991  under agreements with the United States and Australia, the  report points to significant increases in both imports and  consumption over the past few years. Per capita beef  consumption for fiscal 1992 climbed 52 percent from fiscal 1985,  but increased imports reduced self-sufficiency in beef from 72  percent to 49 percent, the report says. It also notes that the  sharp increase in beef imports has had a detrimental effect on  domestic beef production, resulting in declining prices for  wholesale beef and calves. The report urges promotion of  large-scale beef production, selective breeding, and  streamlining of production and distribution to slash production  costs.    The report also touched on other topics:    -- The cool, wet summer last year caused record damage of  1.3  trillion yen to agricultural production, resulting in the worst  rice harvest in the postwar period and a record 956 billion yen  in damage to rice crops alone.    -- Food consumption by nonfarming households inched up 0.1  percent in real terms in fiscal 1992.    -- Agricultural production rose 4.1 percent in fiscal 1992  after a poor harvest in 1991, but remained below average as the  agricultural production index stood at 99.4 against the base  rate of 100 for fiscal 1990.    -- The agricultural work force fell 6.1 percent in fiscal  1992, the largest drop in 12 years.    -- The 1992 food self-sufficiency rate was unchanged at 46  percent on a caloric basis. The rate for grain was also  unchanged at 29 percent.    -- Rice in Japan is about eight times more expensive than  U.S. rice at the average exchange rate for 1993. Japanese rice  was priced about four times higher than U.S. rice in the early  1980s.</p>

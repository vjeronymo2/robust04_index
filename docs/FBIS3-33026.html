Tello underscored that Mexico wants an end to the U.S.  Border  Patrol's xenophobia against illegal Mexicans and it wants  respect for the human rights of immigrants, regardless of  whether they are legal or illegal.    The U.S. Government on 3 February released a new immigration  program to control the crossing of illegal Mexicans through the  border between the cities of Tijuana, in northwestern Mexico,  and its neighbor, San Diego, in the United States. The measures  include the incorporation of 1,010 Border Patrol officers,  construction of double walls along the dividing line, the  installation of sophisticated equipment to detect illegals, and  the deportation of illegal criminals.    "The Mexican Government remains concerned about the  hardening  of the measures against immigrants in the border area, because  the problem will only be resolved in the long term and with  specific rather than police measures," the foreign secretary  said.    On 8 February, Tello met with U.S. Attorney General Janet  Reno, who informed him of the measures her government has  decided to take. Tello indicated that the Mexican Government is  analyzing the measures announced by its neighbor and those  already implemented along the 3,000-km border because they cause  "permanent irritation in bilateral relations."    The request for the modification or suspension of the  measures will be presented during a bilateral Mexican-U.S.  meeting to be held in Neuvo Laredo, Mexico, on 7 March.    According to researchers of the Northern Border College  [Colegio de la Frontera Norte], at least 150,000 illegal  Mexicans annually cross the border into the United States in  search of better job opportunities. The researchers said the  city of Tijuana, Baja California, is the area through which 80  percent of the Mexican illegals cross, although they are  generally arrested and deported to Mexico in their initial  attempts.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Hopes of interest rate cuts fuel European revival INTEREST rate fever swept through the European bond markets last week with the birth of a brave new world of floating exchange rates. The decision by European Community finance ministers, taken early on August 2, to move from a fairly rigid European exchange rate mechanism based on narrow fluctuation bands to one where the fluctuation bands of 15 per cent are so wide as to be irrelevant, triggered a strong rally in European bonds. This was prompted on the view that European governments would be free to kick-start their recession-hit economies by swiftly cutting domestic interest rates. In fact, few cut rates once the shackles were removed, and those who did were far from bold. The Bundesbank surprised the markets with a 15 basis point cut in the fixed rate for 14-day repos, to 6.80 per cent, and an easing in the 28-day repo rate, to 6.70 per cent - which put the latter below the discount rate of 6.75 per cent. Spain cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point, to 10.5 per cent, while Sweden snipped 25 basis points off its marginal lending rate, to 8.25 per cent. However, there is ample scope for European interest rates to fall further, and the bond markets have soared in response. Even the Ecu bond market - which is so sensitive to shifts in sentiment regarding the future of Europe - saw a sudden renewal of interest last week. However, while its short-term prospects make it attractive to some investors, there is still a large question mark over its longer-term attractions. The Ecu bond market took off last week mainly because investors realised the bonds were too cheap, while providing a relatively simple means of benefiting from the potential for interest rate cuts across Europe. 'It's a cost-effective way of gaining exposure to European markets - people buy it as a way of saving dealing costs,' says Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank. The actual yield on Ecu bonds was higher than the theoretical yield curve (calculated according to the bond yields of the Ecu's component currencies), which meant the bonds were cheap relative to the theoretical value. However, last week's rally in the Ecu bond market pushed actual yields below theoretical yields. For example, the actual yield on the 8 per cent, 10-year French Ecu bond was 6.99 per cent on Friday, or 7 basis points below its theoretical yield, while three-month UK Ecu treasury bills had an actual yield of 7.9 per cent, compared with a theoretical yield of 7.95 per cent. 'The actual yield could be as much as 20 to 30 basis points lower than the theoretical yield, and the bonds would still represent good value because of the transaction cost-saving,' says Mr Burke. Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas Capital Markets, points out that for investors based outside Europe, the move from semi-fixed to floating exchange rates means there is more uncertainty over which currency will do what. As a result, the basket nature of the Ecu becomes more important, given that the Ecu can be used as a substitute means of investing in Europe, he says. Yet for all the short-term euphoria springing from the move to wider fluctuation bands in the ERM, there is still considerable concern over the future of the Ecu. 'The whole prospect of European monetary union is, if not dead, at least on its death-bed, so it is highly unlikely that the Ecu bond market will enjoy the same attractions as it did before the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty,' says Mr Burke. If there are grave doubts over whether the Ecu will become the single currency for Europe, investors and issuers may well wonder why they should bother with a market which does not have much of a future and which could suffer from illiquidity - even if Mr John Major does try to relaunch the plan for a hard Ecu. Ecu bond issuance has certainly dried up since the Danes dealt a blow to hopes of European economic and monetary union last summer. Ecu bond specialists, meanwhile, admit it is hard to see why issuers should tap this market at the moment. In the past, some issues have been swap-driven, but dealers say there are few favourable swap opportunities in Ecu. So if there is to be a fresh drive to revive the Ecu bond market, it may well have to be politically motivated. In the past, France was one of the keenest advocates of Ecu bond issuance, and had undertaken to conduct about 15 per cent of its funding in Ecu. However, given that French government bond yields are lower than Ecu bond yields, there is no financial incentive for the French to issue Ecu-denominated debt, although those with a keen interest in the Ecu market no doubt will be watching closely to see just how committed the Ecu's supporters prove to be.</p>

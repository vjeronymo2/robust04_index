			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Management: Discretion is the better part of valeur / A look into the mystery of French bosses' pay, and finds they are doing nicely Ask a senior French executive how much he or she is paid and you are likely to be shown the door. The French have a catholic distaste for talking about private money, reflected in company disclosure laws which oblige employers to tell no one but the taxman how much their top people are paid. So some guesswork is needed to work out who gets what. Recent estimates by Towers Perrin, the pay and personnel consultancy, suggest that directors of companies with over FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) turnover pull in the second highest gross salaries in the world - between FFr2m and FFr2.5m. This is well behind their criticised US counterparts. Yet in net terms, France's top people get a less impressive pay packet - around FFr764,000 annually - behind the Germans, British and Japanese, after the high tax and social security charges for which France is renowned. Quoted companies are not, as in Anglo Saxon countries, obliged to publish the boss's salary, though they do have to declare in the annual report the sum of the top directors' pay. So it is that the Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the water distribution to construction giant, rumoured to be a generous rewarder of top people, reveals in its 1990 annual report that it paid FFr28.8m to its top 20 directors, an average of FFr1.44m each. The average is misleading, since the chairman, Guy Dejouany, is rumoured to earn above the odds. However, the chairman's salary is unlikely to be the whole story. He will typically receive top-ups from a number of foreign subsidiaries, usually small amounts set just under the income tax-paying threshold in each of those countries. This is an entirely legal tax avoidance technique, explain consultants. On top of this, French directors tend to hold more non-executive board seats on other companies than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, believes Heidrich and Struggles, the leading headhunter. They pick up a fee every time, sometimes amounting to an impressive total. Some senior corporate figures sit on more than half a dozen company boards, an essential part of the networks of influence and patronage that bind together the higher echelons of French finance and industry. Not surprisingly, the biggest groups are reputed to pay the best directors' fees, or jetons de presence. Compagnie Generale des Eaux paid FFr1.45m to 12 non-executive directors, in 1990, an average of FFr120,000 each. Then come benefits in kind. Here French companies use share options much less than their British counterparts, and are less generous with company cars, but tend to be more willing when it comes to other perks. These include chauffeurs (pure status symbols, given that being driven to work in traffic-jammed Paris usually takes much longer than going by metro). Another popular perk is a company-owned flat rented out to the senior executive at a cheap rate. This is a valuable perk in France because rental allowances are taxed like normal income. However, the tax authorities are prepared to countenance a reasonably cheap rent on a company owned property, so allowing the executive to pocket the difference between the subsidised and commercially realistic rent free of tax. Anecdotes abound on French companies' generosity in expenses for receptions, seminars in the Bahamas and management meetings in Tuscan villas - although it is hard to get companies to admit to such open-handedness. In keeping with directors' coyness over the size of their salaries, secrecy also surrounds the way in which pay is set. In the private sector, a small committee of two or three of the most influential administrators decide the chairman's salary in private. The figure is communicated to the boss alone, and remains a mystery to other board members, including - crucially - the staff representatives which every French company above a certain size must include on its board. In state-owned industry, which includes seven of France's 10 top companies, the system is different. Here it will be up to the government minister responsible - usually industry or finance - to settle the chairman's salary. On the whole, public sector company chairmen are paid less than their opposite numbers in the private sector because the benchmark ministers use is the pay of civil servants. This tradition is coming under strain, however, as state owned companies increasingly employ executives from the private sector or acquire privately owned companies. Francis Lorentz, chairman of the state-owned computer group Bull, is said to earn rather less than some of his ex-private sector staff. Consultants believe the French top salary system is under pressure to become more open, as French industry becomes more international. Companies with share quotations on Anglo-Saxon markets, for instance, may have to give as much information as their overseas counterparts. Examples include Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group, its rival, Total, and Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging group, which have New York quotations. However, all three say their chairmen's salaries are still confidential. Old traditions take a while to die.</p>

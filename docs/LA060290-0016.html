			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART  </P> <P> I was not a fervent supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts. Not until  reading the column by Bruce Fein and Edwin Meese III ("High Clerics of Art Have  Had Enough," Commentary, May 21).  </P> <P> Their writing deserves an award for lack of both logic and taste.  </P> <P> They complain that the NEA would have yielded a higher return, had it invested  in "defaulted junk bonds." That very comparison illustrates the reason for the  NEA, which exists because art seldom is self-supporting. The writers complain  that there have been no Van Goghs discovered. Poor Van Gogh; a pauperized  genius whose paintings are now worth millions. "Living" proof of the value of  the foundation.  </P> <P> Meese should be an expert in government subsidies. Remember his involvement in  the Wedtech scandal? That company received favored treatment (i.e., subsidies),  for which a few people received prison sentences. Meese is now being  "subsidized" by the Heritage Foundation. But as a "noble fellow"?  </P> <P> WILFRED COUZIN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

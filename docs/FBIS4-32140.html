			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Veselin Angelov from Kozloduy] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] After speedily completed repairs, the  No. 1 Reactor Unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant was put  back into service. But, as our correspondent Veselin Angelov  reports, the nuclear plant is operating at reduced capacity at  the moment.    [Angelov] The reduced operating capacity was made necessary  by the fall in electricity consumption throughout the country.  In fact, only three of the six generating units are in  operation at Kozloduy at the moment: These are Units No. 1 and  No. 2, each producing 420 megawatts, and the 1,000-megawatt No.  6 Unit. The remaining reactors are shut down for planned  maintenance or for reloading with fresh nuclear fuel. The  period of their shutdown is being utilized to introduce some new  technical features, connected with improving safety of  operation. This is a continuous process, prompted by the  constant improvements in international standards and the  requirements of the World Association of Nuclear Operators.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Smooth Landing"] </F>   [Text] At first glance, the Sino-British Land Commission's  approval of the release of 117 hectares [ha] of land at the  start of the financial year seems generous. It looks as though  China has been co-operating fully in the Government's stated aim  of releasing more land to take the heat out of the property  market. That is particularly true of the release of 25.38 ha  set aside for private sector residential development, 38 percent  more than a year ago. The whole package is more than double the  minimum 50 ha for which the commission's approval is required.    However, while the figures are high for the first meeting of  the year, there is no guarantee the trend will continue to stay  ahead of past years. In previous exercises, more land has been  released as the season has progressed, bringing the figure up to  considerably more than yesterday's total. Over the whole of  last year, the commission released 127 ha. It may be that  yesterday's agreement was a political signal, designed to take  some of the steam out of property prices, rather than a genuine  indication of the prospects for the year ahead.    There are no grounds, therefore, for more than cautious  optimism that the Hong Kong Government has a clear idea of how  much land needs to be released to reduce prices without  precipitating a crash. Nor are there for confidence that the  Chinese Government's assessment of the market will be the same.    It is unclear whether the Government understands what it is  doing. How can people have faith in the competence of an  administration which opens a new phase of its sandwich-class  housing scheme just as it is trying to slow prices down and then  finds the banks are unwilling to lend into a falling market?  Nevertheless, the fact that the two sides are working together  on a sensibly measured increase in the amount of land released  at the beginning of the year bodes well for continued  Sino-British co-operation on economic matters and for the Hong  Kong Government's ability to get its programme right despite its  inexperience in the market.    It has set itself the delicate task of taking some of the  air  out of the property bubble without bursting it. The success of  the enterprise depends less on the current balance between  supply and demand than on the market's perception of future land  supply. The decisions of the Land Commission suggest the  Government may yet confound the sceptics and alter perceptions  without engineering a crash.</p>

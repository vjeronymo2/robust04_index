			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Angus Maude: former minister: Obituary LORD MAUDE, formerly Angus Maude, died last night at the age of 81. He was a prominent Conservative politician who began his working life as a financial journalist. Lord Maude was educated at Rugby and Oriel College, Oxford then worked in the 1930s as a financial writer for The Times and the Daily Mail. He served as a soldier in the second world war and was a prisoner of war for more than three years. He won South Ealing for the Tories in 1950 and became director of the Conservative Political Centre in 1951. In 1956 he rebelled against his party's policy on Suez. In 1958, disenchanted with the party's leadership, he resigned to edit the Sydney Morning Herald. In 1963 he won the by-election for Lord Profumo's Stratford-upon-Avon seat. He held that seat until 1983. He clashed in the 1960s with Sir Edward Heath, then leader of the opposition, and resigned as frontbench spokesman on colonial affairs. Baroness Thatcher appointed him paymaster-general, responsible for government information, after her first general-election victory, but he resigned in 1981. He leaves a widow and three children including former Tory junior minister Mr Francis Maude.</p>

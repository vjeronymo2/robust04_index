			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Swedbank package to raise SKr3.9bn SWEDBANK, the newly-merged Swedish savings bank group, yesterday unveiled a SKr3.9bn (Dollars 493m) package of measures to help it weather the crisis in Sweden's financial sector without calling on government support. The bank is strengthening its capital base by issuing SKr1.9bn of perpetual subordinated debt to international investors, mainly in Japan and the US. Pricing is not being disclosed. It plans to raise a further SKr2bn by selling a 60 per cent stake in two wholly-owned subsidiaries to a group of 90 affiliated savings banks. The bank says the moves would have increased its capital adequacy ratio at June 30 by about 1.7 percentage points to 10.5 per cent, well above the 8 per cent international minimum. This will go a long way to enabling it to survive without state support, although, like other Swedish banks, it remains under pressure from heavy credit losses. The bank hopes it will be able to withdraw its request for state aid later in the year, when it expects to announce new measures to strengthen its capital. It applied for support at the start of the year but is now hoping to bail itself out of trouble following similar moves by two other banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Foreningsbanken. First-half results from Swedbank confirmed evidence of a recovery in the Swedish financial sector, which has been battered by two years of heavy losses caused mainly by collapsing real estate values. The bank's operating deficit fell to SKr1.59bn from SKr5.88bn after costs fell by 15 per cent and credit losses shrank to SKr5.80bn from SKr9.25bn.</p>

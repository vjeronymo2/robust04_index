The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit to the purchase price ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under &sect;905.1014, and interest earned on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Permissible uses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families, at the discretion of the IHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the IHA and any other entity with responsibility for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under Sec. 905.1011, a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any contingent liabilities of the IHA under the homeownership plan (such as IHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve for IHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In connection with a Tribal, State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In connection with the IHA's other low-income housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating subsidy otherwise payable to the IHA for its other low-income housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) In connection with any other type of Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.1016  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Replacement requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the IHA must obtain a funding commitment, from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Development by the IHA of additional low-income housing under this part (by new construction or acquisition).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Rehabilitation of vacant low-income housing owned by the IHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the IHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this subpart, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing, comparable to IHA-owned low-income housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution to rent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

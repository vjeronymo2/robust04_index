			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Trade deficit with non-EU countries widens The UK's visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 767m in May, as imports rose 2.5 per cent and exports fell 2.5 per cent on the month. The Central Statistical Office revised down April's deficit to Pounds 493m, from Pounds 566m. If oil and erratic items, such as ships and precious stones, are excluded May's deficit was Pounds 669m, compared with Pounds 614m in April. In the three months to May the visible trade deficit was Pounds 1.95bn, compared with Pounds 2.09bn in the previous three months. In volume terms the UK is seeing a modest improvement. In the three months to May import volumes were 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months. Export volumes fell 1 per cent. The CSO said that on a trend basis export volumes were unchanged while imports were falling by  1/2 per cent a month. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The dip in import volumes is a further sign that suggests that the UK economy is not accelerating into an unsustainable boom and contrasts with the late 1980s import surge.' Yet Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe, said the figures showed 'a disappointing export performance. The benefit of the competitive devaluation in September 1992 seems to be fading away'. Import prices rose faster than export prices in the three months to May, with the main increase coming in basic materials, which might reflect the recent rise in world commodity markets. Prices of both exports and imports have risen 20 per cent since August 1992. After the recent rise in North Sea production the oil account was once more in surplus. In the first five months of the year the UK had a Pounds 36m oil surplus, compared with a Pounds 1.38bn deficit in the calendar year 1993. The CSO said that in the three months to May there was a sharp rise in imports from other OECD countries, mainly Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exports to North America and the rest of the world rose. Trade with Malaysia showed little sign of the ban on state contracts for British companies: exports to Malaysia were Pounds 161m in May, Pounds 110m in April and Pounds 78m in January.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EU NATIONS        Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Poundsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Ex oil and erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992         46,682    56,431    -9,749    40,624    48,097    -7,473 1993         57,329    66,789    -9,460    49,914    57,480    -7,566 1993 Q1      13,569    16,716    -3,147    11,697    13,963    -2,266      Q2      14,158    16,309    -2,151    12,048    14,025    -1,977      Q3      14,441    16,881    -2,440    12,636    14,486    -1,850      Q4      15,161    16,883    -1,722    13,533    15,006    -1,473 1994 Q1      15,303    17,429    -2,126    13,244    15,232    -1,988 January       5,065     5,848      -783     4,479     5,087      -608 February      5,173     5,830      -657     4,366     5,056      -690 March         5,065     5,751      -686     4,399     5,089      -690 April         5,206     5,699      -493     4,473     5,087      -614 May           5,080     5,847      -767     4,464     5,133      -669  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.

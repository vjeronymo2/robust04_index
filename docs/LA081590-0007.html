			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PASSION FOR MUSIC BRINGS DOWN ANOTHER WALL;  </P> <P> CULTURAL EXCHANGE: THE AMERICAN SOVIET YOUTH ORCHESTRA SURMOUNTS MORE THAN THE  USUAL ODDS TO GIVE A HARMONIOUS PERFORMANCE.  </P> <P> Tonight and Sunday night one of the most unusual and best orchestras to be  heard anywhere will fill the Hollywood Bowl with sound. It is an orchestra of  soloists, an all-star team. Unlike most all-star sports teams, however, this  one is international in its composition. Moreover, the nations from which it  draws -- the United States and the Soviet Union -- literally do not speak the  same language and, until recently, viewed each other as bitter rivals on the  world stage.  </P> <P> How can such an orchestra succeed? Mainly because its musicians passionately  want it to. These 100 young Americans and Russians, ranging in ages from 17 to  23, know they were selected as the very best instrumentalists from their  nations' combined population of more than half a billion. Organized by Oberlin  College in Ohio and the Moscow Conservatory, the American Soviet Youth  Orchestra exists to prove that Russians and Americans can cooperate in one of  the most complex human organizations of all: a symphony orchestra.  </P> <P> So far they've succeeded brilliantly. Last month they brought down the house in  Moscow, opened the closed Baltic city of Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg)  after 45 years of isolation, and brought crowds to their feet in Weimar, Milan,  Hamburg and Amsterdam. With tonight's concert they start an American tour that  culminates in performances at Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the west  lawn of the U.S. Capitol. A special act of Congress was necessary to enable the  orchestra to appear at that restricted locale.  </P> <P> After five years of perestroika, is it really still so important to prove that  Russians and Americans can cooperate productively? Definitely. American  businesses have signed well over 1,000 joint-venture agreements with the  Soviets, yet fewer than 100 of these have moved from paper to reality. The  experience of the American-Soviet orchestra suggests why most are stymied.  Simple telephone, fax and mail communications between here and Moscow often  pose daunting challenges. Organizational and management styles in the two  countries differ tremendously. While financing on the Soviet side is still  totally from the state, the American costs are borne privately by  public-spirited corporations, foundations and individuals. This, too, renders  the task of meshing the two systems more difficult. And of course, Russian and  English are different languages.  </P> <P> A symphony orchestra, however, presents special complexities of its own.  American French horn player Nathan Pawelek and his Russian counterpart,  Aleksandr Semyonov, have been taught different styles. Russian oboists even cut  their reeds differently from American oboists to produce a distinctive national  sound. And while American bassists are taught to observe strict precision,  Russians tend more to emphasize the grand sweep and emotional impact of their  playing. Neither approach is incorrect, but that is not the point. Which is  best for the orchestra, and how is the overall sound to be shaped?  </P> <P> The task of mixing these sounds into a single orchestra falls to a  Soviet-American team of conductors led by Pavel Kogan of the Soviet State  Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, tonight's  conductor. Their talented associates, Catherine Comet of the American Symphony  Orchestra and Leonid Nikolayev of the Moscow Conservatory, are among the  fastest-rising stars in the international musical firmament. Working through  interpreters in what must set an international record for intensive rehearsals,  these four conductors have forged 100 soloists into a single artistic organism.  </P> <P> For all its special challenges, this musical joint venture has proven a  resounding success. Zubin Mehta, after conducting the orchestra at the Kennedy  Center in 1988, stated that "while it exists, this is one of the world's finest  orchestras."  </P> <P> Tchaikovsky once said that every great orchestra is a republic of its own. The  "republic" that will step out on the stage at the Hollywood Bowl tonight is  neither Russian nor American but something better than either country could  produce alone. It combines the Russians' special strengths in the strings with  the Americans' virtuosity in winds and brass.  </P> <P> And this, too, is part of the message. Cooperating across 7,000 miles, two  languages and two cultures is far more demanding than working with people in  one's own city or region. But it is possible, and the results can even be  dazzling. The American Soviet Youth Orchestra proves it.  </P></p>

The Chadian Government and  the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD]  have still not been able to settle their differences. Their  talks have stalled on the issue of conditions laid down by Moise  Kette's movement. Here is the reaction of Abderhamane  Djasnabaille, spokesman of the committee for the defense of the  national conference decisions, speaking to Jean-Claude Medome.    [Begin Djasnabaille recording] Concerning the ongoing talks  between the CSNPD and the Chadian Government, we believe that  the very issue they are discussing requires at least a national  consensus. This impasse proves us right because the issue of  organizing a referendum on the form of government is of interest  to everybody, and I am not sure that the government can  guarantee its organization since not everyone is involved. We  must remember that this government is a transitional one and  everything that is discussed must be based on consensus.    We have always generally said that a roundtable conference  comprising all parties concerned must be held. We say that  discussions must not be held with the CNSPD alone. They must  include the Movement for Democracy and Development, the SNT  [expansion unknown], and all other Chadian political and  military organizations.    Furthermore, concerning the internal situation, we proposed  the establishment of a national reconciliation committee to  discuss this issue and to agree on a common stand that would  effectively commit the government since it is a transitional  one. It is not just a matter of discussing the principle. A  program must be drawn up to indicate how long it will take to  organize this referendum.    Meanwhile, today, nothing has been settled yet and this  really shows the precariousness of the agreements that could be  reached at these Bangui talks. [end recording]</p>

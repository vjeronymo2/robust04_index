			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Swedish Riksbank's justification of its surprise rates rise with a claim that it had spotted four inflationary factors prompted a swift review in Germany. A weakening currency, cited by the Swedes, is not a problem in the federal republic. Nor is the speedy global recovery causing concern. Dearer imports have slowed the fall in German consumer prices, but other factors, such as shrunken disposable incomes, are keeping inflation under control. On the other hand, the Riksbank's identification of rising capacity utilisation in industry rang some bells. As Mr Adolf Rosenstock, economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, noted, this indicator is may soon over-step its long-term average of 83 per cent. With this and the turnround in unemployment in mind, he says the Bundesbank will have to stay on guard. The IG Metall engineering union has already started making ominous noises about the need for a clear improvement in real pay. While Mr Rosenstock marked last Thursday in his diary as the day Europe's latest spell of monetary easing came to an end, there were still voices suggesting the Bundesbank has further to go. Optimists believe the central council will signal its attitude with a return to variable rate repos at its first post-holiday meeting this Thursday.</p>

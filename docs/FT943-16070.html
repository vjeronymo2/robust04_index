			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: South Africa Mr Derek Keys looks sincere in maintaining that there is no policy motivation behind his resignation as South Africa's finance minister. Just the same, his departure is a further blow to hopes that political reform would lead to large investment inflows. Mr Chris Stals, who is widely respected internationally, remains at the helm of the Reserve Bank, but he has no influence over fiscal policy. Mr Nelson Mandela's government moved quickly to announce a replacement. But it is hard to imagine Mr Keys' successor wielding the same clout in cabinet on the budget, and an ability to keep public spending under control is crucial to South Africa's economic stability. In theory South African equities represent good value. A historic price/earnings multiple of around 19 is low both by general emerging market standards and for a country on the threshold of a cyclical earnings recovery. Similarly bonds offer attractive real returns after the three percentage point rise in yields this year. But while the political uncertainty continues, enthusiasm is likely to remain muted. It would help if higher prices for minor metals like palladium spilled over into the dollar price of gold. Extra prosperity would make the politicians' task easier too.</p>

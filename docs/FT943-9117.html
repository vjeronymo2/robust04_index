			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Getty son offers Pounds 1m to keep statue in UK John Paul Getty II, son of the late American oil billionaire, yesterday pledged Pounds 1m to the appeal to keep Canova's statue of the Three Graces in the UK - and prevent its sale to the Californian art museum founded by his father. On Tuesday Mr Stephen Dorrell, the heritage secretary, agreed to delay for another three-months the granting of an export licence to the Getty Museum, which has offered Pounds 7.6m for the statue, to enable British galleries and museums to match that sum. An appeal, led by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland, had reached Pounds 5.8m and Mr Getty's Pounds 1m makes it much more likely that the Three Graces will stay in Britain. Mr Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland, said trustees and staff were 'dancing with joy. I'm sure even the Graces are now wreathed in smiles'. Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, director of the V &amp; A, said: 'It gives huge impetus to the campaign and will hearten all those who wish to see this marvellous work retained in this country.' If the campaign is successful, it will not be the first time John Paul Getty II, a committed Anglophile who did not get on with his father, has contributed to appeals to keep works of art in the UK and out of the Getty Museum. He was instrumental in retaining a painting by Duccio in 1984 and a bust by Bernini in 1986. The Grace of Getty, Weekend XII</p>

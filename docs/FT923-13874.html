			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM accused over role of committees MR JOHN MAJOR was accused by a Tory MP yesterday of allowing government business managers to interfere in the Commons select committees responsible for scrutinising Whitehall. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, has called for an early meeting with the prime minister after being left off the list of MPs selected for the health committee, which he used to chair. He cited a letter Mr Major wrote to him in March last year: 'Every member of a select committee is free to vote for the person of his or her choice if a vacancy arises for the chairmanship,' it said. 'That has always been the case and will continue to be so.' The row may dominate the Commons debate on the membership of the select committees next Monday. Mr Winterton will try to win Labour backing for his reappointment to the health committee. The committee of selection's proposals were announced yesterday and confirmed that no minister who was returned to the back benches after the general election has been given a place on a committee. Mr Tim Renton, former arts minister, was tipped for the chairmanship of the Treasury committee, but has taken on consultancy work in the City. Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary, has also been excluded. Besides Mr Winterton, another casualty appears to be Mr James Cran, Conservative MP for Beverley - who usually backs the government except in his strong Euro-scepticism. He has lost his place on the trade and industry committee. Among new MPs winning places are Mrs Judith Chaplin, Tory MP for Newbury and former Treasury adviser, and Mr Gyles Brandreth, the former TV game show host, now Tory MP for Chester. He joins the national heritage committee.</p>

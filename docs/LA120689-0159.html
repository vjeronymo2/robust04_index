			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STUDIES BENCH WILLIAMSON FRIDAY  </P> <P> Maurice Williamson, who backs up both starting guards for ninth-ranked  Louisiana State, has been neglecting his studies and is suspended for Friday's  game against Cal State Los Angeles, Coach Dale Brown said.  </P> <P> Williamson is the second player this season to be suspended for academic  neglect. Center Stanley Roberts sat out the exhibition opener against Athletes  in Action after Brown caught him cutting classes.  </P> <P> Brown did not detail the offenses of either Roberts or Williamson.  </P> <P> "It goes back to the same thing we said with Stanley, he has just has not made  the academic commitment that he needs to make," Brown said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Staying eligible is one thing. Educating yourself for life is the second  thing. He will not play Friday."  </P></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Oil shares The agreement among the Opec producers certainly seems to have calmed the oil market when fears of an outright collapse were growing. Saudi Arabia's readiness to compromise and the involvement of several Gulf heads of state underlined how seriously Opec takes the threat to its position. Yet the agreement does little more than institutionalise the current over-production and formally include Kuwait in the quota system. It will not do much to tighten the oil market, and crude prices may not rise much above Dollars 18 a barrel. That probably puts a cap on the recent rebound in oil company shares. But since BP and Enterprise have lagged behind Shell lately, there is still some room for them to fare somewhat better. Lasmo is permanently hidden in a swirl of bid rumours, but the recent high turnover almost certainly owes more to its efforts to attract new investors in the US than to the likelihood of predatory stakebuilding. One key is the way in which US investors have bought into UK oil shares over the past year. In part that is because simple cash flow models, which are not adjusted for debt servicing, show some UK oil shares to be cheap. Persuasive tales of cost cutting and recovery stocks also play a part. If US funds continue to buy BP and take an interest in Lasmo and Enterprise the sector looks underpinned. How long they are prepared to hold the shares must also be a worry for UK fund managers who are feeling uncomfortably underweight.</p>

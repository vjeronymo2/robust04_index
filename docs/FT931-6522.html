			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Lonrho in talks with Gencor to raise cash LONRHO, the international trading group, is in talks with Gencor, South Africa's biggest mining house, about a cash raising exercise which could see its shareholding in Western Platinum reduced to 51 per cent. The proposals are part of the group's recently unveiled strategy of reducing debt by selling stakes in core businesses. Lonrho has put the value of Western Platinum at Pounds 1bn, though independent brokers say it is worth only half that. Lonrho wants to wipe out the borrowings of the three platinum mines, which have risen to more than R800m (Pounds 180.5m). Talks between Lonrho and Gencor, which has a 27 per cent stake in Lonrho's platinum assets, have been under way since the end of last year. According to a Lonrho executive the group has narrowed its options down to three proposals: Gencor would buy a further 22 per cent of the platinum mines, taking its stake to 49 per cent. The platinum mines would be floated off as a separate company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Lonrho's platinum assets would be put into one of its existing investment companies, such as Tweefontein United Collieries, which is quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The investment company would then have a rights issue to raise funds. It is understood that Lonrho directors hope the talks will reach a conclusion within a fortnight. An announcement may then come as early as this month. However, the recent fall in the prices of precious metals means all three proposals would be more expensive than first envisaged. Since the beginning of the year the price of rhodium has fallen from Dollars 1,800 an ounce to around Dollars 1,450, while the value of platinum fell from Dollars 370 an ounce to Dollars 350. Lonrho last year broke off merger talks with Gencor when it decided to a deal with Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier. Mr Bock joined the group's board as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland. Lonrho decided against merging with Gencor because it did not want to be South African controlled. Mr Rowland has said the group only needed 51 per cent of its key assets to retain control.</p>

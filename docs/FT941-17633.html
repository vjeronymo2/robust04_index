			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: After the age of the dinosaur - Cinema Hollywood, Boom; Rest of World, Bust. That is the first vision a film critic sees when he wires himself up to the Virtual Reality game, 'Guess The Future.' As the decade/century/millennium lives out its dotage years, popular American cinema is spreading through the world like some benign Alzheimer's Disease. Forget your troubles; forget there was ever such a thing as 'art cinema'; forget that intelligent audio-visual life existed between the First Jurassic Age (dinosaurs) and the Second Jurassic Age (Spielberg). 'Popular American cinema', of course, puts it too narrowly. We must call it the whole US moving-image culture from films and videos to computer games and theme parks. In recent years only the Far East - hi-tech Japan and cinematically emergent China and Taiwan - has developed any kind of audio-visual vernacular to compete. Japan's adventures in video, computer-games and high-definition TV, and at other points along today's screen-technology frontier, have created interest in a pop-futuristic iconography which, given Japan's foothold in Hollywood itself, may soon start filtering into American movies and TV. (In fact it is already doing so: look at the mix of Samurai folklore and Virtual Reality in TV's Wild Palms, or the hi-tech/sci-fi stand-off between East and West in Rising Sun.) Meanwhile China and Taiwan, whose films have regularly pipped America's at recent film festivals, are starting to fill the gap between a disappearing European art cinema and a retarded popular US cinema. Films like The Wedding Banquet, Farewell My Concubine and The Story Of Qiu Ju prove that despite the political adversities and scant funding resources of the countries where they are made - or perhaps because of those handicaps (young cinema enjoys a struggle) - these nations are creating the closest thing to a new cinema of humanism since the French New Wave. Neither of these nations has yet made a big impact on the Western box office: which is the West's loss. We on the Atlantic seaboard are left looking back at 1993's searingly forgettable releases and asking, Can there be life after Jurassic Park? That Americans have paid Dollars 334m to date, topping the hitherto highest-grossing ET, to watch the world's most boneheaded prehistoric drama since The Flintstones is bad news for civilisation. (Worse news is that The Flintstones itself comes to your large screens this year.) But perhaps this pattern of historical back-pedalling, of a film industry yearning alike for pre-civilisation and for primeval story properties, fits naturally into a millennial time: reculer pour mieux sauter. And the same desire to give the home-base one last hug before being hurled into the year 2000 may explain - if not excuse - Hollywood's fascination with the sequel. We keep being told it will stop; it never does. Coming soon: Look Who's Talking Now, Return To The OK Corral, City Slickers 2, The Neverending Story 3 . . . Sequels we can almost take: they have become a fact of filmic life. But other forms of derivativeness and running-for-cover in Western movie-making are more disturbing. One is the 'Have you watched any good books lately?' syndrome. Increasingly the men who were once American cinema's great adventurers - Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola - have been abandoning their old rough-and-tumble hyper-realism for a season ticket to the public library. Last year we found Mr Coppola at the shelves marked 'S' for Stoker, Bram. Since then Mr Scorsese has been bookworming through 'W' for Wharton, Edith (The Age Of Innocence, opening here on January 25). There has to be more to cinema than this: than a movie world caught between two forms of emulation - low aping of its own action tropes and high piping to the tune of famous literature. But I fear that Hollywood, having put Europe to the sword with its own world-colonising populism, is now content to rest on the spoils of its victory. It knows that the great days of the European writer-director are over: and that the auteur who invents and shoots his own original stories, racing about the land unencumbered by studio committees, story conferences and bloated production costs, is a dream being swallowed up by history. What we want for 1994 is not a new year resolution but a new year revolution. Something to put the pep back into all those ailing movie lands between Tinseltown and Tokyo. And something to get Hollywood out of its second stone age and into the third millennium AD</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Observer: Smokestack tips How terribly piquant. Edith Cresson, France's commissioner-in-waiting, presented herself in Brussels yesterday for a discreet tete a tete with Jacques Delors, the outgoing EU president, and the man who for a while seemed tempted to become prime minister of France following Cresson's own short stab at the job. She certainly needs all the hot tips she can get. A big-ticket portfolio such as external trade or competition policy is what she really covets, but the present incumbents - Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, and Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner - look pretty tough to dislodge. That might mean she is best off aiming for the industry portfolio - where she could after all amuse herself crafting a whole new European industrial policy for the 1990s. The snag there is Martin Bangemann, the senior German industry commissioner, who could get in the way. He seems fairly certain to stay on in the next regime, and apparently has his eyes on a new information technology portfolio which would encompass both telecommun-ications and computers. If Bangemann succeeded with that particular master plan, Cresson would risk being stuck with the smokestack industries. Much depends, then, on the attitude of Jacques Santer, the prime minister of Luxembourg who takes over from Delors next January. The genial Santer is known in the Grand Duchy as the man who never says No. So perhaps he is a relatively soft target for the legendary Cresson charm.</p>

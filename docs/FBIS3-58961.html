The EC's executive European Commission said ECU12 million  (13  million dollars) would be made available to such organisations  as trade unions, media bodies and human rights monitoring  organisations.    To be eligible, they must work with similar bodies in the  European Community on projects to "promote the concept of  democratic societies governed by the rule of law and the  expressed wishes of free citizens," an EC official said.    The first pilot democracy programme, launched in 1992,  attracted 350 applications for a share of ECU5 million (5.5  million dollars). Some 52 projects from East Europe were  finally selected.    The second programme for which applications are now being  invited has been expanded to include countries of the former  Soviet Union. A third and larger programme is expected to be  announced later this year.</p>

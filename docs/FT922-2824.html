			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Ireland's anti-Maastricht campaigners out in force MASS, not Maastricht, was delivered from pulpits across Ireland yesterday. In churches throughout Dublin, the feast of the Holy Trinity was celebrated, communion taken and coins placed in collection baskets for the Catholic Youth Council in response to an appeal from the Archbishop of Dublin. It is increasingly difficult 'to be young, Irish and Catholic' he said in a message read in churches throughout the city. Maastricht was not mentioned. Only at the entrance of the churches, next to noticeboards, the parish newspapers and the holy water, were copies of the bishops' ambivalent statement on Maastricht displayed. Most mass-goers appeared to ignore it as they filed out, as if they had already decided how to vote in Thursday's referendum. Less easy to ignore, and far less ambivalent, were the anti-Maastricht campaigners outside. 'Seven reasons why you should vote No' said the leaflets they pressed into hands fresh from prayer. Most churches in the city were similarly staked out. The No campaign was out in force. One teenager, sporting prominent 'Vote No' stickers on her blouse, was leafleting on Dublin's beaches at the weekend. 'If you vote Yes, the Maastricht treaty means that abortion will be introduced in Ireland,' she explained as she handed out 'Pro-Life' leaflets to half-naked sunbathers. 'What's abortion, mummy?' asked a child with an ice cream in one hand and a leaflet in the other. 'Give that to me,' said the embarrassed mother. 'What's Mass-tricked then?' he persisted. Many Irish people have been asking the same question in the past few weeks. Confusion is rampant. For some it means Ireland will be wealthier, but women will have fewer rights because of the special Irish protocol in the treaty, respecting Ireland's anti-abortion legislation. For others it means Ireland will be poorer, but women will have more rights because EC law and not Irish law will prevail. The government insists Irish neutrality will not be compromised. Articulate opponents insist that it will. Most people don't know who to believe. A friend said: 'I'm inclined to vote Yes, but some of the implications are so unclear I might vote No to be on the safe side'. A school teacher said he will vote against the treaty because he feared that the Brussels bureaucracy would become too powerful, and that wealthier states would benefit more than the poorer ones like Ireland. Another friend, separated from her husband but unable to divorce because of Ireland's laws said: 'I am voting Yes because it scares me to be left behind with these people who want to keep us in the last century.' Whatever the viewpoint, most are convinced that the opposing camp will win. The last three opinion polls all indicate a two-to-one margin in favour of the treaty, although the 'undecided' still account for some 30 per cent of voters, and most people prefer to believe their own ears rather than the polls. The school teacher is convinced the treaty will be approved because the government and main political parties have all thrown their weight behind the Yes campaign. 'They have all the resources to get their message across, while the alternative viewpoint is not getting heard,' he said. Maybe, but willing bodies to do the canvassing appear to be lacking. According to Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, the main political parties were to have launched an all-out effort to put the Yes message across this weekend. Instead, it was the No campaigners standing at the church gates, tramping the beaches, knocking on doors and pasting up posters. The government leaflet, recommending a Yes vote, was delivered last week in the post. Boardroom fears Page 10 Garret FitzGerald Page 17 Currencies Page 33</p>

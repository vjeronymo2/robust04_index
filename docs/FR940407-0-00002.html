This termination was requested by cooperative associations that represent producers who supply about one-half of the milk regulated under the orders. The seasonal incentive plans have been suspended during each of the last three years and are no longer effective in carrying out their intended purpose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 7, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gino M.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the orders on dairy farmers and will not affect milk handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This order of termination is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the orders regulating the handling of milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 24,1994 (59 FR 8873) concerning a proposed termination or suspension of certain provisions of the orders. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments. Comments supporting the proposed termination were received from Dairylea Cooperative, Inc, and Agri-Mark, two of the cooperatives who proposed termination. One comment was received from a dairy farmer who opposed termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provisions of the orders do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

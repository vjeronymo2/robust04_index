			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Leading Article: New directions for the BBC The government's white paper on the British Broadcasting Corporation, published yesterday, sets out two aims. The BBC should continue to be a public service broadcaster 'serving the nation' and it should be equipped to compete in the revolution under way in media industries worldwide. These are appropriate, if ambitious, goals. The BBC is an institution of great cultural and political significance; potentially, it is also a large commercial asset. Prescriptions, however, are not easy. Technological changes are eroding the barriers between television, telecommunications and information-processing; there is no neat formula to spot or to nurture winners. Moreover, the government's record of media regulation has in recent years been poor. Its piecemeal approach has spawned anomalies and unworkable rules, notably the 1990 Broadcasting Act, intended to govern ITV's actions for a decade, but already partly jettisoned. The patchy regulatory regime governing satellite and cable television is also the subject of much concern. Given that history, the government is sensible to limit its main thoughts on the BBC to a five-year horizon beyond 1996, when the current charter expires. There will then be a further review about BBC funding, to take the corporation to the end of a new 10-year charter in 2006. Unaddressed problem The main recommendation is that the BBC should keep the licence fee - a flat rate payment by all owners of television sets - as the main source of funding its public services, at least for the first five-year period. The government has again concluded that the fee, although 'an oddity', is the least bad way of hypothecating public funds to the BBC to enable it to make and broadcast a mix of programmes distinct from those on offer from the commercial channels. The unaddressed problem is that the licence fee cannot last indefinitely; at some point, a falling share of the audience will make such a universal tax unsustainable. It may well be optimistic to imagine that it can be sustained for the next seven years. The second flange of the government's strategy is to urge the BBC to develop alternative sources of income, especially in the rapidly growing world of international broadcasting, but also to an unspecified extent in the domestic cable and satellite market. The BBC, says the white paper, 'should be able to evolve into an international multi-media enterprise'. The government approves the corporation's recent spate of alliances with the private sector and plans to repeal those parts of the 1990 Broadcasting Act which tie it down. Tricky questions Those steps are the right ones for the BBC, but it is not clear that the government has recognised just how many tricky questions they will raise. Although the BBC is told that it must keep separate its commercial and its publicly funded accounts and that it must trade fairly, it can only be a matter of time before it is challenged by its private sector competitors for unfairly cross-subsidising commercial services. At the same time, if the BBC really wishes to exploit its newly sanctioned commercial freedoms, it will bump regularly and hard against the government's borrowing limits, by which it is still bound. Nor is it likely to be entrepreneurially fleet of foot, in a world dominated by the likes of Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Ted Turner, when every deal has to be approved in Whitehall. The obvious question, ducked in the white paper, is why the BBC should not be steered towards the private sector, there to engage freely in the international marketplace, much as privatised British Airways has been able to do. The privatisation route is, of course, not without difficulties. There would still be a need for public finance for truly non-commercial broadcasting and problems exist in funding by both advertising and subscription, although these are not insuperable. What yesterday's white paper really does is to establish two BBCs in uneasy harness with each other, one maintaining a familiar public service, the other driving hard into global markets. Eventually a choice will have to be made, but the government lacks the courage to make it now.</p>

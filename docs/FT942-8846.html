			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU pulp makers in 'home-made mess' European pulp and paper companies will escape an even worse recession than the last one only if they refrain from building up extra capacity too quickly, an industry leader warned yesterday. Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, told a Financial Times conference on world pulp and paper that it would take time to resolve the 'home-made mess' of overcapacity. All sectors apart from newsprint had operated well below 90 per cent capacity utilisation during the past few years and were expected to return to operating rates above 90 per cent only in 1995 or 1996, he said. 'Current overcapacity will only disappear if the leaders of European paper companies act responsibly. If they do, the outlook is excellent. If not, the future will be even worse than what we experienced during the last few years.' Timber, pulp and paper producers worldwide are emerging from a severe recession that has forced many into radical restructuring. Optimism that the industry has turned the corner has been fuelled by a strong recovery in pulp and paper prices. But Mr van Oordt said rising prices were creating 'an artificial situation' in Europe. 'Other economies - the US and Asia - are doing better than our own and are siphoning off the raw material and pushing prices up. Our economies in Europe are not yet strong enough for us to pass on our costs to our customers.' He said EU companies had to close the competitive gap with other players in the industry, notably in North America and Scandinavia. Further rationalisation of mills was needed. In Finland, the average mill size had risen from 142,000 tonnes to 241,000 tonnes between 1980 and 1992. In the US, the figure had gone from 92,000 tonnes to 134,000 tonnes. But the average mill size in the EU had increased from 22,000 tonnes to just 42,000 tonnes. On the bright side, demand for paper was expected to remain healthy, 'a unique starting position in a European setting where most industries are troubled by low- or no-growth conditions,' he said. The continued demand for paper in the electronic age was underlined by Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper manufacturer. 'The psychological value of the printed page is still high, as is shown by the rapid rise in demand for printers,' he said. Growth in the west European market would continue, he said, but European paper companies must look to opportunities in the Far East, Latin America and eastern Europe to become more competitive globally.</p>

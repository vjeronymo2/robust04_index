			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Purpose Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act establishes a special additional rule for extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers. In general, a bank's lending to each of its executive officers is limited to an amount equal to the greater of $25,000 or 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired surplus, but not to exceed $100,000. 12 CFR 215.5(c). Qualifying home mortgage loans and educational loans are not counted toward this limit, although they do count toward the general individual and aggregate lending limits applicable to all insiders under &sect;215.4 of Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2). Also, unlike the general individual and aggregate lending limits, there has been no exception to the executive officer lending limit based on the manner in which the extension of credit is collateralized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board proposed to create an exemption to the general purpose lending limit for loans to executive officers for loans fully secured by: (a) Obligations of the United States or other obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; (b) commitments or guarantees of a department or agency of the United States; or (c) a segregated deposit account with the lending bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board previously has determined that extensions of credit collateralized in the manner described above pose minimal risk of loss to a bank. See 58 FR 26507, May 4, 1993. In view of this determination, the Board has concluded that it is consistent with safe and sound banking practices to increase the amount of credit that a bank may extend to its executive officers when the credit is secured as described above. Because such loans would continue to be subject to the prohibitions against preferential lending, the Board also believes that the proposed exception would not lend itself to evasions of the law or any other abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters supported the proposed exception. Six commenters suggested that additional categories of exempt extensions of credit be adopted. Nine commenters requested that the current $100,000 cap on general purpose loans be increased, and two commenters suggested that the cap be eliminated altogether. One commenter suggested that loans to an executive officer serving in a bona fide fiduciary capacity not be included as loans to the executive officer for purposes of 12 CFR 215.5(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional exceptions that have been proposed apply more readily to loans made in a commercial context rather than to personal loans. Section 215.5 primarily governs personal loans, however, and the additional proposals therefore are neither necessary nor appropriate. The Board also considers it more appropriate to reconsider the appropriate lending limit for executive officers in connection with a more general review of executive officer restrictions. Finally, the Board notes that the proper treatment under Regulation O of loans to an executive officer serving in a bona fide fiduciary capacity has previously been addressed. See I Fed. Res. Reg. Serv. 3&hyph;1048. The Board will provide any further guidance on this issue on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Refinancing of Home Mortgage Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that a bank may make a loan to its executive officer, without restriction as to amount, if the loan is secured by a first lien on a dwelling that is owned by the executive officer and used by the executive officer as a residence after the loan is made. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Section 215.5(c)(2) of Regulation O implements this provision, and sets forth additional restrictions on such loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board proposed to revise the regulation to provide clearly that the refinancing of a home mortgage loan is included within this category to the extent that the proceeds are used to pay off the prior home mortgage loan or for one or more of the permissible purposes enumerated in 12 CFR 215.5(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were generally supportive. Two commenters asked the Board to clarify that the closing costs of a home mortgage refinancing are included as part of the qualifying portion of the loan. Two commenters requested that all proceeds of a home mortgage refinancing be included in this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board, as requested in the comments, has revised the regulation further to provide expressly that closing costs are included as part of the exempt portion of a home mortgage refinancing, and to make other clarifying changes. Inclusion within the exemption of proceeds of a refinancing that may be used for unrestricted purposes is prohibited by the enabling statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Prior Approval of Home Mortgage Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22(g) provides that the board of directors of a bank must specifically approve in advance a home mortgage loan to an executive officer. 12 U.S.C. 375a(2). Regulation O, however, does not set forth this requirement. The Board proposed that 12 CFR 215.5(c) be revised to conform to the enabling statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments upon this proposal were mixed. One commenter asked the Board to clarify that prior approval is required for all home mortgage loans regardless of size, notwithstanding the general provisions of Regulation O that require prior approval only for loans in excess of a calculated amount. See 12 CFR 215.4(b). Two commenters suggested that the Board rely on its rulemaking authority not to conform to the statute, and two commenters asked the Board to seek relief from this requirement from Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has adopted this provision substantially as proposed. As discussed above, the Board has added an introductory statement to &sect;215.5 to clarify that the requirements for extensions of credit to executive officers under that section, pursuant to section 22(g), are in addition to the general requirements for insiders set forth elsewhere in Regulation O. The Board lacks the authority to adopt a provision of Regulation O that does not conform to the statutory prior approval requirement. The additional comments are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

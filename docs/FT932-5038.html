			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Travel: Blasts from the past in old Kazakhstan - Giles Whittell sneaks into the once-forbidden cosmodrome at Baikonur, and sees where the Soviets used to test their nuclear weapons HERE WAS the corduroyed Moscow correspondent of a staid London newspaper in raptures about a Russian rocket blast-off. He looked more like an opera critic than a space nerd but he had seen Helen Sharman, the British cosmonaut, go up from 500 metres, which is a lot closer than they let you get at Cape Canaveral. The flame, billowing out over the Kazakh steppe, had been apocalyptic. The earth had trembled. So when my bus rolled into Alma Ata two days before a launch, I asked if I could go and watch. Intourist wanted Dollars 1,200, excluding travel to the cosmodrome 1,000 miles away, but could not guarantee permission from Kazakhstan's foreign ministry. Permission was duly refused and Mrs Intourist departed alone on a special flight to host a group of German advertising executives whose cigarette brand was plastered over the communications satellite being hurled into orbit for a fraction of what NASA charges. This left a day in which to introduce myself to the authorities. Baikonur, the cosmodrome, used to be highly secret and run exclusively from Star City, a bastion of the former Soviet techno-elite in a forest near Moscow. Mission Control is still there, even further from the launch pad than Houston is from Florida. And the rockets are still built on very Russian soil at Samara, on the Volga, from where they are flown in bits to Kazakhstan in the world's biggest cargo planes. But Kazakhstan now controls the cosmodrome's territory, and the foreign ministry in Alma Ata occasionally admits foreigners if they book months ahead and pay a lot of money. Casual visitors, on the other hand, get the run-around. I visited 11 different offices all over the city. The foreign ministry claimed to know nothing about Baikonur. A KGB man was polite but bewildered. Eventually, grudgingly, someone gave me a visa stamp for a place, not marked on any map, called Leninsk. This is a 'closed' military city on the Syr Darya river where cosmodrome staff live. Baikonur is 30 miles to the north (which, to flummox spies, is 300 miles south of the only Baikonur on the map). Both are four hours' drive across the steppe from the nearest public airport at Kizyl Orda. It felt perverse but definitely heroic to leave the lush foothills of the Tien Shan, rising from the edge of Alma Ata, in favour of one of the world's bleakest voids. I took a taxi from Kizyl Orda to Leninsk for Dollars 12 and tried to calm the increasingly twitchy driver as the giant parabolic antennae of the tracking station came into view. He had lived in Kizyl Orda all his life but had never been here before. He left me at the entrance to Leninsk, from where a guard took me to the cosmonauts' hotel. With a mosaic of Yuri Gagarin in the lobby and chrome models of rockets festooning the bar, this is the height of Soviet chic. I entered to see Mrs Intourist's jaw, under her Astrakhan hat, fall gratifyingly open. 'However are you come here?' she asked, anxiously. I explained how. But dour men in raincoats were already homing in and talking quietly in Russian; ' . . . bolshoi skandal . . .' said one. I was making for the door when a hand fell on my shoulder and steered me to a large, green sofa. Was I of the 'intelligentsia?' Raincoat was asking not about my position in the Marxist-Leninist class structure but whether I was a spy - an unnerving question even for the innocent. 'No,' I said. He seemed sceptical. My visa had been 'a mistake.' He summoned an army Jeep and told its driver to put me on the first train back to Alma Ata. Meanwhile, the German advertising executives had been issued with souvenir jump suits and were waiting smugly for a special bus to take them to the launch pad. It was very irksome. Fortunately, my train did not leave for eight hours so, once the Jeep had disappeared, I was able to set off on foot across the now benighted steppe towards the cosmodrome. Parts of Kazakhstan look as serene and beautiful as any wilderness on Earth. But, environmentally, the country is a disaster area unrivalled even by the rest of the CIS. It shares with Uzbekistan the territory of the tragically shrunken Aral sea. It is fringed to the east by some of the world's dirtiest cities, producing mainly chemical fertilisers for the wheat fields of the Virgin Lands and heavy metals for atomic bombs and ammunition. In the north-east, an area the size of Ireland served until two years ago as one of the world's busiest nuclear test sites. And, in the middle, gigantic rocket boosters have been crashing to earth and bemusing the nomads ever since Laika the dog went into orbit in 1957. Besides leaking unburned chemical fuel over the steppe, the rockets have been accused of torching the ozone layer and blowing away much-needed rain clouds with the shock wave that spreads out from the launch pad. Nowhere was Soviet gigantism so unfettered. Nowhere were the scientists and soldiers involved prouder of their achievements. Nowhere were the achievements so awesome. The guards at the entrance to the cosmodrome had received a telephone call and were not surprised to see me. But instead of 'phoning Raincoat they invited me into their hut, produced vodka and said that next time I should call them direct. I would be their Latvian friend and they would escort me to a flame-side seat, to the tracking station, to the rocket assembly site, up the gantry, down the flame pit, out into the desert where the boosters fell to earth. Everything was on its head, the duty officer continued. Until a year ago, come within 100 miles of this place and they would lock you up before you could ask for a quote. Now, busloads of school children watched every launch. My mistake had been to walk into the only place where appearances mattered any more and introduce myself to an assemblage of bored ex-KGB men hired to give a group of big-spending Germans an exclusive treat. It was 7.57pm. 'Shall we go outside?' he asked. It was bitterly cold. At 7.59, I was stamping my feet when he pointed and said 'There.' Twenty miles away, the rocket had cleared the horizon already, followed by a taut, white flame. It rose fast, curving away from vertical after 10 seconds and jettisoning stage one in a yellow explosion half a minute later. 'Already in space,' said the officer. 'Eight kilometres a second.' After another two minutes we heard a long, angry roar. The hut behind us shook, rattling its windows. The soldiers looked at me proudly and I hope I was suitably impressed. Another strange and desperately extravagant link with space having been accomplished, silence returned to the steppe and I returned to Alma Ata with the duty officer's number in my pocket. It is 010-7-33622-27280 and his name is Sergei. Or surrender your credit card to Intourist Alma Ata (010-7-3272-330076). Next launch: July 1 1993. For potential tourists who find the idea of watching space rockets too trivial or Boys' Own, Kazakhstan is offering something altogether more grown-up. In 1949, 18,000 square kilometres of steppe in the north-east of the republic were given over to a nuclear physicist called Kurchatov. Since then, 465 atom bombs have been exploded there, half of them above ground, half below. When the test site ('polygon') was busy, it averaged 15 bangs a year and employed 5,000 hand-picked scientists and engineers. They lived in a town named after Kurchatov which, like Leninsk, is hard to find on the map. For nearly 40 years, the existence of the test site was denied, even though the people of Semipalatinsk 100 miles away saw the mushroom clouds regularly and, since underground testing started in 1963, felt the earth shake. But these terrifying 'natural' phenomena were never mentioned in the media and hardly ever, apparently, in private conversation. Then came glasnost and, in 1989, a Kazakh-American group called Nevada-Semipalatinsk which campaigned bravely and successfully for the polygon's closure. Testing stopped in October 1990 and there is now a permanent Nevada-Semipalatinsk exhibition in Alma Ata's central state museum. Semipalatinsk is the remote river port to which Dostoyevsky exiled Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment. It was once picturesque, and there is still a poignant scattering of log cabins round the bazaar. But as you leave town on the Kurchatov road, the emptiness of the steppe feels sudden and total. The road runs south-west, dead straight, for 2 1/2 hours and is crossed only by an army barrier on the final approach to the polygon. 'May peace prevail upon Earth,' says a sign in four languages. Kurchatov is laid out on a tidy grid and has been indulged in various places, including the army HQ, with fresh white stucco on pink paint. General YB Konovalenko has been left under-employed by the closure of the polygon he used to run, but he sees a future in tourism. He was out when I called, but his deputy, a grumpy colonel with a Brezhnevesque breastful of medals, outlined the plan: Kurchatov's hitherto secret army museum will open to visitors this year. So will the 1949 test site and, possibly, a mountainous area further south, Emmenthal'd by decades of underground testing (Emmenthal: pale yellow Swiss cheese with many holes). Visitors are also invited to catch and eat trout from a lake created in 1963 by a nuclear explosion at the bottom of a 90-metre concrete shaft. This is an arid zone, and the project was a joint venture with the Kazakh ministry of irrigation. Having seen the polygon's health statistics prepared by Nevada-Semipalatinsk, as well as grotesquely malformed human foetuses in formaldehyde (which, they believe, were victims of lethal radiation), I did not fancy the fishing trip. Having given such short notice, the colonel said, I wasn't getting it, anyway. I was allowed to see only the river Irtysh, which flows past Kurchatov, and the officers' dachas along its banks. My guide, Edil, a generally reluctant Kazakh among imported Russian technocrats, was relieved. He gave his sanitised commentary as we strolled among birch trees on the river bank. 'People who worked here during the nuclear era had no health problems. They were educated people. When local people had health problems it was usually radio-phobia.' 'Radio-phobia?' 'Perhaps they feel their chair jump. They know there has been a test, so they are frightened and they get a headache from their fear.' 'But there were dangerous radiation levels.' 'Never above the safe ceiling.' I produced a Geiger counter borrowed months before in Moscow for just this moment - and was disappointed. The count was lower than for suburban Alma Ata. Driving back to Semipalatinsk, into a spine-tingling, blue-black dusk, Edil said it saddened him that every foreigner who visited his home town came to see the polygon. Next time, I should visit the birthplace of the great Kazakh writer Abai, or take a boat trip on the Irtysh, or walk in the Altai forests. I said I would. To do any of these - visit the polygon, take a boat trip, visit Abai's birthplace, what have you - contact the Travel Bureau, Hotel Irtysh, Ulitsa Abai 97, Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan (tel. Semipalatinsk 44-75-29 or 44-75-31).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 25 May (MTI) -- If the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) form a governing coalition after second round voting on  May 29, they will agree in detail on implementing a joint  programme, and disclose it to the last letter, a TV debate with  MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn and SZDSZ prime minister candidate  Gabor Kuncze on Hungarian Television clarified this morning.  Apart from an interview from his hospital bed, Horn was on the  screen for the first time since his May 5 car crash.    Horn judged that from their manifestos and efforts, both  parties have realistic chances and show the will to govern  together.    In Kuncze's view, the situation will be different depending  on whether the MSZP wins more or less than 50 percent of seats  in the second round. If more, the Socialists will not have to  coordinate policies with their coalition partner, the SZDSZ  leader said. Although Kuncze did not rule out cooperation in  this case, he said joining such a coalition would need an SZDSZ  delegate assembly decision.    Horn said the MSZP would pursue the same policies whether it  wins 48 or 52 percent. "A government which is unable to agree  not only with its coalition partner but also with other parties,  will be short-lived because the problems the country faces can  only be tackled with a national consensus," Horn said.    The two politicians dismissed as a rumour speculation on a  behind-the-scenes agreement which would give the prime  minister's post to Horn, and the deputy prime minister's  portfolios to the Socialists' top economic politician Laszlo  Bekesi, as well as to Gabor Kuncze and Gabor Fodor of the Free  Democrats. Horn denied even more flatly that trade union leader  Sandor Nagy's name had been raised as prime minister candidate.    On the nomination of Miklos Nemeth, prime minister from 1988  to 1990 and EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development] vice-president today, Horn said, "last May the MSZP  offered him the prime minister's post if there was a Socialist  victory. At that time, Nemeth declined the offer. Although the  Socialists welcome Nemeth at any time, things have changed since  then, as the MSZP waged a tough electoral struggle, using a  great deal of human energy, without the one-time prime minister."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 9 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio said today in San Jose that there are no  major obstacles blocking the signing of a peace agreement with  the guerrillas before the end of year, adding that the  appointment of a truth commission could do more harm than good.    De Leon said during a news conference that an agreement  establishing a timetable for the negotiations and an agreement  on human rights with international verification, which were  signed last month, make "irreversible" the process to end an  armed conflict dating back to 1960.    The Guatemalan president explained that the main components  of his peace plan are achieving reconciliation, meeting social  demands, and ending the armed conflict. He added that these  goals are supported by most local sectors and by the  international community.    "We have never been so close to peace," de Leon Carpio said.  He insisted that the human rights agreement was the "Gordian  knot" of the negotiations, but that as soon as this is overcome  the process will advance more smoothly. The president, however,  added that there are certain groups at home or abroad that could  take advantage of any strike or social movement to create  instability, but that the government is ready to neutralize  their actions.    As for the establishment of a truth commission or commission  on the past, de Leon said that, after an analysis on its  advisability, the government concluded that its results could be  more negative than favorable to national reconciliation. He  pointed out that investigations into serious human rights  violations would be biased against the Army because "there are  documents only" on this sector and not on the actions carried  out by the guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity (URNG).    "If the goal of that (truth) commission were to strengthen  peace, the government would support its creation, but it could,  however, widen the gap, open new wounds, and cause further  polarization," the head of state added.    Ramiro de Leon Carpio insisted that "the ideal" would be for  Guatemalan society to learn the facts, learn who was  responsible, and have them face justice, but said that "there  are conditions that render this difficult -- there is currently  consensus in this regard -- but the government is always willing  to discuss this."    As for a joint declaration issued on Sunday by the Central  American presidents in support of peace negotiations in  Guatemala, de Leon Carpio said that it is a recognition of  government efforts and an initiative to strengthen the "final  stretch" of the process.    He pointed out that certain rulers, such as Alfredo  Cristiani  of El Salvador and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, are  experienced in this kind of process "and understand that the  final route presents certain obstacles, some of which are  natural and others provoked."    Besides Cristiani and Chamorro, the declaration was signed  by  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office on  Sunday, and by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina.    Panamanian President Guillermo Endara attended neither  Figueres' inaugural nor the "mini-summit" in which economic  issues were also analyzed, because general elections were being  held in that country.    The rulers called on the URNG to "give clear signs of its  political determination to reach the firm and lasting peace that  all Guatemalans are demanding and that all Central Americans  long for."    Ramiro de Leon Carpio, however, pointed out that his  colleague's call does not mean that the guerrilla group has not  shown a willingness to end the armed conflict, because it signed  agreements on human rights and on a timetable for the  negotiations.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Barge Sidelights (&sect;82.7, 90.7) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Improper lighting of barges has been a contributory factor in some accidents involving recreational boaters and has been the subject of periodic Congressional interest. This interpretative regulation will clarify the requirements of Rule 24 of the 72 COLREGS and Rule 24 of the Inland Rules for barge sidelights and thereby help to reduce the incidence of improper lighting of barges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. delegation to the IMO raised the issue of sidelights on unmanned barges with the Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation. It was agreed that sidelights powered with existing battery technology could not meet the vertical sector requirements for larger vessels under the 72 COLREGS. It was further agreed that an unmanned barge, unable to meet the technical lighting requirements, could meet the requirements under COLREGS Rule 24(h). Rule 24(h) allows a vessel or object being towed to exhibit alternative lighting where it is impracticable to light the vessel as prescribed in paragraphs (e) or (g) of Rule 24. A Commandant Instruction to this effect was issued on May 10, 1989. (Commandant Instruction 16672.3A International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS); Lights for Unmanned Barges.). The instruction indicates that those lighting unmanned barges may avail themselves of the Rules 24(h) exception. This exception pertains to the ``vertical sector'' technical requirements only. This has been the source of some confusion to mariners who have asserted that paragraph (h) exempts them from other provisions of Rule 24 as well. The proposed interpretive rules will make clear that in all other respects, the sidelights must meet all the technical requirements of the Inland Rules for vessels of that size. This would preclude the use of known non-marine light fixtures. Failure to comply with Inland Rule technical requirements, except the vertical sector requirements under Rule 24(h), where appropriate, could subject a mariner to civil penalties. Including this interpretation in &sect;&sect;82.7 and 90.7 will help to ensure that mariners are aware of the correct interpretation of Rule 24 and its exception in paragraph (h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Corrections to COLREGS Demarcation lines (&sect;80) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal also includes corrections to several errors in the description of COLREGS demarcation lines in 33 CFR part 80. COLREGS demarcation lines are codified boundaries that delineate the applicability of either the Inland Navigation Rules or COLREGS. These lines are marked on navigational charts. The first correction is to the geographic coordinates in &sect;80.501 and &sect;80.520. While these lines are correctly depicted on navigational charts, their description in the Code of Federal Regulations includes inadvertent errors. This rule also proposes to correct several errors in &sect;80.1495, which misspells Johnston Island; refers to Canton Island, which was returned to the Republic of Kirbati in the late 1970s, as a U.S. Possession; and refers to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands which was dissolved in 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The only proposed provision involving potential costs to mariners is the proposed rule that would require moored barges to display lights in accordance with prescribed lighting schemes meeting certain minimum standards. This lighting scheme is consistent with existing industry practice. The Coast Guard estimates that a relatively small proportion of bargetowboat owners are not equipped to light their barges as prescribed by this NPRM. For those persons that do not have lights meeting appropriate standards, the cost is de minimus. An all-round white light fixture costs approximately $12.00. Because most barge lights are placed onboard temporarily by fleeting or towboats when necessary, and barges fleeted together would be lighted as one unit, it is difficult to accurately estimate the number of lights that would be required to be purchased by an individual mariner or maritime company. However, because of the low unit cost, the impact on any one operator will be minimal. The Coast Guard specifically requests comments from the industry regarding the expected costs of the proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include (1) small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

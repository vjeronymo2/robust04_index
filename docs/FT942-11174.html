			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: NSW authorities will award Sydney casino licence today The New South Wales Casino Control Authority will today announce the winning bidder for the right to develop a casino in Sydney. The contest has come down to a two-way fight between Circus Circus, the large US casino operator, acting in conjunction with Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Showboat, a smaller US gaming company, which is partnered by Leighton Holdings, the Australian property and construction group. The Sydney casino is the last prize in a string of Australian gaming developments which could lead to a trebling of the nation's casino industry revenues by the late-1990s. Developers have been chosen for new casinos in Cairns, Brisbane, and Melbourne - all of which will come on stream over the next three years. According to consultants at Price Waterhouse, the total annual gross gaming revenues from those projects, plus Sydney, could amount to about ADollars 1.25bn (USDollars 886m). The operator of the Sydney casino will have to pay more than one-fifth of all revenues from table games, up to ADollars 200m, and 22.5 per cent of gross revenue from 'gaming devices'. Table game revenues which top ADollars 200m will attract a 'super' profits duty, which rises progressively to a maximum rate of 45 per cent. The CCA says annual income from the property should be about ADollars 100m, although this may be a conservative estimate. The developer will hand over a 'once-only, non-refundable lump-sum payment' when the casino licence is granted. 'The benefits to the state arising out of the size and proposed timing of the payment will be significant factors in the CCA's assessment of the applications,' the bidding terms state. Some critics argue that New South Wales has gone too far - and the aggressive structuring of the tax-take from the Sydney property will mitigate against a high-roller type of casino, and encourage the developer to pursue a more downmarket operation. This is thought to be the reason why a number of big US gaming groups backed away from bidding.</p>

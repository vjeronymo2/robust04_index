			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Britain ahead in OECD student survival league BRITAIN, with one of industrialised world's lowest proportion of 18-year-olds going to universities - put at 15 per cent in 1988 - has the highest rate of student survival with 94 per cent finishing their courses. Figures released yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that Japanese and German students survive almost as well with a far higher proportion entering universities at 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. 'In general, there is apparently only a weak relationship between the number of students entering the university system and the proportion eventually graduating,' conclude the OECD. Barely half of French and Spanish students starting degree courses completed them, while among Italians the proportion fell to under a third. University spending in the developed world ranged in 1988 from Dollars 1,300 to Dollars 5,700 per student. Lowest spending is in Ireland, Portugal and Spain, and the highest in Sweden, Luxembourg and Norway.

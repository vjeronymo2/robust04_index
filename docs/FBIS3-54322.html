			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] My colleague had an interview with Foreign Minister  Mr. Velayati on the sidelines of the Economic Conference  Organization [ECO] ministerial session.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] The fourth session of the  ECO Council of Foreign Ministers has opened in Tehran with the  presence of more than ten delegations from the member countries.  Mr. Foreign Minister, could you briefly explain what issues have  so far been discussed in the meeting, and what is the expected  outcome of this consular [as heard] meeting?    [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. As you know, ten countries have participated at high  level -- mostly at the level of foreign ministers -- in this  very meeting.    In this meeting we will review what the Council of Deputies  [deputy ministers] have discussed and the different committees  and commissions during last year, before the third foreign  ministers' meeting. And these foreign ministers' meetings have  been held in Iran, in Pakistan, in Turkey, in different Central  Asian countries, and the Caucasus. We have had many committees  and commissions. And those committees and commissions they have  made many decisions. We have to approve all these decisions.  And this is the final approval. According to the Izmir Treaty,  the main decisions should be made in the Council of Ministers,  which consists mainly of the foreign ministers of these  countries. We do hope that we can adopt a timetable for next  year and all projects that we are going to fulfill in different  countries in connection with the ECO.    [Correspondent] When and where will the next session of the  ECO foreign ministers be held?    [Velayati] Usually, the interval between the ministerial  meetings is one year. So, we expect that the next ministerial  meeting will be held one year from now, after one year. But, as  far as the venue of the meeting is concerned, I have to say that  this decision should made during this session.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

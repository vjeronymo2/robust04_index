			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Berlusconi gains a breathing space Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has gained an essential breathing space for his embattled government in the wake of Tuesday's parliamentary debate on the conflict of interest with his Fininvest media empire. This was the majority view among political commentators yesterday as they analysed the impact of Mr Berlusconi's most difficult parliamentary performance at the close of his first 100 days in office. The debate showed the opposition had no wish to bring the government down and that, for the time being, there was no alternative to the right-wing coalition. Mr Berlusconi thus has a chance to recover his strength during the summer break and to prepare for what is likely to be a 'hot autumn'. During the four-hour debate, which went on late into the night, Mr Berlusconi made clear his determination to resolve the increasingly problematic conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group. But it was also evident that the problem is so complex that it can be solved neither quickly nor easily. Mr Berlusconi back-tracked on the proposals he made only last Friday to avoid a conflict of interest, declaring himself willing to accept any reasonable solution. This means his idea of a five person commission to monitor the conflict of interest could be scrapped. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, failed to come up with his much-promised counter proposals. However, he said the League would have concrete details soon based on a two-stage separation of Mr Berlusconi from Fininvest. The first step would be to separate him from his proprietary interest, the next to place such interests in a US-style blind trust. The opposition claimed there was no option but to sell Fininvest, especially the commercial television interests. But again no details were provided. Mr Berlusconi himself, while willing to be flexible, still seems to draw the line at selling his stake in a group he created from nothing in 30 years. The conflict of interest was only one aspect of the debate. Mr Berlusconi used the occasion to appeal to his electorate, via live television coverage, reassuring them of the government's stability and that the economic recovery was gathering pace. At another level, the debate proved a predictable contest, with each player laying down markers for battle in the autumn. Mr Bossi showed he will be Mr Berlusconi's most redoubtable opponent and difficult ally. The final words of his speech, which time rules prevented him from saying, were: 'You are free to do what you want, but it must be very clear - this cannot be against the interests of the country.'</p>

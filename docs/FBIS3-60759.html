Mr. Issa Mohamed Siad said the  individuals who always told about the impending civil war after  the foreign troops departure from Somalia were behind the  explosion that occurred at the Mogadishu port. He said the SNA  officials and supporters wished the American troops and others a  safe departure from the country. Elmi Osman Farah, our reporter  who filed this report, also adds that Prof. Mohamed Siad called  on the SNA supporters to be vigilant against such a conspiracy.</p>

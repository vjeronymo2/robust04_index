			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Asda lifts three-year facility to Pounds 300m ASDA, the UK supermarket group, has arranged a Pounds 300m (Dollars 453m) three-year facility to replace a higher-priced multi-option facility first arranged in 1989, as part of an effort to improve its financial position. Following its acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores for Pounds 704m in 1989, the company has been struggling under a mountain of debt. The latest refinancing represents an important stage in Asda's efforts to bring its finances under control. The size of the facility has been increased by Pounds 50m from Pounds 250m, and the maturity is being extended by a year. In addition, the margin over the London interbank offered rate has been cut from around 100 basis points to 85 basis points, reflecting the company's improving financial position. National Westminster Bank and Swiss Bank Corp are the arrangers. The facility was last amended in October 1991 at the time of Asda's rights issue, which has been seen as a turning point in the company's recovery after it had lost its way in the mid-1980s. Asda is also asking the banks to loosen some restrictive covenants. Last month, Asda sold two development sites and one store for Pounds 57m.</p>

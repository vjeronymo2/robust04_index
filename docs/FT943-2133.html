			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Hume asks Clinton to grant trade concessions for Ulster Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said yesterday after meeting Mr Bill Clinton, US president, in Washington that he had asked for a new trade agreement between the US and Northern Ireland. Mr Hume said before talks which included Mr Al Gore, the vice-president: 'I am not just asking for money . . . I have specific interesting proposals to help us with economic regeneration.' The proposals are believed to cover duty-free entry to the US for some goods made in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Irish Republic and new tax arrangements for small businesses to help boost exports. Mr Hume is the first Irish politician to meet the president in Washington since the IRA ceasefire. A party of Ulster Unionist MPs is leaving for the US today while Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, yesterday applied for a visa. Mr Adams is to meet Senate foreign relations committee members next month. Meetings are also likely with House of Representatives' members. Mr Adams said on Channel 4 News last night that Mr John Major had shown by his behaviour over Northern Ireland that he was a 'Tom Fool'. He said Mr Major was 'playing with words' in demanding that the IRA add the word 'permanent' to its ceasefire declaration. George Graham in Washington writes: Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, met Mr Hume yesterday and is to meet unionists today. 'It is very important that Congress and the executive branch be seen as even-handed,' he said. 'My own view is that in the long term it's going to be private-sector investment in Northern Ireland that is the most successful catalyst for peace and stability.' Mr Richard Holbrooke, assistant secretary of state for European affairs, told a congressional sub-committee yesterday that a decision on further aid to Ireland was likely next month.

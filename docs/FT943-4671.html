			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Russia will seek Dollars 4bn more from IMF: Moscow's preparations for the next stage of economic reform The Russian government is to push for a further loan of Dollars 4bn from the International Monetary Fund to support the stabilisation of its economy. It argues that its success in bringing down inflation and curtailing the budget deficit this year entitles it to move to the next stage of reform. This initiative, now being discussed intensively within the government, is planned to be launched at the IMF's Madrid summit next month by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for the economy. They will also ask for a 10-year programme of debt repayments to be agreed with the London and Paris clubs of creditors - a normal consequence of an agreement on a stand-by loan. Government officials and advisers will meet senior IMF officials in Moscow this week in a round of talks aimed at determining Russia's readiness for the next stage of economic reform. 'It's at a critical moment; a breakthrough moment,' said one senior western official concerned with Russian reform. '(The government) must avoid any temptation to go for a quick fix. It must be careful not to fritter away the gains it has made but which could so easily be lost.' The IMF mission will examine the performance of the economy and especially the government's plans for next year's budget - due to be presented to the duma (lower house of parliament) later this month. On the results of that examination will depend the disbursement of the Dollars 4bn, together with other western aid promised but not to be paid until certain criteria are met. The budget outline calls for inflation to be reduced to 5 per cent a month in the middle of next year and to 2.5 per cent a month by the year's end. Duma members, who passed the 1994 budget with a minimum of debate, are unlikely to be as accommodating this time and a bruising encounter is expected. The IMF's main concern is that the government has succeeded in observing the tight guidelines agreed five months ago - after the Fund paid out a Dollars 1.5bn loan - only by cutting necessary expenditure and issuing promissory notes. However, as western officials admit, the Fund and the Group of Seven leading industrial countries face a hard choice between insisting on tighter financial discipline and continuing to support reform, even if it is off track. A senior finance ministry official said yesterday that 'the government has complied with the (IMF) programme, and it is the first time it has done so'. He said that fears of a new explosion of inflation following the extra credits agreed for agriculture and other sectors last month would not be followed by further loosening of financial discipline later this year. Instead, credits would be 'nailed down once more'. There are now some clear signs of improvement in the economy, including figures showing that the service sector has leapt ahead, accounting for a larger share of gross domestic product than industrial output for the first time since the early Soviet period. But mushrooming debts among enterprises and lack of industrial restructuring are causing real worry among both Russian and foreign officials - though Mr Chernomyrdin has promised the issue will not be solved, as it has in the past, by bailing out the nominally bankrupt corporations with more credits.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Lateral lures can pull in people - Looking beyond the basic career requirements of your company is a useful enlistment aid Akio Morita, chairman and founder of Sony, the Japanese electrical giant, was asked some years ago why there had been so much Japanese investment in the UK ahead of its other European partners. He listed a string of attractions: political stability, relatively cheap and trained labour force, good internal communications, English language, telecommunications. Then he paused and said: 'But the real reason was the golf courses.' What goes for Japanese investment also goes for recruitment, yet many advertisers fail to tap into the hidden desires of potential recruits. We might all learn something from the resourceful town councillors of Adaminaby, a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of Australia's New South Wales. Adaminaby's doctor has just retired and the town is having problems finding a new one. Instead of circulating the job in the medical press, Adaminaby has chosen to capitalise on its chief asset. Set just five miles from Lake Eucumbene, Adaminaby is acknowledged as the trout fishing capital of Australia. Hence the letter in this month's Trout and Salmon magazine, published in the UK. Anyone suitably qualified should telephone 010 6164 542351. The town councillors of Adaminaby, whether they know it or not, are engaging in what is termed, in the US, 'lateral recruitment', the sort of idea for which consultants demand very high fees. US computer games manufacturers have been known to search among Hollywood screenwriters for potential candidates, but perhaps the most marked example of this practice in the UK was the advertisement taken out by Chemical Bank in Flight International magazine in April for 'numerate, risk-oriented, confident and highly ambitious professionals' to train as dealers. The theory was that air traffic controllers, used to reacting to movements on screens under pressure, would be good dealers. What the theory did not take into account was that they must be risk averse, not risk takers. While Chemical Bank may have missed the target, it is clear that some recruiters are prepared to cast their net in unusual areas to fill a job. Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the Vermont-based manufacturer of quality ice cream, is seeking a new chief executive for its business which last year notched up Dollars 140m in sales. The search has been prompted by the resignation last month of Ben Cohen, the chief executive who founded the business with Jerry Greenfield in 1978. The manufacturer is known for its quirkily-named flavours, such as Chunky Monkey and Cherry Garcias, and its support for charities and righteous causes. For the first time the company is abandoning its pay policy that has limited executive salaries to no more than seven times the lowest wage, a decision which Cohen, who remains chairman, described as the hardest the board had made. Realistically, the company did not think it would get the highest-calibre people using the old policy. The company has lost none of its novelty. While it has engaged a recruiting firm, the post has also been advertised on Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream tubs with the added incentive that the runner-up in the appointment contest will get a lifetime's supply of ice cream. Applicants are asked to explain in 100 words or less 'Why I would be a great CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'. By last Friday there were 15,250 applications with several thousand more through the letter box over the holiday weekend. One application came on a brass plate mounted on marble, another on a large flat cake and another on parchment script. In spite of the competition, the suspicion is that most applicants are hoping to come second. The lesson from all these approaches is that lateral lures are worth exploring when fishing for people but care must be taken when hauling them in. You're never quite sure what you've hooked. Counting the cost Investment banks are finding a shortage of good-quality back office staff, according to Robert Walters Associates, recruitment consultants. The firm says that towards the end of last year, the trading houses began to require specialists capable of handling sophisticated products, instead of people fulfilling more general roles. The development reflects the need for back-office staff to keep abreast with the ever more complicated and inventive derivatives trading emerging in the market. The sacking earlier this year of Joseph Jett, the Kidder Peabody trader, who allegedly ran trades that led to profits being overstated by Dollars 350m, resulted in an attack of nerves among the securities firms on both sides of the Atlantic anxious to ensure their internal controls were effective. While some have been content to take on newly qualified accountants and train them, others are demanding highly qualified people who understand business processes. Walters says: 'The last time the City was so buoyant the cry was 'get me bodies' but now we are finding that the calibre of people being requested is so much higher and the standard is being maintained.' There are also signs, he says, that some firms are returning to the so-called golden hello or joining fee and guaranteeing an element of bonus. Roberts Walters adds that word of mouth is proving the most effective way of finding candidates. Its own office in Bedford Street resembles a small city dealing room, only the calls are to match people to jobs instead of buyers to sellers. IT shortfall exposed Meanwhile, the speed of technological change is leading to shortages in the information technology industry, according to the Anglo-Dutch CMG Computer Management Group which launched a recruitment drive for 400 staff for its information processing and consultancy business. Colin Osborn, associate director responsible for resource management in the UK, says that at junior levels the computer industry was paying the price for not giving graduates opportunities two years ago. As a result, he says: 'Skills in some areas are almost non existent and so demand for talented people, for example with Oracle skills, is very competitive.' More than half of its UK recruitment was at a junior level, 30 per cent from intermediate level and about 10 per cent at a senior level, mainly in business development, sales and project management. Down and outs The newly launched Institute of Personnel and Development has committed itself to reducing the jargon which has pervaded the profession in recent years. There is much to be done. To give some idea of the mysteries of human resource management, here is a cynic's glossary of personnel terms for managers. Downsizing: getting rid of half your employees. Delayering: getting rid of your promotion prospects. Empowerment: getting rid of your responsibilities. Outsourcing: getting rid of the work. Outplacement: saying goodbye with a smile. Rightsizing: correcting your mistake. Flex Programme: doing other people's jobs Stress management: dealing with those who think they'll be got rid of. There are more but that should suffice for now.</p>

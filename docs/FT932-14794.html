			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: South African bank buys Midlantic for Dollars 15m FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, has paid Dollars 15m to acquire the Hong Kong-based bank Midlantic (Asia). This follows the FNB's recent purchase of Henry Ansbacher Holdings, the UK merchant bank, and its move to set up a branch in Zurich. Mr Barry Swart, FNB managing director, commenting on the Midlantic acquisition, said: 'With increasing trading opportunities between South Africa and Asia, this acquisition forms a key component of FNB's internationalisation strategy.' The primary focus of Midlantic's Asian activities is trade finance. It has an asset base of Dollars 75m, is profitable, and has customers in Hong Kong's main manufacturing and trading industries. FNB says Midlantic's activities will shift more towards South African trade finance than in the past. The deal, which takes immediate effect, was paid for through the financial rand. The name and corporated identity of the Hong Kong bank - previously owned by Midlantic National Bank of Edison, New Jersey - will be changed to reflect the new parentage.</p>

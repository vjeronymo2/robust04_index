			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Monteverdi and Bluebeard - Opera double-bill The ideal opera-house pairing for Bluebeard's Castle is surely more Bartok - one of the ballets, either The Wooden Prince (with which Bluebeard was coupled at its premiere) or The Miraculous Mandarin, which explores similar themes of sexual dependency. For a company like English National Opera without a resident ballet the choice becomes more difficult: Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung, instant box-office death, has been tried in the past, and when David Alden's finely disciplined and severe production of Bluebeard first appeared at the Coliseum two years ago it followed a bilious version of Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex. For the revival Oedipus has mercifully been abandoned, replaced by a Monteverdi confection based upon The Duel of Tancredi and Clorinda, that vivid, unclassifiable theatre piece published in the Eighth Book of Madrigals in 1638. At its performance in Venice 14 years earlier, Tancredi and Clorinda was prefaced by a group of Monteverdi's songs and madrigals, and the same plan is followed at the Coliseum: five numbers, written in the 1620s and '30s and all sung in Anne Ridler's neat, witty translations, have been integrated into a single dramatic package by Alden and his designer Nigel Lowery. One wishes the scheme had worked musically or dramatically, for such an undeniably powerful and enduring vision of Bluebeard's Castle deserves a viable and engaging prologue. The result is anything but viable or engaging; the dramatic treatment of the sequence seems at best negligible and the performances are adequate rather than outstanding. Alden presents a vaguely late 20th-century setting and concocts an equally tenuous ritual involving three singers in which the explicit musical confrontation of Tancredi attempts to crystallise the tensions set up so self-consciously during the madrigal sequence. Paul Nilon, kitted out in some decidedly unbecoming long shorts, is the Tancredi narrator, Christopher Ventris and Patricia Rozario the protagonists; Harry Bicket conducts an on-stage ensemble. While all sang and played decently enough, there was little sense of period style or lyrical intensity or any feeling that there was any dramatic, musical or psychological point to be made, only the need to fill 50 minutes before the main business of the evening. The Bartok at least fulfilled expectations. The production remains a triumph, even though Adam Fischer's handling of the score does not have quite the telling intensity and radiance that Mark Elder brought to it first time around. Sally Burgess and Gwynne Howell repeat their roles; both in their different ways have developed and strengthened them. Howell's Bluebeard is yet more desperate, more impotent; brute power is clearly all that is left within his human shell. Burgess's Judith is obsessively fixed on self-destruction, unable to resist the compulsion to know everything and so dominate her new husband the more completely. The clarity of their singing is exemplary. There is a new narrator, Imogen Claire, who delivers the spoken prologue rather more archly than her predecessor, but then Alden's fussy handling of the fore-play is the only miscalculation in what remains a spell-binding piece of stage craft. London Coliseum; further performances until April 7</p>

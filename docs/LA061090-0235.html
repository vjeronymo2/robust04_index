			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR RACES TO WATCH IN NOVEMBER  </P> <P> County Superintendent of Schools  </P> <P> How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary  </P> <P> Peterson: 43%  </P> <P> Dean: 44%  </P> <P> The combatants: Robert D. Peterson, a 24-year-incumbent, takes on Whittier  College Prof. John F. Dean and Peterson will tout his experience and longtime  support of academic competition. . . . It's Peterson's toughest battle in two  decades, and support for him among district superintendents is soft. . . . "I  don't know very many superintendents who would support Bob Peterson's candidacy  for another term," says one.  </P> <P> The job: Supervises special education programs and services to local districts.  . . . Pays relatively well -- at $98,633 a year, it's one of the top  public-education posts in California.  </P> <P> Hot issue: Dean would abolish the ejected superintendent's post and replace it  with an appointed one. . . . That's not popular with county voters. They've  rejected it twice.  </P> <P> Early outlook: Peterson holds the fund-raising edge and says he'll spend  whatever it takes. . . . Dean will batter Peterson with grand jury reports  criticizing his department's management. Look for this race to get dirty early.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Supervisor, District 2  </P> <P> How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary  </P> <P> Neugebauer: 20%  </P> <P> Wieder: 47%  </P> <P> </P> <P> The combatants: Three-term Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder faces Joy L.  Neugebauer, 18-year veteran of the Westminster City Council. . . . Not since  1980 has a supervisor been dumped from the post, and the loser in that contest  was under indictment. . . . Wieder has her own troubles: She blew a race for  Congress two years ago after discovery that she lied about earning a college  degree.  </P> <P> Hot issue: Wieder. She says she has paid her dues for lying about her degree,  but the issue lingers. Neugebauer promises not to dwell on it, but predicts it  will "stay with Harriett."  </P> <P> Key strategy question: Money. Who can raise it fastest and spend it best?  Advantage Wieder, but her congressional campaign left her tapped out with many  sources. . . . She may find the going rough.  </P> <P> Early outlook: Neugebauer will run a grass-roots effort to save money, but if  Wieder can raise what it takes to launch an effective ad blitz, Neugebauer  could be in trouble.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voter Turnout  </P> <P> November balloting  </P> <P> 1982: 65%  </P> <P> 1984: 78%  </P> <P> 1986: 60%  </P> <P> 1988: 77%  </P> <P> 1990:  </P> <P> June balloting  </P> <P> 1982: 46%  </P> <P> 1984: 50%  </P> <P> 1986: 38%  </P> <P> 1988: 49%  </P> <P> 1990: 39%  </P> <P> November's Ballot  </P> <P> In addition to county races, voters will consider a slew of city candidates and  could decide several controversial spending measures. Among them:  </P> <P> Half-cent sales tax for transportation  </P> <P> General obligation bond for court construction  </P> <P> General obligation bond for open-space acquisition  </P> <P> General obligation bond for jail construction  </P> <P> Separately, those proposals are considered popular; together, they represent a  billion-dollar wish list that would boost taxpayer bills significantly . . . If  they all make it on the ballot, betting says voters would revolt and reject the  lot. . . . Look for their proponents to elbow for position between now and  August, when the supervisors finalize the November ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District Attorney  </P> <P> How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary  </P> <P> Enright: 29%  </P> <P> Capizzi: 41%  </P> <P> The combatants: It's an in-office duel, as Michael R. Capizzi, appointed  district attorney in January, takes on the office's chief deputy, James G.  Enright. . . . The campaign tests office loyalties. . . . Capizzi counts most  of the staff in his corner, but the primary contestants have rallied to  Enright.  </P> <P> The job: County's chief prosecutor with 184 lawyers, $34 million and nearly 700  staffers at his disposal. Pays $110,781, with a raise due in July.  </P> <P> Hot issues: Enright will portray Capizzi as the "politicians' " choice, since  Capizzi was appointed by the supervisors. . . . Capizzi will lay lower, and  will try to ignore Enright altogether.  </P> <P> Early outlook: Armed with money, endorsements and incumbency, Capizzi will be  difficult to beat. . . . Enright needs to get his name out, hard to do without  big contributions. . . . Capizzi is the early favorite.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 72nd Assembly District  </P> <P> Umberg defeated Jerry Yudelson 64% to 35% in the Democratic primary.  </P> <P> Pringle was unopposed.  </P> <P> The combatants: Backed by state heavyweights from both parties, it's rookie  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) versus Democrat and ex-federal  prosecutor Tom Umberg, both vying for the $40,816-a-year job. . . . The  battlefield's a great equalizer. . . . Predominantly Democratic, it votes  Republican. . . . Prickly turf for any incumbent.  </P> <P> Hot issues: Pringle, a 22-year resident of Garden Grove, hopes to tag Umberg as  a carpetbagger for recently moving into the district. . . . But the big issue  is crime. As the one who sent bad guys to jail, Umberg argues he's the best  crime fighter.  </P> <P> Weaknesses: A messy primary split Democrats into feuding camps -- a problem for  Umberg. . . . Pringle is collared with a controversial 1988 decision to put  guards at polling places on Election Day.  </P> <P> Wild card: In this close race, Latinos could tip the scales. . . . Despite  large numbers, turnout has been notoriously low. . . . Armed with a recent  $150,000 court settlement, Latino groups plan a massive registration drive.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pekka Kostamo report: "Austrian `Yes' Strengthens the </F> Front"]    [Text] Austria's massive yes to the EU [European Union]  strengthens the pro-EU position in all three other candidate  countries. This delighted comment came from Foreign Trade  Minister Pertti Salolainen (Conservative Party) on Monday [11  June] as he learned about the outcome of the Austrian referendum.    Salolainen was convinced that the Austrian result will have  a  positive impact at least on the undecided members of the Finnish  parliament and on other citizens. The Austrians have, in fact,  fought the same kind of battle as the Finns over billions in  subsidies.    A negative result in Austria would have been, according to  Salolainen, a "dreadful shock."    "The referendum result has once again made a mockery of the  opinion polls," Salolainen added joyfully. The referendum in  Austria also accelerates the forthcoming disintegration of the  EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EEA [European  Economic Area] base. Austria's decision to join the EU breaks  up the base of mutual arrangements between the EFTA countries.</p>

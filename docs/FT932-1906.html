			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / CBI urges job advice 'credits' THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a new system of 'credits' for careers guidance. It said such a system would allow individuals in England and Wales to 'buy' guidance from Training and Enterprise Councils. Tecs in turn would have to apply to the government for funding to provide careers guidance. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said credits 'will encourage a true market in advice, raising standards across the country'. He also called for a system of minimum entitlements which would give women returning to work, redundant workers, the long-term unemployed and ex-offenders access to careers guidance. The report also includes a call for improved quality, to be nurtured by the creation of an advisory National Council for Careers Guidance to set national standards, and for improved training of careers practitioners. It says that fewer than one-third of careers teachers in schools have professional qualifications. This puts the UK behind other countries.

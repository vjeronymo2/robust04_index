			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: Magisterial but not infallible / Review of a major new work on China's history which will appeal to the general reader CHINA: A NEW HISTORY by John King Fairbank Harvard Pounds 22.25, 510 pages IN WHAT was possibly the most dramatic episode in the life of a gentleman scholar, John King Fairbank, doyen of American China-experts, delivered the manuscript of this history to his Harvard publishers on a September morning last year, and that afternoon died of a heart attack. The only unfinished section of the text was, uncharacteristically, the acknowledgements. The book is a suitable swan song, probably the best and certainly the most magisterial survey of China's history. It spans the Chinese saga from 200,000 years ago when Peking Man, the hunter/fisher/gatherer and probable cannibal, flourished in caverns a few miles southwest of a contemporary mausoleum housing the mummified remains of Mao Zedong, a much more deadly predator. Fairbank's book comfortably deals with the huge distances of time and space, knitting the development of Chinese society (or rather of Chinese culture) together with the repetitive patterns picked out with great intelligence and urbanity. However, this is a work for the general reader and, as such, is largely a summary of Fairbank's life work and a survey of the current state of establishment Chinese scholarship in general. It adds little, apart from the intelligent commentary and perspective he provides, to what those already interested will know. Fairbank rehearses the social and cultural explanations of what makes up the special 'different' characteristics of the Chinese people. The transplanting of rice 'certainly the greatest expenditure of muscular energy in the world' in a country where land is economically more valuable than labour sets up a 'vicious interdependence' which creates hostility to machines and labour-saving invention, as well as inspiring filial respect in sons awaiting their inheritance. He contrasts the 'culturalism' of the Chinese - a nationalism born of a unified identity defined by the surrounding hordes of Inner Asian 'barbarians' - with European nationalism born of contact with other nation states. The Confucian and neo-Confucian hierarchical social structures are likewise seen as admirable, indeed enviable, reflections of history and an innate culture. All such 'approaches to understanding China's history' are within the great tradition of western Sinology, where the academic who understands and empathises with Chinese civilisation feels himself duty-bound to communicate his special expertise and adjure the ignorant to make due allowances in dealing with and judging China; this process tends to be a one-way flow. Such attitudes have shaped generations of Orientalists who have reached high positions within the US State Department. Even President George Bush's short posting to Peking was sufficient to persuade him that he has special insights, leading to his insistence that the Tienanmen massacre and subsequent violations of human rights should not deny China most-favoured nation status in trade. The same attitudes are rife among the Orientalist mandarins of Britain's Foreign Office (Sir Percy Cradock, for example, who persuaded John Major not to annoy Peking by receiving the Dalai Lama). Hong Kong's retiring governor, Lord Wilson, left the colony angrily denying that his qualifications had predisposed him to 'kow tow' ('dreadful word]') to the Dragon Throne. The Fairbank school helped inspire an academic backlash of revisionists unwilling to swallow the China apologists' arguments. These were frequently exploited by the leaders of such authoritarian states as China itself, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as a rationale for dictatorship and human rights violations ('You do not understand; we Chinese have no democratic traditions'). Much the same has been happening in the field of Japanology, in which modern scholars are increasingly unwilling to explain away single-minded protectionism and market domination in terms of a cultural tendency to seek consensus. But the names of such brilliant 'revisionists' as Simon Leys are not to be found among Fairbank's acknowledgements or suggested reading. In spite of Fairbank's urbane mastery of the subject, his book betrays a nervous defensiveness. 'US citizens who feel inclined to bash China's dictatorship,' he writes gratuitously, 'may usefully recall their nation's difficulties in the exercise of freedom and power.' Even more gratuitously, he goes on to recall the Kennedy assassination, Nixon's dishonesty and a recent Hollywood product who 'lived a fantasy life, lying to himself and the public to make us feel good', which presumably helps to put into perspective Mao's killing of 'millions and millions of Chinese' and Deng Xiaoping's dispatch of the tanks into Tiananmen. Anyway, US shortcomings, in Fairbank's view, explain the reluctance of the old men in Peking to have China flooded with pop culture and invalidates 'the appropriateness of the American model for China's modern transformation.' So it does, but two wrongs hardly make a right. Only at one point does Fairbank admit misjudgment, which occured a forgivable number of years ago. He ascribes the lack of any serious discussion of the practice of foot-binding by the social historians of China to an 'occupational quirk of sinologists, a secondary patriotism or sinophilia that may lead otherwise hard-headed scholars to want to say no evil of the object of their researches.' This breath-taking admission is footnoted with a confession which is even more damaging in its implications: 'For an outstanding example of sentimental sinophilia see my statement in Foreign Affairs, October 1972, that to a certain extent the Maoist revolution was the best thing that had happened to the Chinese people in many centuries.' So much for the balanced search for objective truth which academics would have us believe inspires their researches. At least when journalists get things wrong no one accords them the infallibility with which Fairbank was credited by so many of his students.</p>

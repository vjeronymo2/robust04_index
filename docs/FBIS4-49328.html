			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 3 May (XINHUA)--That the political and  economic ad hoc groups of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC]  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Preparatory  Committee have met for the first time in Hong Kong has become a  topic of common concern among the Hong Kong people. The XINHUA  News Agency Hong Kong branch invited approximately 500 public  figures to attend a function tonight to extend a warm welcome to  the PWC Vice Chairman Lu Ping and other mainland China PWC  members who have made a special trip to Hong Kong to attend the  ad hoc group meetings.    Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, addressed  the reception, which was held on the 50th floor of the China  Resources Building. He said that these ad hoc meetings have  important significance. PWC members will take this opportunity  to meet public figures from all walks of life in the Hong Kong  community as well as the local people and will discuss with them  matters of vital importance concerning Hong Kong's steady  transition, stability, and prosperity. Zhou Nan stressed that  the meetings seek to improve communication with all sectors of  the Hong Kong community, to meet with grass-roots  representatives from all social strata and geographic areas, and  to widely solicit opinions on issues related to the preparations  for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.    Zhou Nan said: In order to preserve long-term stability and  prosperity in Hong Kong, one must closely rely on the vast  number of Hong Kong people who love this country and Hong Kong,  as well as on other members of the local public. One must do a  solid job in preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong  SAR in all areas. To this end, he and all other PWC members  alike sincerely and eagerly hope that Hong Kong people from all  walks of life will show concern for and play a part in this task  and will contribute and pool together their wisdom, talents, and  efforts, thus making new contributions to achieving a smooth  transition and to preserving Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity.    Henry Fok, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference National Committee, was present at  today's reception.</p>

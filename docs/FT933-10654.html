			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: Alternatively. . . Sir, It was exciting to read (Technology: 'The little engine that could', July 29) that Mazda is to build cars with an engine which emits 600kg less carbon dioxide in a year, equivalent to planting 100 trees. Wouldn't it be easier, and even more environmentally sound, just to plant the trees? 22 Franklin Street, Reading RG1 7YA</p>

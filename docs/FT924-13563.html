			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Quayle denies US spending closed plants VICE-PRESIDENT Dan Quayle has denied that US foreign aid funds, intended to promote private investment in developing countries, have instead encouraged the closure of US plants and their relocation to Caribbean basin countries. The charge, in a study by the New York-based National Labour Committee Education Fund, has been picked up in recent campaign speeches by Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate in the US, who has accused the administration of shipping jobs out of the country. In the vice-presidential candidates' televised debate on Tuesday night, Mr Quayle denied that the US had ever 'subsidised any company to move to Latin America.' The allegations concern Dollars 1.3bn of funding by the US Agency for International Development (AID), released under the terms of President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, which gave countries in the region almost total access to the US market. Voters watching the most popular US television news show, CBS's Sixty Minutes, last month saw US officials (recorded by hidden cameras) promote the Caribbean basin for factory sites and even promise that a local blacklist would guarantee no union organisation. Mr Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labour Committee, had set up a dummy US company for the Sixty Minutes news team. He said a partial survey of the US clothing industry found 30 US manufacturers with plants in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as 68 others using factories in those countries as sources. Since 1990, the same companies closed 58 plants in the US, leaving more than 12,000 US workers jobless. Since 1983, AID has spent Dollars 289m funding Central American and Caribbean investment and export promotion organisations. It has denied subsidising any plant removals, although it has paid for advertising and promotion which led to them.</p>

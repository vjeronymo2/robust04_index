			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Markets: EMU is still alive - Economic Eye The emotion and heat of the Maastricht ratification process has faded. Many politicians and market participants alike have written off Economic and Monetary Union. That judgment may be too hasty. Financial markets - liberalised by the Single European Market - have already created such convergence of long-term interest rates among a core group of EU members that no trend divergence in exchange rates is discounted: a de facto EMU of the few. A wave of elections will roll across Europe in the next two years. The newly elected governments will have to strike a delicate balance between their political ambitions for further integration and economic constraints. When the next Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) starts in 1996 there will be a formal constraint on them: will the Maastricht criteria to permit the start of EMU be satisfied? The criteria were explicitly designed to promote price stability but there was an implicit strategic purpose: to minimise the risk that financial instability could spill over into the political arena. Yet the opposite has happened. Policy and financial markets have become increasingly entwined. In 1992-93, financial markets - liberalised by the single market - demonstrated their power to discipline policy by shifting capital, prompting the upheavals in the ERM. However, recognising the apparent contradiction of increasing their own exposure to mobile capital, policy makers are, reluctantly, accepting the importance of markets by emphasising that economic stability includes low long-term interest rates. They should complete the U-turn and recognise the significance of two clear messages from the financial markets: The remarkable convergence of long-term interest rates in some EU members since the ERM collapse implies that monetary union would run with the grain of markets. Nominal bond yields, that were recently close to post-war lows in many countries, imply that the purchasers of government debt do not feel that public deficits are excessive amid deep recession and with inflation heading for 30-year lows. As the 1996 IGC assembles, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institution (EMI) will examine compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria, which cover four main factors: inflation, long-term interest rates, exchange rates and public finances. Inflation prospects suggest 10 states should pass that test. The same states had met the interest rate criterion before the February collapse in bond markets. The ERM test - respect the 'normal fluctuation margins for two years' - has a different quality now that the margins appear likely to remain at 15 per cent. The ERM criterion will become a simple test of whether exchange rate fluctuations have been minimal. As these criteria seem likely to be met, the state of public finance will be the key. The judgment required that 'The Council shall . . . decide after an overall assessment whether an excessive deficit exists'  - will be highly political. That decision may be foreshadowed by the review, later this year, of the member states' convergence programmes: will their 'planned deficits' for 1996 be acceptable? That is the test where the reality of the market should intrude. If the capital flows of 1992-93 are any guide, the market will discipline states for whom EMU is unrealistic. Those states that are genuinely convergent will be presented with a de facto EMU. The political judges should toughen the standard applied to long-term interest rates - both to absolute levels and convergence - when deciding whether a deficit is excessive. Both tests would reinforce the role of the market's judgment on whether a budget deficit above 3 per cent is genuinely excessive in the sense that it threatens stability. It is bond holders that will pay the penalty most rapidly if the judgment turns out to be wrong. That is why the market will react so powerfully. Such an approach could help to depoliticise the most crucial judgment in the decision to move to Stage Three of EMU, which would involve locking exchange rates together as a prelude to a single currency. EMU is unlikely to get star billing on the political agenda until well into next year - at least until the German parliamentary, and probably French presidential, elections are out of the way. And they are not the only elections: in the next two years nearly 70 per cent of EU electors will go to the polls. So most of the politicians who sit down at the 1996 IGC will have a fresh democratic mandate. The electoral cycle may mesh with a recovery in the economic 'feel-good' factor (see chart). Historically, an upswing in Europe's economy has raised political spirits - spurring another leap forward in integration. On the EEC's 25th birthday in 1982 when 'Eurosclerosis' feeling was at its most virulent - the Community was regarded as politically dead. Yet political vision was restored as early as December 1982 when the heads of government accepted the concept of the Single European Market - opening the way to an irreversible liberalisation of Europe's markets. 1996 could prove to be another momentous year. An EU already enlarged by the accession of several Efta members will be acutely aware of the need to reform its system of political institutions. Germany is likely to push for the goal of political union, perhaps stimulated by unease over developments in Russia. A touchstone of the commitment to deeper co-operation will be the willingness to honour existing agreements - just when economic convergence under the Maastricht timetable is being examined. The governments which the financial markets have already pushed into de facto EMU should be able to avoid an excessively legalistic interpretation of the criteria. As economies improve there will be a powerful incentive for states on the borderline of participation to redouble their efforts to join. Those in power at the time may feel the issue should be postponed despite the risk to the members of the core group that an external shock could trigger a tidal wave of capital flows. Investors should reckon on a significant probability that EMU is alive and will kick into operation this century - and not exclude the possibility that it could start on schedule in 1997.

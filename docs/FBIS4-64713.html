Our ideals are not up  for sale and this is why we want a political ministry and not  only an economic one. We shall be the guarantee; if the  government were to threaten democracy, it would not last two  seconds."

The League leader also attacked the prime minister-designate:  "He thinks the state is a company he can raid."</p>

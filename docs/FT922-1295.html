			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Observer: Smart choice Big Italian companies have a habit of hiring ex-diplomats. Even so, there is some surprise at the speed with which Ferruzzi/Montedison, Italy's chemicals and foodstuffs conglomerate, has grabbed Giandomenico Picco, the UN hostage negotiator. The 44-year-old Picco, who is stepping down as under-secretary general, has made a name for himself as an expert behind-the-scenes negotiator. He played a central role in obtaining in great secret the release of hostages from Lebanon, and indeed the news of his switch to Ferruzzi comes precisely when the last remaining western hostages, two Germans, have been freed. Picco is expected to be based primarily in New York and help beef up the group's US profile which declined when the flamboyant Raul Gardini was running Ferruzzi. Interesting to see whether he makes as big a mark in the private sector as he did in the public sector.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE COSTLY  </P> <P> This is the week of holiday parties, and the holiday cheer brings with it  questions of legal risks and liabilities. Two quickly come to mind: liability  for furnishing alcoholic beverages and sexual harassment.  </P> <P> In the 1970s, a series of California court cases created new law by imposing  liability on social hosts who served alcoholic beverages to their guests. If  the guest left the party intoxicated and subsequently injured someone in an  automobile accident, the host could be sued for his negligence.  </P> <P> Those cases were overturned in a 1978 statute that expressly says, "no social  host who furnishes alcoholic beverages to any person shall be held legally  accountable for damages suffered by such person or for injury . . . or death of  any third person resulting from the consumption of such beverages."  </P> <P> In the years since, there have been various court cases interpreting the  statute, but by and large, it still essentially stands intact, so that legal  risk for a party host who serves alcoholic beverages is relatively minimal. The  same cannot be said for possible cases of sexual harassment.  </P> <P> In a recent newsletter, the Century City law firm of Goldstein &amp; Kennedy,  which specializes in representing management in labor matters, reminded its  clients that the perils of sexual harassment loom large during holiday  festivities.  </P> <P> "Simple acts such as hugging, close dancing, kissing under the mistletoe, and  other forms of affection . . . can be construed as sexual harassment," the firm  warned.  </P> <P> Sexual harassment "is one of the most serious problems that females face in the  work force," says Charles H. Goldstein, the firm's senior partner and the  narrator of a videotape called "How to Prevent Sexual Harassment Lawsuits,"  which is sold to businesses for $79.95.  </P> <P> What is sexual harassment? First, it is unwelcome sexual advances or physical  or verbal conduct of a sexual nature. Second, the conduct must be tied to an  employment decision, such as hiring or promotion, or it must unreasonably  interfere with work performance or create a hostile work environment.  </P> <P> Even off-color jokes can constitute legal sexual harassment. If you're not sure  whether it's a joke that should stay in the locker room, Goldstein has an easy  test: Is it a joke you would not be embarrassed to tell in a courtroom to a  judge and jury, with your spouse and family sitting in the audience? It it  doesn't pass that test, don't tell the joke, he says.  </P> <P> If you feel you are a victim of sexual harassment, you should report it to a  key company executive, perhaps even in writing, Goldstein advises.  </P> <P> "Don't ever just give in, in silence. Get to somebody in the organization who  will investigate." If the company is not responsive, then file a complaint with  the state Fair Employment and Housing Department, or the federal Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, he adds.  </P> <P> Goldstein advises his clients to have a clear policy that defines sexual  harassment, how cases will be investigated and what penalties will be imposed  on violators. Complaints should be reported to a neutral person, and both a man  and woman should be available. Never take a "boys will be boys attitude" toward  sexual harassment, he advises in his videotape.  </P> <P> There is substantial potential legal liability for the organization and the  individual who allows or joins in sexual harassment -- legal fees, damages for  pain and suffering and lost wages, punitive damages, as well as loss of  employee productivity and morale. A sexual harasser, not just the employer, can  be personally liable for these damages.  </P> <P> These legal risks simply reinforce common sense: Don't allow the festivities of  the holiday to get out of hand.  </P></p>

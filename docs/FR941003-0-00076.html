A 505(b)(2) applicant shall send the notification to the appropriate division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research reviewing the application. A patent owner or its representative may also notify FDA of the filing of any legal action for patent infringement. The notice should contain the information and be sent to the offices or divisions described in this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the patent owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee waives its opportunity to file a legal action for patent infringement within 45 days of a receipt of the notice of certification and the patent owner or approved application holder who is an exclusive patent licensee submits to FDA a valid waiver before the 45 days elapse, approval of the abbreviated new drug application or the 505(b)(2) application will be made effective upon completion of the agency's review and approval of the application. FDA will only accept a waiver in the following form: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Name of patent owner or exclusive patent licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) has received notice from ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> name of applicant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) under ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> section 505(b)(3) or 505(j)(2)(B) of the act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) and does not intend to file an action for patent infringement against ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> name of applicant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) concerning the drug ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> name of drug <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) before ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> date on which 45 days elapses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Name of patent owner or exclusive patent licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) waives the opportunity provided by ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> section 505(c)(3)(C) or 505(j)(B)(iii) of the act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) and does not object to FDA's approval of ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> name of applicant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> )'s ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 505(b)(2) or abbreviated new drug application <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) for ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> name of drug <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) with an immediate effective date on or after the date of this letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;314.108  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> New drug product exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Active moiety  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approved under section 505(b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means an application submitted under section 505(b) and approved on or after October 10, 1962, or an application that was ``deemed approved'' under section 107(c)(2) of Pub. L. 87&hyph;781.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clinical investigation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means any experiment other than a bioavailability study in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used on, human subjects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conducted or sponsored by the applicant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> with regard to an investigation means that before or during the investigation, the applicant was named in Form FDA&hyph;1571 filed with FDA as the sponsor of the investigational new drug application under which the investigation was conducted, or the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest, provided substantial support for the investigation. To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study or provide an explanation why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to a clinical investigation after it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of approval  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the date on the letter from FDA stating that the new drug application is approved, whether or not final printed labeling or other materials must yet be submitted as long as approval of such labeling or materials is not expressly required. ``Date of approval'' refers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval that may become effective at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Essential to approval  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means, with regard to an investigation, that there are no other data available that could support approval of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the Food and Drug Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New chemical entity  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New clinical investigation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an investigation in humans the results of which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effectiveness or safety in a new patient population of a previously approved drug product. For purposes of this section, data from a clinical investigation previously submitted for use in the comprehensive evaluation of the safety of a drug product but not to support the effectiveness of the drug product would be considered new.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: This marigold madness - Gardening / Robin Lane Fox is annoyed by riotous roundabouts and municipal hummocks Bank holiday Britain is blooming. The roundabouts are a riot of marigolds and heritage cities are screened behind hanging baskets as cascades of harsh carmine petunias compete in mid-air with the country's best Georgian architecture. But why do we not rebel and demand that this municipal madness stop? Such profligacy bears no relation to the thoughtful art to which knowledgeable gardeners aspire. It is a style that belongs with the toytown mentality. Townspeople are apparently supposed to take pride in all this - but most of them are too bewildered to have a view. They are used to it by now and think that it must be approved. Basket 'gardening' has spilt on to the streets in a style which belongs with that ultimate British phoney, the British pub. The Britain In Bloom Board goes solemnly round our townscapes, giving prizes to those which have done more than anyone else. The prizes are then pasted on to signposts in order to legitimise the local council tax. Meanwhile, great gardeners have written, planned and laboured to prove that there is so much more to the art than lines of fibrous rooted begonias. More than a century ago, William Robinson asked the right question: if this is the result which gardeners want, why not paint the ground instead? Yet, I have watched while historic Oxford has been dug up near its centre and re-laid in hummocks. We need to pay for these hummocks because begonias can be displayed better at a tilt to the ground: they stare at us full-frontally, elevated on the local rates. The maintenance of bedding plants requires three to four times as much labour as perennials. I want a council to kill my rats, empty my rubbish and pass on the cheques to the people who teach our children. I do not want them to plaster the roads with marigolds when the rest of us are trying to raise our sights beyond them. If you are annoyed already, be warned that it will soon be worse. I have just penetrated the breeding grounds, the base camps from which the wholesalers push pre-germinated seedlings at council departments: they might as well be selling pots of vibrant paint. For centuries, the dianthus was a sweet-scented pink, fringed or laced with elegant colours. In time for the millennium, the breeders have made it go mad: they have levelled its height, enlarged its flowers, and selected the colours which glow. In 1991 and 1992, they won Fleuro Select Medals for their awful offspring. Next year, Dianthus Strawberry Parfait and Raspberry Parfait will be blinking like cats eyes on every road junction. Petunias have been driven insane too: the breeders call them Petunia Frenzy Blue Veins and they are now making Busy Lizzie Hyperactive - her flowers are the size of the old half crown. Snapdragons have shrunk to the dwarf Chimes module and gentle old families have been invaded by the mania for peaches and cream. What counts is impact, accent, dazzle, bred like the fruit in a supermarket to be level, monotonous and 'tiny-garden size'. I am not being negative, let alone elitist. There have been good alternatives, beautifully advanced by amateurs during the years in which the municipals have gone mad at our expense. In the 1980s, the Royal Parks, under Ashley Stephenson, delighted the Chelsea Show with soft colours and half-hardy plantings for bedding. The new style of planting in pots has been the star turn of private gardeners and its artistry could so easily be put in place of local authorities' unsolicited visual rape. How can we stop it? I see little point in appealing to Europe because French, Italian and German bedding are even worse. We cannot send for the Americans because it is their breeders who have produced most of the monsters, conforming to their national taste for big and bright. I therefore propose a project to kill off the salvias, shrivel the marigolds and return peace and quiet to our over-heated cities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan's widening trade  deficit with Europe has caused grave concern that the economy  has hit a bottleneck.    Statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show  that Taiwan posted a US$760 million trade deficit with Europe in  the first four months of the year. The figure not only  represented a huge 300-fold increase over the US$2.5 million  deficit registered in the same period a year ago, it also  exceeded the US$677 million deficit posted last year as a whole.    Together with the US$4.96 billion and US$348.5 million  deficits contracted with Japan and South Korea, the trade  imbalance with those three regions amounted to more than US$6  billion, nearly offsetting Taiwan's surplus with Hong Kong  during the four-month period.    As Europe is Taiwan's third-biggest trade partner after Asia  and North America, the mounting deficit with the region has  become a thorny issue for the government, almost on a par with  the long-standing trade gap with Japan.    Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Europe hit a record high  of US$26.4 billion last year, but that figure represented a  minimal growth rate over 1992, ministry officials said. They  said trade with Europe may continue to stagnate as Taiwan  increases its focus on doing business in the burgeoning mainland  Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.    Taiwan's trade with Europe began to decline in 1992, when  the  trade surplus with European countries fell dramatically to  US$1.48 billion from US$4.03 billion in 1991. European-bound  exports have continued to decline since.    If the downward trend continues, Taiwan's trade deficit with  Europe may hit a new high of US$2.3 billion for the year.    Although officials attributed Taiwan [words indistinct]  widening gap is also a signal that local industries have not  made sufficient adjustments in the face of the unification of  European markets.    In order to keep the nation's entire foreign trade surplus  from being eaten up by the deficit with Europe, ministry  officials called on the government to examine and adjust its  current economic policies and export strategies with Europe in  order to help the nation avoid further foreign trade and  economic losses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Indios rebellion leader `Commander' Marcos, </F> by Raffaele Crocco at San Cristobal; date not given: "Commander  Marcos: `We Will Not Stop Before Mexico City'" -- first  paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] San Cristobal -- Like all officers of the Zapatist  Revolutionary Army [name as published], his face is covered by a  black ski mask and his identity concealed by a nom de guerre.  But for "Commander Marcos" -- the leader of the guerrillas who  have occupied San Cristobal de las Casas and who are now keeping  the army busy on the road to Ocosingo -- these seem to be the  only elements of anonymity. Tall -- taller than the Indians who  form his army -- and with pale skin betraying his Hispanic,  non-Indian origins, he does not evade questions. He spent the  entire day of the occupation explaining to people the reasons  for the struggle. "In any case," he said, "for us war is a  political act, not a military one. We must depend on everyone's  support."    [Crocco] Why have you come out into the open only now, by  declaring war on the Federal Government?    [Marcos] Look, when we opted for armed struggle we decided  to  prepare ourselves properly. The Zapatist army was formed 10  years ago, and before that we tried other forms of political  intervention which all failed. We are an army, not a guerrilla  group. We are not interested in attacks, looting, and  kidnapping: We are at war and we need our people.    [Crocco] What support do you have?    [Marcos] In the Southeast our support is mostly among the  Indians. In other areas it is the peasants.    [Crocco] What is your objective?    [Marcos] To create a real democracy in Mexico. With this  precondition, we could tackle specific problems such as a better  distribution of wealth, observance of the Indians' rights, and a  reform of the health and education systems. We believe that our  country's main problem is the federal government, which is the  result of an electoral fraud. The people do not feel that they  are represented.    [Crocco] Who do you support in the government contest?    [Marcos] Nobody. We say that Salinas de Gortari must go, but  we are not proposing anyone to replace him. We are demanding  the establishment of a provisional government that will bring  Mexico to the first free and democratic elections in its  history. Then victory may be gained even by a party that we do  not like, but it will have been chosen by the people. I want  this to be clear: We do not represent any ideology. The  Zapatist army stemmed from a group of people who wanted, and  still want, more social justice.    [Crocco] But does the decision to take up arms not hinder  the  achievement of the democratic process?    [Marcos] Do you know how many people die in Chiapas every  year? Some 15,000, killed by malnutrition and the lack of  medicines to treat diarrhea and cholera. It is worse than the  war in El Salvador. They are all Indians. NAFTA will make  things worse and will cause the death of the Indians. Legal  methods have failed. Now these people are demanding to live.    [Crocco] What kind of response do you expect from Salinas?    [Marcos] He will issue a tough response, as always. But  there are over a million Indians in Chiapas. They cannot kill  us all, and they will never know who is with us and who is not.    [Crocco] Do you enjoy any international backing?    [Marcos] This is our own, Mexican struggle. We do not  receive help from abroad, from other nations. We have support  from within: In the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, and  Veracruz people have already adhered to our declaration of war.    [Crocco] What will you do at the military level?    [Marcos] We will attack the army, avoiding as long as  possible confrontations involving the civilian population. We  will try to grant the military no respite.    [Crocco] When will this revolution end?    [Marcos] I do not know when; I only know how -- with the  occupation of Mexico City.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Socialist leader urges new left-wing party THE BREAK and realignment of Italy's traditional political parties was taken a step further yesterday by the appeal from Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, the Socialist leader, to create a new left-wing party with a fresh symbol. In a special meeting of the party leadership, Mr Benvenuto said he would resign if his proposals were not accepted. Mr Benvenuto was brought in to head the 100-year-old Socialist party as a compromise candidate when Mr Bettino Craxi was forced to resign in February after being involved in corruption scandals. The proposal to reshape the party and shake off the publicly discredited image accumulated by years of abuse of power follows similar proposals from Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader. The former Italian Communist party changed its name to the Party of the Democratic Left two years ago. Mr Benvenuto has felt obliged to act hurriedly after the wave of protest directed against the party following the majority decision in parliament to block last week four requests by Milan magistrates to waive Mr Craxi's immunity to face corruption charges. In the wake of this decision a number of prominent party members including Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, a former environment minister, announced they were resigning. Indeed, since the onset of the corruption scandals last year, the party has suffered a steady loss of members both at the top and among the grass roots. The latter has been of particular concern as the party draws up lists for municipal elections in June. Officials from a number of big cities have warned that the party, which won 14 per cent of the national vote last year, risks being wiped out unless it changes its name and symbol. Yesterday Mr Benvenuto called for a constituent assembly in June and demanded all those in the party under investigation for corruption (over 60) should step down. He also insisted the party in parliament approve immunity to be waived in all cases where members were involved in demands by magistrates to investigate corruption. Of his broader aim he said: 'The object is to form as soon as possible - in other words, before the next general elections - a new socialist grouping within a broad realignment of the left which can present itself to run the country.'</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: No number for a No vote Sir, I object in the strongest possible terms to your cunningly and contrived front page picture (February 3) regarding the launch of a telephone poll on the Maastricht treaty. The fact that we can only read the Yes vote telephone number makes it impossible to register a No vote. You are not usually so biased.

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark loses a little shine THE D-MARK yesterday lost some of the strength it had built up against European currencies in recent days, but there were some signs of gathering tension within the exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The peseta, which came under strong selling pressure against the D-Mark at the start of the week, was looking comfortable by yesterday's close. Once again, the Bank of Spain intervened in the market to support its currency, holding it to a close of Pta71.93 against the D-Mark from a previous Pta71.94. The D-Mark lost some shine against the dollar, partly helped by expectations of a high figure for fourth quarter GDP in the US today. The dollar closed at DM1.6345 up from a previous DM1.6195. Even sterling and the lira managed to shake off the gloom of recent days. The lira closed at L964.9 against the D-Mark from a previous L985.0, helped by a victory for Mr Amato, the Italian prime minister, in a crucial confidence vote in the Italian parliament. Sterling also closed up a pfennig at DM2.3375. The immediate outlook for most currencies depends on whether Germany cuts interest rates again. The French authorities appeared to be under a little more pressure yesterday, with the 3-month French franc interest rate rising to 12 1/16 per cent as the currency came close to dipping below FFr3.40. The franc also closed slightly weaker on its divergence indicator in the European Monetary System, to -41 per cent. Several UK economists take the view that the prospect of lower German inflation and the deepening recession will allow the Bundesbank to cut interest rates very soon. Ms Jane Edwards, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, believes the Bundesbank will ease aggressively from the spring. She told a conference in London yesterday that German call money will fall below 6 per cent by the end of this year, moving to 4 per cent in the course of 1994. This is a far more radical view than the market is taking. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, also believes that a 50 basis point cut in official German rates is possible next Thursday. However, remarks yesterday by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank Vice-President, raised speculation that policy may be on hold for longer. 'If the Bundesbank were to turn away from its stability-oriented policy, serious consequences for the exchange rate and the level of prices could not be ruled out,' he said. A poorer-than-expected set of inflation figures in some German states may also have made a cut less likely next week. 'It is the same old story,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London. 'At best, we are still looking at 6 or 7 per cent interest rates in Germany by the end of the year.'</p>

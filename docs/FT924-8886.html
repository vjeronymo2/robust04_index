			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / People: Heley - vice-chairman at Hill Samuel Richard Heley, head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, has been promoted to vice chairman, enabling him to devote more time to generating new business, while leaving others to run the day-to-day operations of the department. Heley, 44, who says his expertise is 'domestic transactions - from the biggest and most complicated to the smallest and most complicated', claims to be busier than he has been for a long time. While underwriting fee income, a crucial constituent in the profitability of City corporate finance departments, has dropped away almost completely, Heley says that, since advising on the Brent Walker restructuring, there has been a steady stream of other mandates, including Control Securities, as well as two other restructurings which are not yet in the public domain. Hill Samuel has one other vice chairman, Murray Stuart, who is also chairman of Scottish Power. Meanwhile the day-to-day running of the division will be taken on by three directors, all of whom will report to Stuart: Edward Buchan will be in charge of operations; Martin Anderson of international; and Sir Mark Wrightson of marketing. Originally an economist at Phillips &amp; Drew, Heley joined Hill Samuel for first time in 1974, becoming a director in 1980. He moved to BZW in 1986, as head of merchant banking corporate finance. He returned to Hill Samuel in 1990. ***** Frank Pipkin has been promoted to director of finance and administration at BROTHER INDUSTRIES (UK). ***** John Lindop, formerly a director of Wise Speke, has been appointed company secretary of CRANSWICK. ***** Nigel Gee, md of the fashion division, and David Moss, deputy md of the classic and mainstream divisions, have been promoted to the main board of MOSS BROS GROUP. ***** David Evans (right) is promoted to research director for ICI Agrochemicals on the retirement at the end of the year of John Finney, the development director. ***** Tom Vyner, joint md, is also appointed deputy chairman of J SAINSBURY. ***** Scott Dodkins, formerly marketing and development director of Cartwright Brice, has been appointed sales director of LABATT BREWING UK; he succeeds Walt Lemmon who is returning to Canada.</p>

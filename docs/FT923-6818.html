			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: European growth lifts Rentokil EUROPEAN expansion helped Rentokil, the environmental and property group, report a 21 per cent growth in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. The rise - from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 51.1m - was further boosted by a strong performance from environmental services, including pest control, healthcare and tropical plant maintenance. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said that with about 55 per cent of profits generated outside the UK the group would continue to meet its promise of annual earnings growth of 20 per cent. 'We are not limited by a single market such as a large supermarket chain in the UK. We have the opportunity to grow . . . in every significant market in the world.' Overall sales increased to Pounds 210.4m (Pounds 191.8m). Environmental services generated Pounds 181.9m (Pounds 163.5m) with property services accounting for Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 28.2m). The biggest growth occurred in Europe with sales of Pounds 61.8m (Pounds 51.9m) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 11m). Mr Thompson said: 'We started from a lower base and were helped by some strategic acquisitions. The recession has not affected the Continent as badly as the UK.' In spite of the economic downturn in the UK the group reported sales of Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 80.5m) and increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 19m). Asia Pacific and Africa saw sales rise to Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.3m) and pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 8.93m). North America was the only market to report a fall in sales with turnover down from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 20.9m, mainly because of the weakness of the dollar. Pre-tax profits were little changed at Pounds 3.3m. Mr Thompson said net cash of Pounds 39.8m enabled the group to consider more acquisitions throughout the world. 'The recession has meant that there are more companies to select from when looking at acquisitions'. Interest income increased to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 197,000). Earnings and dividends per share were 3.351p (2.785p) and 0.64p (0.532p) respectively, after adjusting for a share split in May. See Lex</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Dutch bank launches tightly priced Eurosterling deal BORROWERS tapped the international bond market using a wide assortment of currencies and structures - including straight bonds, floating rate notes and equity-linked issues - yesterday. In the Eurosterling sector Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten, the Dutch bank which funds local authorities, launched a Pounds 200m, 10-year bond which some banks criticised for being too aggressively priced, especially since the borrower does not have an official credit rating. BNG's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the gilt, giving a yield of 7.83 per cent. Some dealers said the yield pick-up was too small to appeal to UK investors. However, Paribas Capital Markets, the bookrunner for the deal, argued that BNG was regarded as 'in line with triple-A borrowers,' given that it was owned 50 per cent by the state and 50 per cent by the municipalities. The deal was swapped into guilders, allowing the borrower to achieve its funding target of 25 - 30 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Dutch state loan - or around 6.75 per cent. Paribas Capital Markets said demand came mainly from international investors who saw little downside risk with the currency and who like the yield pick-up over the core European government bonds. Elsewhere, the Republic of Austria launched a Dollars 350m, four-year floating-rate note, with a coupon of three-month Libor capped at 6.25 per cent. CSFB, the lead manager, said the deal attracted interest from money market funds, which liked the higher, up-front coupon. 'A lot of people think we are in a low interest rate environment and that if rates rise, they won't be going up that much,' said an official. One rival house criticised the deal, saying that it was rare to see such a low cap. Some of the much older issues (with a similar maturity date) trading in the market have caps of as much as 12 per cent. Bayerische Vereinsbank, one of Germany's two large Bavaria-based banks, yesterday launched a collared floating rate note in the Canadian dollar sector of the international bond market. The CDollars 150m, 10-year deal has a coupon set at the rate on three-month bankers acceptances less 30 basis points, with a floor of 6.25 per cent and a maximum of 10 per cent. Three-month bankers acceptances are currently about 4 3/8 per cent. Kidder Peabody International, the lead manager, reported strong retail investor interest. In the equity-linked sector, Morgan Stanley brought a L565bn convertible bond issue for Softe, a financial subsidiary of Stet, the Italian public sector telecommunications group. The bonds can be exchanged for shares in Sip, the main telephone utility (Stet is the holding company for Sip).</p>

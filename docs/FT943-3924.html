			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / This Week: Television Murder has become a merchandising opportunity in the US, where the murder of OJ Simpson's wife and her friend has made millions for those with the ghoulish foresight to cash in by printing books, T-shirts and playing cards. Late Show (Monday, 11.15-11.55pm, BBC2) turns the camera on this media circus and discovers that sales of white Ford Broncos have gone up by 30 per cent since the allegation that Simpson used it as a getaway car. Such is the power of fame in America that in a recent poll a large majority of people thought Simpson could not be guilty because he is too famous and good-looking. Watch and wonder. Carlton Television's sponsorship deal with the Donmar Warehouse bears fruit with this special televisation of its production of Cabaret (Wednesday 10.40-12.40am, lTV). Those who didn't manage to get a ticket can console themselves with this production, although it won't have the audience participation of the original, in which performers at the Kit Kat Club would lead members of the audience into a dance. Jane Horrocks as the cut-price chanteuse is somewhat inconsistent, and therefore unconvincing. However, Alan Cummings, as the sleazy MC, leers into the lens with great aplomb. Sam Mendes' award-winning production is much closer to what lsherwood might have seen in the Weimar Republic so don't expect it to be anything like the cleaned up Hollywood version. Radio Four's funniest comedy Knowing Me Knowing You. With Alan Partridge makes its transition to television (Friday, 10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) with the eponymous spoof chat show host blundering his way through more interviews in a set modelled on the lobby of a 'top international hotel'. The TV version is less subtle, and therefore not as much of a guffaw-inducer as its sound-only predecessor, but, nonetheless, when it works, it works spectacularly well. The entourage following operatic superstars tends to consist of yes-men, rather than lensmen, so the BBC is crowing about being allowed to tail Placido Domingo while he jetted around the world. The result has been chopped into four documentaries entitled Placido Domingo: Tales From the Opera (Sunday, 8.00-9.00pm, BBC2). He comes across as a genuinely amiable man, and opera lovers will relish being allowed into rehearsals. The most talented member of the Just A Minute team and the most miserable panelist on Have l Got News For You, gives us the ones he's loved from the world of variety in Paul Merton's Palladium Story (Sunday, 8.00-8.50pm, BBC1), a two part documentary on the pleasure palace. It is a bit long on anecdotes, not all of which are up to scratch, but includes some good archive material.</p>

Last month the group offered 33.33m ordinary shares, 20.8m placed with institutions and the remainder subject to clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The Pounds 26.5m raised through the issue of 23.33m new shares will be used alongside a new revolving credit facility of Pounds 10m to repay Pounds 35m of debt incurred during the Pounds 47.6m management buy-out in 1990.</p>

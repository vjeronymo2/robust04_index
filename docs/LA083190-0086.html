			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> BURGLARY SUSPECT SHOT BY OFFICER  </P> <P> A man suspected of breaking into a market was shot and wounded by a policeman  Thursday after allegedly attacking the officer with a screwdriver.  </P> <P> Gilbert Lopez, 19, was listed in fair condition Thursday afternoon after  undergoing surgery at UCI Medical Center in Orange for a bullet wound in his  back.  </P> <P> The officer was not injured, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said.  </P> <P> Police were investigating a false alarm at a Target store in the 1800 block of  West Lincoln Avenue at about 4 a.m. Thursday when two people ran up to the  squad car and alerted officers to a burglary in progress at a food store a  block away.  </P> <P> Arriving at the market, the officers spotted a car speeding away with two young  men inside, Barry said.  </P> <P> The police car chased the suspects two blocks to Euclid Avenue and the Santa  Ana Freeway, where the driver of the suspects' car lost control and the  automobile rolled over, landing on its roof. After the car skidded to a stop,  the suspects climbed out and began running.  </P> <P> One of the officers chased Lopez to North Manchester Avenue, an industrial area  bordering the Santa Ana Freeway. After cornering him at 300 N. Manchester, the  officer pulled out his handgun and ordered Lopez to surrender, but the suspect  turned and lunged at the officer with a screwdriver, Barry said. The two were  struggling when the officer shot the suspect at point-blank range, Barry said.  </P> <P> Lopez's 16-year-old companion was found by officers a short time later, hiding  in a commercial storage area, Barry said. Food and other items were found in  the overturned car, which was later determined to have been stolen from an  Anaheim resident. No firearms were found on the suspects or in the car, Barry  said.  </P> <P> Lopez and the 16-year-old, whose name was withheld because of his age, were  arrested on suspicion of burglary, auto theft and evading a police officer,  Barry said.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the shooting, the  16th this year involving a uniformed peace officer in Orange County.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: ERM: Arguments favour giving priority to monetary policy and a large realignment (2) Sir, the MIT professors and Nobel laureates, in their early burial of the European Monetary System, reminded me of Mark Twain's quote, 'The announcement of my death is premature'. Although I am not an enthusiast of the ERM, I was astonished to see no mention of a large realignment as a possible solution to the current ERM crisis. Since I co-share the authors' (presumed) preference for living in a world of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, I cannot see what their advocacy of a 'new EMS' can bring as new to lay down the stepping stones of a future international monetary system.

A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is being characterized by the Department of Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. Both the field trip and the workshop will focus on the terrestrial ecosystem studies being conducted in conjunction with the Yucca Mountain project. Although the field trip and the meeting are open to the public, the number of participants who can attend the field trip will be limited, and advance reservations will be necessary. (See information below on making advance reservations.) The workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 4255 South Paradise, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109; telephone (702) 369&hyph;4400; fax (702) 369&hyph;3770. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The field trip on March 21 will allow panel members and consultants to review the work described to the panel by the DOE at the panel's November 22, 1993, meeting in Las Vegas. The panel will visit locations where environmental monitoring activities are being conducted, as well as other locations where scientific studies are under way at the site that could help project the long-term environmental effects of a potential repository. These might include sites where infiltration and evapotranspiration are being studied, and places where there is evidence of fracture-rooting of plants. No cameras or videorecorders are allowed on the field trip. A box lunch will be provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons wishing to attend the field trip must submit the following information by telephone or fax to Frank Randall at the Board's offices in Arlington, Virginia; telephone (703) 235&hyph;4473; fax (703) 235&hyph;4495. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship, passport number and expiration date, immigrant alien status, type of visa and expiration date, name and address of employer, name and address of work place (if different from employer's), length of time in the United States, and alien registration number. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the field trip. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued. This information must be provided to the Board  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> no later than February 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  You also must bring your passport or alien registration card with you to the badging office when you begin the field trip. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, place of birth, date of birth, and your business name and address.

The workshop also will explore a previously stated Board concern that experimental studies might be needed to develop the information necessary to adequately forecast the long-term environmental effects of a repository. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel members will hear presentations from representatives of the DOE and its contractors on the Thermal-Loading Study Design, evapotranspiration, and heat transfer from a potential repository to the surface environment. The panel also will investigate the legal requirements for environmental programs at Yucca Mountain, and the implications of those legal requirements for the technical studies to be conducted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning May 4, 1994.

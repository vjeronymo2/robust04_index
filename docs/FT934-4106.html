			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Traffic law may be used to keep City cordon City of London police may use traffic management powers to retain the controversial security cordon around the Square Mile if objectors seek its withdrawal next year. The cordon, which restricts and monitors traffic movements in the central area of the City, was set up in July after April's Bishopsgate bombing which killed one person and injured more than 40. It was introduced for a six-month experimental period under traffic powers, and the City Corporation is likely to extend the experi-ment for a further six months. Retention for longer than that would require government approval. Objectors  -possibly including surrounding boroughs - could force a public inquiry. Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police, said one option, rather than removing the controls pending an inquiry, would be to redesign the cordon as a new traffic management experiment. 'It would be foolhardy to remove the cordon while the terrorist threat remains,' he said. 'I would sooner answer to a charge that I had abused my power than that I had done nothing.' Mr Kelly, who retires as commissioner this week, regards his introduction of the cordon as probably the most controversial decision any chief constable has had to take in recent years. He said: 'Some people complained that it would make the City of London like Belfast, but it has not done so. The checks are not overpowering and obtrusive. Many people tell us they now feel more secure.' City of London police stepped up street patrols after last year's Baltic Exchange bombing, and a year ago last week introduced random vehicle checkpoints using armed officers. Mr Kelly said: 'The subsequent Bishopsgate bombing proved that these measures were insufficient. We had to do more. Of course terrorists can penetrate a security cordon. To make any area risk-free would involve levels of security that people would find unacceptable. But I had a duty to do all I reasonably could.' He has faced three main criticisms of the security ring - that it was a propaganda coup for the IRA, would at best divert terrorists elsewhere, and might act as a challenge to bombers to penetrate the cordon. 'I reject all three. There is no propaganda coup to equal a bomb explosion. Terrorists have to put massive planning and effort into staging a big operation and, if they want to attack the heart of the financial community, will not necessarily put the same effort into a substitute target. 'As to the argument that we are challenging them to strike again - they have proved with their attacks on the City that they do not need us to challenge them. Doing nothing was not an option.' One consequence of the security measures has been a reduction in crime in the City by 10 per cent last year, and a further 18 per cent so far this year.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gillette puts effort into male toiletries GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products group, yesterday unveiled its Gillette Series line as it prepares to foray into the male grooming product arena. Developed at a cost of about Dollars 75m, the 14 products that will form the core of a line of shaving preparations, deodorants, anti-perspirants and after-shave conditioners, will be the first toiletries to carry the Gillette name. The company will spend Dollars 125m to market the products in the North Atlantic market and it has applied for more than 20 patents to cover new technologies used, including a novel gel-based deodorant which will be rolled out through a grid applicator. Although Gillette has a chequered track record in toiletries, the company has a strong presence in the men's shaving market. It expects the Dollars 6bn male grooming market to grow to nearly Dollars 12bn by the end of the century. The move is the latest effort by Gillette to expand from its established product base. In the summer it launched a Sensor razor for women and acquired a majority stake in the biggest razor blade maker in China. Earlier this month it bought Parker Pen for Pounds 285m (Dollars 564m).</p>

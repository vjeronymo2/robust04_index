			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> UCI GETS FUNDS FOR BRAIN CANCER STUDY  </P> <P> A Los Angeles hospital has given UC Irvine a $208,000 grant for research into  the use of the body's immune system to combat brain cancer.  </P> <P> The grant from the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles to UCI's  Cancer Research Institute will support basic studies by Gale Granger, a  professor of molecular biology and biochemistry.  </P> <P> Granger's approach to the battle against brain cancer is threefold.  </P> <P> First, he has been studying the effect of concentrated amounts of natural  cancer-killing substances that are produced by the body's immune system. So  far, injecting patients with those materials has proven largely ineffective.  </P> <P> A second approach is to grow certain human immune cells and implant the cell  culture following brain cancer surgery. In clinical trials on patients with a  type of brain tumor known as recurrent glioblastoma, delays in the recurrence  of cancer have been seen in 10% to 20% of cases, Granger said.  </P> <P> A third method under examination is to identify toxins produced by tumors.  </P> <P> The gift from Good Samaritan is expected to speed further study and a new round  of clinical trials, institute officials said.  </P></p>

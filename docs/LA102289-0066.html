			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> MANY MARKET LENDERS FINANCE 90% MORTGAGES  </P> <P> QUESTION: We live in a very expensive area where home prices seem outrageous.  My husband and I have been saving like mad but only have about a 10% down  payment. What is the maximum limit on a 90% mortgage?  </P> <P> ANSWER: There is no limit to 90% mortgages. Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  can't buy mortgages over $187,000, there are other secondary-mortgage market  lenders who either originate or buy home loans with virtually unlimited  amounts.  </P> <P> These so-called jumbo loans can be obtained from local S&amp;Ls, banks and  mortgage brokers. Although these loans may seem expensive, they are better than  the alternative of not buying a home.  </P> <P> Getting a big mortgage doesn't conflict with the suggestion that you pay off  that mortgage as quickly as possible if you plan to stay in the home many years  and want to save interest dollars by cutting the loan from 30 to 15 or 20  years. To find out the exact extra payment necessary to cut the mortgage term,  ask your lender to supply a 15-year and 20-year payment amortization schedule.  </P> <P> 'Get Largest Mortgage' Still the Best Advice  </P> <P> Q: Several times you recently said home buyers should obtain the largest  mortgage they can get. I agree that because of the 1987 Tax Act, your advice  makes sense. But doesn't this conflict with your advice to add an extra $50 or  $100 to each mortgage payment to reduce the principal and cut the mortgage  term?  </P> <P> A: No. Many home buyers make large down payments, thinking it is smart to  reduce their monthly mortgage payment by a few dollars. Then they realize their  big mistake but it's too late. Once a home acquisition mortgage is obtained,  the home buyer has only 90 days to change his/her mind.  </P> <P> Tax-Deferred Exchange Way to Handle Profit  </P> <P> Q: We recently sold some land and earned about $44,000 profit. If we use this  money to pay down our home mortgage can we avoid tax?  </P> <P> A: Nice try, but using your cash from the land sale to pay down your home  mortgage won't avoid tax on the profit. You could have avoided tax by making an  IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange but it's too late now. Please consult your tax  adviser for details.  </P> <P> Pay Home Loan Fee by Separate Check  </P> <P> Q: We are buying our first home. Our realtor advised us to pay the loan fee by  separate check, so we can deduct it on our income tax returns. But the lender  refused to let us do that and subtracted the loan fee from our mortgage  proceeds. Can we deduct our loan fee on our tax returns anyway?  </P> <P> A: The official IRS position is that the loan fee for a mortgage to acquire a  principal residence is tax deductible as itemized interest if "paid" from  separate funds rather than being subtracted from loan proceeds.  </P> <P> You should have listened to your smart realtor and insisted that the lender  allow you to pay the loan fee by separate check. Shame on that ill-informed  lender who forced you to make a costly tax mistake. I've heard some aggressive  taxpayers claim this deduction even if the lender subtracted the loan fee from  the proceeds, but then they pray every day that they won't be audited by the  IRS on this item.  </P> <P> Loan fees not paid by separate check on home acquisition loans and loan fees on  all other types of realty loans are tax deductible over the life of the loan.  Please consult your CPA for full details.  </P> <P> Child Can't Deduct Mom's Mortgage Cost  </P> <P> Q: For the last few years, I have been paying my disabled mother's mortgage  payments, property taxes and insurance. A friend tells me I can deduct these  expenses on my income tax returns, although I do not live in my mother's house.  If true, these tax deductions would save me a bundle of income taxes since I  rent an apartment and don't have enough tax deductions to itemize. Please  clarify.  </P> <P> A: Your friend is mistaken. Since you are not the owner of the property and  therefore are not obligated to pay the mortgage and property taxes, you are not  entitled to deduct them on your tax returns.  </P> <P> However, if your mother is willing to add you as a co-owner of the residence  and if you move into it as your personal residence, then you would become  eligible to deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes you pay.  </P> <P> But there could be adverse tax consequences of doing so because if your mother  is expected to die soon, you would probably be better off inheriting the home  since you would then receive a stepped-up basis of its market value on the date  of her death. Please discuss the pros and cons with your tax adviser.  </P> <P> Don't Use Inheritance on Mortgage Principal  </P> <P> Q: Several times recently you have advised homeowners to make extra principal  payments of $100 or so each month on their mortgage payments to cut the length  of their mortgage by several years. My husband recently inherited almost  $15,000 and we are considering using it to pay down our 8.25% interest-rate  mortgage, which has a balance of almost $34,000. Do you think we should do  this?  </P> <P> A: No. Making a lump sum prepayment on a low interest rate home loan is not a  smart idea. There are several reasons. Your monthly mortgage payment will not  be reduced, and since your mortgage interest rate is low, you will never again  be able to borrow money so cheaply.  </P> <P> You would be tying up cash which you might need for emergencies or investments.  By paying down a low-cost loan, you would really be investing that $15,000 at  8.25 percent interest. That is a very poor investment.  </P> <P> The only advantage of making a lump-sum payment on a low-interest-rate mortgage  is you will cut the life of the mortgage and save some interest. However,  saving interest at 8.25 percent is not a smart move. Instead, I suggest you  invest that $15,000. Surely you can earn more than 8.25 percent interest on it.  </P> <P> You Don't Have to Pay Off Loan Before Selling  </P> <P> Q: A few years ago, we refinanced our mortgage with a new VA loan. My husband  died last year and I have decided to sell my home and move to a better climate.  I talked to a realtor and she says I don't have to pay off my mortgage before  selling. This doesn't seem right to me that I can sell with my mortgage unpaid.  How does this work?  </P> <P> A: Presuming your VA mortgage was created before 1988, there is no need to pay  it off before selling your home. The buyer can either assume it or obtain  another mortgage which will be used to pay off your old VA loan.  </P> <P> Having an assumable mortgage is a major advantage if it has an attractive  interest rate. However, if the buyer assumes your VA mortgage, be sure the  lender releases you from further liability.  </P> <P> Then, if the buyer defaults, you won't have to worry about a deficiency loss  against you. Ask your attorney to explain further.  </P> <P> Questions and comments may be sent to the Real Estate Editor, Los Angeles  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

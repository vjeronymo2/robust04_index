			<p>SUMMARY                                   The 6 January Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission  (CEC) announcement scheduling repeat elections to fill vacant  Federal Assembly seats has prompted varied responses from the  affected localities.  The Chechen republic continues to balk,  denouncing the announcement, and again refusing, as in December,  to hold elections.  Moscow and Tatarstan appear to be making  progress toward signing a treaty on bilateral relations, a Tatar  prerequisite for holding elections, suggesting that voting may  proceed on schedule in that region.                               END SUMMARY     In an effort to fill vacant upper- and lower-house seats in the  new Russian parliament, the Russian Federation CEC announced  "repeat elect ions" have been scheduled in regions where they were  boycotted or not held on 12 December, namely the republics of  Tatarstan and Chechnya, and the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrug  (Interfax, 6 January; ITAR-TASS, 6 January).  The CEC scheduled  elections in Tatarstan and Chechnya, the only republics not to  have held elections on 12 December, for 13 March and in Yamalo-  Nenets for 6 March.  The CEC announcement indicated that the  elections would be organized by local election commissions with  the "same members" as for the failed 12 December elections.     The Chechen republic refused to take part in the 12 December  Federal Assembly elections (ITAR-TASS, 13 October 1993).  While  Tatarstan did not openly refuse to hold elections, local  authorities effectively sabotaged them by using their control of  local media and by bureaucratic maneuvering, according to an  article in the 29 December Rossiya.  As a result of the local  opposition, the elections had to be cancelled because of an  insufficient number of registered candidates (Kommersant-Daily, 7  December 1993).  Only one Federation Council deputy was elected  for the Yamalo-Nenets two-mandate district (Interfax, 20 December  1993). (See Note)     (Note)  Ballots for the December elections allowed the voter to  vote against all candidates.  Federation Council seats were  awarded to the two candidates receiving the largest number of  votes, unless the number of votes in the box against all  candidates exceeded the total of either of the top two.  It can  therefore be assumed that only one candidate in the Yamalo-Nenets  district exceeded the "against all candidates" vote.     Chechnya Remains Adament     Chechen electoral officials reacted with hostility to the CEC  announcement of a new election date for the republic.  The CEC  announcement on Chechnya's elections--termed a "final appeal" by  Ostankino television's "Novosti" newscast-- asked the "people and  leadership" of Chechnya to "examine and make a positive decision"  on the question of the republic's participation in Federal  Assembly elections (Ostankino TV, 5 January; ITAR-TASS, 6  January).  Nevertheless, the Chechen republic electoral  commission vehemently decried the CEC announcement as  demonstrating Russia's "unwillingness to abandon the gendarme  approach," "threats," and "intimidation," and it called the  announcement a "fresh ultimatum" that will "complicate relations"  between Chechnya and Russia (Interfax, 6 January; Russian TV, 7  January).     Tatarstan Negotiates     In contrast to Chechnya's outright opposition, Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev has reportedly offered a compromise,  agreeing to hold new elections in Tatarstan if Moscow and the  republic first conclude a bilateral treaty defining Tatarstan's  sovereignty (Kuranty, 12 January; Interfax, 11 January).  Although this "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of Authority and  Terms of Reference" has yet to be signed, it is cited in the  Tatarstan Constitution as the "basis" on which Tatarstan will  associate with the Russian Federation (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13  December 1992).  In a possible attempt to pressure Moscow toward  concluding the treaty with the republic, during a break in the  first session of the Federation Council--which Shaymiyev and  Tatarstan Parliament Chairman Farid Mukhamedshin attended as  guests" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 11 January; Interfax, 11 January)-  -Shaymiyev was quoted as saying that repeat elections will  "depend on whether relations [with the Russian Federation] are  straightened out" and whether the treaty is signed (Kuranty, 12  January).     The two sides appear to be making progress toward signing the  treaty.  Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported from "well-informed  sources" that "full-scale" negotiations will take place between  Russia and Tatarstan at the end of January and that the Russian  Government has reportedly been tasked with preparing "within a  week draft intergovernmental agreements on defense, foreign  economic activity, banking activity, and budget interrelations  between Moscow and Kazan" (19 January).  Suggesting that Kazan is  anticipating a successful outcome of the end-of-January  negotiations, officials at the Tatarstan republic CEC reportedly  announced that "operating procedures" will commence as of 1  February (Segodnya, 22 January).     This conciliatory stand appears consistent with Kazan's efforts  to garner a greater "say" in policy affecting its territory while  avoiding explicit advocacy of separatism.  Assessing Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's 11 January address to the Federation  Council, Shaymiyev was quoted as expressing "great satisfaction"  with Yeltsin's "thesis" that "strong regions are the condition of  Russia's prosperity" (Interfax, 11 January; Radio Rossii, 11  January). Shaymiyev previously has claimed that, while  "sovereignty" is important for the republic, "full independence  in the usual sense of the word does not suit" Tatarstan, owing to  "the republic's geographical location," "visible and invisible  ties," and the "large degree of economic integration."  This  stand has left him open to criticism by Tatar nationalist  opponents for trying to "reform the Russian Federation rather  than leave it" (Ostankino TV, 10 August 1993).     Tatarstan officials also appear to have adopted a new tactic in  their efforts to achieve greater autonomy within the Russian  Federation--organizing a republic political party.  According to  a report in Kommersant-Daily, government officials and Shaymiyev  supporters recently founded the Republican Party of Tatarstan  "Unity and Progress," with presidential adviser Rafil Khakimov  serving as co-chairman of the organizing committee.  Khakimov  reportedly expects that the party will "soon emerge on the  federal political arena and make Moscow reckon with it"  (Kommersant-Daily, 18 December).  The newspaper cited Khakimov as  saying that the party's goals include the "development and  consolidation of Tatarstan's statehood," and fighting "not only  for Tatarstan's rights but also assist[ing] the other Russian  republics in this struggle" (Kommersant Daily, 21 December).     Implications     A successful conclusion to treaty negotiations should assure the  holding of elections in Tatarstan and, in turn, the republic's  full representation and participation in the Federal Assembly,  although disputes over the republic's sovereignty and  interpretation of the treaty will probably continue.  In  contrast, there seems to be little prospect for agreement between  Chechnya and Moscow on ending the republic's boycott of federal  institutions.     (AUTHOR:  NERO.

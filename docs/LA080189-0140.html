			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY SAYS NO TO GENERAL'S BID IN POLAND  </P> <P> Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak's bid to be prime minister ran into difficulty today  after Solidarity declared its opposition to him and the Communist coalition  acknowledged that it is divided.  </P> <P> Across Poland today, food prices soared by up to 500%, the bitter cost of the  government's swift push toward a free-market economy.  </P> <P> Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity free trade union, called for opposition  lawmakers in Parliament's lower house, or Sejm, to vote against Kiszczak, the  ruling Communist Party's nominee for prime minister. His brief statement was  issued just minutes before the lawmaking body was to meet to consider the  nomination.  </P> <P> However, after a series of consultations in Parliament, it was decided to  postpone Kiszczak's nomination and debate on his candidacy at least until  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Communist-allied Peasant Party, whose 76 votes are needed to give the  Communist delegation a working majority of lawmakers, did not announce its  stance.  </P> <P> After battling on Monday to snap up goods at the old prices, long-suffering  Poles bore the unprecedented hikes with resignation.  </P> <P> When shops opened today they found a loaf of bread had more than doubled in  price to 200 zloties (24 cents) while milk cost 180 zloties (22 cents) a  bottle, four times the old price.  </P> <P> "This is ridiculous but what can we do?" shrugged one pensioner at Warsaw's  Koszykowa market.  </P></p>

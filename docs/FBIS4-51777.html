			<p>BFN     [Text] A pier in Pusan exclusively used free of charge by  the United States forces here since 13 years ago will be  returned to the government to be used for export-import cargos.    A tentative agreement for the return of the sixth quay was  reached between the Korea Maritime &amp; Port Administration  [KMPA]  and the Eighth U.S. Army authorities recently, a KMPA official  said yesterday.    Consultations for a final decision are underway with the  U.S.  State Department and the two sides will begin taking necessary  procedures after the consultations end. But another pier also  being used by the U.S. and the Korean naval forces for purely  military purposes will remain as it is now, he said.    U.S. military officials revealed they would return the wharf  to the Korean government from a positive perspective on  condition that ships carrying U.S. military materials are  allowed to use the pier with preferential treatment, he said.    The pier, 233-meters long and 25-meters wide, is located  beside the Pusan Container Terminal Company and has the  capability of accommodating one 3,000-ton container ship.    It was offered to the USFK [U.S. Forces in Korea] in July  1981 on the basis of the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Agreement  concluded in 1954.    The KMPA plans to develop the pier for the exclusive use of  ships transporting trade freight by investing some 8 billion won  (10 million U.S. dollars).    The KMPA official said the restoration of the wharf is  expected to inject fresh momentum in attracting cargo going to  and coming from Russia and China.    The KMPA asked the USFK to return the pier via the Defense  Ministry last September.</p>

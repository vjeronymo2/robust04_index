			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Swedish banks Yesterday's announcements from Gota and Svenska Handelsbanken are a rude reminder of how intractable the crisis in Swedish banking has become. Unlike SEBanken, Sweden's largest bank, Handelsbanken is still in profit. But non-performing loans virtually doubled in the first four months. Gota has insured its loan portfolio with Trygg-Hansa, its main shareholder. US banks have insured developing country loans in the past, but Gota is paying a high premium to protect itself against losses. That smacks of more than just financial engineering. At least depositor confidence should improve now the insurance is in place. Eventually Swedish bank profits should rebound as loan loss provisions abate. That point is still a long way off. Sweden's banking crisis is not as acute as that facing Finland or Norway, but the repercussions have now hit even well-managed banks like Handelsbanken. Worries about currency stability prevent Sweden from applying the normal palliative of lower interest rates. The banks themselves are hardly optimistic. Sharply higher provisions for the first four months suggests they do not expect much respite this year, if any at all.</p>

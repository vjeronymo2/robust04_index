			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: GTE sells lighting division in buy-out GTE of the US has sold its GTE Sylvania International lighting operations in a management buy-out. The new company, Sylvania Lighting International, inherits a business ranked third in European lighting with a worldwide turnover last year of Dollars 650m. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but GTE said it was raising about Dollars 1.1bn from the buy-out and the separate sale of its North American lighting activities to Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens. The buy-out, covering operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Australia, was financed by an investment consortium led by Citicorp Venture Capital. In Europe, which accounts for 80 per cent of sales, Sylvania Lighting International produces and markets lamps and fixtures under the brand names Claude, Concord, Le Dauphin, Linolite, Lumiance and Sylvania. It claims an average market share of just over 10 per cent, behind Osram and the market leader Philips, but is more strongly placed in individual country markets such as France. Mr Norman Scoular, Sylvania's chief executive, formerly chief executive of FKI, the UK-based electrical engineering group, hopes to improve the company's indifferent performance by better use of technological resources and more streamlined, decentralised management. To that end, Sylvania has a technological assistance pact with its North American counterpart, giving it unlimited access to the product and process technology of that group and of Osram, the new owner. Mr Scoular said yesterday the Geneva-based company, which has 6,300 employees, would be pursuing growth areas within a largely stable market. These included compact fluorescent lighting using thin tube lamps, which are increasingly displacing the traditional incandescent light bulb.</p>

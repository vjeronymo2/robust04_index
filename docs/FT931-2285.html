			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why not buy a pied-a-terre? - Expatriates / The Budget and You THE CHANCELLOR proposes to abolish the 'available accommodation' rule. This treats individuals in the UK, for a temporary purpose only, as resident for tax purposes for any tax year in which they visit the UK - no matter how short the visit - and where they have accommodation available for their use. The rule's abolition will apply to both income and capital gains tax from April 6. In spite of the change, resident status will be incurred in any of the following ways: Coming to the UK with the intention of remaining permanently or for over three years. Visiting for more than 182 days in any tax year. Visiting for more than 90 days per year by reference to an average of four consecutive tax years. It may be some time before all the ramifications of the current changes become clear. Ownership of property will continue to be relevant to resident status, although not to the previous extent. For example, if you claim to be departing the UK for permanent residence overseas, whether you dispose of your UK home or not will determine respectively: whether UK non-residence is admitted immediately; or whether you will be required to wait three years for a retrospective ruling. Similarly, owning or acquiring a property when you arrive in the UK may be taken as indicating your intention to reside in the country for an extended period. Some results of the change are clearer. Britons who have emigrated to the sun following retirement and who have been deterred from maintaining a UK pied-a-terre, need hesitate no longer. Similarly, foreign businessmen who are regularly in the UK and would like to acquire accommodation, should be able to do so without fear of tax consequences. Under current law both would risk liability to tax on overseas income and gains. British expatriates, staying in their UK homes between overseas contracts, have faced even greater problems. Most will have been UK domiciliaries and the acquisition of UK resident status carried with it the danger of tax on worldwide income and gains. Expatriates who perform 'duties of substance' in the UK while maintaining accommodation there, have faced the same sort of problem. While most will have succeeded in excluding their salaries from liability by means of the foreign earnings deduction, they typically became chargeable to tax on worldwide investment income and gains. All of the above people will gain from the impending change. Their overseas income and gains will remain outside the charge to UK tax, provided they keep their visits within the six months per annum/three months average rules. But there are snags. Wives who had previously been regular UK residents will no longer be able to enjoy an annual Pep, while others may find their right to personal pension plans has evaporated. All this assumes the legislation will pass through Parliament. However, that is not a foregone conclusion. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T. Fry of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

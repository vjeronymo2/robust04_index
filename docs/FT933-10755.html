			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Economics: Depressed indicators from Germany bring more bad publicity for Europe THE important German employment and output figures due out this week will be viewed in a subdued light after the weekend's developments in the ERM. West German unemployment is forecast to rise by 30,000, a little more than the previous month's 29,000. The outlook for employment is similarly bleak: it is expected to fall by a further 38,000, following the June fall of 35,000. German industrial production and manufacturing output are both expected to have been flat in June, after rises of 1.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively over the previous month. Manufacturing orders, predicted to fall 1 per cent, would have deteriorated even further from the May figure, which rose 3.8 per cent. Overall, another dose of depressed figures from the German economy will only add to the theorising about the future for European exchange rates which has followed in the wake of the Bundesbank's decision not to cut the discount rate at last week's council meeting. It is a busy week for figures in the US. Observers will be especially watching the July figure for non-farm payrolls after last month's meagre 13,000 rise. Forecasters expect a rebound in July, with an increase of 150,000. But considering the measure's erratic behaviour in recent years (see graph), nothing should be taken for granted. Other US data out this week - manufacturing payrolls, hourly earnings and the newest unemployment rate - will help to provide a more balanced view of the state of the US labour market. Unusually low employment growth has so far been a stubborn feature of the American economy's recovery. As a result, fewer economists now consider manufacturing payroll figures, for example, to be a reliable guide to the level of overall economic activity. The following are some of the week's other economic highlights and events. The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The head of the  government's Tax Commission Tuesday [8 February] expressed the  view that financial sources to cover a tax reduction announced  earlier in the day are ensured from a broader viewpoint.    Kan Kato was commenting on a decision by the government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to slash income and other taxes  worth 5.85 trillion yen as part of an economic stimulative  package and to discuss how to fund the cuts in a consultative  body to be created within the coalition government.    "We now have a system whereby we can solve the issue of  revenues," he told reporters. "In a wide sense, we have managed  to come through with putting the tax reduction together with a  tax increase."    Kato said he will keep a keen eye on discussions to be made  in the consulting body.    "We have put off deciding on the revenues, but we must come  to a conclusion by the end of the year. The Tax Commission will  keep participating in the struggle," he said.</p>

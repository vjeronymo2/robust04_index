			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt takes support from Lufthansa SENIOR bourses were stronger yesterday, writes our markets staff. FRANKFURT saw gains in the pre-bourse accelerate throughout the session on good overseas interest. The DAX index closed 13.97 higher at 1,587.64, a gain of 2.8 per cent on the week. Turnover was DM5.7bn after DM5.2bn. Some analysts believe that, while the prospect of a cut in interest rates continues to lift sentiment, hopes that the government's solidarity pact will gain the agreement of employers and trade unions is currently supporting the market. Individual features included Lufthansa, up DM6.60 or 6 per cent at DM110.00, on reports that it will show good earnings results next week. Deutsche Babcock rose DM5.80 to DM159.80, after announcing that it was to resume dividend payments of DM3 after a two year suspension and pay the same amount retrospectively for 1991 and 1990. Elsewhere good performances were seen by Siemens, up DM7.00 at DM604.80 and Daimler, DM11.50 higher at DM576.50. PARIS was positive on the last day of the account with the CAC-40 index finishing 8.24 higher at 1,820.42 for a 0.4 per cent gain on the week. Turnover was good at FFr3.1bn. St Gobain gained FFr14.90 to FFr495.90 as investors took stock of its 1992 figures, released after Thursday's close, which suggested that the group has been more resistant to the economic downturn than other cyclicals. Lyonnaise-Dumez, which has lost 11.6 per cent on the week after forecasting disappointing 1992 earnings on Wednesday, closed 50 centimes lower at FFr409.50. Elf put on FFr6.00 to FFr340.80 after the group said that its 1992 results, due out early next week, would meet expectations. Moulinex was another gainer, rising FFr5.40 to FFr82.90, ahead of results due out after the close. Peugeot shed FFr20 or 3 per cent to FFr578 as a number of brokers downgraded the stock. ZURICH turned broadly firmer after a lively afternoon. Shares rose in the morning, dipped at midsession on profit-taking, but climbed again in the afternoon as investors were attracted by lower prices. The SMI index, little changed on the week, ended up 15.3 at 2,102.7, the level at which it had hit resistance in the morning. Chemicals were in demand. Ciba registered shares rose SFr14 to SFr656. Roche certificates dipped to a day's low of SFr4,050 in response to overnight news of a 50 per cent drop in profits at Genentech, its US biotechnology unit. But the shares later picked up to close unchanged at SFr4,120. AMSTERDAM featured a 5.5 per cent rise in Hoogovens, up Fl 1.30 to Fl 24.80, while a late session rumour that the state was to place its 8 per cent stake in ING sent its shares down 80 cents to Fl 58.00. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 lower at 98.9, up 1.2 per cent on the week. MILAN suffered a bout of profit-taking after recent gains but the market closed mostly off the day's lows. The Comit index was 5.98 lower at 481.62, 0.6 per cent higher on the week. However, Italcementi and its parent, Italmobiliare, were among the few issues to rise after news that the government was to free around L50 trillion for public works spending. Italcementi rose L388 to L9,338 and Italmobiliare fixed L150 up at L37,000 before surging to L38,500 after hours. STOCKHOLM ended lower after profit-taking ahead of the February results reporting season and a fall by pharmaceutical group Astra. Astra's A-shares closed down SKr12 at SKr694, and the B-shares fell SKr10 to SKr679. The Affarsvarlden index ended 14.3 lower at 912.9, for a weekly decline of 1.5 per cent. Asea's B-share rose SKr1 to SKr383 on news of a large contract from Swedish railways. Among banking stocks, Handelsbanken A-shares climbed SKr2.50 to SK5r44.50 supported by hopes of a maintained dividend. In contrast, S-E-Banken's A-share were unchanged at SKr14 after news of a widespread group overhaul. BRUSSELS closed higher in busy trade which took the Bel-20 index 7.91 higher at 1,172.32, for a weekly rise of 2.4 per cent. Belgium's biggest retailer, GIB, was the most active share following recommendations from London brokers. It advanced BFr24 to BFr1,234 on very high volume of 186,800 shares. MADRID took little encouragement from a cut in domestic interest rates and the general index lost 1.19 to 232.18, down 1.5 per cent on the week. Banco Santander, whose results on Thursday disappointed the market, shed Pta235 to Pta4,640. VIENNA, held up against expectations in the wake of news of a 1992 operating loss dividend cut at OMV. The ATX index eased 1.43 to 338.34. OMV shares slid Sch15 to Sch599 after the company said it expected to post a 1992 loss of Sch300m and that the dividend would be cut.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 22                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes                Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1094.45   1094.75   1092.36   1090.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1158.36   1157.72   1155.93   1157.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Jan 21    Jan 20    Jan 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1091.44   1091.84   1090.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1154.96   1153.29   1155.89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1090.57   1091.76   1091.92   1091.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1159.26   1157.69   1157.61   1156.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Jan 18    Jan 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1097.15   1089.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1166.50   1160.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1094.96 ; 200 -  1159.76 Low/day: 100 -  1090.13  200 -  1155.58  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

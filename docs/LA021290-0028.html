			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF UNION  </P> <P> All hail our many-faceted President for his sound sense of proportion.  </P> <P> Our "education President" has allocated for Head Start programs, one-half as  much as for rebuilding the parts of Panama he destroyed as a Christmas gift to  the poor of that country (Part A, Feb. 1).  </P> <P> Our "environment President" has decided that twice that amount should "do it"  for salvaging our vast nation's tenuous hold on life on this planet as we knew  it.  </P> <P> Our "support repressive governments as long as they aren't communist" President  has asked for $50 million more to add to our daily $1.5 million contribution to  the well-being of the Salvadoran government. But, patience. Surely the  homeless, the fixed-income aged, and the uninsured ill can wait at least until  the next State of the Union message, to hope for a little of the largess our  President reserves for his own.  </P> <P> JEAN K. GLASSER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

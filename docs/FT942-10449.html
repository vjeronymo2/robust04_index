			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Syrians turn to entrepreneurs for big returns: Frustration at the slow pace of economic reform is forcing investors into the private sector Every month, thousands of Syrian investors make their way to the centre of Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, to collect substantial dividends on their savings. They pass the empty and dilapidated state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria, and enter plush and computerised offices of Anas Trading Corporation, run by a private sector entrepreneur, Mr Mohammad Kallas. There they receive a handsome yearly interest rate of between 30 and 40 per cent, paid in monthly instalments. Sums invested range from SPounds 5,000 (about Dollars 108) to SPounds 10m (about Dollars 217,400) and Mr Kallas has more than 4,000 individual investors on his books. While the Syrian government talks limply about opening a Damascus stock exchange and reforming the banking system, Mr Kallas' thriving business is already fulfilling such services. Few Syrians deposit their savings in the government banks. Although interest rates are between 5 and 12 per cent, annual inflation rates of over 15 per cent means they would lose in real terms. Since it is illegal to take local currency out of the country, ordinary Syrians frequently complain they have few places to put their money. Mr Kallas says he has a capital of more than SPounds 2bn from people of all walks of life. He explains that depositors' money is invested in the corporation's export-oriented industries, such as its clothes and cotton processing factories, fruit juice plants, and engineering shops. The interest paid on accounts is based on profit-margins and while a provisional rate is paid each month, the final dividends are calculated at the end of each year. Unlike a bank, however, there are no government guarantees against losses. There are no shareholder meetings, company reports, or regulations to protect investors from fraud. Aleppo remembers only too clearly a number of seemingly successful operations like Anas Trading which collapsed overnight in the late 1980s. And there are plenty of others offering the same kind of service as Mr Kallas who could go under anytime. Thus, predictably, the market is ultra-sensitive to rumours. Mr Kallas recounts that two months ago, speculation that Anas Trading had gone bust spread through Aleppo like fire. In one morning, depositors demanded the return of SPounds 60m which was paid the same day out of the export payments account and Mr Kallas' own pocket. Once people realised they could get their money back, however, most of it was re-deposited the next day, he says. At the root of Mr Kallas' success is widespread frustration among Syrians at the slow pace of economic reforms. Liberalisation of the economy began in the 1980s, but the essential pillars of a command economy - a massive public sector, over-valued exchange rate, trade restrictions and foreign exchange controls - remain intact. Although in many areas the private sector is doing well - benefiting especially from the Encouragement of Investment Law No 10 of 1991 which offers tax and import incentives - the regime remains cautious about relinquishing too much control. Privatisation of state assets is firmly off the agenda. The government says it prefers to 'reform' the banking system rather than open up to private and foreign banks, and the possibility of a Damascus stock exchange remains in the balance. Mr Rateb Shallah, president of the Syrian Chambers of Commerce, argues that opening a stock exchange would not only ease the current liquidity problem but allow more people to invest in the private sector. With over 950 projects approved under Law No 10 there is no shortage of private companies to enter a primary market. Mr Kallas says he would be the first formally to float his company. Furthermore, a bourse would provide the private sector with the kind of capital resources which domestic banks cannot. The draft bill for a stock exchange has been ready since last year for presentation to the People's Assembly for approval. Problems of regulation and control are cited as the main sticking point. But until the government makes up its mind, individual investors will have no choice but risk trusting their money with the likes of Mr Kallas.</p>

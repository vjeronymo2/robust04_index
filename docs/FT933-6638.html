			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Victaulic cites gas factor for drop to Pounds 5.8m VICTAULIC blamed reduced demand from British Gas for a 16 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 5.8m, in the six months to June 30 1993. The company makes pipeline products for the gas, water, and construction industries. Total turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 51.2m), but this included a contribution of Pounds 2.6m from Lindapter, a fixings company acquired late last year. Reduced sales of Pounds 48.9m from continuing operations mainly reflected a fall of Pounds 3m in the gas sector's turnover to Pounds 15m. The company warned in June that turnover would fall due to lower investment in pipeline infrastructure at British Gas because of uncertainty created by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. The MMC report, published on August 17, recommended that British Gas should retain its ownership of the gas distribution network. Mr David Stewart, Victaulic's managing director, said yesterday that if the MMC recommendations were accepted, positive benefits would start to emerge as the uncertainty surrounding gas distribution faded. But he foresaw no improvement in British Gas purchases this year, and added: 'Until we know the government view we are not committing ourselves.' The company had sought to offset the decline in gas pipeline sales by boosting exports to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 4.3m). This had been achieved across the board, taking advantage of weaker sterling and extra capacity available. Demand from the water industry was steady, with turnover unchanged at Pounds 22m. Net interest receivable was nil, compared with Pounds 400,000 in the 1992 first half. The company blamed lower UK interest rates and lower average cash balances after the Pounds 4.8m acquisition of Lindapter. Mr Stewart said the company had been earning interest in the UK to offset interest on Pounds 3.5m of borrowings in Europe. 'When interest rates reversed we replaced these borrowings,' he said, predicting an improvement in the second half. Earnings per share were 8.8p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p. The group continued to reduce costs, and working capital had been reduced from 19 per cent to 16 per cent of sales. Net cash generated was Pounds 3.3m. Net cash at the bank rose to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 6.3m). The shares, which fell by 20 per cent to 253p on June 17 after the warning of reduced turnover, closed yesterday up 5p at 301p.</p>

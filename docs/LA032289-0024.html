			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 100 NATIONS STRIVING TO AGREE ON PACT TO CURB TOXIC WASTE EXPORTS  </P> <P> An international conference on toxic waste grappled late Tuesday with the  difficult issue of the export by developed countries of poisonous garbage to  less-developed nations.  </P> <P> The meeting of more than 100 countries, arranged by the United Nations  Environmental Program, had agreed on the provisions for a treaty after 18  months of negotiations.  </P> <P> A draft of that treaty was submitted to the countries here in Basel, selected  as a meeting site by the United Nations partly because the Swiss are proud of  this city's cleanup of toxic problems caused by chemical plant emissions into  the Rhine River. However, after committee members' recommendations on the  treaty were sent to the full meeting, objections were raised.  </P> <P> Sources here said that most complaints came from nations that had not  participated in the year and a half of talks that attempted to narrow the toxic  waste issues.  </P> <P> "We thought that everyone was roughly agreed on a treaty," said one U.N.  official here late Tuesday, "but then we found there were many other nations  that suddenly sent delegates here who raised objections in the form of  amendments to the treaty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weight Against Industrial Nations Urged  </P> <P> These objections generally suggested that any convention should be heavily  weighted against those nations that export toxic wastes -- including the United  States and most other industrialized nations.  </P> <P> Greenpeace, the environmental organization, has been urging African nations to  support a ban on all exports of toxic -- or almost any other -- waste.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, aides to Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the U.N.  Environmental Program, said they thought that many nations will vote today in  favor of the idea of banning shipments of toxic waste.  </P> <P> However, they admitted that while some nations might agree to a treaty, most  others would simply indicate their assent to the idea that poisonous-waste  exports should be banned -- but would not necessarily commit themselves to such  laws.  </P></p>

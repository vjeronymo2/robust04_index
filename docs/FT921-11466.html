			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (3): Only a few stars - The principal industries at a glance A WIDE range of industrial sectors are in the midst of a deeply disruptive downturn forcing leading companies into far reaching reassessments of their strengths and weaknesses. Traditionally cyclical industries such as chemicals and steel were expecting lower demand, but not the potentially severe downturn which has emerged. In the car industry, recession in the US and some European markets has compounded the difficulty western producers face from a mounting Japanese challenge. These traditional manufacturing industries established before the second world war have been well worn by recessions since the 1970s. More dramatic is the position of some younger industries - aerospace, aviation and electronics. The aerospace industry is facing an historic decline in defence spending; aviation is in the midst of a financial turmoil; the electronics industries from computers and semi-conductors to consumer electronics are deeply troubled, almost for the first time since their birth, by sharply lower growth. One of the few bright stars is pharmaceuticals, an industry which appears to have been invulnerable to recession. What follows is a brief guide to the worldwide state of the main industrial sectors. Commercial Vehicles. Commercial vehicle makers, and in particular the truck producers, are enduring harsh challenges with sales falling in North America and in many western European markets. Sales and production have also declined for two years in Japan in 1989-90, though less dramatically. In Europe, German sales, which were robust last year, are expected to weaken this year. Leading truck makers in the US and Europe continue to accumulate heavy losses. Cars. Car makers are operating in an increasingly harsh financial climate with heavy losses particularly in the US in the face of fierce competition and recession. In Europe, several volume markets led by the UK, Spain and France, have been hurt by plunging sales, while the German industry is warning that demand cannot continue at the overheated levels of last year. Sales have weakened in Japan after several years of buoyant growth and the profits of some leading Japanese car makers are slipping. The focus of the Japanese challenge is likely to shift in the next two years from the US to Europe. Engineering. The machinery manufacturing industries have been hit by recession in the UK. In the US, demand has not picked up but it has stopped falling. In Asia, the trend of demand is down but not sharply. Sales into eastern Europe and the former USSR have come to a virtual standstill while the Middle East has not yet recovered from the Gulf war. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Differences in performance between dynamic pharmaceuticals companies and their more sluggish chemical counterparts were all too evident last year. Helped by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated drugs, the pharmaceuticals groups have proved to be inoculated against the insidious slowdown of the western economies. Most top European drugs companies reported sales growth averaging about 13 per cent over the past 12 months. In contrast, bulk chemical companies had a dreadful year and few expect much improvement this year although cost cutting programmes should start feeding into improved margins which have been squeezed by falling prices, lower demand and soaring environmental costs. Steel. Red ink is starting to flow thick and fast across the world's steel industry. The traditional integrated US steel makers are being severely tested again having barely recovered from the crisis of the 1980s. Even in Japan, the most stable and technologically sophisticated industry, profits are coming under severe pressure. MEPS, the Sheffield based steel consultancy, projects EC production in 1992 of about 129m tonnes, down from 132m tonnes in 1991. Japan's output is widely expected to fall about 4m tonnes, to about 107m tonnes this year. US production is forecast to be about 1 per cent on last year. Computers. The industry enters 1992 in disarray. The major hardware manufacturers are all in difficulties. IBM, the bellwether of the US industrial economy, had the worst year in its history - the first time growth had fallen on a year-on-year basis since 1946 and the first pretax loss in living memory. The surviving European owned manufacturers, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy, all lost money last year and have put in place wide-ranging recovery plans. The Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, which have hitherto grown strongly on the back of a healthy home market, faltered as problems with the powerful Japanese banks and hints of scandals in Tokyo shook business confidence. Consumer electronics. The growth of the consumer electronics industry in the last decade has come to a halt. The travails of the leading European producers such as Philips and Thomson are well known. Far less familiar are the across the board cuts in capital spending which have become the rule of the day in Japanese industry. Aerospace. The aerospace industry is bracing itself for another unstable and grim year as it adapts to the irrevocable decline in government defence spending and the recession in civil aviation which has taken a heavy toll of the fragile finances of many airlines. Restructuring is expected to lead to more job cuts in the defence sector as manufacturers grapple with the uncertainty of future defence programmes at the same time as they reduce capacity in the face of defence cuts. In the US alone, more than 100,000 people were laid off last year and the industry expects a further 36,000 to go this year. In Europe, the leading defence contractors are all in the throes of restructuring programmes which are likely to be affected by a series of important government decisions this year on the future of programmes such as the European Fighter Aircraft. New orders for commercial aircraft dropped sharply last year and are expected to remain flat this year. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, booked 252 aircraft valued at Dollars 20.26bn last year compared with a record 543 new aircraft orders in 1990. Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, booked 101 new aircraft orders compared with 404 the year before. Although international passenger traffic has started to recover during the last three months, airlines are still struggling to climb out of the recession and continue to face grave financial pressures. For the first time since World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline last year. The most immediate problem facing the airline industry is its low level of profitability. International losses last year are expected to total more than Dollars 4bn compared with a Dollars 2.7bn loss in 1990.</p>

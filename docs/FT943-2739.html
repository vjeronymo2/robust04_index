			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson sale attracts MEPC - Australian property portfolio could be worth up to ADollars 500m MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, has joined a large number of property investors negotiating the purchase of Hammerson's Australian property portfolio. The portfolio was valued at Pounds 175.9m in December, but could fetch as much as ADollars 500m (Pounds 238m). Under the guidance of Mr Ron Spinney, who took over as chief executive 15 months ago, Hammerson has been looking to realign its portfolio, concentrating on the UK and continental Europe. It has received approaches from up to seven investment groups, and has indicated that it plans to sell its entire portfolio, assuming sufficiently attractive prices. The main asset in the portfolio is the 1.05m sq ft Warringah Mall shopping centre, the second largest in the country, which is situated on Sydney's north shore. The centre is fully let, and Hammerson has planning permission for an extension. MEPC Australia has confirmed that it is interested in the portfolio, as has AMP Investment, the investment arm of the Australian insurance group. MEPC recently raised ADollars 1bn in debt to fund Australian acquisitions. Other interested parties are understood to include Lend Lease, Bankers Trust and Schroders. Hammerson has made it clear that it is in no hurry to dispose of these assets, which were marked down by close to 30 per cent in the previous two years. However, Australian property values have surged this year and analysts estimate that by the year end the Hammerson portfolio could have appreciated in value by up to 10 per cent, with stronger growth to come in 1995. The bulk of the portfolio was acquired during the early 1970's, although the Warringah Mall development was started in 1963. Investors' attention has been focused on the retail development. At the year end Communications House and 500 Collins Street, both Melbourne office properties, had occupancy rates of only 14.7 per cent and 68.5 per cent respectively. The portfolio had a 1993 rental income of Pounds 16.3m. Hammerson has gearing of about 60 per cent and is expected to have year-end net debt of about Pounds 750m. The sale could cut its debt by close to one-third and save the group about Pounds 1m a year in administration costs. Analysts said Hammerson would have to find attractive pricing to justify the Australian sale, as the portfolio currently offers a yield of about 9 per cent.</p>

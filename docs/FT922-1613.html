			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / W Europe new car sales down 4.9% NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 4.9 per cent in May, the sharpest monthly fall this year, chiefly because of an accelerating decline in new car demand in Germany. According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe in May fell to 1.19m from 1.25m in the same month a year ago. Sales last month were lower than a year ago in 10 of 17 markets across west Europe, with declines most significantly in Germany and France. New car sales in Germany are estimated to have fallen by 16.1 per cent last month to 359,000. Demand remained strong in Italy, however, with a rise in new car sales of 6.4 per cent, while sales increased by 6.2 per cent in Spain and 1.4 per cent in the UK. Hopes for the start of a significant recovery in demand in the UK had been kindled by the 9.1 per cent jump in new car registrations in April, the first monthly year-on-year increase in 30 months. Sales were only marginally higher in May, however, and car makers are becoming concerned that their forecasts for higher UK sales for the full year will soon have to be reduced, if the predicted recovery remains elusive. In the first five months of the year total west European new car sales were marginally lower than a year ago with a decline of 0.1 per cent to 6.221m. Sales were lower in eight and higher in nine markets across west Europe. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has established an unprecedented lead over its main rivals and captured 17.5 per cent of west European new car sales in the first five months, with a 4.9 per cent jump in volume. The competitive gap has widened thanks to the decline of the Fiat group of Italy. Ford of the US, which was briefly European market leader in the mid-1980s, has fallen back to fifth place and suffered a 5.5 per cent fall in sales (excluding Jaguar) in the first five months.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January-May 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units)   Change(%)  Jan-May 92  Jan-May 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET             6,221,000        -0.1       100.0       100.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volkswagen* (incl.       1,090,000        +4.9        17.5        16.7 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) Fiat (incl.

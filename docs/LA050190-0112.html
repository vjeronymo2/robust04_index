			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: LONDON;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS IN BRITAIN  </P> <P> Britain's hard-pressed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is likely to hear more  bad news from the voters Thursday as her countrymen elect 1,914 local council  members.  </P> <P> The latest polls indicate that her ruling Conservative Party will loose scores  of seats to the arch-rival Labor Party, which traditionally does better locally  than in general elections.  </P> <P> An unpopular local taxation scheme imposed by Thatcher's government is the key  issue behind Labor's 26% lead in recent surveys. If the polls are right,  Thursday's vote will increase the possibility of a leadership challenge within  the Conservative Party.  </P></p>

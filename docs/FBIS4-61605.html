			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file: "Transcaucasia Economic </F> News"]    [Text] Baku [Dateline as received]--The Russian Foreign  Ministry has proposed an initiative to settle issues regulating  border regime between Russia and Azerbaijan. The Russian  Foreign Ministry sent a written message to Baku with this  purpose.    Azim Dzharahmedov, the employee of the Russian Embassy in  Baku has affirmed that fact. According to him, Mr. Churkin, the  first deputy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, has sent a letter  to the Russian Embassy to Baku asking for starting consultations  with the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry for setting up the free  economic zone between Azerbaijan and Dagestan.    Mr. Dzharahmedov pointed out that means establishing of  joint-ventures, stock-companies, and organization of by-border  trade.    Russia suggests creating a commission that will carry out  work on realization of corresponding proposals.    The commission will consist of ministries' chiefs and also  the Dagestan Prime-Minister.    Mr. Dzharahmedov said the positive decision will be  beneficial both for Azerbaijan and Dagestan since only in the  Derbent region are 75 thousand Azerbaijanis and in the northern  regions of Azerbaijan are dozens thousand Lezgins, Avaries and  Lacks. As Mr. Dzharahmedov said "a creation of free economic  zone will keep and reinforce historical and cultural ties  between two neighboring countries."</p>

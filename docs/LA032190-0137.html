			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATIN AMERICA;  </P> <P> BRAZIL ECONOMY SPUTTERS UNDER REFORM  </P> <P> Forceful anti-inflation action by President Fernando Collor de Mello has  sharply reduced the Brazilian money supply, curtailing financial and commercial  activity.  </P> <P> After taking office last week, Collor froze 80% of all the money deposits in  bank accounts and financial funds -- an estimated $85 billion. The freeze  amounted to a moratorium on most of the government's $70-billion domestic debt,  because the debt was being turned over on the "overnight" financial market at  interest rates that reached 83% a month.  </P> <P> On Monday the "overnight" rate dropped to 18% a month.  </P> <P> Many Brazilian analysts said they expect the money shortage to cause a  recession. Jose Augusto Savazini, an economist with the University of Sao  Paulo, predicted a drop of 6% to 7% this year in industrial production.  </P> <P> Collor, in a television interview Sunday night, said the government could avoid  recession by releasing blocked deposits into the economy as needed to stimulate  commercial activity.  </P> <P> "There is not going to be a recession," he said, emphasizing that the tough  measures were necessary to stop inflation that was racing at more than 70% a  month.  </P> <P> Stock markets in Rio and Sao Paulo were paralyzed Monday and barely stirred  Tuesday, and commerce went into a deep slump.  </P> <P> The newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo said supermarket sales Monday in Brazil's  largest city were 30% to 40% below normal levels. Silvio Cunha, president of  the Store Directors Club in Rio, said retail sales there have dropped by 90%.  </P> <P> "Without sales, we'll have to lay people off," Cunha said.  </P> <P> Government officials, however, said if widespread layoffs begin, authorities  will take countermeasures such as increasing the period of advance notice  required to dismiss employees.  </P> <P> "The president, the minister of economy and the minister of labor have insisted  to businessmen that they not practice dismissals," Labor Minister Antonio  Rogelio Magri said. "The government has mechanisms to prevent this from  happening."  </P> <P> The freeze on deposits applies to amounts of more than about $1,200 in savings  and checking accounts. It also blocks 80% of individual investments in  financial funds or investments of more than $600, whichever amount is higher.  </P> <P> The "provisional measure" says the government's central bank will retain the  frozen deposits for 18 months, paying real interest of 6% a year and returning  them in 12 monthly installments. Officials said deposits could be returned  early if the anti-inflation plan is successful.  </P> <P> Companies with money in financial funds will be permitted to draw up to $12,000  of it to pay salaries and, if that is not enough, to use blocked deposits as  collateral for loans, officials said. Many middle-income Brazilians are upset  over the freeze on deposits. Some commentators called it a confiscation. But  Collor said the freeze will affect only about 10% of the population.  </P> <P> To distinguish between frozen funds and circulating money, the government  changed the name of Brazil's currency from novo cruzado back to cruzeiro, the  name it had until 1986. The cruzeiro has the same value as the novo cruzado.  </P> <P> The new president also froze prices temporarily. In mid-April, authorities will  calculate a pre-set indexer that will set legal price increases for the  following 30 days.  </P> <P> Federal police and other government agents monitored stores Tuesday throughout  Brazil, enforcing an official price list. Another measure provides for fines  and up to five years in jail for "economic abuses," including overpricing.  </P> <P> The provisional measures must be approved by the Congress to stay in effect for  more than a month.  </P> <P> TOURISM DROPS: Pollution and crime are keeping visitors away from Rio de  Janeiro.

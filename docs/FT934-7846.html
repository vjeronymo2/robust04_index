			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the Chinese AFTER 15 years of market-oriented reform, China is transforming itself into an economically liberal, open and powerful market economy. Its cities look more and more like other Asian cities with new office and apartment blocks, busy department stores, karaoke bars, and traffic jams caused by cars instead of bicycles. The economic achievement of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader since reform began, is already substantial, as today's FT survey, makes clear. And this process is almost certainly irreversible: political power is too decentralised, the constituency which has benefited from reform too widespread and entrenched. Yet for the outside world, the enduring image of China remains that of tanks crushing the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square, a dark reminder that China's spectacular economic success has been built on a repressive one-party state. It is this contrast between China's economic dynamism and political backwardness which continue to make China's relations with the rest of the world so difficult. The country is, without doubt, an economic force to be reckoned with, as demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, will hold one-to-one meetings with the Japanese, South Korean and US leaders at this week's Apec meeting in Seattle. Companies from east Asia and, increasingly, the US, have responded to China's open door policy by investing billions of dollars. The rest of the world's economic stake in China's development is large and growing fast. Inefficient bureaucracy Not that the reality of China's economic development fully lives up to its image. The state enterprise sector remains an inefficient drain on the economy, social welfare provision is undeveloped and 100m Chinese still live in absolute poverty. Reform has also brought problems. By unleashing strong provincial ambitions, Beijing has weakened its ability to exercise macroeconomic control. Meanwhile, huge ranks of poorly-paid bureaucrats, still with considerable powers, mean that China's bureaucracy is both inefficient and riddled with corruption. But it is the manner in which China conducts its internal affairs which remains the biggest problem for many outsiders, particularly in America. The rule of law and freedom of speech remain subservient to the party line, while documented human rights abuses are legion. Little wonder that the US has been tempted to link economic concessions - in particular on trade - to progress on non-economic issues. Human rights President Bill Clinton's success in persuading Congress to renew China's Most Favoured Nation status this year depended, in part, on his willingness to link next year's renewal to China demonstrating 'substantial progress' in tackling human rights abuses, progress which China has yet to demonstrate convincingly. Yet to try to ostracise China from the world community or to blunt its open economic development with trade restrictions would be a grievous error. Market reform in China may be irreversible, but the outside world has the power to speed or impede that process. And the pace at which this change occurs is, almost certainly, the most important determinant of the rate of political change. The evidence from elsewhere - South Korea and Taiwan are good examples  - is that economic growth and liberalisation intensify the pressure for political freedom and democratic change. Closing the door on China, and thus effectively slowing the flow of western capital, practices and ideas into the country, can only slow that change. In short, renewal of China's MFN status is the best way to encourage political change, a fact that in recent weeks Mr Clinton has shown he recognises. His desire to engage China in a co-operative rather than antagonistic relationship is the right course. China's new wealth and status mean that it too has bigger responsibilities - to honour its obligations to counter nuclear proliferation, accelerate progress on human rights and resolve outstanding trade disputes. But progress is more likely to be achieved if US concerns are carefully explained rather than delivered with menaces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ryo Sano] </F>   [Text] In view of the approaching 11 February Japan-U.S.  summit meeting, the bilateral framework trade talks have entered  the final stage. However, concern has been growing over the  apparent lack of mutual trust between the bureaucrats of the two  nations who are in charge of the trade talks. The two nations  have been at odds over setting "objective criteria" to measure  progress in market access, and hardly any progress has been made  in the talks. As a result, the United States continues to step  up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats. Concern voiced by  former Japanese bureaucrats has also been noted.    "Japanese negotiators like to stay up all night. They do not  show what is up their sleeves until the eleventh hour.  Americans are nice, so they show their hands right away." In a  recent visit to Japan, U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan E.  Spero, who is in charge of the negotiations, made these remarks  during a news conference at the Japan National Press Club on 12  January. She thus complained it was the fault of Japanese  bureaucrats for causing the two nations to still fail to see  points where they could agree in the trade talks despite the  fact that the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is less than a month  away.    In response to such "bashing of Japanese bureaucrats" by  U.S.  officials, Keio University professor Makoto Utsumi, in a lecture  at the Japan National Press Club on 14 January, said: "What is  making the current trade talks difficult is distrust between  Japanese and U.S. negotiators." Utsumi, who formerly served as  deputy vice minister for financial affairs at the Ministry of  Finance, thus expressed his concern on the outcome of the trade  talks.    Concerning current Japan-U.S. relations, Utsumi considers  the  affinitive relationship between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton as one of the positive factors.  However, he points out that "U.S. negotiators seem to think  rather simply that just because Prime Minister Hosokawa enjoys  high popularity, the Japanese Government should be able to do  anything, but cannot because the bureaucrats are bad." Utsumi  explained that the good relations between the leaders seem to  act in reverse and lead to bureaucrat bashing.    Furthermore, Utsumi criticized the United States, saying:  "Since Prime Minister Hosokawa is a lord, he does not go out to  directly persuade those concerned. This is the bureaucrats' job  in Japan. Therefore, it does not do any good for the United  States to go on bashing Japanese bureaucrats."    Explaining that the United States has misunderstandings,  Utsumi offered the following advice to ensure the trade talks  proceed smoothly: "First, the two nations should look for  points where they can agree so they do not have to criticize  each other. Second, they should take up working on bilateral  cooperation in practical areas. From there, they should build up  mutual confidence. This is necessary above all."    Tentatively, the focal point of the Japan-U.S. framework  trade talks is a vice ministerial meeting to be held on 25  January in Washington. Talks are expected to be held to the  very limit on individual trade sectors which include automobiles  and auto parts, insurance services, and government procurement.  As the United States steps up bureaucrat bashing, Japanese  Government officials who are actively engaged in the  negotiations are deliberately trying to remain calm.    One Japanese negotiator has said: "In negotiations, there is  bargaining up to the last moment. Some Japanese and U.S.  negotiators are personal friends. Therefore, I do not think  feelings of mutual distrust will grow." Mutual distrust would  be detrimental to building new bilateral ties. It is hoped that  calm, constructive discussions will be conducted during the  trade talks.</p>

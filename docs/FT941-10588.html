			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Elf may reduce stake in refinery A meeting aimed at resolving differences over one of eastern Germany's largest investment projects will take place today between Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand privatisation agency, and Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group. Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as Elf chairman last August, is seeking to reduce his company's stake in the Leuna refinery from 65 per cent to 35 per cent as part of his strategy of curbing investments and increasing profits at the oil group. Elf, which is in the final stages of privatisation, saw net profits fall from FFr6.2bn in 1992 to FFr1.1bn (Pounds 120m) last year. The rebuilding of the Leuna refinery, based in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, is seen as a crucial element of the Treuhand's long-term strategy for the region. It wants the refinery to provide the basis for a petrochemical industry developed around Leuna, as well as provide jobs in a depressed region of eastern Germany. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, had already told Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart and Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, that the uncertainty surrounding such an important project must be removed. Under the terms of the 1992 agreement with the Treuhand, Elf undertook to rebuild with Thyssen Handelsunion the refinery with a total investment commitment of DM4.3bn (Pounds 1.64bn). The aim was to develop by 1996 a facility with a capacity of about 10m tonnes per year and secure at least 1,000 jobs. British Petroleum and Statoil had also competed for Leuna, but could not match Elf's much larger investment commitments. Under the deal, the French company gained control of the Minol network of service stations in eastern Germany. Elf has repeatedly said it would find new partners for its reduced stake in Leuna. It is even considering reducing annual capacity to 8m in order to reduce the total investment requirement. But Treuhand officials yesterday said the company had found 'no takers'. It remains unclear if Elf's contract with Minol would be affected if it reduced its stake without finding partners. In any case, Treuhand officials confirmed it reserved the legal right to impose penalties for any breach of contract. The Leuna investment project is backed by subsidies amounting to about 35 per cent of the total investment. Despite opposition from Germany's oil companies, which criticised the subsidies on the grounds of unfair competition, the federal government in Bonn, the European Commission, the Leuna board, and President Francois Mitterrand pushed hard for Elf's acquisition of Leuna and Minol.</p>

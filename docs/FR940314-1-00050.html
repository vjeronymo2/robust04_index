			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA requests comments on the approach described above. Based on its review of the comments, the agency may provide in the final rule that companies claiming the exemption will be required to permit inspection of supporting documentation or to submit any required information to the agency, as appropriate. Given the late date of this proposal, however, the agency would not make these requirements effective for notices of exemption for 1994&hyph;95. Many small firms, in contemplation of the fact that most small businesses must file a notice, have already filed notices without any indication from the agency as to how it intends to enforce the implementation requirements. Because FDA believes that people should have full notice of the requirements that will apply to them when they file a notice of exemption, and because requiring small firms to refile based on any final rule would significantly undercut the efficient enforcement purposes of a records access requirement, FDA would make these requirements applicable to notices seeking exemption beginning with the period from May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996. Nevertheless, companies filing for an exemption would still be subject to the statutory requirement in section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, and, although the procedural requirements for complying with this section would not be effective until 1995, companies should still be prepared to provide information to FDA to support their notices of exemption should FDA question the validity of any information contained in those notices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reflecting new section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii) of the act, the agency is providing in proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) that a firm that is not an importer and that has an average of fewer than 10 full-time equivalent employees does not have to file notice for any product for which it has sales of less than 10,000 units in any year for it to be eligible for the small business exemption for that product. The agency would suggest, however, that such a company submit a notice to the Office of Food Labeling (HFS&hyph;150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, to establish a record that it is claiming a small business exemption for some or all of its products. (The Office of Food Labeling is the office within FDA that has responsibility for food labeling issues.) The agency intends to make available to FDA and State enforcement offices a list of the names and addresses of firms that have claimed the small business exemption and the names of the products for which they have claimed the exemption. The agency intends to include on this list the names of firms that have fewer than 10 employees and sales of fewer than 10,000 units of a particular product. Such firms are not required to file a notice but can choose to do so voluntarily. FDA believes that the appearance of a product's name on the list will eliminate any questions about its eligibility for an exemption. Thus, even though not required, the submission of a notice of a claimed small business exemption for a food product may be in the best interest of a firm. FDA also intends to include in the list the names of firms eligible for the small business exemption provided in &sect;&sect;101.109(j)(1)(i) and 101.36(f)(2)(i) if they file notice with the Office of Food Labeling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All notices must be filed by May 7, 1994, for the 12-month period beginning May 8, 1994, the date that the new mandatory nutrition labeling regulations become effective. The notice is to be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (address above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that time is growing short for the filing of notices to FDA, and that firms may be anxious to file the notice for claimed exemption. As an interim measure and to assure that all necessary information is submitted, FDA suggests that firms follow the procedures proposed in this document if they file a notice with FDA before the agency issues final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it has received numerous inquiries as to whether a form exists for the submission of the notice, FDA is providing in Appendix I of this document, a model form, along with instructions for completing it in Appendix II of this document. This model form may be used by firms to supply notice of their claimed exemptions. FDA advises, however, that it is not necessary to use this form. The agency also advises that the small business exemption for a food product will be in effect once a notice has been filed with FDA, even though it may be necessary for the Office of Food Labeling to work with the firm that is filing the notice to address deficiencies in the notice. Although no action by the agency is required, FDA will attempt to review all notices to ensure that they are complete and to notify companies of the receipt of the notice, and whether additional information needs to be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

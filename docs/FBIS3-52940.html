He said  this in a statement opening the news conference he held in  Riyadh today at the conclusion of his visit to the Kingdom.  [passage omitted]. The prime minister further said: We have  agreed on coordination, consultation, and dialogue at all levels  between state bodies as well as between companies, with a  periodic exchange of views in order to assess bilateral  relations and bolster the ties of cooperation in all fields, and  to give fresh momentum to economic and trade cooperation.    The French prime minister mentioned the domains of  cooperation that had been discussed, such as energy and defense,  and he said: We have decided to set up a team of experts to  complete the projects for cooperation which have already been  discussed, examined, and prepared in detail, and which we want  to start carrying out. [passage omitted]    Naturally, the French prime minister said, we discussed the  situation in the region and recent events there, and we  reaffirmed the need for the full implementation of the UN  resolutions. Concerning the problems of the region at large, he  said, we both stressed our full support for a just and  comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem on the basis  of the Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [passage  omitted].    The prime minister affirmed that his visit was aimed at  giving a fresh impetus to relations between the two countries,  and at laying down the principles that will clearly govern these  relations. He denied that his visit was to conclude precise and  defined contracts. He told journalists that France and the  Kingdom had decided to set up a working team to discuss a number  of projects of cooperation in the two friendly countries,  complete what has been achieved, and secure progress in these  matters. [passage omitted].    For his part, and to a question on the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who  took part in the news conference, pointed out that he had  discussed this matter with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal, and he had the chance to explain the French and  European diplomacy on this matter. He said: I believe that I  have given a useful and detailed explanation to Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal that permits the strengthening of common understanding  aimed at a peaceful settlement of this issue. He expressed his  regret at the appalling deterioration of the situation, and he  blamed all the parties to the conflict for rejecting the peace  plans. [passage omitted]    On the other hand, with regard to the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and what he learned in the Kingdom concerning  the Saudi position in this respect, the French prime minister  expressed understanding for the concern of Saudi Arabia toward  this part of the world. He said that at the talks, he had tried  to explain the French position and that of the European Union  with a view to breaking the vicious circle surrounding the  problem. [passage omitted]</p>

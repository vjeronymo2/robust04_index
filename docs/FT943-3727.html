			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / BBC plans to start digital radio in 1995 The BBC plans to start network radio transmissions of digital audio broadcasting next September. The development is the most important in radio technology for 40 years. After next year's launch, the BBC plans to extend the broadcasts, which provide compact-disc quality distortion-free audio to both car radios and portable sets, to 60 per cent of the country within the next few years. Although experimental transmissions are either under way or promised in a number of other European countries and Canada, the BBC is believed to be the first broadcaster to have committed itself to providing a service. Mr Phil Lavin, controller of engineering, outlined the BBC's plans in London yesterday at the first plenary session of the UK DAB Forum, set up last year by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to encourage the development of the new broadcasting technology. The BBC, as a public-service broadcaster funded by a universal licence fee, has decided that it should begin broadcasts to stimulate the market for the special radio sets that will be needed to receive the broadcasts. The corporation hopes to have covered the main urban areas of the UK and the motorway network by 1998. Further expansion will depend on the success of the system. Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, which regulates commercial radio, said yesterday the key to success was a strong signal from a major broadcaster. He said: 'We value the BBC's ability to take the lead in introducing new broadcasting technology in partnership with the private sector.' He expected one or two commercial broadcasters to come in 'at or near the leading edge', with others joining later. Apart from proving a better-quality signal, the system is more efficient in its use of the radio spectrum and its use could ultimately allow an expansion in choice. Mr Richard Norman, chairman of the executive council of Breema, the consumer electronics trade body, said yesterday a group of companies was working to develop a low-cost design for a receiver, based on purpose-built microchips. The companies have formed a development club which includes Ensigma, a company which has experience in the design of the sort of complex chips needed. The BBC approach in pioneering a digital audio broadcast service could provide a model for the introduction of digital terrestrial television in the UK.</p>

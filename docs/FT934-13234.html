			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals help A Fisher - Shares fall after chairman strikes cautious note on current year outcome SHARES IN Albert Fisher fell 5p to 75p yesterday after the food processing and distribution group struck a cautious note when announcing its annual results. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.5m in the year to August 31, compared with a restated Pounds 25.9m under FRS 3. This was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 15.4m to cover disposals, compared with Pounds 34.2m previously. Total sales rose from Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 1.28bn. Mr Stephen Walls, executive chairman, said: 'The outcome for the current year will continue to be affected by the pace of economic recovery in our markets as well as the need for restoration of greater balance in supply and demand in key products and markets.' However, he also stated that there had been considerable progress made in repositioning the group by strengthening management, reducing costs, acquiring complementary businesses and disposing of non-core operations. Operating income from European food processing fell from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 21.5m. The company blamed a large part of the decline to Mondi Foods, its frozen fruit and fruit concentrate business, which was hit by a worldwide glut of apples and the political upheaval in eastern Europe, which resulted in large falls in volumes and prices. The European seafood division increased operating income from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 10m. The group said synergies between the companies had been realised during the year, particularly the networking of sales. Operating income from the European fresh produce division fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 6.4m. North American fresh produce increased operating income from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 11.6m. Early signs of recovery in the south-east of the US were not sustained consistently in the second half, and the West Coast  - in particular southern California  - continued in recession. Earnings per share rose to 2.49p (1.78p). The final dividend was held at 1.9p to maintain the final at 3.75p. COMMENT The share price fall was not surprising, given the caution over trading and the fact that the shares had already doubled in the last year. The City is pleased that Mr Walls seems to have completed the first phase of his clean-up after the reign of his acquisitive predecessor, Mr Tony Millar. However, serious doubts remain over whether the group can secure high-margin business  - or will remain dogged by the random fall-out from produce gluts, crop failures and political turmoil. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 53m put the shares on an undemanding prospective multiple of 12.5. They are underpinned at that level by a yield of more than 6 per cent. There seems little downside at this level, but the shares will not be significantly uprated unless and until profits represent a more significant proportion of sales.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/Vienna (DPA) -- On Tuesday [17 May] the  foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands, Klaus Kinkel  and Pieter Kooijmans, took the first steps in Vienna to equip  the CSCE with the right to clear majority decisions. The  German-Dutch initiative presented to the Steering Committee of  the 52-nation CSCE was published by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  and is addressed to the summit of the CSCE heads of state and  government, which will be held in Budapest from 7 to 9 December.    Kinkel and Kooijmans demand from the December summit the  right for the CSCE to call on the UN Security Council, to work  out recommendations, and to support their implementation by the  United Nations if necessary also without the approval of the  affected or defendant members. The two ministers voiced the  demand for a considerable strengthening of the position of the  secretary general, which is currently occupied by German  diplomat Wilhelm Hoeynck. In certain areas he is to be able to  call for majority decisions and to initiate himself immediate  measures in critical situations involving members, such as  observer missions.</p>

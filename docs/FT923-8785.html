			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed in late dollar intervention THE FEDERAL RESERVE intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prop up the dollar yesterday after disappointing employment figures had pushed the currency down by around two pfennigs against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. The Fed bought dollars shortly after the European close as the currency dipped below DM1.47. The US central bank later bought the currency at DM1.4725 and DM1.4735 in its second intervention in the market in less than three weeks. Shortly after the Fed's move, the dollar was trading up at DM1.4750, having risen about one pfennig in 10 minutes. But by the end of New York trading it dropped back to DM1.4668 despite further apparent intervention by the Fed and the Bank of Canada. The fall in the dollar followed the release of the much-awaited non-farm payroll figure for July. This showed an increase of 198,000, confirming the generally sluggish growth of the US economy. It was a disappointing figure because dealers had been expecting a rise of anything up to 300,000 for July. One analyst said that when the summer jobs creation scheme and the fall in June employment by 63,000 were taken into account, the figures looked a good deal worse. 'Employment is growing by an average of around 30,000 a month,' he said. 'That's far too slow for an economy that is supposed to be climbing out of recession.' Another London-based analyst said the market had been adversely affected by overnight comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President. His suggestion that the concerted central bank intervention to prop up the dollar on July 20 had been undertaken to counter disorderly market conditions may have given traders the impression that it was a one-off event. 'We had disorderly conditions,' said Mr Schlesinger. ' and I am not aware of any exact target level for dollar-mark.' Analysts believe that the dollar could test new lows next week, especially if the retail sales figures for July come in lower than expected. The D-Mark's stronger performance against the dollar fed through to cross trading. The pound fell to a DM2.8250 close compared to a previous close of DM2.8280. At one stage it had dipped to DM2.8232 against the D-Mark, a new low since sterling joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990. The Italian lira closed down at L757.2 against the D-Mark, compared to a previous finish of L756.00. The Bank of Italy's recent cut in its discount rate may have had an adverse effect on the currency. The Bank's repurchase agreements in the lira money market were at a rate of 14.20 per cent yesterday, compared to a recent peak of 17.56 per cent.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / How to make the most of life: A look at an attempt in the UK financial services industry to meet customer needs The warning on the life insurance policy was written, with suitable severity, in block capitals. Key words were underlined. The gist was simple: if you do not like our terms for surrendering policies early, too bad. That was 60 years ago. Mr John Hylands, head of marketing at Standard Life (not the company cited above), says: 'Then people who left early had 'broken their contract', and received what the life company out of the kindness of its heart decided to shell out. 'No one today would take that line, it's not viable any more.' Instead, companies try harder to find ways of keeping their customers. The change of attitude is one example of a trend by life companies towards creating financial services products that better suit the customer. 'We have moved away from the paternalism of the old days, when a chief actuary would come up with a policy which he thought would be good for people, and then the sales force went out and sold it,' one chief executive comments. 'Now we try to respond to what the customer wants.' Designing products that suit people appears so obvious a marketing strategy that its relative novelty seems surprising. Executives say one reason why it has taken so long to come about is the complexity of many financial products, which makes them difficult to devise and often confusing for the customers. But now change is being forced on the industry. Consumers are becoming more sophisticated - and increasingly wary of an industry with a reputation for hard selling policies which may be inappropriate for customers. Demand for life insurance products where the customer pays regular premiums  -currently the biggest part of the market - is falling. Income from such policies fell from Pounds 2.04bn in 1991 to Pounds 1.75bn last year. In 1991, some 5.77m regular premium policies were taken out; by 1993 that had fallen to 4.46m. At the same time, new standards are being set by the industry's regulators. From next January, the Personal Investment Authority, which protects the private investor, will insist life companies give customers more information about the costs of selling a life policy and the commission paid to advisers. Life companies are responding to these regulatory and demand pressures in two ways. First, they are making their products more flexible. Sun Alliance, the large life insurer, earlier this year launched a life policy under which the cover provided can be varied. For instance, a customer could make provision for a bigger payout while he has dependent children and then reduce the cover when they have grown up. Premiums vary accordingly - or could be varied anyway, according to the customers' financial circumstances over time. Second, as part of the move towards greater flexibility and transparency, life companies are starting to split - or 'unbundle' - the two parts of a life policy: the 'protection' part which pays out on death or serious injury; and the investment part which pays out a lump sum when the policy expires. Earlier this year, for example, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, launched two policies: Prudence Family Cover and the Prudence Savings Account - which split the insurance and savings elements respectively of a conventional product. Under the scheme, the proportion of 'protection' to 'savings' can be decided by the customer Several other companies plan to launch similarly flexible products in the autumn and beyond. 'There is a whole trend towards more flexible and complex products,' says Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager. The trend towards greater product flexibility and unbundling have been welcomed by the Consumers' Association. Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's financial specialist, says for 'too long life companies have been able to get away with selling packaged products' when a more flexible approach may have benefited customers. But the trend offers the life companies an important advantage as well: a means of combating increasing competition from other forms of long-term savings. By offering customised policies, life companies should be able to compete more effectively with, for instance, unit trusts or deposit accounts. In an uncertain economic climate, in which customers are reluctant to make long-term commitments because of fears of job or wage cuts, such flexibility is in increasing demand. This has been shown by the fact that in recent years the number of regular premium policies sold has fallen while sales of single-premium polices have risen. Another advantage for the life companies is that greater flexibility in premium payments should mean fewer customers giving up their policies early. This has been a particular problem for the past couple of years: on one industry expert's estimate, 23 per cent of life policies are surrendered at the end of the first year. A lapsed policy not only means a lost income stream for the company, it may also mean an upset customer who will not buy the company's products again. Moreover, the high lapse rate draws attention to the relatively low surrender value of many life policies, attracting further damaging publicity. Life companies were forced on to the defensive in June by a report from the Office of Fair Trading showing that some savings plans offered very poor surrender values. While economic circumstances and the problems of the life industry mean companies have little option but to move quickly towards offering greater flexibility, there are drawbacks. The main problem for the companies is likely to be lower margins. As consumers become aware of the policy charges, competition will intensify, even if the volume of business expands. 'Industry margins will be under terrific pressure over the next few years,' says Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the life insurance company. Unbundling products holds specific dangers. As the split between protection and investment becomes more common, protection-only policies could be treated like motor insurance, with quotes available by the telephone. By putting greater emphasis on price, this would add to the pressure on margins. At the same time, the investment plans would have to compete more directly with other forms of savings - for instance Personal Equity Plans - offered by other financial institutions such as banks and building societies. Some life companies also warn that a general move towards unbundling may not necessarily benefit the consumer. They argue that buying protection separately over the telephone would mark a departure from the approach to selling financial services urged by the Personal Investment Authority, and its parent regulator the Securities and Investments Board. The two regulators say that sales representatives should take account of a customer's overall financial needs if they are to offer sensible financial planning advice. Though Ms Eaglesham of the Consumers' Association thinks the life companies are protesting too much, she agrees there is a risk to consumers in separating the components of life policies. The answer, she says, is to bring protection-only policies within the remit of the Personal Investment Authority. The industry would argue against such an extension of regulatory controls - particularly given that the trend towards greater flexibility has only just begun to gather pace. It will not be clear until figures are released next year whether the life industry is selling more policies as a result of the shift. But one point is already clear: making life simpler for the customer does not make life easier for insurers.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- LIFE INSURANCE: ENSURING A MARKET  -------------------------------------------------------------------        Yearly Premium Prices                  Single Premium Prices  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Life          Number of        New       Number of           New Insurance   new policies     premiums   new policies      premiums                 (000s)      (Pounds m)     (000s)        (Pounds m)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989            6,788        1,769            *            4,234 1990            6,655        1,934            *            4,829 1991            5,769        2,037           681           6,397 1992            5,285        1,899           980           7,970 1993            4,464        1,745         1,185          11,162  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of British Insurers * Included under yearly premium policies  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

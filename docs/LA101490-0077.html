			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIMITS ON FILM CREWS PROPOSED  </P> <P> Film crews working in downtown San Pedro would face new restrictions on  shooting schedules and parking under a proposal unveiled last week by the  community's Downtown Business Assn.  </P> <P> The restrictions include forbidding outdoor filming two weeks before Christmas  and parking by film crews within the downtown area bounded by 5th and 7th  streets, between Center Street and Pacific Avenue.  </P> <P> The proposal follows a survey of downtown merchants showing continued support  for filming in the community if restrictions are enacted.  </P> <P> "We are trying to strike a compromise between the business owners and the film  industry," association President William Manuel said.  </P> <P> "We understand some filming will occur. We also understand it sometimes  interferes with businesses," Manuel said. "We're not going to be able to avoid  all of the problems, but we hope these restrictions will avoid some."  </P> <P> The proposed restrictions on filming will be sent to the Los Angeles city Board  of Public Works, where officials have expressed a willingness to consider  restrictions, Manuel said.  </P></p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Schnittke Series - Music in London In this, his 60th birthday, Alfred Schnittke's position as the natural successor to Shostakovich as Russia's leading composer seems unassailable. Schnittke festivals are on the increase, his discography is - for a serious contemporary composer - massive, and his rate of production - especially given his precarious state of health and his need to make statements on a large scale - shows no sign of dwindling. For his admirers, he is as much moral inspiration as pure musician: they speak passionately of his work's overwhelming emotional intensity and of his giving voice in dark and dangerous times to the soul of an oppressed Russian people. These are strong claims, but are they justified by the musical reality? Do the ends - the powerful communication of non-musical truths - justify the means? Can we turn a deaf ear to the relative crudity of Schnittke's techniques, not least his juxtapositions of avant-garde cliches and quotations from the whole gamut of musical history? Or should we expect more from a composer of his stature than a language in which the ideas behind the music are more important than the music itself, and in which the actual notes dissolve into a rhetoric whose only raison d'etre seems to be dictated by the composer's own freely associating anxieties? 'Perhaps' and 'sometimes' may be the answers, but not, I think, on the basis of the three Schnittke pieces given exemplary performances by the London Sinfonietta in the opening concert of the Barbican Centre's Schnittke Series on Friday. The shortest, Three by Seven, proved a slight, rather dry and schematic exchanges between harpsichord and instrumental ensemble. The earliest, Quasi una sonata of 1987 for violin and chamber orchestra, a reworking of his Second Violin Sonata of 1968, was a typical head-on collision between sounds from the 1960s avant-garde and quotes from Beethoven and Brahms, which ignores the purely musical implications of its material in favour of hollow gestures and temper tantrums. The most recent, Five Fragments on Pictures by Hieronymous Bosch, receiving its recourse to rudimentary melody-plus-chords textures, sounded dangerously undercomposed. Ironically, it was the work of two of Schnittke's compatriots which offered the main musical interest of the evening. Life without Christmas - Daytime Prayers by Giya Kancheli was a gentle, Goreckian meditation for clarinet and ensemble, capped by the arrival of a boy soprano to sing a Latin prayer. More striking was Alexander Raskatov's Xenia, another delicate, meditative work, evolving logically from shimmering tintinnabulations and revealing a fine ear for subtle shifts of colour, new orchestral sonorities and some appealingly quirky changes of direction. The Schnittke Series continues at the Barbican Centre tonight and November 17.</p>

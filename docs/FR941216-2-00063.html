This final reissued NPDES general permit contains effluent limitations, prohibitions, reporting requirements and other conditions on facilities which discharge uncontaminated groundwater associated with dewatering or treated groundwater and/or storm water incidental to the groundwater cleanup operation which have been contaminated by automotive gasoline, aviation and/or diesel fuels. This permit authorizes discharges from facilities currently located in and discharging to surface waters within the political boundary of the State of Florida, and any new treatment facilities placed in operation during the term of this permit. Reissuance of this final NPDES will allow general dewatering and cleanup actions at petroleum contaminated sites to begin without the delays of individual NPDES permit issuance procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For facilities seeking coverage for general dewatering discharges, coverage under the general permit is automatic, upon the permittee's receipt of acceptable groundwater screening values, as described in Part I.A.3(c) of the general permit. The effluent from these general dewatering activities shall be monitored within thirty (30) days after commencement of the discharge and once every six months for the life of the project to maintain coverage under the general permit. Additionally, short-term pump tests, eight (8) hours in duration or less, shall be automatically covered upon receipt of the permittee's Notice of Intent (NOI) by EPA and the permittee will be responsible for meeting the requirements of Parts I.A.1 or A.2. DMRs shall be submitted within thirty (30) days after completion of the pump test discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for facilities meeting the above conditions, all other facilities seeking coverage under the general permit by NOI requests will be responded to by written notification of coverage by certified mail from the Director, Water Management Division, U.S. EPA Region IV. This method of notification will be applicable to both new dischargers applying for coverage for the first time and existing dischargers which are seeking coverage under the reissued general permit. Facilities which are currently discharging under the previous NPDES general permit are required to submit another NOI requesting coverage under the reissued general permit by February 14, 1995, in accordance with Part II, Section F(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This general permit is effective on December 7, 1994, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dates for coverage: (1) Dewatering Activity discharges are authorized upon the permittee's receipt of acceptable groundwater screening values listed in Part I.A.3.

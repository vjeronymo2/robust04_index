			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV VIEWERS RISE UP TO DEFEND THE 'MARRIED' LIFE  </P> <P> It's frightening what kind of influence one person can have. Several weeks ago  Terry Rakolta, a housewife from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., a wealthy Detroit  suburb, launched a passionate, half-crazed, one-woman letter-writing campaign  to protest what she considers anti-family and sexual sentiments in the TV  sitcom, "Married . . . With Children." The action prompted at least one sponsor  to terminate its advertising and several others to consider doing so.  </P> <P> I respect Ms. Rakolta's opinions, but she in no way speaks for me or the  millions of other viewers who enjoy this show. If she can't appreciate its  offbeat, adult humor, she has several options, including turning the TV set off  or to another program.  </P> <P> I am disappointed in some of the show's sponsors, who seem to have about as  much backbone as a chocolate eclair.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P> <P>  See today's article on FOX TV programming, Page 4. On March 8 Calendar ran two  articles under the headline "'Married' . . . With Controversy" and on March 4  published a report headed "Won't Yield to Attack on Show, Fox Says."  </P></p>

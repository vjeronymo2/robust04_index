			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: IoD chief demands cut in interest rates THE LEADER of the Institute of Directors, yesterday called on the government to cut interest rates to 8 per cent in the aftermath of the French referendum. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director general, also called on the prime minister not to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He said implementation in the present form would be 'the height of folly' because of dissatisfaction in France and elsewhere. The treaty was designed by 'other people' with other interests and there was never anything in it for Britain. The European exchange rate mechanism had been exposed as a 'multilateral shambles' which had destroyed many businesses, added Mr Morgan.</p>

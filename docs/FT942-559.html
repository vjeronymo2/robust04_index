			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Conseco set to buy Kemper in 1980s style Kemper, the US insurance and mutual funds group, has accepted a Dollars 67-a-share bid from smaller rival Conseco, in one of the biggest leveraged acquisitions of a US financial company. Kemper's decision had been expected after GE Capital last week dropped its Dollars 60-a-share bid. The Conseco offer values Kemper at Dollars 2.7bn on a fully diluted basis, though the company puts the total value at Dollars 3.25bn, including Kemper's preference stock. The bid from Conseco, a fast-growing insurance holding company based in Carmel, Indiana, marks a return to financing techniques rarely seen since the late 1980s. The offer, Dollars 2.2bn of which is in cash, is backed by junk bond financing, Dollars 1.2bn of bank debt and a private buy-out fund run by Conseco. In a step not used in a large transaction in the 1990s, Morgan Stanley, Conseco's adviser, has issued a letter stating it is 'highly confident' it can raise Dollars 750m of bond finance. Such letters were the hallmark of Mr Michael Milken, who pioneered the use of sub-investment grade paper in acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert. All the main rating agencies are reviewing Conseco's debt with a view to downgrading it as a result of the leveraged deal, a move likely to put it firmly in the non-investment grade category. Mr Jim Parrish, in charge of sub-investment grade ratings at Moody's, said the Conseco deal marked a return of junk bonds to back acquisitions. Until now, the re-emergence of junk bonds in the 1990s had been based on refinancings of 1980s deals or to raise money for companies which previously would have turned to bank finance. The Dollars 1.2bn commitment of bank finance from Citibank is the latest large-scale bank deal for an acquisition. The takeover battles for Northrop and Paramount both involved committed credit lines from individual banks topping more than Dollars 1bn. In another echo of the 1980s, the bid for Kemper turns on a buy-out fund run by Conseco. Known as Conseco Capital Partners II, this fund, with equity capital of Dollars 624m, will take over Kemper's insurance and property activities, leaving Conseco with the less capital-intensive, fee-generating activities. US buy-out funds were largely left on the sidelines last year as high stock market prices enabled quoted companies to use their paper to make acquisitions. Lower share prices have seen the funds returning. Forstmann Little, a buy-out specialist that has not mounted a deal since 1992, is involved in a battle for control of Western Union, a money transfer business. Unusually, its Dollars 650m offer would be backed entirely by the funds it runs, signalling the large resources available to the US buy-out industry. Although the Conseco bid is remarkable for its size, there have been other highly-geared takeovers of financial companies during the 1990s. American Re, the US's third largest reinsurance company, was bought from Aetna for Dollars 1.3bn in 1992 in a deal led by buy-out specialists KKR. With only Dollars 300m of equity behind the deal, American Re was relegated to junk-bond status by the rating agencies. However, it has since returned to investment grade after being taken public.</p>

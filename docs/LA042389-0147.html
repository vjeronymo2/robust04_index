			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURTURE  </P> <P> From a documentary on marsupials  </P> <P> I learn that a pillowcase makes  </P> <P>  a fine substitute pouch for  </P> <P> an orphaned kangaroo.  </P> <P> I am drawn to such dramas of animal  </P> <P> rescue. They are warm in the  </P> <P> throat. I suffer, the critic  </P> <P> proclaims, from an overabundance  </P> <P> of maternal genes.  </P> <P> Bring me your fallen fledgling, your  </P> <P>  bummer lamb, lead the abused, the  </P> <P>  starvelings, into my barn.  </P> <P> Advise the hunted deer to  </P> <P>  leap into my corn.  </P> <P> And had there been a wild child --  </P> <P>  filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called  </P> <P> in one nineteenth-century account --  </P> <P>  a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,  </P> <P>  given my fireside inked with paw prints,  </P> <P>  there would have been room.  </P> <P> Think of the language we two, same and not-same,  </P> <P>  might have constructed from sign,  </P> <P>  scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel:  </P> <P> Laughter our first noun, and our long verb, howl  </P> <P> From "Nurture" (Viking: $17.95; 63 pp.).

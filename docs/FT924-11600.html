			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Echoes of Keynes in arguments over support for over-valued exchange rate Sir, Peter Martin ('Troubling memories of the 1930s', October 17) refers to John Maynard Keynes' concern about the impact of external economic conditions on the domestic economy, and provides a quote that could have come from Norman Lamont's current issue of 'Popular Economic Dilemmas'. Particularly apposite is the reference to external depression (read recession) which, in this case, the Bundesbank is inflicting on Germany and the rest of Europe. Many argue that Britain should never have broken ranks, and should suffer the same, or worse, consequences. No matter the policy prescriptions of the Bundesbank are inappropriate for the circumstances. In Keynes' The General Theory, the ghosts of the past haunt the present: '. . .the City of London gradually devised the most dangerous technique for the maintenance of equilibrium which can possibly be imagined, namely, the technique of bank rate coupled with a rigid parity of the foreign exchanges. For this meant that the objective of maintaining a domestic rate of interest consistent with full employment, was wholly ruled out. Since, in practice, it is impossible to neglect the balance of payments, a means of controlling it was evolved which, instead of protecting the domestic rate of interest, sacrificed it to the operation of blind forces. Recently, practical bankers in London have learnt much, and one can almost hope that in Great Britain the technique of bank rate will never be used again to protect the foreign balance in conditions in which it is likely to cause unemployment at home.' There are good reasons to justify support for a fairly-valued, but not over-valued, exchange rate. Transitional costs will be incurred in moving from one level to another, but these will be less than those suffered by trying to beat down domestic costs to compensate for lack of competitiveness. The way to support an over-valued exchange rate is to maintain relatively high interest rates, or manage policy so as to force economic growth below its long-term potential. Keynes believed these costs were unnecessary and unacceptable; he was right. Richard Coghlan, Strategic Investment Services, 1325 Morris Drive, Wayne PA 19087, USA</p>

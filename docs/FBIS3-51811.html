			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beginning this Monday [24 January], many  congregationist schools in Port-au-Prince have decided to  operate only three times a week: Mondays, Wednesdays, and  Fridays. This decision was made by the association of the  directors of those schools working in Port-au-Prince. This  decision is a direct consequence of the shortage of fuel and the  scarcity of oil product in Port-au-Prince.    We will later discuss the details of this news item,  especially with regard to the closing of industries and  businesses in Port-au- Prince. For instance, the radio stations  in the capital last week began working on a reduced schedule.</p>

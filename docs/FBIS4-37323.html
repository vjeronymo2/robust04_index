			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Jun (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak today received Lakhdar Brahimi, the special envoy of the  UN secretary general who is investigating the Yemeni crisis.  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa attended the session.    Following the meeting, Minister Musa said that Egypt's  position, as has been stated by President Mubarak, is that an  immediate cease-fire should be observed in Yemen, because  continued fighting is detrimental to that country and its unity.    Minister Musa said that a cease-fire would give dialogue a  chance to begin and a solution to be found. The longer the  fighting continues, the slimmer the chances of preserving  Yemen's unity and interests. It is in the interest of all Arabs  to see an end to the fighting in Yemen. This is a message that  has been relayed to all the warring parties and expressed  repeatedly by President Mubarak, Minister Musa stated.    For his part, Brahimi said that he was honored by his  meeting  with President Mubarak, noting that the meeting is part of the  consultations he is holding with various Arab officials  concerning the Yemeni crisis. He added that his visit to Egypt  is the last stop on a tour that took him to a number of Gulf  countries.    The UN envoy said he appreciates the time President Mubarak  spent with him discussing the Yemeni crisis. Brahimi said that  President Mubarak told him Egypt takes an interest in the crisis  out of concern for regional stability.    Brahimi said that President Mubarak expressed a view shared  by many Arabs and Yemenis, namely, that the fighting in Yemen  should stop and that disputes should be worked out through  dialogue rather than violent means. This is all I can say for  now, Brahimi noted.</p>

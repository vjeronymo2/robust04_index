			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Exposed to chill economic winds: French banks are beginning another bruising year in their domestic markets If you ask Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, the French banking group, how his company is faring, the answer is scarcely cheering. 'We had a tough time in 1992,' he said, 'and 1993 is going to be another difficult year.' Mr Levy-Lang is not alone. The 1992 figures for Paribas and the other big French banks, due to be published over the next few weeks, will paint an unpleasant picture of sluggish operating profits from their banking activities and steep provisions against losses on property and industrial investments. The French banks, which include six of Europe's 20 biggest banks, are now beginning another bruising year of struggling with both the short-term pressures of the economic slowdown and the long-term challenge of adapting to life in an increasingly competitive market. The problems could not have come at a worse time for Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the state-controlled banks which are prime candidates for privatisation if, as the opinion polls suggest, France's conservative coalition wins this month's parliamentary elections. One of the main difficulties is the sluggish state of the banks' domestic market. The high level of French real interest rates, at more than 7 per cent, has depressed demand for credit among consumers and industry. 'Demand for credit is static for the first time since the war,' said Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of Credit Commercial de France. 'This means that the volume of banking activity is very low.' The credit problem has also made it difficult for the banks to respond to the recent rise in short-term interest rates triggered by the Bank of France in its battles to defend the franc. The bank raised its short-term lending facility, which sets the rate at which banks borrow money, from 10 per cent to 12 per cent in early January. The action was aimed at deterring speculation, by making it more expensive to borrow funds in francs. This increase also raised the banks' borrowing costs. In normal conditions they would have responded by raising the base rate they charge for loans to their own customers. But they have been reluctant to do so, partly for fear of offending the government, which is anxious to avoid another interest rate rise before the elections, and partly because of concern that higher base rates would further depress demand for credit. The big banks have left base rates at 10 per cent since December. The French banking association estimates that, since the short-term facility rose in early January, their total borrowing costs have risen by FFr10m (Pounds 1.25m) a day. The Bank of France is committed to reducing short-term rates, but is unlikely to make substantial cuts until German rates fall further, for fear of imperilling the franc. The banks have been left in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to struggle on with higher borrowing costs, or to risk losing business by raising base rates. These problems have been aggravated by the fragile state of the property market, particularly in Paris where average rentals have fallen by 20 per cent over the past three years. Mr Levy-Lang estimates that the banking industry may have to write off up to FFr70bn on property loans. Banks have also been hit by the plight of small companies. The number of business failures - mostly small concerns - rose by 7.3 per cent in the year to last August, leaving the banks with a string of bad debts. As a result, the four largest commercial banks - BNP, Credit Lyonnais, CCF and Societe Generale - have seen their average level of provisions as a percentage of average loans treble from 0.4 per cent in 1989 to 1.2 per cent in the first half of last year. While this level may be relatively high for French banks, however, it is low by international standards. The comparable figure for the four big UK banks in 1992 was 2 per cent. Moreover, French bankers argue that higher provisions, like the credit squeeze, are due to short-term factors. 'We've been through all this before in the mid-1970s and early 1980s,' said Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale. 'The property crisis, business failures and the market slowdown are all cyclical problems which will be resolved when the economy picks up.' So far, there is no sign of a pick-up. The latest Bank of France survey suggests the economy has deteriorated in the opening months of this year, largely because of the effect of the strong franc on exports. Economists expect the strains to continue until after the elections, with the recovery starting in the second half of the year. 'The worst is probably over,' said Mr Chris Davis, banking analyst at BZW in London. 'The cyclical pressures should have eased by the end of this year and the banks must then address their main structural problem  - the high cost of their branch networks.' French banking overheads are high by international standards, with a cost-to-revenue ratio of 70 per cent, against 65 per cent in the UK. The banks are trying to resolve this by shedding staff, which represents 60 per cent of costs. The French banking association estimates that the industry, which employs 430,000 people, is now reducing staffing at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent, against an average of 1 per cent for the past four years. The banks are also responding to domestic pressures by expanding outside France. The industry has traditionally taken a cautious approach to international investment, with the exceptions of Paribas in capital markets and Credit Lyonnais with its successful European commercial banking network. However, last month CCF joined forces with Germany's BHF Bank to take control of Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank, and BNP declared an interest in buying Banco de Fomento of Spain. The most pressing question on the domestic agenda is whether the banking industry's present problems will jeopardise the conservatives' plans to privatise BNP and Credit Lyonnais. Both state banks have been badly affected by the economic slowdown. BNP, which has adopted the more cautious strategy of the two, saw net profits fall from FFr2.94bn in 1991, to about FFr2.78bn in 1992, and is on course for a modest recovery to FFr3.2bn this year, according to Shearson Lehman, the investment bank. Credit Lyonnais is in a more precarious position. It barely broke even in the first half of 1992 and analysts forecast a fall in net profits from FFr3.2bn in 1991 to less than FFr1bn last year. The crux of its problems is the aggressive lending policy, pursued since Mr Jean-Yves Haberer became chairman in 1988, which has left it exposed to a string of corporate catastrophes, including Dollars 350m to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, and Dollars 900m to MGM, the stricken US film studio. The bank is also worried by speculation that its MGM exposure is far higher than its Dollars 900m estimate. 'Could you privatise Credit Lyonnais right now? No way,' said one observer. 'And I wouldn't try selling BNP on last year's figures.' However, analysts are confident that both banks should be marketable in two or three years. The most discussed scenario is that Mr Haberer will be replaced at Credit Lyonnais after the elections and BNP will liven up its image with deals such as Banco de Fomento. 'This certainly isn't the right time to sell either BNP or Credit Lyonnais,' said a second observer. 'But there's no reason why they shouldn't be sold in late 1994 or 1995. The whole French banking system should look a lot healthier by then. If there are no more disasters, Credit Lyonnais might even look like an exciting investment - exciting in the right way.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FRENCH BANKING: NO SIGN OF A PICK-UP  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1990                   1991                             Net profit Provisions  Net profit Provisions                              FFr bn      FFr bn      FFr bn      FFr bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banque Nationale de Paris     1.6          7.1        2.9          8.1 Credit Lyonnais               3.7          6.5        3.2          9.6 Societe Generale              2.7          6.8        3.4          5.5 Credit Commercial de France   0.8          0.1        0.9          1.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1990 estimate          1993 estimate                             Net profit Provisions  Net profit Provisions                              FFr bn      FFr bn      FFr bn      FFr bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banque Nationale de Paris     2.8          8.1        3.2          7.8 Credit Lyonnais               0.8         13.5        1.5         13.5 Societe Generale              3.4          6.0        4.0          5.7 Credit Commercial de France   0.9          1.1        1.0          0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company accounts and analyst estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

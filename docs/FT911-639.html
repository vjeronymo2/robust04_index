			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Leonard Mather, top roles in banking: Obituary MR LEONARD MATHER, a prominent clearing banker who played a central role in helping to resolve the secondary-banking crisis of the 1970s, has died aged 81. Mr Mather was chief general manager and subsequently vice-chairman of Midland Bank when the liberalisation of the UK banking system was producing rapid changes and new stresses in the financial markets. At Midland, he is remembered as a commanding, inspiring figure who sought high standards and reshaped the bank to become more responsive to its customers. But his time there was later marred by the top-level rivalry that was to divide and weaken Midland for a decade. Mr Mather left Midland late in 1974 to become chairman of United Dominions Trust - one of the secondary banks worst affected by the crisis - which the Bank of England was supporting with Pounds 500m. He steered UDT back to financial health until it was sold to Trustee Savings Bank shortly before his retirement in 1981. Mr Mather was born in Liverpool in 1909, and embarked on a lifetime banking career when he joined Midland's local branch as a 17-year-old clerk. His steady rise through the ranks took him to the position of chief general manager in 1968. He remained a director of Midland until 1984. A bluff figure who was proud of his northern origins, Mr Mather brought a directness and dash of colour to a profession that was still inward-looking and resistant to change. His talent for communication made him an excellent salesman for the bank and a popular after-dinner speaker. Mr Mather was the author of several books about banking which became standard texts for aspiring bankers in the 1950s and 1960s. He became president of the Institute of Bankers in 1969 and was subsequently made a lifetime vice-president and honorary fellow. He is survived by his wife Muriel whom he married in 1937.</p>

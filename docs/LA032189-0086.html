			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ALEXANDER LEADS BERLIOZ REQUIEM  </P> <P> The Requiem of Hector Berlioz is a sprawling, ultra-Romantic work, alternating  grandiose movements with surprisingly intimate ones. Many conductors are lured  by its huge aspects, but few are able to manage the disparate elements of this  gargantuan composition and fuse a cohesive structure.  </P> <P> Sunday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, John Alexander proved  to be one of the few.  </P> <P> Leading the combined forces of his Pacific Chorale and Valley Master Chorale,  along with an augmented Pacific Symphony, Alexander conducted a performance of  consistent intensity. The sheer mass of the forces alone insured that volume  per se would not be a problem. Taking advantage of the Segerstrom Hall  acoustics, Alexander conducted with an ear toward balance, instrumental detail  and beauty of sound.  </P> <P> From the opening Kyrie Alexander revealed that he does not subscribe to one  common school of choral conducting -- maximum attention to the singers, general  neglect of the orchestra. The Pacific Symphony strings produced deep, warm  sounds from the start and all sections demonstrated impeccable intonation  throughout.  </P> <P> The famous Dies Irae handled the placement of the additional brass in  quasi-quadraphonic style. In addition to the requisite clean entrances and  polished ensemble, their collective tone was imposing without blaring or  strain.  </P> <P> The massed vocalists sang with a keen awareness of balance in every dynamic  level, though tenor passages occasionally lacked heft.  </P> <P> The same cannot be said of tenor soloist Paul Johnson, whose sostenuto lines in  the Sanctus revealed clear, light skillfully modulated sound with power in  reserve.  </P> <P> Having scrupulously avoided any and all temptations to bombast, Alexander  conveyed a sense of mystery in the quieter movements, not least among them the  Hostias, with its recurring chords uniquely scored with three flutes and eight  trombones.

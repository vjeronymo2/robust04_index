			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Nigeria cuts fuel price rise Nigeria's military regime yesterday reduced an earlier 400 per cent rise in the official price of fuel in an attempt to win public support as the economy continues to decline. In his broadcast speech, head of state General Sani Abacha cut the official prices by 26 per cent to N11 (30p) per litre for petrol, by 25 per cent to N9 per litre for diesel, and by 40 per cent to N6 per litre for kerosene. The price of fuel oil was cut to N7 a litre. Industry experts say that N12 per litre of fuel is the break-even price for the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, but Gen Abacha said the increased revenue would be spent on public services. He promised 1,000 new buses for public transport and higher spending on social services. The earlier steep increases in fuel prices were never officially announced and their reduction on Tuesday was not explained by Gen Abacha who said all Nigerians had to tighten their belts and make sacrifices. Gen Abacha blamed the price rises on high maintenance costs and the need to import fuel during recent strikes and shutdowns affecting the oil industry. 'What we spend must come from what we earn,' said Gen Abacha. 'The day of reckoning has already come true.' Confusion over fuel pricing is the latest evidence of the government's chaotic handling of the economy. The removal of the price subsidy is a condition for aid and debt relief from the IMF and the Paris Club but the government is far from meeting other criteria. Payments on Nigeria's external debts of Pounds 28bn are more than Dollars 7bn in arrears, government spending is out of control and heading for a large 1994 deficit and the parallel market value of the naira has halved in the nine months since Gen Abacha seized power.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots upset Stores and pharmaceuticals group Boots fell in reaction to disappointment over the group's half-year results and statement. There was also a sense of deflation when the company failed to announce details of the sale of its pharmaceuticals arm. However, the lack of disposal news failed to stop a welter of speculation on the timing of a disposal and the ultimate recipient. Most analysts have set a Pounds 900m price tag on the drugs arm and there were strong rumours that Astra would buy and Boots was planning a special board meeting today. However, both the Swedish drug company and the Nottinghamshire retailer strenuously denied the talk. Other names mooted were Knoll, which is part of BASF, Menarini, of Italy, Ciba and Zeneca. The purchase was, however, said to be too dear for Zeneca. Boots shed 20 at first but rallied to close 10 off at 519p. Takeover talk and a strong dollar gave a fillip to the pharmaceuticals sector. The main story was an old one that had been given a new coat of paint. Dealers suggested that a bid of 170p a share would be made for Fisons, whose shares gave a late spurt to close 3 1/2 higher at 117 1/2 p in spite of cynicism from analysts. There was also said to be some active buying of traded options. Zeneca was said to be either making a bid for Boots or receiving an offer from a rival. The shares were also benefiting from reports that it is considering forming joint ventures or links with US healthcare suppliers and a deal is likely within four months. Vickers' City presentation confirmed all and more that analysts had been hoping to hear, with the group talking boldly of a partner for its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars unit before the end of the year, plus a big order back-log in defence where there could also soon be news of European collaboration. The company would not be drawn on whether its prospective Rolls-Royce partner was either Daimler-Benz or BMW, both German groups, but yesterday the stock market had few doubts and the shares put on a further 4 at 183p in 1.8m volume for a four-day gain of close to 10 per cent. A downbeat review of the property sector from NatWest Securities pushed the stocks lower against the day's trend, with British Land and Brixton Estate among the hardest hit, shedding 6 to 397p and 3 to 186p respectively. The securities house has moved its sector stance from neutral to underperform following a reduction in its estimates for the growth of net asset values this year and next. It singles out British Land, Brixton and Great Portland Estates (down 2 at 189p) as the most exposed stocks. Other features among engineers included Laird Group, best known for its motor vehicle sealing systems, which jumped 15 1/2 to 370p in nominal trading volume. Legal &amp; General, which held at 436p, was one of the market's most heavily traded stocks, with turnover reaching 11m as one institution sold a block of 4m shares at 432p via an agency cross. Royal Insurance attracted strong support in the options market, as well as being boosted by broker recommendations ahead of next Thursday's third-quarter results. The shares settled 8 1/2 higher at 309 1/2 p. Marley, the building materials group, moved up 3 to 135p after a UBS buy note, while Blue Circle hardened 3 to 284p after a recommendation from Robert Fleming. British Airways moved forward 7 to 366 1/2 p following an increase in traffic flows for October substantially ahead of the 5 per cent or so that most analysts had been expecting. The airline's revenue passenger kilometres rose by 6.8 per cent, although the growth in premium traffic slowed sharply. The session saw 3m shares dealt, plus heavy stock options activity. Inevitably the excitement washed over on to airports group BAA, which gained 7 at 522p in advance of Monday's results statement. Other statistics, Page 35</p>

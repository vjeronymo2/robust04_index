			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: All eyes on The Equitable's transformation - Nikki Tait reports from the troubled US insurer's demutualisation process hearings Two years ago, Mr Claude Bebear, the colourful chairman of France's Axa insurance group, tried to acquire Farmers Group, the US insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries of the UK. He spent months testifying before state insurance commissioners across the US - and got nowhere. This week, his new US target, The Equitable, started public hearings in a complex demutualisation process which could ultimately transform Axa's earlier Dollars 1bn investment in the ailing US life insurer into a 49 per cent stake. The process lasted half a day, and no one from Axa was even visible. The difference is that this is a friendly deal. The worry is not whether Axa's influence on The Equitable will be benign or malevolent, but whether confidence in America's fourth largest insurer has recovered sufficiently to permit a smooth sale of its shares later this year. The demutualisation process, however, is important. On the one hand, it is setting down markers which other US mutual insurers may seek to follow. On the other, it has provided the first readily-comprehensible insight into Equitable's financial affairs. Demutualisation is the procedure by which a mutual insurer - that is, one controlled by its policyholders - turns itself into a 'conventional' company, owned by shareholders. The motive for undertaking such a complex legal manoeuvre is simple. A shareholder-owned company can easily raise new funds on the stock market, while a mutual's access to new capital is limited. As Mr Dick Jenrette, Equitable's chairman, has noted, this basic advantage has already prompted a sharp decline in mutuals' market share. Twenty years ago, mutuals accounted for 50 per cent of the capital in the US life industry; today the figure is just 30 per cent. A few demutualisations have occured in the US before, and many state insurance departments now have guideline rules governing the process. But Equitable, with total assets under management of Dollars 140bn, is by far the largest American insurer to tackle the task, and it is doing so when the need to bolster capital resources is widespread within the US insurance industry. It is also being supervised by the New York State Insurance Department, probably the best state regulatory agency. In short, everyone knows that a textbook case is being written notice some other mutuals represented in the room,' remarked Mr Salvatore Curiale, the New York insurance superintendent, underlining this point as hearings began. The tricky part of any demutualisation is to divide up the current worth of the insurance business between policyholders in a manner that is fair. In Equitable's case, matters are complicated by the Dollars 1bn capital infusion which Axa provided last summer, when the US insurer's need for funds was acute. In return, the French negotiated the right to between 40 and 49 per cent of Equitable's equity once demutualisation - and an associated offering of shares to outside investors - was complete. With all this in mind, Equitable's approach has been to collect existing dividend-paying policies into a 'closed block' and to assign a clearly-defined portion of its assets to support them. This has demanded some fancy actuarial footwork, and the use of a generous 9.9 per cent reinvestment rate - for cashflows from these investments - has already provoked some comment. Equitable advisers, however, contend that the rate is consistent with that implicit in the 1991 dividend scales. If it is over-optimistic, they admit, dividends will have to fall - but that would have happened regardless of demutualisation. As for the allocation of shares in the 'demutualised' company, Axa's investment agreement determines its portion. It is, perhaps, worth noting that the French insurer stands to earn a hefty 22 per cent annual return on the Dollars 1bn investment. However, before anyone complains about such generosity, the bankers point out that the return is delivered in risky equity - not solid cash payments - , and Equitable counts as 'a substantially leveraged investment'. No-one else, they also observe, wanted to supply a Dollars 1bn cheque. Among policyholders, shares are allocated on two principles: everyone gets three shares, regardless of the size or type of policy, to reflect their 'ownership' interest; further shares are then appropriated on the basis of each policy's contribution to Equitable's surplus. This, in turn, has promoted yet more complex actuarial arithmetic. Again, there has been some modest controversy. Why, it has been argued, should so many shares - perhaps almost a quarter of those going to policyholders - be allocated on the fixed basis? After all, certain types of policies - such as the 'guaranteed investment contracts' (GICs) - have caused The Equitable to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. On the second score - Equitable's financial health - the insurer's prospective stockmarket debut has brought a wholesale accounting change. Like all stock market companies, The Equitable must now restate its earnings under the more rigorous SEC's GAAP accounting rules; previously, in common with most mutual insurers, it reported under the statutory system used by the state regulators. For the layman, this means that the figures take on a far more familiar format - and look none the prettier for that. Equitable produced an after-tax loss of Dollars 453.8m in 1990 under GAAP rules, and then another Dollars 651.1m deficit in the first nine months of 1991. In truth, things were not quite that bad. The nine-month loss contained only a Dollars 146.5m deficit from continuing operations. And that, in turn, was struck after adding Dollars 368m to valuation allowances to cover impaired assets, plus a Dollars 29.7m write-down for publicly traded securities. The more damaging Dollars 493.5m deficit from discontinued operations referred to the GIC business, with the Equitable attempting to provide for future losses as these contracts run out. The GIC loss provisions were then increased by a further Dollars 103.6m in the fourth quarter. Total loss provisions, says the insurer hopefully, now 'represent the estimated present value of all future losses on GIC contracts'. Still, in the first nine months, individual insurance and annuity surrenders were still running at Dollars 1.88bn - up 53 per cent on the previous year - although Equitable says the position has improved since then. Meanwhile, at end-September, equity real estate investment accounted for 12.6 per cent of the core investment portfolio; junk debt and equity interests, 14.2 per cent; and mortgages, 29 per cent. All that noted, some of the US rating agencies monitoring the insurer closely now seem relatively sanguine about prospects. Standard &amp; Poor's, for example, says it found nothing surprising in the financial information. It still had the company on 'creditwatch', but with developing rather than negative implications. Meanwhile, Equitable's 2.2m policyholders, who get to vote next month on the demutualisation proposal, seem understandably baffled by the bulky documents. The insurer had logged 95,000 calls by the end of last week, largely from people seeking to discover whether their policies would be affected. Nevertheless, aside from the inevitable policyholder lawsuit and a handful of letters to the insurance department, scepticism rather than objection seems to be the order of the day. What guarantee was there, demanded one man at the hearing, that any new money raised would not be put to equally bad use? 'I can't guarantee that we won't make mistakes in the future,' replied Mr Jenrette, 'but we do have a new management team'.</p>

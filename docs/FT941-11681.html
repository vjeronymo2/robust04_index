			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Treasury upbeat about economy The Treasury yesterday painted a upbeat picture of the economy, suggesting that there will be no early cut in bank base rates from their present 5.5 per cent. In its monthly monetary report prepared for yesterday's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, the Treasury said that preliminary fourth- quarter gross domestic product figures 'showed continuing steady growth in activity'. Noting that the latest monthly indicators 'reinforce this picture of further recovery', it said: The trend in retail sales remains strongly upwards in spite of a slight decline in December that may have reflected seasonal adjustment problems. Manufacturing output rose further in November. Business optimism, as measured by the latest CBI survey, showed a very strong rise. Unemployment fell sharply again in December. The report gave a generally favourable account of price trends in Britain but contained some warning signals, noting that growth in manufacturers' unit wage costs remained low 'but is no longer negative'. Underlying retail price inflation, at 2.7 per cent in December, was at its second lowest rate since January 1968 after a rise in the month that reflected the Budget increase in excise duties. However, although the underlying rate was 0.8 percentage points below the latest average 'headline' inflation rate for the European Union, it was 0.2 points above the average for the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, the Treasury said. Meanwhile, the UK's official reserves rose by Dollars 521m (Pounds 347.3m) in January, or by Dollars 205m on an underlying basis. The increase was greater than expected.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAYANA'S PLAY A BIG RELIEF TO REDS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FORMER LOYOLA MARYMOUNT STAR HAS BEEN A STEADY FORCE IN CINCINNATI'S  BULLPEN.  </P> <P> Back in the summer of 1988, Tim Layana was digging deep into his wallet, hoping  to find a little spare change.  </P> <P> Instead, he found inspiration -- which turned out to be worth a lot more in the  long run.  </P> <P> This summer, Layana is a rookie middle-relief specialist for the Cincinnati  Reds. He's earning the major league minimum of $100,000, so he doesn't need to  dig for laundry money any more.  </P> <P> But most importantly, the former Loyola Marymount ace has regained his  confidence.  </P> <P> It was in short supply two summers ago when Layana was a struggling starting  pitcher in the New York Yankees farm system.  </P> <P> He was in debt, his signing bonus was all but gone, and his minor league salary  was barely cutting it.  </P> <P> To make it worse, Layana's control had vanished, taking his confidence with it.  His earned-run average had ballooned over 6.00. And the Yankees had rewarded  him with a demotion from triple-A Columbus to double-A Albany-Colonie.  </P> <P> But when Layana burrowed through his wallet for some change that day in Albany,  N.Y., he found a card he had buried inside it long ago.  </P> <P> Written on the card is a poem called "Don't Quit." Layana used to read the  words to pump himself up for games in college and high school.  </P> <P> That card is now taped above his locker in the Reds' clubhouse at Riverfront  Stadium.  </P> <P> Layana recited the opening words to the poem two weeks ago in the visiting  locker room at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> "Life is queer with its twists and turns. . ." he said. "I remember those words  any time I get down . . . the times when I'm struggling, when I'm sick of  losing, when I can't throw strikes. That poem reminds me to just get out there  and keep battling, even when the debts are high and funds are low."  </P> <P> After Layana found those long-forgotten words of wisdom, his career took a turn  upward.  </P> <P> In 1989 at Albany, Layana switched to the bullpen, where he could make the best  use of his strikeout pitch, the knuckle-curve.  </P> <P> He saved 17 games that season -- best in the Eastern League, and found himself  in Yankee Stadium at the end of the year making a couple of cameo appearances.  </P> <P> Layana got another boost in December, when the Yankees gambled and left him off  their winter roster. The Reds, managed by former Yankee skipper Lou Pinella,  were impressed enough with Layana's numbers that they snapped up the  right-hander in that month's major league draft.  </P> <P> For Layana, who had been shuffled around the Yankee farm system for four years,  it was like going to heaven. He was placed on the Reds' spring training roster,  and was still on the team on Opening Day.  </P> <P> Today, Layana finds himself in the middle of a pennant race, going into this  week with a 4-0 record, a 2.47 ERA and a save.  </P> <P> "The Yankees knew it was a risk, but the risk failed for the Yankees," Layana  said. "From a personal standpoint, it's great. Look at where the Yankees are  compared now to where we are."  </P> <P> Layana doesn't have the notoriety of fellow relievers Rob Dibble, Randy Myers  and Norm Charlton -- the Reds' self-styled fraternity who call themselves the  "Nasty Boys."  </P> <P> But as a solid middle reliever, Layana is one of the unsung heroes in the Reds'  success story this season. Layana has four wins and a save and has yet to lose  a game.  </P> <P> He has been keeping the Reds in games when they are behind, giving the hitters  time to make up the deficit. And he has pitched well when Cincinnati is leading  by too many runs to warrant using one of the team's short relievers.  </P> <P> Layana has proven he has the stuff to get out major league hitters. He has 34  appearances, 51 innings pitched and National Leaguers are batting only .246  against him.  </P> <P> Layana throws a fastball, a slider, a change-up, and of course, the  knuckle-curve. Myers gave Layana the ultimate compliment early in the season  when he said Layana's knuckle-curve was a "nasty" pitch.  </P> <P> "Every once in a while, the Nasty Boys make me an honorary member," Layana  said.  </P> <P> But he concedes that he doesn't have the requisite personality to be a real  Nasty Boy, which is probably for the better, since the Nasty Boys have become  notorious more for their antics off the field than their performances on it.  </P> <P> Layana is not eccentric like Myers, who has an eight-inch hunting knife  sticking out of the wooden frame of his locker and who once drove a motorcycle  into the Reds' clubhouse.  </P> <P> Nor does he have the temper of Dibble, who is known to throw bats and bean  balls on the field and buckets of water over the heads of Cincinnati reporters  off it.  </P> <P> And Layana doesn't have the mean streak of Charlton, who leveled Dodger catcher  Mike Scioscia -- baseball's premier plate blocker -- with a "nasty"  forearm-and-shoulder block in a collision at home plate earlier this year.  </P> <P> Instead, Layana is a quiet and serious 26-year-old -- a Loyola Marymount and  Loyola High graduate who is going about his business in the big leagues.  </P> <P> "I'm just doing what I have to do to stay in the big leagues," Layana said. "If  it's middle relief, long relief, whatever. Maybe someday I'll become a closer  again, but I've got to establish myself on this level first."  </P> <P> When he entered professional baseball in 1986, Layana was earmarked as a  starter.  </P> <P> The Culver City native was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in 1982 after a  standout prep career at Loyola High in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After his first three years at Loyola Marymount, Layana was drafted again --  this time by the New York Mets. But he decided to pass up a contract for his  senior year.  </P> <P> It was a good move. Layana did the pitching and Chris Donnels and Billy Bean  did the hitting to lead Loyola to the 1986 College World Series.  </P> <P> In four years at Loyola Marymount, Layana set most of the school's career  pitching records -- including marks for career victories, starts, innings  pitched, complete games and strikeouts.  </P> <P> He signed with the Yankees after his senior season, having been selected in the  third round of the June, 1986, draft.  </P> <P> Layana was immediately successful at the class-A level that year. He had a 2.37  ERA at Oneonta, N.Y. and a 2.24 ERA at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., that season.  </P> <P> But in 1987, Layana's control began to unravel at Prince William, Va., Albany  and Columbus. The struggles continued the next year.  </P> <P> Two years later, those troubles are far behind.  </P> <P> On April 10 this season, Layana picked up his first major league victory as the  Red defeated the Houston Astros, 3-2.  </P> <P> A week later, Layana worked two innings to beat the San Diego Padres. He picked  up another victory against Pittsburgh on May 15.  </P> <P> But Layana's biggest thrill of the season was yet to come. On June 23, Layana  inherited an 11-5 lead against the visiting Dodgers and threw four  near-flawless innings to record his first big league save.  </P> <P> "I went to Dodger Stadium so many times growing up and I'd be totally in awe  just watching the players," Layana said. "I was a little nervous actually  pitching against the Dodgers at first."  </P> <P> Layana finally got a chance to pitch in Dodger Stadium on July 30, working a  scoreless eighth inning in a 4-1 Reds' loss. He closed out that inning by  striking out Rick Dempsey.  </P> <P> When the Reds travel to Los Angeles, Layana stays at home with his mother. His  father has been overseas, working as a superintendent for a firm doing  construction work in Thailand.  </P> <P> Along the way, Layana has emerged as a thorn in the Dodgers' sides. In three  appearances against his old hometown favorites, Layana has allowed only one run  over six innings and has struck out five.  </P> <P> He's had only one really rough outing this season, that coming on July 12  against the visiting New York Mets. The Reds trailed, 7-3, when Layana entered,  but Layana gave up a two-run homer to the Mets' Kevin Elster in an eventual  10-3 loss.  </P> <P> Layana bounced back in his next appearance, going four innings four days later  to beat the Montreal Expos, 8-3, to earn his fourth victory.  </P> <P> Right now, the Reds will take whatever Layana can offer. After weathering a  lengthy losing streak at the end of July, Cincinnati has seen its lead dwindle.  </P> <P> "All teams are going to stumble at one time or another," Layana said. "At least  we staggered in July instead of September."  </P></p>

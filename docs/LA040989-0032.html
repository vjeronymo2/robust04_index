			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIRRORING A MALADY  </P> <P> Michael Pittas' comments are right on target, especially his criticism of  architects designing primarily for recognition by colleagues, often at he  expense of the community and the intended user ("American Dream House: New  Reality," by Connie Koenenn, March 21). His revelation of the profession's  non-existence in the arena of code development, though assuredly shocking to  laymen, is true.  </P> <P> We architects, individually and collectively, have castigated ourselves  mercilessly for decades over this predicament.  </P> <P> However, let's remember that all of the great architecture of the past was  instigated by non-architects, primarily secular and ecclesiastical nobility  that generously supported this delicate profession, so it always rose to  excellence. These people were the driving force of the entire marvelous culture  we in America inherited from the Old World of Europe and other civilizations.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, today, behind the steering wheel are uncultured opportunists at  every level, whose obsessive on-a-roll-and-can't-be-stopped philaguria (Greek  for "love of money") has created a self-destructive "ledger book" culture of  its own.  </P> <P> Architects, by the very nature of their calling, can only mirror this malady.  Their current mutual admiration society, cowering in the face of their greatest  historical challenge, is a direct reaction to the absence of support by the  people in power.  </P> <P> ROBERT RINGSTROM  </P> <P> architect  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

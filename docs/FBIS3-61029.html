			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ivanyuk: "Wage Agreement </F> in Army Conditions: Still More Problems Than Solutions"]    [Text] This year has been important in a special way for  the army trade unions. For the first time, all their work has  been based on the branch wage agreement of the Federation of  Trade Unions of Armed Forces Workers and Office Employees, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, and the Russian  Federation Ministry of Labor, which was announced by the defense  minister in Order No. 197 in 1993. How has it been carried out,  and what has it done for Army and Navy civilian personnel? Let  us attempt to tally some of the results at the end of the year,  a year that has been difficult from an economic standpoint,  especially for workers paid from the budget.    For the sake of objectivity, it must be said that the  agreement has worked well even in these difficult conditions.  Despite the financial difficulties, the Ministry of Defense  found ways to improve labor remuneration and material  incentives. Repeated appeals to the government made it possible  to increase the wage rates up to 50 percent and to earmark up to  half of the annual wage fund for bonuses. Benefits were  introduced for education, health, and cultural workers living in  rural areas; pay was introduced for civilian specialists on  alert duty; regional wage regulation was improved, and  supplementary bonuses for uninterrupted service were increased.  And after these decisions were adopted at the government level,  the documents did not spend months circulating in ministry  corridors, as used to be the case, but were quickly sent to the  units by telegram. It should come as little surprise that they  were received rather enthusiastically by labor collectives,  especially Order No. 129 and Order No. 130, which the defense  minister issued in the first quarter.    But closer to the end of the first six months, it became  clear that efforts to keep up with price increases were not  succeeding. And Russian presidential Edict No. 842 of 3 June,  "On Certain Measures to Curb Inflation," essentially blocked  section three of the branch wage agreement. The issues dealt  with in that paragraph (payment of leave entitlements,  insurance, exemption of Defense Ministry organizations from the  added-value tax, and other measures that significantly improve  the workers' material, social, and consumer-service situation)  were submitted to the Russian Federation government for  consideration and resolution. In July 1993 prices, these  measures required almost 2 billion rubles. The treasury didn't  have the money for these things, and it still doesn't today.    Meanwhile, the situation is critical. And if Army and Navy  workers and office employees have not held mass strikes like the  miners, this is due solely to their high degree of  conscientiousness and to their special legal situation, which  does not allow such actions. Veterans remember how even during  the war years, financing was provided monthly. But today, money  is distributed only as it becomes available. Funds might be  distributed several times in one week, but more often there is  nothing to distribute. And how can you ask a person whose wages  haven't reached the subsistence minimum lately and, moreover,  haven't been paid on time, to give his work everything he's got?  But this has to be done during this of time personnel shortages  in order to somehow maintain the forces' vital activities.    Throughout this period, the Federation of Trade Unions of  Armed Forces Workers and Office Employees did not sit around  doing nothing. "We tried to call the attention of the national  leadership and the Ministry of Defense to the emerging  situation," said Federation Deputy Chairman Vladimir Volkov. "In  addition, we took part in setting norms, exercising our right of  legislative initiative. Very many difficulties, unfortunately,  stem from the uncertain legal status of civilian personnel in  the Armed Forces."    Of course, the most difficult situation obtains in the near  foreign countries, where financial problems are many times more  acute and the status of civilians working in military units is  altogether unclear. When a Russian citizen went to work, for  example, in the Western Group of Forces, he knew every last term  of his contract. But what about in the near foreign countries?  What are the rights of citizens of republics that do not belong  to the CIS but in which Russian military units are stationed, if  they work in these units? To start, we should at least clarify  the social and legal status of Russian Federation citizens in  Russia, since they are pursuing careers with the Armed Forces  voluntarily and under contract.    By analogy with the Law "On the Status of Servicemen," the  executive committee of the Federation of Trade Unions made such  attempts with the support of the Defense Ministry. But a kind of  impasse has arisen here too. To expect that the Federal  Assembly, after its election, will be able to consider such a  law in the foreseeable future is simply unrealistic, for it will  inherit many other urgent matters--as well as hundreds of other  laws that have already undergone various kinds of preliminary  study--from the Supreme Soviet, and all these things will have  to be considered. The only realistic option is to change the  corresponding paragraph in the branch agreement and to ask the  government to confirm the Statute on Benefits for Civilian  Personnel of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, in accordance  with the Law "On Defense." The Federation of Trade Unions, in  conjunction with the Defense Ministry, is currently studying  this question.    This step is of fundamental importance in and of itself,  since the civil rights of Army and Navy workers and office  employees are restricted, albeit less so than those of military  personnel. And so it is necessary to offset this with certain  benefits and advantages. Many readers who bring such complaints  to the newspaper emphasize that what bothers them is not that  they aren't getting something, but the fact that, in principle,  they are deprived of the right to establish a claim to anything.  For example, defense minister Order No. 285, which has regulated  housing issues in the Army and Navy ever since 1975, states  explicitly that workers and office employees are to be provided  with apartments at their place of residence. In other words,  they do not appear to have the right to even dream of getting  housing at their place of service.    In the new conditions, such a relationship between a worker  and his employer, in the form of the Defense Ministry, is hardly  justified -- especially considering the fact that the Defense  Ministry has one million civilian employees today, and they have  a very strong influence on the state of affairs in the forces.  With the cutbacks in the Armed Forces, in accordance with  defense minister Order No. 295, which took effect this year,  they are permitted to substitute in the forces for 40 officer  positions and for more than 200 positions normally held by  warrant Army and Navy warrant officers, extended-duty  servicemen, senior sergeants, soldiers, and seamen, and to hold  such important positions as leading research associates, test  engineers, designers, chief designers, chiefs of  apartment-operation services, chiefs of aircraft maintenance  services, and others.    According to some estimates, the number of workers and  office  employees could grow by 15 percent in the next few years, and  they will play an increasingly important role in strengthening  the country's defense capability. This means that we must work  to solve their problems too -- to come up with funds, to improve  the legal foundation, and to observe mutual agreements more  strictly. This was the subject of a recent meeting of a  trilateral commission that discussed progress in implementing  the wage agreement. A decision was taken to extend the agreement  to 1994. The deadline for assembling and reaching agreement on  amendments and changes in the document based on the past year's  experience and on all outstanding problems expired today.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Note: Major-General Viktor Rudik, chief of the labor and  wages administration for Russian Armed Forces civilian  personnel, reports that by decision of the Russian Federation  Council of Ministers of 7 December 1993, No. 1268, the monthly  wage rate for category-one of the uniform wage rate for  budget-sphere workers was set at 16,000 rubles as of 1 December.    Based on this, the wages of Defense Ministry workers and  office employees, in accordance with Russian Defense Minister  Order No. 130 of March 8, 1993, is being doubled.</p>

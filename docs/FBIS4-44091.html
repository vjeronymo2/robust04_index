			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Operation Turquoise in Rwanda is  primarily a humanitarian operation. In the wake of soldiers  dispatched to Bukavu, Zaire, to enter the western part of  Rwanda, a full medical and surgical infrastructure is ready to  be set up. Jean-Noel Ferre, a general with the French Army  Medical Corps, outlined the technical details of the operation  to Jean-Pierre Boris:    [Begin recording] [Ferre] This infrastructure is made up of  a  surgical team, with two surgeons and an anaesthetist, two  medical teams including two doctors each, a 50-bed hospital  section, a laboratory unit and an X-ray unit.    [Boris] What about the surgical unit?    [Ferre] The surgical unit is a simple surgical unit which  can  only carry out emergency surgery. It is manned by three  doctors, two surgeons and an anaesthetist, six fully qualified  nurses, and three soldiers.    This gives you a broad picture of the infrastructure we are  setting up: On one hand a surgical unit for the troops, in case  of fighting; and on the other hand a medical unit that includes  a surgical team and two medical teams -- with laboratory and  X-ray sections -- to cater to the refugees.

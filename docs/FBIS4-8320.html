			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus said on Czech Radio today that no controversial themes  came up during his meeting with Polish Premier Waldemar Pawlak  in the Polish province of Jelenia Gora on Sunday [10 April].    Asked if during the almost five hours of discussion between  the chairman of "one of the few genuinely right-wing parties in  Europe and the leader of the post-communist Polish People's  Party" there reigned only harmony and agreement, Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus said he would be "more careful about using these  easy labels such as post-communist," because the world was  always a little bit more complicated. He had talked to Pawlak  about completely specific things, in the realization of which  both countries were interested. "Thus I do not think there was  any room, essentially, for disagreement on such matters," Klaus  said.    He said that Poland, at least according to Pawlak, did not  have differing foreign policy ambitions. However, Klaus said it  was not impossible that if he had spoken to President Lech  Walesa or Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, the difference in  opinion on some things might have been greater.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Warburg names heirs to top jobs SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday put to rest speculation about the succession of the firm's top management, saying its chief executive Lord Cairns, will succeed chairman Mr David Scholey when he retires in 1995. There will be no new chief executive: Lord Cairns, with the title of executive chairman, will fill both roles. This is a departure from recommended best practice for corporate boards which urges separation of the roles. Meanwhile, Warburg also said that its 90-year old co-founder and senior president, Mr Henry Grunfeld, would no longer hold that position from next year. Mr Grunfeld, who emigrated to Britain in 1934, founded the original New Trading Company with the late Mr Sigmund Warburg. The announcement came as Warburg revealed record profits of Pounds 297m for the year to March 31, despite a 40 per cent rise in salary costs and a slowdown in trading profits in the second half. Speculation about a new chief executive had centred on Mr Nick Verey, managing director of investment banking and Mr Derek Higgs, a managing director at SG Warburg and Co. Under the new structure, Mr Verey, 51 and Mr Higgs, 50, will be chairmen of SG Warburg Securities and SG Warburg and Co respectively. Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman of Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund management arm, Mercury Asset Management, will form the third divisional chairman. A spokesman for MAM, which has been a frequent, although quiet, participant in corporate governance matters as a shareholder, said the group had no view on whether companies are best run by separate chairmen and chief executives. Meanwhile, MAM, reported a 33 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 109.5m, despite a 30 per cent rise in operating costs following increases in performance related pay and staffing. MAM also said it had provisionally agreed to buy the 50 per cent of the Geneva-based Bank SG Warburg Soditic AG it does not already own. It will pay Pounds 48.3m cash, roughly twice the sum paid to SG Warburg for the first 50 per cent in 1990. Mr Stevenson said the transaction would further MAM's ambitions in private client fund management. MAM is trying to ease its dependence on the UK institutional market and diversify into retail and international fund management. Lex, Page 26; Details, Page 29</p>

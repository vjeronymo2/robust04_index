			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News (FT Conference): Asia-Pacific region prepares for new jet take-off - Airbus and Boeing are seeking to attract Japanese partners for their jumbo projects LARGE Asia-Pacific airlines are expected to provide the main market for the development of a new generation of ultra-large commercial aircraft by the turn of the century. Senior executives of both the European Airbus consortium and the US Boeing company yesterday told a Financial Times conference on Asia-Pacific aviation that they were already studying the development of new 600-seat jumbo aircraft with potential airline customers. Both companies were also seeking to attract Japanese aerospace companies as partners in their proposed new jumbo aircraft projects. Mr Adam Brown, Airbus planning director, said the consortium expected the market for a 600-seat ultra-large aircraft to be highly concentrated, with 60 per cent of the new jumbos being needed by only nine airlines worldwide. Of these, five came from the Asia-Pacific region, which is expected to continue showing vigorous growth in air transport during the next 10 years. The five Asian carriers were Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Korean Airways. The four others were British Airways, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and Iberia. Airbus expects the development of a 600-seat aircraft to cost about Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and is forecasting an overall demand for 700 ultra-large airliners, with the first entering service around 2002. 'I believe that the design and development of this giant aircraft represents the next great challenge for commercial aviation,' Mr Brown said. 'It could offer an extraordinary opportunity for the manufacturing industry in the Asia-Pacific region.' He has already paid two visits to Japan to sound out possible interest on the part of Japanese manufacturers to become partners with Airbus in developing the new jumbo. The three big Japanese aerospace companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, are currently tied to Boeing in collaborating in the 100-to-400-seat market. But they would have the opportunity to co-operate with Airbus in the new 600-seat market. Mr Brown suggested the Japanese companies could find a partnership with Airbus on the development of a new jumbo more attractive than continuing collaboration with Boeing, which has been reluctant to co-operate on core technologies and know-how. 'I raise the question as to how much longer Boeing can hope with such an approach to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the dynamic developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region,' he said. He conceded, however, that Japan remained nervous of abandoning its traditional US partner. 'The question is whether they are psychologically ready,' Mr Brown said. Boeing is also talking with airlines about the feasibility of a super jumbo and has formed a large Airplane Unit at its Seattle headquarters to study the project. Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said the company was looking at three alternatives for developing an ultra-large aircraft. This included a stretched version of the Boeing 747-400; the extension of the 747's upper deck over the entire length of the aircraft's fuselage; and a completely new aircraft with a double-deck fuselage. Boeing is also considering developing a new extra-large aircraft with a folding wing tip to enable the aircraft to use existing 747 terminal gates at airports. The manufacturer is already offering a version of its new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner with folding wing tips, although no airline has yet opted for this. Mr Albrecht acknowledged it was too early to say if the market would be able to sustain more than one new jumbo aircraft project, which would be 'very expensive' to develop. McDonnell Douglas of the US is also considering developing a larger version of its MD12 three-engine jet which it hopes to develop in partnership with Taiwan and possibly Korea, and is already negotiating the sale of a 40 per cent stake in its commercial aircraft operations to Taiwan Aerospace for Dollars 2bn. The big aircraft manufacturers have their sights firmly fixed on the Asia-Pacific market because traffic in the region is expected to double by the end of the decade. At the same time, airport and air traffic congestion is expected to limit longer-term growth of flight frequencies in the area. Airbus thus predicts that, during the next 20 years, the average size of jets operated by Asia-Pacific airlines, already substantially higher than that of any other region, will rise from 228 to as high as 334 seats. 'This will obviously require the delivery of substantial numbers of aircraft very much larger than anything flying today,' Mr Brown said.</p>

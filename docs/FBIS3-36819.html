A Qualitatively New Point Has  Been Reached in the Russian-Latvian Talks"]    [Text] Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, told  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that the 7 February meeting with  Martins Virsis, his Latvian colleague, was highly productive.  It makes it possible to say that we are approaching a  qualitatively new point in the talks, since one of the most  difficult problems -- the period of operation of the radar  station at Skrunda after the Russian troop withdrawal from  Latvia -- has been removed. An accord was reached at the level  of the delegations that the radar station will be retained for  four more years, with 18 months being allocated thereafter to  dismantle it.    The delegation heads believe that all other questions could  also be resolved in the very near future. Thus, Sergey Zotov  stated, if in the very near future the Latvian Government  approves the accord that has been reached on the radar station,  then the way will be opened up to signing an entire package of  treaties and agreements connected with the troop withdrawal.    As is known, Russia links the signing of the main treaty on  the troop withdrawal with agreement on the radar station and on  social protection for military pensioners. An accord has been  reached on the Skrunda installation, and a second agreement is  practically ready, although a number of recent statements by the  Russian foreign minister on questions of relations with the  Baltic countries have caused the Latvian Government to waver on  certain points of the agreement, but in Sergey Zotov's opinion,  this is still no reason to jeopardize the whole package of  treaties and agreements that have been worked out. It will  obviously become clear whether or not this is so as early as  14-17 February in Riga, where the next round of the  Russian-Latvian talks will be held.    Talking with Sergey Zotov, I could not fail to touch on the  fact of the reelection of Andrejs Rucs, who was to blame for the  10 January incident involving two Russian generals, to the post  of chief of the council of Riga's Vidzeme suburb. "In this  connection we expressed concern to the head of the Latvian state  delegation," Sergey Zotov replied. "He informed us that the  republic General Prosecutor's Office is submitting for the  Saeima's consideration a corresponding proposal to create a  legal basis for Rucs' removal from the post and the institution  of criminal proceedings."</p>

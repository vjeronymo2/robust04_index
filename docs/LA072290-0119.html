			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THESE THINGS HAPPEN BY MARIAN THURM (WASHINGTON SQUARE:  $7.95)  </P> <P> Marian Thurm's prose has a straightforward clarity that captures the essential  details of her character's lives in these wry short stories. In "Sanctuary," a  gay man, stuck at the bar mitzvah of his lover's only son, finds an unexpected  ally in his lover's ex-wife; a divorcee struggles to overcome her father's  conviction that she's messing up yet again when she decides to marry for a  second time in "Flying." Thurm notes the follies and neuroses of daily life in  urban America with the seemingly innocent fascination of a child watching the  inhabitants of an ant farm.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tulio Fazzolari: "Conversion on the Road to </F> Arcore"]  txt}[Text] First, the owners of small- and medium-sized  companies. Then came the big fish, catching Agnelli by surprise.  Minds change in a hurry. Now there is an army behind Forza  Italia, an army that is almost as big as the Confindustria  [General Confederation of Italian Industry].    Silvio in the midst of the salami makers. Friday, 6 May,  Berlusconi will be the guest of honor at the food industry's  convention. For the first time in the history of the Republic, a  head of state will make his debut among the manufacturers of  bologna and mozzarella. For Berlusconi, however, this is almost  a mandatory act of appreciation. In fact, it is the victorious  general who goes out to thank his most faithful veterans. It was  the leaders of the food industry, guided by their president,  Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara from Bologna (in other  words, the owner of the well-known company Idrolitina), who were  the most enthusiastic supporters of Berlusconi's entrance into  the political arena.    By now, however, they represent just the older nucleus of  the  army of followers that the Forza Italia leader can count on  among the industrialists. Even though the Confindustria  president, Luigi Abete, continues to repeat  vigorously that "the Confindustria does not take sides," in  reality, the industrialists have indeed taken sides, and how.  And of course, they are on the winner's side. Evidence of their  approval of Berlusconi was demonstrated at the meeting the  industrialists' organization held in Verona on 15 and 16 April.  An audience of owners, large and small, almost clapped their  hands off whenever any speaker made favorable mention of the new  majority's platforms. Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi received only scattered applause out of courtesy. Worse  yet, a charismatic entrepreneur like FIAT president Gianni  Agnelli risked a confrontation when he let it be known that  in the Senate he would still vote for Giovanni Spadolini for  speaker of the house, and not for Carlo Scognamiglio,  Berlusconi's candidate.    The opposition to Agnelli was too strong to have come only  from Gazzoni Frascara and the other pioneers of Forza Italia.  They were joined by a crowd of converts, even though they  represented different shades and meanings. Berlusconi's  last-minute followers included many anonymous figures, but also  many prominent Italian industrialists who, until recently, had  not hidden their animosity toward the Fininvest president. Even  Pietro Marzotto, who has always been considered an  almost overly independent man and someone who is completely  averse to following the latest trends, has begun to take sides.  "If I were Agnelli," he stated at the end of the Verona meeting,  "I would take into consideration the way the industrialists  applauded Scognamiglio." In short, Marzotto would have voted  according to Berlusconi's wishes. And yet, it was he who, 12  days earlier (and, therefore, even after the elections), had  pronounced the following, unequivocal words: "Berlusconi as  prime minister would be a mistake. Not from a lack of  appreciation, but I find it unthinkable that a large publisher,  an entrepreneur who owns newspapers and television channels,  could become the head of the government."    But when the unthinkable becomes reality, even Marzotto  adapts. His Veneto region gave the right 53 percent of their  votes and, without a doubt, the Venetian industrialists under  the long-time leadership of Marzotto contributed to this  success. It is necessary, therefore, to bow to the will of the  masses. A similar turnabout occurred in Rome on Thursday, 7  April, during the Confindustria directors' meeting. The  industrialists' leaders are still in shock over the elections  results. "We miscalculated," Abete admits to his closest  colleagues.    The magnitude of Berlusconi's victory stunned the  Confindustria leadership, which had hoped that the center would  hold better than it did. All the people who previously had been  critical of Berlusconi have been left speechless by Forza  Italia's triumph. Abete is silent and so is Aldo  Fumagalli, the feisty president of the young entrepreneurs  who is a strong believer in the Pact for Italy and tends to  sympathize with the Democratic Alliance. Instead, the leader of  the oil industrialists,Gian Marco Moratti, is  talking. From the very first comments of his speech, it is  immediately clear that the only incompatibility existing between  him and Berlusconi is that he is an Inter soccer team fan. Other  than that, Moratti adheres closely to the political positions  held by the owner of the Milan soccer team and the future Prime  Minister. "As long as there is no government," Moratti  concluded, "Italy Inc. is closed. Therefore, it is better to set  aside doubts and concerns and clear the way for Berlusconi." No  sooner said than done. The number of industrialists siding with  Berlusconi are increasing every day. As a consequence, those  individuals who had already chosen Forza Italia have gained  importance within the Confindustria. People like Gazzoni  Frascara or the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of  Lombardy] president, Ennio Presutti. The stock of the  Northern League's Vito Gnutti, whom everyone expects  will be a minister in Berlusconi's future government, has also  risen. And even an unknown, like Giampiero Beccaria,  the managing director of Necchi who was elected in Pavia for the  Freedom Alliance has become a political reference point.    But the feelings of the masses cannot be left in the hands  of  individuals such as these. Confindustria leaders know this and  have started to make up for lost time. Behind the scenes of the  Verona convention, Abete had harsh words of criticism for  Ciampi: "He cannot come here as Prime Minister and then speak  like a politician." The industrialists who hear these words  immediately think that Abete has a plan. First, he will bury  Ciampi's government, whose work he had generously supported, and  then he will make overtures to Berlusconi's government.    Other industrialists do not even bother to proceed step by  step. Former Confindustria president, Vittorio  Merloni, has now rejected both his old Christian Democratic  persuasion and his more recent one of approval for Mario Segni's  Pact for Italy. Now all his affections are reserved for Forza  Italia. Like the true entrepreneur that he is, Merloni can even  give an explanation for this change in marketing terms: A  preelection survey in his Marches region predicted a massive  swing of the population away from the center and toward Forza  Italia. And Merloni moved along with them.    Further north, the battle flag is being lowered by another  former Confindustria president, Luigi Lucchini, who  in Brescia had stubbornly resisted the rising of the League.  When Berlusconi decided to become a candidate, Lucchini  commented--citing an old Lombardy proverb--that everyone should  stick to their own jobs. Two months later in Verona, Lucchini  was among those who tried to explain to Agnelli that he should  not unduly insist on Spadolini's nomination as Senate speaker of  the house. Furthermore, the former Confindustria president, like  Moratti, now states that a Berlusconi government is the only,  and therefore, the best solution.    This attitude is increasing among the Roman Catholic  industrialists. For them there is even a theological explanation  for the success of the Forza Italia leader: Berlusconi is an  "inferior being," but he is still the result of God's will. In  more down-to-earth terms, it means: Since he exists, better that  he govern with us than without us or even against us. So, the  platoon of industrialists who had preferred Segni or  Martinazzoli is thinning out more and more. The feisty Fumagalli  continues to keep silent and prepares to hand over the reins to  Alessandro Riello, who certainly does not appear to  be an anti-Berlusconi warrior. And even if Fumagalli does not  know it, there could be a dramatic change in his attitude, since  the Right intends to put forward his name for president of RAI  [Italian Broadcasting Corporation].    Unexpected capitulations confirm that the group of  non-Berlusconi supporters is in the process of dispersing. An  incorrigible like Giancarlo Lombardi is beginning to  admit that the Forza Italia leader knows how to restore the  country's confidence. Until the end of March he, too, had said  that Berlusconi could not expect to have the unanimous support  of the industrialists and, above all, that the right did not  have convincing platforms.    Now their positions have softened. Many, including Abete,  are  making a few demands. For example, they are asking the  Berlusconi government not to reopen the issue of the wage  agreement that has improved the competitiveness of Italian  businesses. But it seems that these are actually conditions for  an even greater support of the government. There is no trace of  a desire to oppose Berlusconi. If proof be needed, there is an  abundance. The industrialists have never favored playing the  role of opponent.</p>

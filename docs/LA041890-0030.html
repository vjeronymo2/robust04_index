			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVING OLVERA STREET  </P> <P> The article "History Is People, Not Bricks" (California Commentary, April 2) by  Rodolfo Acuna was cruel and biased with false information. He does not know the  facts regarding the curator, Jean Bruce Poole.  </P> <P> She goes the extra mile to promote and preserve the Spanish-Mexican history and  traditions of El Pueblo de Los Angeles. She does all she can toward maintaining  the history of Los Angeles and to protect El Pueblo from commercialism and  further destruction. It seems that Acuna has Poole's efforts confused with the  projects of other factions working to destroy the historical significance of  the area. He expects El Pueblo to preserve Mexican history and culture as would  a Hispanic museum. This is shamefully lacking in Los Angeles but that is  another issue.  </P> <P> As a descendant of two pobladores and two soldados of the 1781 founders of El  Pueblo de Los Angeles, I appreciate Jean Poole's enthusiastic and sincere  support of my heritage. Mi muchas gracias to Jean!  </P> <P> JOSEPH MURILLO  </P> <P> NORTHROP  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Pace of US economic growth beats Wall Street forecasts THE US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the second quarter this year, nearly twice as fast as most Wall Street analysts expected, revised figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday. Officials also announced the biggest revision to earlier estimates of growth in gross domestic product for 20 years. The new figures show that the economy grew at a real rate of 3.9 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1992 - a period in which candidate Bill Clinton capitalised on the supposed economic failure of former president George Bush. Analysts had predicted growth at an annual rate of just 1 per cent in the second quarter following the release of unexpectedly poor trade figures for June. However, the impact of the trade figures was more than offset by upward revisions to federal, state and local government spending and a larger-than-expected increase in corporate inventories. The composition of growth was encouraging, with consumer spending and business investment increasing at annual rates of 3.2 per cent and 14.4 per cent respectively. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, as consumers retrenched after a binge at the end of last year when GDP grew at a revised annual rate of 5.7 per cent, the fastest since 1987. Figures for consumer confidence released yesterday showed no improvement in August, despite passage of President Clinton's budget, which ended uncertainty about future tax rates. The closely watched index compiled by the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, registered 59 in August, unchanged from July and below the 100 plus readings that would be normal in a robust recovery. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said confidence had 'dropped a disconcerting 18 points' since the beginning of the year. The number of respondents fearing worsening business conditions had steadily risen. There was no sign in the latest survey of an imminent acceleration of economic growth, he said. Most private sector economists, however, are still predicting a revival of growth in the second half to an annual rate of 2.5-3 per cent, reflecting the stimulative effect of recent falls in long-term interest rates. The benchmark revisions to GDP amounted to a rewriting of economic history. The new figures suggest that the recession of 1990-91 was mild, with GDP falling only 1.6 per cent from peak to trough, rather than 2.2 per cent. The subsequent recovery was stronger with real GDP growing at an average annual rate of 2.4 per cent rather than 2 per cent. A mild recession, Page 6</p>

Armenian  armed forces have had to suspend combat operations after  sustaining heavy losses in battles on 5-7 March. Armenia has  once again returned to discussing a ceasefire, but the prospect  of a ceasefire does not suit some separatist forces, the  document says. They demonstrated this once again on 12 March,  the day when Rasul Guliyev, the Chairman of the Azerbaijan  Supreme Soviet, was meeting Armenian representatives. Grad  launchers and tanks fired on Azerbaijani positions in Agdam  Rayon and also on the settlement of Ashala Seidakhmedli in  Fizuli Rayon. Azerbaijani forces did not succumb to this  provocation and to preserve conditions essential for peace talks  did not return fire.</p>

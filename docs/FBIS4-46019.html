			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 18 -- As President Farooq Ahmed  Leghari embarked on a two-week "unofficial", but "working" visit  to the United States, official circles here on Wednesday  expressed cautious optimism on improvement of bilateral  relations between Washington and Islamabad.    "The delivery of F-16s to Pakistan and the issue of  non-intrusive inspection of our nuclear facilities by the United  States, will possibly come under review during President Farooq  Leghari's deliberations with the Clinton Administration,"  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told newsmen.    In the light of India's refusal to the U.S. proposals on its  nuclear non-proliferation Sardar Asif was asked to clarify  Pakistan's position on its acceptance of nuclear "non-intrusive"  inspection. He said: "If the U.S. proposals are acceptable to  Pakistan and are totally in line with our nuclear policy, we  will accept them."    Would Pakistan then he accepting them unilaterally, given  the  fact that India had already rejected all such American  proposals? The Foreign Minister was unable to give a  satisfactory reply.    Conceding that the "United States through its non-intrusive  technical means was satisfied that Pakistan had not as yet  produced nuclear weapons," the Foreign Minister listed recent  positive developments which indicated a renewed U.S.  understanding of Pakistan's stated position on its nuclear  programme, which was now more "even-handed."    "The fact that the United States has not asked us to roll  back our nuclear programme, but to cap it instead, and its  viewing of the non-proliferation issue in the context of  regional security," puts Pakistan on a "high moral ground", as  opposed to India, who has bluntly refused the U.S. proposals on  capping and verifiable physical or nonphysical inspection of its  nuclear sites, he said.    The Foreign Minister was confident that Pakistan would not  only get the 38 F-16s but also succeed in resolving the nuclear  issue with the United States by the end of this year. "But, our  view on receipt of F-16s and capping of our nuclear programme is  very clear: the two have nothing to do with each other," Sardar  Asif pointed out.    On the downside of U.S.-Pakistan relations, Sardar Asif,  reacting sharply to the American State Department spokesman,  Mike McCurry's statement on alleged official Pakistani support  to the Kashmiri Mujahideen and that Pakistan could be put on the  terrorist list any time, said: "We are extremely surprised that  a senior official should make such an allegation against  Pakistan. It leads us to believe that these kinds of statements  are made perhaps to please Mr Narasimha Rao."    Sardar Asif said the Western world was bending backwards to  please the Indian Prime Minister. "Selling cokes appears more  important than solving the human rights problems," he remarked  in reply to a question about the West disregarding India's human  rights violations in lieu of economic trade-offs.    Sardar Asif, who leaves for Afghanistan on May 24 carrying  peace proposals for the Afghan leaders, told newsmen that apart  from re-opening the Pakistan mission in Kabul in the building  the British government has partly handed over, he will discuss  the possibility of opening another mission in Herat with General  Ismail Khan.    The foreign minister will float the idea for an Afghanistan  peace making fund, because when normality is restored,  Afghanistan will need a lot of money for reconstruction.</p>

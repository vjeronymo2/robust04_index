			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLISH POLICE BREAK UP 1 DEMONSTRATION, ALLOW A 2ND ONE  </P> <P> Police wielding truncheons broke up a protest by 2,000 students in the southern  city of Krakow on Friday but allowed a similar demonstration in Warsaw outside  the site of historic opposition-government talks.  </P> <P> The Warsaw protest was the first legal student street demonstration since the  imposition of martial law in 1981.  </P> <P> The Krakow students, who were demanding the legalization of their student  union, tried to march across the city, but police blocked their path and used  truncheons to disperse them, a student source who insisted on anonymity said.  "Several students were detained," the source said.  </P> <P> The Krakow rally was organized by the illegal Confederation of the Independent  Poland, a group the government claims wants to overthrow the Communist system  and thus is not considered part of Poland's so-called "constructive  opposition."  </P> <P> In Warsaw, about 300 students marched from Warsaw University to the site of the  so-called "round-table" talks, chanting "We want free elections," and other  slogans.  </P> <P> The talks, involving representatives of the government, the banned Solidarity  union and other groups, are aimed at setting a course for Poland's future and  the relegalization of the union.  </P></p>

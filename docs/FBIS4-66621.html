			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khadidja Zeghloul, Samir Knayaz, and Ryad </F> Kramdi: "Batna Has Still Not Shaken Off Its Lethargy" -- first  paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] It has been more  than a week since the spectacular attack on the Tazoult  (Lambese) prison. The tension is still high in Batna.    The queen of the Aures Mountains, the attractive city of  Batna, which until recently was still a little haven of peace,  is now living in anguish and fear. This can be easily read on  the drawn faces of its residents. It has now been more than a  week since Thursday, 10 March, at about 1900, when "a squadron"  made up of 150 to 200 terrorists attacked the well-known high  security prison (the Tazoult Lambese Detention Center) and freed  about 900 prisoners, among them dangerous terrorists sentenced  to death by the special courts, mainly for murders. This prison,  which houses approximately 2,200 detainees, is located less than  15 km from downtown Batna, making it a prime refuge for certain  escapees.    Besides, some of them were found and captured in town. This  is basically why the residents of Batna are afraid. It is a fear  that set in very early and continues to turn Batna into a town  that is virtually dead.    Elsewhere, in Tazoult, where the prison is located, the  pot-holed streets are still wet with last night's rain.    In the square opposite the prison, some young men are  playing  with a ball. A herd of goats and sheep walks lazily by.    A few more minutes go by and a gate at Lambese opens: About  50 guards emerge in a quick procession--these guards were on  duty during the attack--and, as they push on, they just raise  their hands to stop any questioning: "I have nothing to say";  only those who were not on duty that night agree to talk about  the event. But there, in their neighborhood, they saw only  shadows moving taking up positions in the village's dark  streets. As was only proper, the attackers had cut off electric  current. How many of them were there? "A great many," "they came  in groups from everywhere," pushing aside the few residents who  were still in the street when the fast was broken. At each  entrance to the city of Batna checkpoints were set up. If in  downtown you could mention two permanent gendarme roadblocks  staffed by several men armed with Kalashnikovs, as you entered  the city, coming from Barika, as on the road leading towards the  village of Tazoult Lambese, much more impressive means were  deployed. At the two ends of the city, the army was on the  watch, backed up by tanks and big troop carrier trucks. Just  about every vehicle was gone over with a fine-toothed comb, with  taxis given "special treatment." The same thing for passengers.    The more careful checking of taxis can doubtless be  explained  by the fact that many vehicles of this type had been stolen from  their owners by the terrorists at the time of the attack. They  had even stolen identification papers and sometimes citizens'  professional cards.    At regular intervals, helicopters belonging to the  gendarmerie and the National People's Assembly [APN] fly over  the region, most particularly the many mountains and vast  stretches. Indeed, these flights take place in practically every  wilaya bordering on Batna. The first planes we could see were  patrolling over the plains of the Setif, about 150 km away from  Batna.    However, we were told, the principal mission of these  helicopters is to ensure air coverage for troops carrying out  sweeps searching for groups of escapees and attackers, a goodly  number of whom, if certain information is to be believed, are  still entrenched in the Aures Mountains. According to leaked  information, numerous caches have been discovered and food and  medicines as well as bedding have been recovered. On the road  linking Setif to Batna, going through Barika, the first and only  major roadblock has been set up by soldiers and gendarmes as you  leave the village of Megra slightly more than 100 km before  Batna.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE KITCHEN: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> DRAW WHILE YOU EAT  </P> <P> CRAYONS AT THE table was one of the great restaurant innovations of the '80s.  Remember when you could hardly walk into a restaurant without finding a jar of  crayons sitting next to the salt and pepper shakers? The tables themselves were  covered with butcher paper, and nervous doodlers could simply while away the  time until supper made its appearance. Some artists even insisted on taking the  table covering home with them when they left.  </P> <P> Now somebody's brought the idea home. Snap-Up Scribble Mats are plastic place  mats that come with a little package of crayons attached. The bored diner is  thus encouraged to scribble his way through dinner. When the meal's over, you  simply take a sponge, wipe the mats off and wait until it's time for the next  meal to roll around.  </P> <P> You can see by the design that these place mats were intended for children.  What a waste. Most children have no trouble at all amusing themselves at the  dinner table and could probably think of many better things to do at the table  than draw. It's the adults who need to be entertained during dinner, and there  probably aren't very many adults who wouldn't be thrilled to sit down to supper  and find a crayon waiting. It would certainly be one way to make a long evening  seem shorter.  </P> <P> Snap-Up Scribble Mats are $4.95 at Fred Segal, 8112 Melrose Ave., West  Hollywood; telephone (213) 651-3698.  </P></p>

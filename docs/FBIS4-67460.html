			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Anton Vernitskiy; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Today, an international conference on the problems  of the Chernobyl nuclear electric power station began in Vienna,  which is being held under the aegis of the IAEA. Experts from  that organization who made an inspection of that station in the  Ukraine came to the conclusion that at the present time the  state of the nuclear power station does not correspond to the  generally accepted international standards.    [Vernitskiy] It was proposed that this conference should be  held by IAEA General Director Hans Blix. At the beginning of  April he visited the Chernobyl nuclear power station with a  group of experts for the purpose of checking how safe it is.  The conclusions of the experts were not comforting. According  to Blix' statement, the safety norms at the station do not  correspond to even the least stringent international standards.  First and foremost, the state of the sarcophagus on the  destroyed reactor of the fourth power unit gives cause for  concern, as well as the shortage of modern equipment and spare  parts. Besides this, the funds allocated for the elimination of  the consequences of the radioactive contamination are constantly  being reduced.    In their turn, the Ukrainian authorities think that the data  given in the IAEA representatives' report are somewhat  exaggerated, although according to Valentin (Kupnov), who is  responsible for the safety of the Chernobyl zone, the best  solution would be the mothballing of the Chernobyl nuclear power  station. However, Ukraine cannot simply close down the nuclear  power station. An extremely acute shortage of energy resources  threatens the Ukrainian economy with complete paralysis.    It is most likely that at the conference in Vienna, Ukraine  will be offered help in financing the development of the atomic  industry in exchange for shutting down the Chernobyl atomic  power station.

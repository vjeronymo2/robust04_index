			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'YELLOWSTONE' THE NOVEL  </P> <P> I am disappointed in Michael J. Carroll's review (Book Review, Nov. 20) of my  novel, "The Yellowstone."  </P> <P> Carroll doesn't take care of the first piece of business of any review, to  report to the reader the basic facts about the book. So here they are.  </P> <P>  "The Yellowstone": The first of a series called Rivers West, is a generational  novel set in the Yellowstone country about the trader Mac Maclean and his  family of Indian wives and half-breed children. In the first part, at the end  of the fur trade era, Mac tries to establish a life for himself among the  Cheyennes. A generation later, the family struggles to keep its native life way  in the face of the Montana gold rush. The book has a bizarre cast, from  idiosyncratic mountain men to a Scots lord to a Cheyenne male who lives his  life as a female to a Jewish peddler, of all things, who traipses the Great  Plains pulling a handcart full of sewing gear.  </P> <P> Aside from underreporting, Carroll does some misreporting: He invents a rape  that isn't there, and calls my book a frontier novel when it's set a thousand  miles beyond the frontier. He also chastises me for my descriptions of the  Yellowstone country. But those descriptions are from the point of view of the  central character, Mac, so the language is not mine but his.  </P> <P> I'll grant Carroll whatever opinion of my novel he likes, but not his critical  ineptitude. If I'm going to get knocked, I want to get knocked by somebody  good.  </P> <P> WINFRED BLEVINS  </P> <P> JACKSON, WYO.  </P></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Inequality in society wedding: The merger plans of the Halifax and the Leeds The announcement yesterday of merger plans between Halifax, the UK's largest building society, and Leeds Permanent, the fifth largest, surprised many observers with its timing. But the likelihood of mergers in the sector - and the desire of both societies to find partners - is not new. However, yesterday's plans have gone further than many expected in the intention that the combined organisation should become a public limited company and seek a Stock Exchange flotation. The benefits of conversion for Abbey National, the first building society to have chosen plc status, have not been so self-evident that any others have since followed that path. Mr Jon Foulds, the Halifax chairman, who will chair the new organisation, was upbeat about the consequences, however: 'We propose to create a new force in personal financial services,' he said. The wooing of Leeds by Halifax began with talks in the spring, after the announcement of an agreed Pounds 1.8bn cash bid by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, the sixth largest. Leeds had already been to the altar once recently, in merger talks with National &amp; Provincial Building Society - a move that would have created the UK's third-largest society. When those broke down up in October last year, Leeds was left looking forlorn. At its annual general meeting in May, Halifax made clear it was seeking a merger in pursuit of its mission to be the UK's biggest and best provider of personal financial services. The problem was whether any society would want to be the junior partner. Halifax and Leeds will have to persuade several audiences that they have ended up with the right match: The members of the two societies - investors and borrowers - who must approve by substantial majorities both the merger and the later conversion to plc status. The money markets on which the new organisation will borrow wholesale funds  -at rates that will depend on the judgment of the viability of the merger made by the US ratings agencies. The capital markets will also have to be convinced that the plans for the future make sense if the flotation is to be successful. Some points in the merger plan have a wide appeal. Members, staff and financial monitors are likely to be pleased with the prospects for growth for the new organisation which will be able to provide a wider range of products to both societies' customers. Leeds, for example, does not offer a current account with a cheque book; Halifax does, and will want to sell the service to Leeds customers. Within five years, Halifax is likely to want to use the greater freedoms that accompany its new status to produce as well as sell personal lines of general insurance, such as motor and travel. No cash sum is on offer for members, as a result of the merger, to compare with the share of the Pounds 1.8bn on offer from Lloyds Bank to Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester members. But any dismay among members that they will not receive such a bonus is likely to be outweighed by the prospect of free shares when the merged building society is floated. The advantages to Halifax of acquiring around 4 per cent of the current UK mortgage market and access to a further 2.5m customers without having to make a cash bid are clear. The benefits to the Leeds of this deal are much less obvious. The society will have the advantage of being reunited with Mr Mike Blackburn, the chief executive who left the Leeds in February last year to run Halifax. And being part of the larger organisation - likely to be the third largest UK high-street bank by asset size - will ensure that it is not squeezed out in the increasingly competitive financial services sector. The Halifax's contribution to the new group is much the larger - and not merely in terms of the Pounds 69.9bn it provides of the Pounds 90bn assets of the combined operation. It will also contribute its name and its head office, as well as its chairman and chief executive. Leeds is bringing the brand names of some of its products. But rather than giving up its identity to join Halifax, the Leeds could have chosen another, less powerful partner that would have allowed for a more equal relationship within an organisation large enough to survive. Its motivation in choosing Halifax is mystifying competitors. 'I can't see what's in it for the Leeds,' one chief executive commented. 'I was surprised,' said another, 'I thought they would reject it because of the likely branch closures.' What the future of the branch network might be is an issue requiring diverse messages about the benefits to different audiences. The two organisations have more than 1,100 branches, with considerable overlap. The temptation to rationalise the combined branch network and cut expenses will be strong. Mr Roger Boyes, Leeds's acting chief executive, insists that there would be no need for large numbers of branches to be closed and staff to be made redundant. He argues that the planned expansion of business in financial services will provide a use for the extra branches. The new organisation is planned to employ about 27,000 staff and re-training, redeployment and natural wastage, should mean no need for compulsory redundancies, he hopes. That stance, expressed also by Halifax, is intended to reassure members that they will not suffer a loss in the availability of services, and to give confidence to staff that there will not be massive job cuts. There is some merit in expressing this view: the outspoken way in which 1,600 job losses among 9,800 staff were envisaged in the announcement of the merger between Leeds and National &amp; Provincial last August was one of the factors in its downfall. But retaining most of the existing branch network would be far from reassuring to the credit ratings agencies. It could also undermine the two societies' current cost to income ratios of around 40 per cent - below the sector average. The shadow over societies is the merger of Nationwide and Anglia building societies in 1987. The two businesses were not properly combined, and it is only relatively recently that Nationwide has shown signs of tackling the high cost to income ratio and regaining competitiveness. Halifax competitors believe that whatever is said to ensure approval of the merger, the society's management will be prepared to take tough decisions on rationalising the combined organisation. Only if it does - and can make the most of its added size and wider powers to provide a wide range of financial products efficiently - will yesterday's announcement of merger and conversion set the pattern for tomorrow's moves among other societies. They will be watching closely.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax and Leeds: building a brighter future  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Halifax               Leeds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total assets                  Pounds 69.9bn (as      Pounds 20.6bn (as                                  at 31.7.94)            at 30.9.94) UK building society ranking  by total assets                       1                     5 Number of employees            approx 22,000            approx 5,000 Number of branches                   687                     453 Number of agencies                 1,143                 approx 120 Number of investing members       approx 6m               approx 2m Number of borrowing members         1.86m                   0.5m Pre-tax annual profit           Pounds 866m              Pounds 246m Cost/Income ratio                   39.6%                   40.2%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Halifax/Leeds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

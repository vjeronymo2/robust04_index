			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Hurd seeks to unite party before Euro poll The European Union must find ways for member states to be comfortable about their European identity without feeling that their national interests are being undermined, Mr Douglas Hurd said yesterday. The foreign secretary used a speech in Warsaw to try to stake out common Conservative ground ahead of next month's European elections, in which the party hopes to avoid a second humiliation. Addressing the Polish parliament, Mr Hurd spoke of a 'strong Europe of self-confident nation states' and said that a 'multi-speed, multi-track, even multi-faceted Europe' was taking shape. The foreign secretary's remarks came against a backdrop of growing alarm in Tory ranks about the implications of Thursday night's local election results for next month's European elections and Mr Major's premiership. It is widely thought that the Tories need to hold at least half their 32 European seats to give the prime minister a decent chance of survival. The blunt message from the local elections is that this could well be a tall order. The Conservatives' 27 per cent share of the vote on Thursday night was only the same as that obtained by the Liberal Democrats, and is far below the 34.7 per cent they secured in the 1989 European elections. To make matters worse, the local electorate showed a tendency to vote for the candidates who appeared to stand the best chance of kicking - or keeping  -the Tories out. If this inclination is repeated next month, it could be decisive in the crucial battle in the Conservative heartland of southern England where the party is fighting tooth and nail to stop a widely predicted Liberal Democrat surge in the south-west from spreading east to the Cotswolds, Hampshire and beyond. Early projections suggest the Liberal Democrats may have taken as much as 40 per cent of Thursday night's vote in southern England excluding London. It would now require a remarkable reversal of fortunes to prevent Tory-held European seats in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset from falling. But it is the results farther east - where the Liberal Democrats swept to victories in Bath, Eastleigh and Winchester, gained seats in Stroud and Portsmouth, held Cheltenham with ease and frustrated Labour's expectations of winning control of Gloucester - that will have been more disquieting for the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats can now have realistic hopes of breaking out of the south-west into the neighbouring counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Hampshire. They believe several gains are possible on swings of 10 per cent or less. Further east again, the Liberal Democrats won control of councils such as Mole Valley, St Albans and Worthing, deprived the Tories of control in true-blue Tunbridge Wells and made sweeping gains in the London suburb of Bromley. This suggests they could be a force to be reckoned with next month even in the Home Counties, where the party estimates it needs a swing of about 12 per cent before it begins to make headway. Tory strategists will also be noting nervously that the Greens - in their brief spell in the electoral limelight five years ago - took a quarter of the vote in 1989 in Sussex West and 23 per cent in both Cotswolds and Hereford &amp; Worcester. Precious little of that surprisingly heavy environmental protest vote is likely to come the Conservatives' way five years later.</p>

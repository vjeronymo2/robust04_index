			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report An extremely active and extended afternoon fixing session on the London bullion market saw heavy selling before GOLD was fixed at Dollars 342.30 a troy ounce, down Dollars 1.70 from the morning fix. Brokers reported large Middle East sell orders as the fix began, with dealers in New York reporting bids ranging up to 200,000 and 350,000 ounces. Dealers said there was no sign of producers in the market and no initial indications of official selling. London's robusta COFFEE prices closed steady and New York arabica futures moved above lifetime lows by midday as the markets awaited developments at the slow-moving ICO talks in London. London September COCOA touched a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 511 a tonne before recovering some of the loss by the close. Dealers said that the Ivory Coast and Ghana, under pressure to pay off debts, had large amounts to sell in the near future. 'Until people think they have sold enough to satisfy the IMF, the market is going to remain depressed,' said one trader. Three-month ZINC extended an early short covering move on the LME, breaking above Dollars 1,240 a tonne and almost reaching Dollars 1,250.</p>

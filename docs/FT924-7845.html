			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (8): Markets succumb - The Midlands / Confidence has evaporated PROPERTY markets in the Midlands are not exactly bubbling and some have succumbed to inertia since the post-election confidence - evident throughout the economy - evaporated in June and July. The East Midlands, said Mr Tony Hewitt, chief executive of Connell Wilson, surveyors, 'withstood the storm better than most. But it desperately needs some boost to the economy.' The East Midlands, he went on, is better than the West Midlands and they are both better than the south-east of England. Both Midlands regions have in common the fact that the retail sector is flat. 'You only have to look at the agents' boards on a high street,' noted Mr Hewitt. In the Birmingham area of the West Midlands, 'most retailers have put plans on hold and are concentrating on survival,' according to Chesterton, surveyors, although it observed that there is little vacant space in the big shopping centres. The office market is more complex, more varied. There has been some stimulus in Nottingham because of planned government department relocations, notably that of the Inland Revenue. Derby, too, is receiving 1,700 Prison Service posts. Such relocations have prompted rivalries in the area, with Mansfield District Council pointing out that average office rents in its area are Pounds 8 a square foot compared with Pounds 12 in Nottingham, Lincoln, Leicester and Derby and Pounds 16 in Northampton. However, Mr Hewitt has noticed some slippage in Northampton rents for new accommodation to more like Pounds 12-Pounds 13 a sq ft. The contrary is true in central Birmingham, where, said Mr Roger Ford of Chesterton, rents are stable and there are very few discounts. 'If you look at quality space - raised floors, air-conditioning and so on - there is very little available. It's down to about 50,000 sq ft.' Rents are steady at about Pounds 20 a sq ft. But office property , especially, in small units, is freely available at much lower prices in the fringe areas of the city. On the industrial side of the West Midlands, there is a lot of what Mr Ford called 'poor property' available, but not very much which is brand new. Deals are being done, although. But both the East and West Midlands have a firm market in large distribution sheds.</p>

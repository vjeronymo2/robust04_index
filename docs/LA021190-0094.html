			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A FANCY FOR NANCY;  </P> <P> FORMER 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' PERFORMER AGAIN DONS A LACQUERED WIG AND A COPY OF  AN ADOLFO SUIT TO SAVAGE THE EX-FIRST LADY IN HIS ONE-MAN SHOW  </P> <P> Why is Terry Sweeney dressing up as Nancy Reagan -- again?  </P> <P> "When she wrote her book -- well, that was the last straw," said the ponytailed  performance artist who opens today at Santa Monica's Highways in "It's Still My  Turn," a one-man, one-two punch aimed squarely at America's former First Lady.  "It was very false, very 'Feel sorry for me,' still trying to manipulate public  sympathy. I thought, 'I've had it with her.' It just crossed the limit of what  I could take."  </P> <P> The association is neither accidental nor recent. It's been more than three  years since Sweeney first donned a lacquered wig and Adolfo suit (OK, a copy of  an Adolfo) as a cast member on NBC-TV's "Saturday Night Live." In fact, he won  the role when "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels caught his multiple  characterizations -- including his drag rendition of a low-rent gossip  columnist named Connie Chutzpah -- at New York's 78th St. Theatre Lab.  </P> <P> "They asked me if I could do Nancy Reagan, because they wanted to do political  material," said the Long Island native. "The first sketch we did was a takeoff  on 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'; Charles and Diana were over and the  evening just got worse and worse. I found that once I got into that Adolfo  suit, I could say anything. And Nancy gave us plenty of material. Everything  she was doing or not doing became fodder for us."  </P> <P> Sweeney's Highways program is a continuation of that relationship. He subtitles  the show (excerpted from his upcoming book of the same name), "An Unauthorized  Collection of Nancy Reagan's Private Poetry." In one poem, titled "Oh, I Had  the Scariest Dream Last Night," Sweeney's First Lady intones, "I gave my old  clothes to a mission, a shelter for women in need, and I even threw in my good  china as my second noble deed."  </P> <P> The 38-year-old performer said, "I think people are reacting to her fakeness,  her insensitivity, her hypocrisy. See, I'm a lover of truth; I like people to  be truthful. But this is not a vendetta, and there are other things I like to  lampoon. Sure, part of it's about what happens when you take public office,  part of being out there. Look, I wasn't the one who went out and bought new  china. She did.  </P> <P> "Parody is one way of processing that behavior," he continued. "And that's what  the artist does in our society. The artist doesn't have any rules. He says,  'This is what I see. I'm going to hold up a mirror; you may not like the  reflection, but I'm still going to hold it up.' I think we can't help but be  political people. And we have a responsibility to respond in the way we know  best. I'm a performance artist, I do political satire."  </P> <P> Highways co-founder Tim Miller said he believes that Sweeney "fits in really  well in both the sex and politics part" of the theater's current "Sex, God and  Politics" performance festival. "It isn't stand-up," he explained, "more of a  strange character performance."  </P> <P> Yet despite Highways' non-traditionalist profile, Sweeney doesn't think he'll  be playing solely for the already converted -- or causing more polarization in  a society already so divided.  </P> <P> "Not all Republicans are archconservatives," said Sweeney, adding that some  audience members come up after a show and say, " 'I'm a Republican, and I still  think it's hilarious.'  </P> <P> "You know, there are a lot of Republicans who don't like the Reagans, don't  like what they stood for or how they behaved," Sweeney said. "Already we're  seeing the damage: to black people, gays. And Nancy and Ron are like,  'La-la-la, $2 million to speak in Japan. . . . ' "  </P> <P> Since people in glass houses ought not to throw stones, Sweeney keeps a tight  leash on his own words ("I have to catch myself sometimes, when I'm being  hypocritical") and life style. For that reason -- and because, as he says, he  loves truth -- -- Sweeney publicly admitted he was gay in 1986. "I guess it was  a brave thing to do," he said. "You're challenging people's value systems, and  they're going to react. A lot of them will say, 'OK, be gay -- but don't flaunt  it.' "  </P> <P> Sweeney (whose biography describes him as "openly gay") is fully aware that his  frankness may affect his career.  </P> <P> "But it's what I am," he said simply. "I'm also an animal rights activist. If  someone wants to make fun of that, satirize me or my values . . . well, that's  life."  </P> <P> Sweeney hopes that societal tolerance for gays isn't too far in the future.  </P> <P> "I've been in a relationship with a man -- Bill Lovejoy, my writing partner --  for nine years," he said. "We're like a married couple."  </P> <P>  "It's Still My Turn" plays today, Feb. 18 and 25 at 3 p.m., and 10:30 p.m.  every Saturday beginning March 10 at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica.  (213) 453-1755. Admission is $8.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 17 (AFP) -- An agreement between the  European Union [EU] and Japan to restrict the export of Japanese  cars until end-1999 could be jeopardised by calls for the accord  to be extended, a senior EU official said here Thursday [17  March].    EU Industrial Commissioner Martin Bangemann warned that the  1999 deadline needed to be honoured in the interests of both  sides. "Whoever asks today for a prorogation of the arrangement  jeopardises the current talks," he said.    Bangemann was speaking on the first of two days of  negotiations between the Union and Japan in Tokyo to set levels  of Japanese car exports into the EU for 1994.    His warning was clearly addressed to France. French Industry  and Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said last week that the 1991  agreement to curb Japanese car exports to the EU should be  extended for two years after 1999.    EU officials said they wanted Japanese car exports in 1994  to  be maintained at last year's level to reflect a stagnant  European market where sales are expected to show zero or very  low growth this year.    They noted that this would mean higher Japanese car sales in  Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, because import  barriers had kept Japanese penetration in the five countries at  particularly low levels until 1993.    The 1991 agreement provided for Japan to regulate overall  car  exports to the EU until 1999 according to demand, raising them  moderately when the market was good and reducing them in years  of declining sales.    Thus, the two sides agreed to cut Japan's 1993 exports to  the  union by 18.4 percent (to 980,000 units -- about 8.4 percent of  the market) to reflect a 15.9 percent drop in car sales in the  EU.    The 1991 agreement aims at giving European car-makers a  breathing space until 1999 to restructure and prepare for  unrestricted Japanese competition. It was prompted by the EU's  single market launched on January 1 last year, which eliminated  barriers between EU countries.    This meant that national quotas for Japanese auto imports in  Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain became impossible to  enforce.    The Japanese share of the auto market in these countries is  supposed to increase gradually until 1999, even in bad years.</p>

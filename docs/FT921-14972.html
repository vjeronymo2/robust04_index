			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Poor hopes for sales of companies THE MARKET for selling unquoted businesses was depressed last year and there is little prospect of an upturn this year, according to Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants. Prices were lower in 1991 than in previous years and were also low relative to the sums paid for similar quoted companies. Many of the sales that were made resulted from companies' going into receivership or administration or were distress sales intended to raise desperately needed cash. In the UK, companies were already over-borrowed and would need to devote their resources to rebuilding finances rather than making acquisitions. Companies in continental Europe that paid what seemed generous prices for UK companies over the past two years were less keen to make foreign acquisitions now that their own economies were moving into recession. Nevertheless, for buyers who were confident of the future, this year should be good for making purchases, Ernst &amp; Young said. The economic cycle was at or near its trough, while vendors should be more realistic in their price expectations.</p>

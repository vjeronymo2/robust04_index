			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Jobs move for Royal Navy TWO administrative units are to be built in Portsmouth for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines under plans for rationalising senior staff structures. The plans, yet to be officially announced, are expected to result in the transfer of several hundred jobs. The Navy's personnel department will move to Portsmouth from London and merge with the home command headquarters in new premises in the naval base. This change, due to take place by the spring of 1994, will involve combining the jobs of Second Sea Lord, now held by Admiral Sir Michael Livesay, and of Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, held by Admiral Sir John Kerr. At the same time, Royal Marines headquarters oper-ations in London, Plymouth and Poole are also to move to Portsmouth, where a building to be completed in November 1994 is planned on Whale Island.</p>

Winslow fired two more rounds at the car when it stopped at an intersection and  the other youth allegedly got out of the back seat with a handgun, Lawrence  said.  </P> <P> The second barrage of shots sent the suspects fleeing again, according to  Lawrence, but their car later struck a utility pole at Westmoreland and 9th  Street. Winslow held all six occupants of the car at gunpoint until  reinforcements arrived, Lawrence said. Marco Silva, 20, and the two teens were  held on attempted murder charges.  </P></p>

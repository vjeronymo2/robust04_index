			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Level of student debt rises rapidly THE LEVEL of student debt is rising rapidly, with four out of five students ending this academic year in the red, says a survey by Barclays Bank. The average undergraduate owes Pounds 1,672, up almost 22 per cent from the equivalent figure in last year's survey. This year's new graduates expect to owe Pounds 1,900, compared with Pounds 1,765 for last year's graduates. Students appear to be over-optimistic about how quickly they will be able to pay back their borrowings. In spite of the poor employment climate, more than a third hope to pay off their debts by the next academic year by finding a summer job. Many students also under-estimate how deeply they are likely to be in debt by the end of their courses, and 45 per cent believe they can discharge the debt within two years of graduating. Government student loans appear to be gaining acceptance, with 46 per cent of students in the survey having taken out a government loan, up from 31 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Italian government forced to defend Omnitel-Pronto Italia decision The Italian government was forced yesterday to defend its decision to announce on election night that Omnitel-Pronto Italia, led by Olivetti, had won the licence for the new Europe-wide GSM mobile telecommunications contract, writes John Simkins in Milan. Mr Maurizio Pagani, postal services minister, said the decision had been made according to transparent technical guidelines 'independent of the elections'. He said the decision had to be taken considering that the government's advisers had already delivered their report. Mr Pagani's intervention followed criticism from politicians about the timing, including from within Forza Italia, led by Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company was among members of Unitel, the losing consortium.</p>

Unlike last year, when more than 400 cases were  recorded, this year there have been only 11. This proves that  the regular information given to the citizens on how to protect  themselves from that disease has begun to yield results.    Furthermore, teams of experts regularly check the herds in  the private and public sectors and conduct examinations, after  which any animal suffering from brucellosis is destroyed  immediately.</p>

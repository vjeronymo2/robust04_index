			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> HOUSING MANAGER TO STAY  </P> <P> Culver City Housing Manager Phyllis Baboolal, offered a job in Hawthorne and a  pay raise in Culver City to keep her, has decided to stay.  </P> <P> Praising her work, the City Council three weeks ago gave Baboolal a raise of  nearly 20%, from $4,354 to $5,210 a month, while she was one of two finalists  for the job of housing director in Hawthorne. She was then offered the  Hawthorne job, which would pay $66,000 a year, Baboolal said. The Culver City  raise put her at $62,520.  </P> <P> Baboolal, Culver City's housing manager for seven years, said, "Basically, I'm  very happy here," adding that she appreciates the City Council's support of the  city's housing programs. The pay increase was one factor in her decision to  stay in the city, Baboolal said, because she has two children in college.  </P></p>

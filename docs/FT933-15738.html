			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gaylord hits the high notes with latest craze for country music - The success and aspirations of an entertainment group devoted to the values of rural America CRAZY as a 'coon. That, roughly speaking, was how much of the US television industry dismissed upstart Gaylord Entertainment in 1983 when it launched a cable network devoted to subjects which stir the soul of rural America - such as country music, drag car racing, pick-up trucks, down-home cooking and bass fishing. Yet, 10 years later, Gaylord's The Nashville Network (TNN) is one of the most successful US cable channels and a second network, Country Music Television, which Gaylord acquired in 1991, is among America's fastest-growing cable services. Gaylord, in short, is riding high on a boom in country music which has made this the fastest-growing form of popular music in the US. And now it is hoping to export its success to Europe. The boom seems due largely to the emergence of a new generation of young singers - led by the phenomenally popular Garth Brooks - who are more able to cross the boundary which has traditionally distinguished country from the broader pop stream. Country is also benefiting as pop fans turn away from rap and grunge, and from a vogue for simpler, rural values. Whatever the cause, Gaylord, based in Nashville, Tennessee, is ideally placed to benefit, for it dominates country music in a similar manner to Walt Disney's hold on children's entertainment, with interests ranging from cable networks to a theme park. At the heart of the group, giving it coherence, is its ownership of country music's most venerated institution, the Grand Ole Opry. This is a folksy show, broadcast from Nashville ever since 1925, which has played a central role in the development of 'country' artists. The Opry House, where performances are held, is a key feature of Gaylord's nerve centre, the Opryland complex, just outside Nashville. The complex includes its theme park and the Opryland hotel, an imposing building in southern plantation style featuring vast glass-enclosed gardens, complete with waterfalls and fountains synchronised to accompany evening performances by a harpist. 'This is not just a hotel, this is an entertainment experience,' says Mr Terry London, Gaylord's chief financial officer, sipping a drink against a backdrop of 10,000 tropical plants. Gaylord - quoted on the New York Stock Exchange but 59 per cent held by the family and associates of its eponymous chairman, Mr Edward Gaylord - was an Oklahoma-based owner of newspapers and broadcasting stations until 1983, when it bought the Grand Ole Opry and the adjoining hotel and theme park. It went public with a stock offering in October 1991, partly to provide for growth and partly to give liquidity to the founding families, and since then the share price has soared from Dollars 20.50 to around Dollars 45. Group revenues jumped from Dollars 417m in 1988 to Dollars 643m last year and operating cash flow from Dollars 64.4m to Dollars 150.8m. Gaylord's growth is due to more than being in the right place at the right time. It has gained a reputation for good management, a sensible expansion strategy, strong finances and an ability to cross-promote its subsidiaries. The major source of profit and revenue growth for the foreseeable future will be the two cable networks, which already provide over 30 per cent of cash flow. TNN reaches 57m subscribers - 93 per cent of cable households in the US and 61 per cent of TV households. Mr London says it still has plenty of growth potential, since cable will continue to penetrate US homes at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent a year. Also, TNN's advertising sales are still somewhat below those of some other networks because of Madison Avenue's past prejudice against country music. But Gaylord's greatest growth over the medium term is likely to come from CMT, which broadcasts non-stop country music videos. Since Gaylord acquired 67 per cent of CMT 18 months ago, the network has increased its number of subscribers from 10m to around 19m. It attracts a much more youthful audience than TNN, which should make it attractive to advertisers, and its programming costs are small, since record companies provide it with videos free. Last October, CMT launched a service into the fledgling European cable television market, which Gaylord thinks offers good long-term growth prospects. Says Mr London: 'Estimates suggest there will be 54m cable homes in Europe by the year 2000. There are currently 60m in the US. So we have the opportunity to repeat what we have done here.' It remains a moot point, however, whether Europeans will get excited about something as quintessentially middle-American as country music, even if CMT waters down its programming for transatlantic consumption. Gaylord is also looking for significant growth at the Opryland Hotel, which is already one of the 20 largest hotels in the US in terms of guest rooms. A leading convention centre, it has more than 2m room nights of bookings, stretching to the year 2009, and an 86 per cent occupancy rate. Gaylord has just announced plans for Dollars 175m of capital spending to add 979 rooms to the existing 1,891, to double the trade show facilities, and to create another immense glass covered space called 'The Delta.' Two main dangers would appear to face Gaylord. One is that it might grow faster than its management resources, though it recently addressed this by hiring Mr Richard Evans, former president of New York City's Madison Square Garden auditorium, as chief operating officer. The second is that country music could prove a temporary craze, as in the past. However, Mr David Hall, general manager of TNN, argues that at the end of each boom industry revenues have remained higher than before the craze began, and he expects this long-term growth pattern to continue. 'We will find artists that will . . . keep pushing up that trendline further and further, if no one goes to sleep at the wheel,' he insists. 'We're dealing with a lifestyle here.'</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure will raise Pounds 7.6m via flotation PARKDEAN LEISURE, the holiday park operator, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing its shares at 120p and arranging an institutional placing which will raise Pounds 7.63m net for the company. The price values the whole company at Pounds 12m. Mr Graham Wilson, chief executive, said the flotation would leave the group virtually ungeared at its financial year end in November. It would then be able to expand, partly through buying two or three new parks a year. He said the average cost of a park was between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m and Parkdean would also spend on new facilities such as indoor swimming pools. Gearing could rise to about 35 per cent by the end of the 1994 financial year. Mr Wilson said the group might return to shareholders for more equity when the success of the acquisition programme had been demonstrated. Past acquisitions had shown Parkdean could raise profits substantially through adding to facilities, improving marketing and applying economies of scale, he said. The group, which currently owns seven parks, forecast operating profits for the year to end-November of not less than Pounds 1.4m, up from Pounds 1.3m in 1992. On a pro-forma basis, as if the flotation proceeds had been available throughout the year, earnings per share would be 8.7p, giving a p/e of 13.8 at the placing price. Parkdean said if it had been quoted for the whole year it would have paid a total dividend of 4.35p, covered twice by earnings. That gives a notional yield on the placing price of 4.53 per cent. It said it planned to pay a final dividend of 1.3p next April. The company is issuing 6.85m new shares and some shareholders, including certain directors, are also selling a total of 645,833 shares. There will be a total of 9.99m shares in issue after completion. After the issue, Mr Wilson, who led the management buy-out of the company in 1989, will hold 3.85 per cent of the equity, with directors and management holding a total of 8 per cent. The venture capital groups which backed the MBO and put up further equity finance in 1991, are selling some shares but retaining stakes in the group. About 30 institutions agreed to buy shares in the placing. Proceeds will be used to repay Pounds 2.33m of preference shares, which Mr Wilson said were costing the group 16 per cent gross in dividends, with the other Pounds 5.3m repaying debt. At the end of 1992 the group had debt of Pounds 6m and finance leases and deferred consideration of Pounds 828,000. The placing was arranged by Charterhouse Tilney. Dealings in the shares begin on October 14.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Gummer backs shops complex A proposed Pounds 200m property development next to the Manchester Ship Canal yesterday won the backing of Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, in an important test of government policy on out-of-town shopping centres. Mr Gummer said that he would ask the House of Lords to overturn a Court of Appeal judgment in July which threatened to block the 1m sq ft Trafford Centre scheme. The Appeal Court quashed outline planning approval granted in March 1993 by Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, following opposition by local authorities. The authorities, led by Manchester City Council, said that the development would increase traffic pollution and harm town-centre stores. The outcome should clarify the government's attitude to large out-of-town shopping developments. Recent planning guidance issued to local authorities by Mr Gummer suggested that the government had changed its attitude to the desirability of such centres since the Trafford scheme was given the green light. The environment department has discouraged schemes which require people to travel. Mr Gummer said yesterday that the original decision was lawful and reasonable in the light of circumstances at the time. He said the Appeal Court ruling could have implications for the administration of the planning system and should be clarified in the Lords. The ruling is already being challenged in the Lords by Manchester Ship Canal Company, owner of the 300-acre site.</p>

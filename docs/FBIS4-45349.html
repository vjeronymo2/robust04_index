Salinas de Gortari and Ruffo Appel, with the mayor of  Tijuana, Hector Osuna Jaime, agreed in citing the undeferrable  need to pool efforts throughout the republic. They made a series  of commitments aimed at coordinating efforts to deal with the  common enemy of Mexico and Baja California: the drug traffic.    The Baja California governor, who recently expressed his  disapproval of the manner in which that state's deputy attorney  general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, was arrested by Federal Judicial  Police personnel, arrived at Los Pinos shortly after noon.  [passage omitted]    The heads of the three government echelons--federal, state,  and municipal--agreed, with respect to public security, on the  creation of interdisciplinary police units, with federal, state,  and municipal forces. Their main objective will be to combat  activities and crimes associated with drug trafficking.    It was explained that these units will engage in preventive  and surveillance activity, through close cooperation in their  operations. These police units will have agents from the Federal  and State Public Prosecutors' Offices present to assist them.  The latter will submit joint reports to the authorities on the  three government levels, under the political responsibility of  the federal chief executive, the state governor, and the mayor  of Tijuana, in their respective jurisdictions.

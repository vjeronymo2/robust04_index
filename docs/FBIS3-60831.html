We have also avoided  issuing any clarification or denial of any report or  "information." If we get "involved" in denying everything that  is published in this respect, we will then find ourselves  compelled to issue countless "denials." And if we forget to deny  any report or "information," the people will think that what has  not been denied must be true. Hence our party's cadres have  become used to these types of "reports" and "information,"  particularly because these cadres know that all these reports  have shaky foundations. Sometimes they are so unjust that they  are useful to us because they enhance our credibility when they  are proved wrong. They only increase the people's confidence in  us and their sympathy for us.    As for the existence of multiple trends inside the party, we  stress that there are never identical views or opinions between  one person and another, even if they are in the same  organization or party. Differences in views are possible and  are usually necessary. They are even a duty. Those who claim  that there are "differences" or "divisions" inside the party  must provide proof or evidence. We are not required to prove  the falsity of these allegations, first, because the constant  task of denial is a waste of time and a diversion from the task,  and, second, because we are confident that these allegations  will be automatically proved to be false with the passage of  time. Our bases have sufficient immunity on this issue.    The party has recently undergone important experiences,  especially the events that followed the signing of the  "Gaza-Jericho" option. Can any one of those who claim that  there are such trends inside the party provide a single piece of  evidence that there is a real division over any stand taken by  the party during these important, and even grave, developments!    Regarding the campaign launched by a man of religion  affiliated with Iran against the Hizballah secretary general,  Nasrallah said: We are dealing with this phenomenon with the  same spirit and method. We are not annoyed by this. We believe  that it only strengthens the confidence in the leadership and  also boosts popular sympathy for the party. The people are  saying: Israel is seeking the physical liquidation of the  party's leaders, in addition to trying to mar the party's  reputation as a whole. Israel is the one that assassinated  'Abbas al-Musawi, former secretary general and prince of the  martyrs, and is targeting the new secretary general and, of  course, all the other leaders. Whoever is waging such a  campaign is only collaborating with the enemy, either  intentionally or unintentionally. This "popular" view of the  issue strengthens our self-confidence and stands. He added:  This unjust "campaign" has exploited, for example, the party's  decision to participate in the elections to attack us with the  aim of "weakening" our stand by making these allegations before  the leadership of the Islamic revolution in Iran. It was  revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i who blessed our decision  to enter the elections battle. Therefore, the opposition to the  party's participation in the election became an opposition to  the Islamic revolution's leader. Any attack on us over this  issue is an attack on the revolution leader himself.    There was one beneficial outcome of this "campaign" against  us, namely some people's accusations that we were working to  establish an Islamic rule or an Islamic state. This helped us  because it absolved us of something that others regarded as an  "accusation" and made our activities acceptable to circles that  accused us of working to impose the establishment of an Islamic  state in Lebanon. We do not hide our belief in the rule of  Islam, but we do not want to impose our views by force. We call  for following God through wisdom, example, and conviction.    Regarding the allegations made in the campaign against the  Hizballah secretary general that there is a trend that is  following the al-Da'wah Party inside Hizballah, the secretary  general stressed that those who have joined Hizballah from the  al-Da'wah Party have left their former affiliation behind and  have become part of the Hizballah trend, like the Amal Movement  members who joined Hizballah. Even many members who were in the  al-Da'wah Party might criticize the ideas and methods they  adopted during their former party affiliation, as former Amal  members did. Martyr 'Abbas himself was originally a member of  the al-Da'wah Party, yet he was a splendid embodiment of the  Hizballah trend.    We told the Hizballah secretary general: We heard from you  more than seven years ago that those who joined Hizballah from  other organizations brought the methods and traditions of their  previous organizations to Hizballah and tried to practice them  within the party. Nasrallah stressed that this was at the  beginning. Over time, everyone has blended into the same  melting pot. One example of this is the al-Da'wah Party.  Underground activity was one of its doctrines. Some of its  former members who joined Hizballah carried with them the spirit  of underground activity, even when there was no need for  secrecy. But such habits have changed with time, as I mentioned  earlier.    When we told him that the presence of the al-Da'wah Party in  many countries and places could, due to human nature, affect the  former members who joined Hizballah, the secretary general said:  Those former al-Da'wah Party members who are members of  Hizballah have absolutely no relationship with those who were in  the al-Da'wah Party in any other place. Those who joined  Hizballah from the al-Da'wah Party are very critical of the  mistakes the al-Da'wah Party made, just as any other party could  make mistakes.    With regard to some published reports about the fact that  Hasan Nasrallah brought misfortune to the party, he said: I did  not read what was written about this issue carefully. But such  statements are contradictory, if not ignorant. Those who wrote  such things also said that Hizballah has become stronger, has  established its private economic institutions, increased the  number of its members, and spread like wildfire in the south or  other areas of the country recently. How could that have  happened, particularly during the last two years--according to  what they say--when these two years are the ones when I assumed  the position of secretary general of the party, and I, according  to their claims, succeeded in managing the party with skill and  professionalism? And at the same time, they claim that I  brought misfortune to the party.    On the subject of relations with 'Allamah Fadlallah, the  Hizballah secretary general affirmed that he has a distinguished  relationship with 'Allamah Fadlallah and that he always meets  with him, listens to his advice, and discusses important and  sensitive matters with him. He has never had a real difference  of opinion with him. Yes, the organizational state of the party  is very different from the important religious personality,  which is respected and held in high esteem by all. Due to his  nonorganizational position in the party, 'Allamah Fadlallah  could, for example, receive people we are not compelled to  receive. He could establish relations with people whom we see  no need to establish relations with. In addition, certain  topics could be discussed, and we could have our own opinion on  them. This is something that does not bother the 'allamah. But  there was never an argument in the sense some media have been  reporting.    Regarding the silence on the results of the investigation  into the airport bridge incident [in which the Army shot at  Hizballah demonstrators], he said: We were not silent and will  not remain silent. This incident has infiltrated our conscience  and even the psychological makeup of our party. It will never  be allowed to fade away. We are waiting for the issue to be  raised on a broader and more significant dimension in the  Chamber of Deputies. It is true that some sides want us to  temporarily quiet what they call the exaggerated attack on the  state regarding this matter, but this will not change anything  for us.    I was the one who, from the podium and from above the heads  of the martyrs, made direct speeches about the president of the  Republic and the prime minister. I held them responsible for  the incident and demanded that they resign and leave if justice  is not meted out in this matter. Some sides described our  restrained stand after the massacre as being of the highest  level of heroism. Our enemies described our stand as cowardly  and hesitant. However, let it be made clear to all: We are the  ones who maintain public security and general law and order. We  have no time to waste on bitter condemnations of anyone. We  have a project that is grander than all the narrow-minded  political projects and gimmicks: confronting the dangers that  are looming over our country and nation. Our fight against the  Zionist enemy is a more noble goal than the fight against the  insignificant sides. This does not mean, however, that the  blood of our brothers and people can be shed by a murderous  group. So far, they have not determined whose responsibility it  was. Was it the responsibility of the president, the defense  minister, the prime minister, the interior minister, or the  security bodies? They have not told us anything clear about  this matter. They think that the issue will die over time. We  will address them in the same way that the poet Muhammad Mahdi  al-Jawahiri addressed the ruler of Iraq when the latter killed  his brother Ja'far in the Battle of the Bridge in Baghdad:    Whether you know it or not,    Victims' wounds are a mouth,    Unlike that of one giving testimony    Or another begging for mercy.</p>

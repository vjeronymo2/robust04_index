			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Protest at Pakistan bank curbs Three directors of Pakistan's central bank have submitted their resignations over new legislation which partly reduces the bank's recently-established independence from the government. Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former caretaker prime minister who made the bank independent last year, said last night that the latest move could create difficulties for Pakistan in its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 'I am concerned over their loss of credibility if they take away such an important step,' Mr Qureshi, a former World Bank official, told the Financial Times from Washington. Pakistan is negotiating with the IMF and World Bank for up to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in assistance over the next three years. A new presidential decree seeks to curtail the powers of the central bank governor in setting monetary policy. The governor is also required to consult the federal government and the four provincial governments on the limit of credit extended to them, while the earlier law introduced by Mr Qureshi allowed him independently to establish the limits. The governor's term of office has been reduced to three years from five. A provision allowing the government to appoint a new governor within 180 days from commencement of the new law has generated speculation that Mr Mohammad Yaqub, the present governor, who is known as a strict financial disciplinarian, may be replaced. One of the seven members of the bank's central board has resigned in protest at the presidential decree and two more have submitted resignations which have not yet been formally accepted, senior officials said. Mr Qureshi's steps to make the central bank autonomous had been praised by western economists. He said yesterday: 'In my view, the ordinance I had issued was one of the cornerstones (of policy) to ensure financial discipline.' He said: 'It is extremely important to give the central bank the feeling that if they take a stand on principles, the governor will not be fired.' The government defended the move as a step requiring the bank to set policy in consultation with the government, rather than interference in his functions. Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister, pledged to continue economic reform when she was sworn in in October, without committing herself to the changes introduced by Mr Qureshi. After her election victory Mr Farooq Leghari, a trusted aide, was elected president.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: FR 6% ahead to Pounds 11m despite difficult market FR GROUP, the aviation products company, yesterday reported a 6 per cent rise in profits in spite of difficult conditions for the aerospace and defence industries in the US and Europe. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June rose from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 11m on sales up 10 per cent at Pounds 85.4m. Earnings per share increased from 9.7p to 10.2p and the group is to increase its interim dividend by 5 per cent to 2.46p. 'We have selected the markets we are in very carefully but we are not immune from what is going on elsewhere in the world,' said Mr Gordon Page, chief executive. 'But generally speaking we are going for a reasonable year.' Flight refueling, a growing part of the business, received a boost through contracts with the Ministry of Defence to convert five more VC-10 aircraft to a tanker role. In August FR completed conversion of the first of these aeroplanes; a total of 13 aircraft are now to be converted. FR has also just completed the first of four kits for conversion of the US air force's KC10 to pod refueling capabilities. A decision on conversion of the remaining 54 aeroplanes of this class is unlikely before next spring. The group's cash fell from Pounds 7m at the year-end to Pounds 3m after a planned expenditure programme on the company's fleet of Falcons but also because of slow and late payment on contracts. Mr Page said he was unhappy with the cash position but that it would not deteriorate further during the second half. FR Aviation has also won a five year contract with the French Navy for electronic warfare and target towing services. COMMENT Already out of favour, defence contractors must be feeling even more put upon as they contemplate a Clinton victory in the US election. Add impending spending cuts in the UK and their gloom is complete. FR Group could, however, benefit. A lot depends on the MOD contracting out more services like electronic warfare and target towing which FR already supplies the UK and French navies. Add the potential of a bigger conversion programme for the US KC10 and C130 and FR could be one of the survivors of the MOD/DOD shake-out. Such is the nervousness about defence spending, however, that not much of this is in FR's price. Brokers' forecasts of Pounds 23m for full-year pre-tax profits give earnings of 21.3p. This puts FR on an average market yield but a prospective earnings multiple of about 8.4 - more than a 40 per cent discount to the market.</p>

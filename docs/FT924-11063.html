			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Observer: Sam's missile Sam Nunn had always seemed to be one of the more down-to-earth members of the US Senate but now the truth can be revealed. Forced to respond to reports in the Weekly World News, an always reliable supermarket tabloid, the Georgia Democrat admitted this week that he is, in fact, a space alien. 'I confess. It's amazing that I've been able to keep it a secret for 54 years,' he said. Perhaps Nunn's origins account for the staunch support he has always given, as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to the 'Star Wars' anti-missile defence projects of the Reagan and Bush administrations.</p>

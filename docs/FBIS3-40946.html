			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olena Lisnycha: "What Will Ukraine Get From the </F> Nuclear Deal?"]    [Text] At first, it should be emphasized that terms and  figures included in the agreement by the three presidents and in  an appendix to it are suspended in a volatile imbalance, because  that document does not have the force of a concrete  international legal document, reflecting simply formal political  obligations assumed by all sides. If that document had the form  of an agreement or treaty, it would certainly affect our  internal law, which would enable the parliament to resort to its  favorite weapon, impeachment.    "I have no doubts whatsoever about the legitimacy of what  was  done by the executive branch. However, it is up to the Supreme  Council to examine how this was done," said Mr. Chalyy, chief of  the legal department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Thus,  the Ukrainian parliament will have to ratify START I with no  reservations and join the nonproliferation treaty to implement  the agreement. Ideally, the legislature should endorse START 2,  that is, to give the go-ahead regarding the destruction of  nuclear arsenals so that the Moscow agreement is legally  binding. Silenced by top officials of our state, this question  somehow remains nothing more than rhetoric.    It is strange that the agreement's appendix provides for the  decommissioning of most of the modern SS-24 missiles within 10  months and not the SS-19's whose short expiration terms cause  much concern.    The agreement signed in Moscow will surely be extended by a  long chain of negotiations, and its contours -- now pretty vague  -- will have to become more specific.  <H5>  Nuclear Fuel </H5>   "Enriched uranium contained in nuclear arms is a matter of a  purely commercial nature," said Bill Clinton at a press  conference at the Boryspil Airport. It was agreed that within  seven years, Russia would process -- at our expense -- highly  enriched uranium into fuel for atomic power stations, one  portion of which will be immediately shipped to Ukraine (100  tonnes of low-activated uranium in the first 10 months), while  another part will be sold to the United States for $1 billion.  Ideally, Washington should send this billion to Kiev. However,  Russia also claims its portion of the nuclear pie as a country  tasked with processing the uranium. So far, details regarding  the division of this billion-dollar tidbit are inaccessible.  <H5>  Debts for Energy Sources </H5>   The information that came in last Friday [14 January] about  Moscow's pledges of fair play in negotiating the $2-billion  indebtness with Kiev have not borne out entirely. Looming ahead  is the perspective of endless blanket-pulling and difficult  inter-governmental talks. According to a dark vision by  government officials, instead of the entire debt, Russia will  agree to forgive only its small portion. The point is that  structures with looser dependence from the state, such as the  "Gazprom," were also engaged in energy supplies. This kind of  "debt canceling" is more profitable for them.  <H5>  Support of International Financial Organizations </H5>   This support is possible only when Ukraine devises clear-cut  plans for getting out of an economic crisis. In other words,  only staunch optimists can count on it at the present time. For  example, propped up by the United States, Russia is expecting  $1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $500  billion from the World Bank. This is a modest sum considering  the size of Russia, and would remain so if allocated to Ukraine.  Hypothetically, even with credits on hand, Ukraine should be  prepared for high interest rates.  <H5>  Tactical Weapons </H5>   This appears to be the biggest "white spot" in all this  nuclear business. The agreement does not offer a clear  statement on compensation for tactical weapons removed from the  three ex-Soviet republics to Russia. Officials warily say that  "experts are now working on this issue."  <H5>  Support for Weapons Destruction Process </H5>   This support was offered by the Nunn-Lugar plan initiated in  December 1991 and will be financed by U.S. Defense Department  resources. The plan's basic provisions envisioned for 1993  fiscal year spendings for dismantling and destruction of nuclear  weapons, establishing aid funds for disarming CIS countries, and  humanitarian aid, which is $800 million, $100 million, and $410  million, respectively, for all nuclear successors of the Soviet  Union. Of this amount, $175 million for technical assistance in  weapons destruction was promised to Leonid Kravchuk by  then-President Bush in December 1992. This promise was also  confirmed by Bill Clinton at the meeting with the Ukrainian  president in Kiev. The American side is relying on its  experience of scraping similar 300-missile complexes in 1992  that needed $300 billion for destruction. Foreign Ministry  officials claim that if the process "gets rolling," Americans  are ready to provide additional funds to Ukraine. On the other  hand, the Nunn-Lugar program contains quite a few discriminative  limitations. One of them, for instance, says that the CIS  country receiving this aid should also put in its own money to  finance the destruction of nuclear weapons. So disarmament will  definitely put a squeeze on the more than meager Ukrainian  budget. In addition, Ukraine will be able to use the $175  billion only for U.S. and Ukrainian (practically nonexistent)  technologies and experts.    The United States will definitely reap most of the profits  coming from the nuclear deal. Bill Clinton returned to the  White House with another victory. The United States will cash  in on buying cheap fuel for atomic power stations practically  without spending their budget dollars for the important cause of  "peace in all the world." Ex-Soviet republics safeguard the  quiet sleep of Americans because the spread of nuclear  technologies and weapons to unreliable Asian regimes -- so much  feared by America shortly before the collapse of the Soviet  Union -- appears to be unrealistic now. Russia, America's  strategic partner, achieved its goals by bashing Ukraine on the  nuclear issue. The issue of energy debts -- one of the  leverages over Ukraine -- remains unsolved; now even fuel  supplies to Ukrainian atomic power plants depend on Russia.    So what has Ukraine gotten from the deal except for  international acknowledgment? For now, we can definitely point  to a great relief for our state budget from a huge burden  imposed by servicing nuclear complexes. In addition,  preliminary estimates show that the 100 tonnes of fuel for  atomic stations, due within 10 months, will keep our plants  going for two years.</p>

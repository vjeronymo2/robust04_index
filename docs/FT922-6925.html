			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont's gesture fails to convince gold market - Why the producer's symbolic purchase has so far not succeeded in lifting prices IT WAS meant to be a big, symbolic gesture by Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer. Newmont wanted to send, with a flourish and fanfare, a clear message to the market and other producers that it was sure the gold price was at or very near its lowest point. Newmont bought 375,000 troy ounces (or 11.7 tonnes) of gold at a cost of nearly Dollars 126m on April 29 - the day the gold price was fixed in London at its lowest point for six years. But the impact of the news was dampened because it became fouled up by US stock market disclosure regulations. These forced the group to include details of the gold deal in its report on financial results for the first quarter. The gold deal was completed on the day those results were due to be revealed and Newmont was obliged to tell its shareholders immediately. After all, it was locking in a net profit of more than Dollars 40m. However, even allowing for the lack of razzmatazz accompanying Newmont's announcement, some gold bulls have been disappointed by the market's reaction. Newmont bought its gold at Dollars 335.95 a troy ounce, and two weeks later the gold price still languishes at Dollars 337.30, near its lowest for 16 years in real terms, when inflation is taken into account. Some bullion dealers were also perturbed by the comparative lack of impact Newmont's buying spree had on the market at the time. Sellers, particularly from Europe, swamped Newmont's attempt to give the gold price a push in an upward direction. However, as the price had drifted to a low of Dollars 333 an ounce on April 29, Newmont managed to lift it by a dollar or two. Some observers contrast this with the market's reaction in February 1988 when Newmont announced it had completed the biggest gold loan ever  - of 1m ounces or 31 tonnes. Perhaps unfairly, this move was blamed for starting the steady fall in the gold price which continued through the following four years. In a gold loan operation a mining company borrows metal from a commercial bank or syndicate which has, in turn, borrowed some from a central bank. The mining company then effectively sells the gold in the market for cash which is then used for a designated purpose. In the opinion of some analysts, Newmont signalled in the most dramatic way in 1988 that the gold price had reached its peak and, once the news was out, the price took a tumble. Mining companies pay back gold loans, both principal and interest, usually in gold but occasionally in cash. Gold loans are mainly used to finance new gold mining projects, but Newmont's was arranged to take advantage of the low interest rates offered, roughly 3 per cent at that time, compared with the money markets. The group was under tremendous pressure to reduce the burden of its Dollars 1.6bn debt, most of it taken on to ward off the unwelcome overtures of marauders led by Mr T. Boone Pickens, the well-known corporate raider. Newmont bought gold at Dollars 449 an ounce for its five-year loan and was repaying at the rate of 62,500 ounces a quarter. By the end of last year about half the loan had been repaid. Mr Jim Hill, Newmont's vice president, corporate relations, says the company 'is neither disappointed nor surprised' by the reaction so far to its announcement about the early repayment of the rest of its gold loan. 'Gold analysts reacted very positively,' he says. 'We felt that, whereas the gold price might go down a few more dollars, the trend from now on would be up. So we decided to pay off our gold loan and lock in a net profit of about Dollars 100 an ounce.' Newmont is not the only producer to repay a gold loan before the due date. And an analysis by Ms Jessica Jacks, analyst with the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, shows that at the end of 1991 total gold loans outstanding involved 330 tonnes compared with 391 tonnes in December the previous year. Therefore a net 60 tonnes of gold (1.9m ounces) was repaid last year. Yet a large number of professionals operating in the gold market seem to believe that the price has not yet touched bottom. Most of the commodity funds, for example, are selling the metal short - they have contracted to sell gold they do not yet own in the expectation that they will be able to buy it at a lower price when they need it. Sceptics also point out Newmont's move seems to bear the mark of Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, who is one of the greatest bulls of gold. Much of his fortune is wrapped up in Newmont. His General Oriental Investments, where he has a two-thirds stake, owns 42 per cent of Newmont. Sir James is also chairman of the group's new strategy committee. Yet it is clear Newmont did not just play a hunch. Mr Paul Maroni, Newmont's chief financial officer, lists some of the factors pointing to a gold price rise soon: production is tailing off; new gold is expensive to find and to produce; demand from the jewellery industry (which has been buying more gold than is newly-mined each year) remains buoyant. Mr Maroni suggests those producers who continue to sell when the price rises  -and effectively 'cap' any substantial increase - are mainly high-cost producers who could not survive without this form of insurance. The time will come when their ability to survive will be called into question, he suggests. Also, the extraordinarily high level of gold sales from the former Soviet Union which helped to drive down the price in the past two years cannot continue because its stocks have almost run out and production is now relatively modest. Mr Maroni says there is also a potential 'wild card' which might benefit gold - a 'meltdown' of the world's financial system. Sir James has recently forecast such an event, which he suggests will see investors returning to the security offered by gold. Mr Maroni echoes this view: 'We don't think the world financial system is in very good shape.' Leaving that 'wild card' aside, many analysts agree with Mr Maroni's analysis. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert group, says: 'We agree with the view that this is the bottom of the gold market.' But she warns: 'Recovery will be a slow and painful process.' Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, also says the gold price is likely to be higher at the end of the year than it is today - perhaps by Dollars 30 or Dollars 40 an ounce. 'But it won't move for a month or so and it might not stay there when it gets there.'</p>

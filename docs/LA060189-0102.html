			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TROOP CUT WOULD SAVE RELATIVELY LITTLE, EXPERTS SAY  </P> <P> President Bush's surprise offer to cut 30,000 U.S. troops and associated  weapons in Europe would produce relatively small budget savings, U.S. lawmakers  and arms control experts said Wednesday, even though the defense of Europe has  absorbed more than half of the U.S. defense budget for decades.  </P> <P> Bush's proposal could save more than $1 billion per year, mostly in troop pay,  experts said. To a deficit-weary Congress eager to find budget savings at the  Pentagon, that would provide a welcome benefit, even in a Pentagon budget that  is about $300 billion a year.  </P> <P> And if subsequent negotiations with the Soviet Union result in the wholesale  removal of U.S. military units and weaponry from Europe, experts said savings  could be reaped not only from the personnel cuts but also from the closure of  military headquarters and some U.S. bases in Europe.  </P> <P> Administration officials, however, have cautioned that reductions more likely  would leave America's 4 2/3 divisions in Europe intact but less fully manned.  </P> <P> In the short term, Bush's proposal would entail costs as well as savings.  Congressional budget analysts estimated that it might cost the United States as  much as $250 million to withdraw the 30,000 U.S. troops at one time.  </P> <P> Also, the new willingness to negotiate limits on aircraft and short-range  nuclear systems could be costly if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  introduced more modern weapons to compensate for the reduced numbers.  </P> <P> A treaty with the Soviet Union limiting particular kinds of weapons also could  require costly procedures to destroy existing weapons and to monitor each  side's compliance with the accords.  </P> <P> Despite the potential for only limited budgetary savings, Democrats in Congress  praised Bush's initiative as a first step.  </P> <P> "The President hit all the right chords with his proposals on conventional arms  reductions in Europe," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin  (D-Wis.), who has urged Bush to respond aggressively to Soviet arms-control  initiatives.  </P> <P> "We'll have to look at the fine print to see how much money this might save the  American taxpayer," Aspin added. "If all the U.S. troops removed from Europe  under his proposal are demobilized as the President has said, the savings will  be substantial."  </P> <P> Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) hailed Bush's proposal as the first step in a  process promising bigger savings in the future.  </P> <P> "This is not the summit, this is Base Camp One," Schroeder said. "If this is  seen as the end of the process and not the beginning, then everybody's going to  revolt."  </P> <P> Defense Department officials cautioned that political and military motives  drove Bush's initiative.  </P> <P> "The proposal . . . was not offered for budgetary reasons," Pentagon spokesman  Pete Williams said. "It was proposed as an incentive to encourage agreement on  conventional forces reductions in Europe."  </P> <P> Joshua M. Epstein, a Brookings Institution arms control expert, pointed out  that the Soviet Union has proposed reducing NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in  Europe by about 25% below the levels envisioned by Bush. The President's plan  would leave NATO force levels about 10% lower than at present, although it  would require much deeper cuts by the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> "In the long term, really significant savings would require the kinds of  further reductions and restructuring that the Soviets have proposed," said  Epstein.  </P> <P> Schroeder, who has sponsored legislation calling for the unilateral removal of  thousands of troops from Europe, said that future talks should try to reduce  U.S. forces in Europe to a training command and a headquarters unit that could  coordinate the rapid return of American troops in a crisis.  </P> <P> If such efforts succeed, independent analysts and Pentagon officials say, much  larger budget savings loom on the horizon.  </P> <P> "The whole idea that you're going to save huge bucks by taking out a division  is just nonsense," said one military officer familiar with the Bush proposal.  "But if this succeeds, you're going to save money in a much more general sense,  as future defense budgets begin to respond to a smaller Soviet threat."  </P> <P> At that point, the officer said, Congress and the Pentagon may safely scale  back defense research and development, reduce equipment modernization and  accept still smaller armies.  </P> <P> "These kinds of savings dwarf the idea of just taking out a few troop  carriers," the official said.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd rules out open commitment - Kurdish Refugees MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to allay fears that British, US and French troops protecting the Kurdish refugees moved to the safe havens to be established for them in northern Iraq might be involved in an open-ended commitment. He told the House of Commons that while no time limit could be set, every effort would be made to bring the task to an end 'in safety' by handing it over to the United Nations. Dealing with the likely size of the British force assigned to the operation, Mr Hurd said it would be 'as heavy as required, but as light as possible'. He envisaged about 2,000 troops - somewhat less than a brigade - being involved. A statement is to be made by Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, outlining the rules of engagement to be observed by British troops in the event of any interfence by Iraqi forces with setting up camps for the Kurdish refugees. Mr Hurd led Conservative MPs in praising the persistence of Mr John Major, the prime minister, in overcoming initial US objections to the establishment of safe havens. He also underlined Mr Major's earlier insistence that there could be no question of allowing them to be used by the Kurds to mount guerrilla attacks on Iraqi forces controlled by President Saddam Hussein. A restrained welcome by Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, for the fresh impetus given to the British initiative - in which he emphasised that it was backed by the authority of the UN - contrasted sharply with the comments of many Labour backbenchers who argued that more should have been done earlier. Mr Kaufman said if Iraqi forces were to interfere with the establishment of the camps for the Kurdish refugees they would be 'in breach' of resolutions approved by the UN. He urged the government to press Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, to send a mission to Iraq to investigate charges of genocide by Saddam Hussein 'against the Kurds and others'. While acknowledging the role which the UN could play in bringing Saddam Hussein to account, Mr Hurd refused to accept that it was a matter on which the government was open to criticism. He said the practical position was that 'Saddam Hussein is not within our power'. Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the establishment of the safe havens amounted to the 'de facto partition' of Iraq, with an implicit risk of further developments paralleling Britain's experience in Northern Ireland. He said five or six camps would be provided for the Kurds and, discounting fears of a duplication of the Palestinian refugee issue, stressed that they would not form a single area comparable to the Gaza strip or the west bank. The foreign secretary did not envisage a role for representatives of the Kurdish refugees in a 'huge' conference dealing with every Middle East issue. Once the camps had been established, he said, they would become the responsibility of the UN. 'We do not want to establish camps which start as temporary and end up as permanent'.</p>

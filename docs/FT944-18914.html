			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Indian food exports hit by plague panic India's businessmen were yesterday counting the growing economic cost of the plague, with tourism and food exports the two sectors hardest hit. The disease, which has killed about 50 people and left 2,000 others sick, has disrupted the travel trade and exports. Hotels and tour operators, gearing up for the start of the tourist season, have reported cancellations by groups from Europe, the Far East and North America. Some business visitors have cancelled trips. At least three trade fairs have been postponed. Trade with the Gulf states, worth Dollars 3bn a year, has been badly hit by the decision by Gulf governments to close air and sea links with India. The biggest impact is on exporters of fresh food, who rely on the Gulf for 70 per cent of their overseas sales. Food exporters are having to cancel purchases, put produce in store or try to sell domestically. 'After three years of effort in promoting exports we are back at square one,' said Mr Gian Nega, assistant director of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. Fresh food exports to the Gulf last year totalled Dollars 177m. Health officials, including Dr N K Shah, the resident representative of the World Health Organisation, accused the Gulf countries and other states which have cut trade links of over-reacting. The Indian government launched a publicity campaign aimed at calming the fears of tourists, business travellers and importers of Indian goods. Mr T Khanna, the commerce secretary, expressed concern at the potential damage to Indian trade. 'There's been a panic reaction from some of our trading partners. But I believe it will soon blow over.' Speaking in London, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the countries which had imposed restrictions on travel and imports risked hampering efforts to deal with the problem. 'We are trying to create an atmosphere where people have confidence that plague is no longer an incurable disease,' he said. 'Creating an atmosphere of panic which drives the whole thing underground would do a great disservice to both India and the outside world,' he said. An official of KLM, the Dutch airline, in Delhi said much harm had already been done. 'The whole image of India has already been affected.' He estimated 25-30 per cent of tourists who had planned to travel to India by KLM this week and next had called off their trips. Other European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and Swissair, also reported cancellations by tourist groups. Yesterday's most serious development in the spread of the plague were the deaths of an 18-year-old man and a five-year-old boy in Delhi. They were the first deaths outside the western city of Surat and its neighbourhood, where pneumonic plague erupted last week. The tally of suspected cases rose by about 700 yesterday to 2,500, mainly in Surat and in remote eastern Maharashtra, where bubonic plague broke out a month ago. India's exports in August were Dollars 2.11bn, some 24.6 per cent higher than the same month last year. This followed four months of sluggish performance which gave rise to concern about future prospects. Figures published yesterday by the commerce ministry showed exports in the five months to August were 10.6 per cent up, compared with 8.3 per cent for the four months to July. But the growth rate is still below the annual target of 15 per cent or more.</p>

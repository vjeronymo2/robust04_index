			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We present yet another edict by the Georgian head of  state.    Taking into consideration the fact that due to the current  situation in the country it has become necessary to take urgent  measures to speed up the process of forming a national army,  increasing its fighting efficiency and creating a military  doctrine. I have decided to agree to a request made by the  collegium of the Georgian Defense Ministry, and as a commander  in chief of the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia I will  temporarily carry out the duties of Georgian defense minister.    All armed formations of the state will be subordinate  directly to the commander in chief of the armed forces.    [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze</p>

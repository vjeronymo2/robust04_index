			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Greek private bank to set up unit in Romania CREDIT Bank, Greece's largest private bank, is setting up a bank in Romania in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will take an equity stake. The new bank, to be called Bank of Bucharest, will have start-up capital of Dollars 10m. It will be the first foreign-owned bank to open in the country since the overthrow of the Communist government in 1989. The EBRD is to contribute Dollars 2.5m in equity, with the remainder being covered by a holding company controlled by Credit Bank, in which several Greek businessmen will have minority holdings. The new bank will be managed by Alpha Finance, the merchant banking arm of Credit Bank. It is expected to start operating by the end of 1993. Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha Finance, said the bank would look for opportunities offered by Romania's privatisation programme as well as financing trade carried out by a growing number of Greek-Romanian joint ventures.</p>

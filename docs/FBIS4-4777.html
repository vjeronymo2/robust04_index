			<p>BFN     [Text] Amidst some doubts abroad about the transfer of  power, North Korean leader Kim Il-song has been praising up his  eldest son and heir-apparent, Chong-il, for his "simplicity and  frugality."    In the latest issue of NODONG SINMUN, the Workers'  (Communist) Party organ, the senior Kim was quoted as saying  that he felt a lump in his throat whenever he saw the junior Kim  wearing a plain jacket and that people should lead a plain  lifestyle like him.    Kim also said that Comrade Kim Chong-il does not care much  to  appear in the limelight, as he thinks all he has to do is to  give devoted servitude to the people and the nation.    Earlier, the senior Kim also told the party rank and file  that Kim Chong-il was "the people's leader" fit to succeed him.    In a letter to a national conference of "party cell  secretaries" which opened in Pyongyang March 31, the North  Korean top leader said that the cause of the party was  "honorably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim  Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as  the people's leader," according to the Korean Central  Broadcasting Station.</p>

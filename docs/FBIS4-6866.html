			<p>BFN     [Text] Kanju Sato, chairman of the National Public Safety  Commission [NPSC] (and concurrently minister of home affairs),  was present at a news conference held after the 22 April cabinet  meeting. Touching on measures to be taken if the UN Security  Council imposes sanctions on the DPRK (North Korea) in  connection with its suspected nuclear weapons development  program, Chairman Sato stated, "In my position as NPSC chairman,  I have requested various agencies with the National Police  Agency [NPA] playing the leading role to compile a manual, as  well as to come up with carefully planned measures to prepare  for unforeseen contingencies." In this way, he disclosed that  measures for ensuring public safety are under study now.  Maintaining that "(details of the measures) should not be  disclosed in concrete terms," Chairman Sato avoided mentioning  concrete details. However, he stressed that "these measures  will be taken within the framework of existing laws." He then  added, "Maximum diplomatic efforts should be made to avoid  sanctions."    In connection with this issue, the NPSC Information Office  issued the following comments on the morning of the same day:  "This means that the NPA is currently reviewing and studying  points at issue in connection with various situations, but it  does not mean that a practical manual is being prepared now."</p>

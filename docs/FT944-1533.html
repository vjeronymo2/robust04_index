			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Defence of steel industry urged The government should 'review its position' on state aid for the steel industry if other European Union producers continued to receive state subsidies, the Commons trade and industry committee said yesterday. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The system of state aids to European steel producers is a shambles and it is British steel producers who are paying the price. 'If the lack of proper controls over Euro-state aid continues, in the medium term the British industry will be forced to cut . . . new investment and capacity and shed more jobs in order to prop up less efficient, subsidised steel producers in the rest of Europe. 'The government can no longer sit back and allow European producers to benefit from state subsidies to the detriment of the British steel industry.' The report calls on the government to 'continue to resist any new state aids or the weakening of existing conditions for state aids in the steel industry'. But if non-compliance continues the UK should reconsider its position. It adds: 'The ability of the UK steel industry to compete is adversely affected by excess capacity in other EU countries which is artificially preserved by state aids.' The MPs said their inquiry was prompted by 'growing concern over the ability of the European Commission to control this situation'. The report outlines the failure of an EU restructuring plan which aimed to cut European steel capacity by up to 26m tonnes. Many MPs blamed a decision a year ago to allow state aid for six struggling companies in Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal in return for a capacity reduction of 5.5m tonnes.</p>

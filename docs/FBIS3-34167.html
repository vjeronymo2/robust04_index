			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Text] The talk about possible Israeli withdrawal from the  security zone in the framework of the anticipated arrangement  with Syria has generated great anxiety among members of the SLA  [South Lebanese Army] upper echelons.    The remarks by U.S. elements in Washington to the effect  that  the arrangement with Syria will necessitate a phased Israeli  withdrawal from the security zone to be carried out over several  years have reached senior SLA officers and caused much concern.    In conversations with senior officers at the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] Northern Command, SLA Commander Antoine Lahd's  aides voiced serious anxiety over the possibility of being  deserted by Israel. An SLA officer has told IDF commanders: "We  are afraid you will leave us, and we will become a target for  the Lebanese and the Syrians."    Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, the Northern Command  commander, and brigadier General Gabi Ashkenazi, chief of the  Liaison Unit With Lebanon, apprised their interlocutors of the  remarks of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister,  who said during a tour of Qiryat Shemona three weeks ago that  Israel will not desert its allies in south Lebanon. The SLA has  been apprised of the basic conditions for any possible  arrangement in south Lebanon and of the Israeli demand to  guarantee the local residents' safety.</p>

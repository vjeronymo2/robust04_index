			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Legal threat seen over ERM stance BRITAIN may find itself taken before the European Court of Justice and threatened with fines if it ratifies the Maastricht Treaty then keeps the pound outside the European exchange rate mechanism indefinitely, a Tory barrister warned yesterday. In a paper that was strongly disputed by the Treasury last night, Mr Martin Howe, a member of the executive committee of the Society of Conservative Lawyers, said the UK would be in breach of its European treaty obligations if it pursued an independent exchange rate policy for more than a limited period after Maastricht takes effect. He said the UK would be obliged to accept the legal obligations of stages 1 and 2 of European monetary union and treat its exchange rate policy 'as a matter of common interest' with other member states if the Treaty comes into force. Although Britain can opt out of stage 3 of monetary union with its 'irrevocably fixed' parities, Mr Howe emphasised that it has not opted out of the lesser objective of exchange rate convergence. Under the Maastricht convergence criteria, Britain would be required to put sterling into the narrow band of the ERM and maintain it there without devaluation. The UK's EC partners would be 'effectively in a position to insist in the long term upon maintenance of an ERM exchange rate policy as a condition of (UK) access to the internal market,' Mr Howe said. He said that Britain, if it chose to stay outside the ERM indefinitely and Maastricht went ahead, could expect steadily mounting pressure from other member states, followed by representations from the EC Commission that the UK's stance did not live up to its Treaty obligations. The issue could then be referred to the European court if the UK were to pursue a floating exchange rate policy indefinitely. Mr Howe's views are potentially embarrassing to the government as it struggles for a majority in tonight's paving motion on the Maastricht bill. They were published by the Centre for Policy Studies, a Conservative party think tank. However, the CPS said Mr Howe's paper did not reflect the centre's corporate view. The Treasury said: 'We reject this argument absolutely. The Maastricht Treaty nowhere imposes any obligation on a member state to be in the ERM either for legal or policy reasons.'

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ROSEANNE BARRS TABLOIDS, BUT FREELY LETS LIFE IN  </P> <P> THE WEEKLY tabloids were said to be offering up phenomenal sums to cover the  Roseanne Barr-Tom Arnold wedding, which took place recently. But Roseanne aced  out the supermarket papers. She feels they've made her life at the top pretty  miserable. So the TV star gave her exclusive coverage, for free, to Life  magazine. And all the big magazine had to do was hire some extra security to  keep out the paparazzi and media gate-crashers. We'll see Roseanne as a  blushing bride in Life's March issue, on the stands Feb. 19.  </P> <P> COULD THIS be the nightclub duet of the year -- or of the decade? Sid Caesar  and Imogene Coca will team in a show, "Together Again," celebrating the 40th  anniversary of their legendary "Your Show of Shows," which made TV history  after it began telecasting on NBC back in February, 1950! (Its live comedy ran  every Saturday night till June, 1954.) Some of the writers serving under them  were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart.  </P> <P> Sid and Imogene became TV icons. So now they appear live and in person at New  York's East Side boite, Michael's Pub, on April 17. The engagement is  open-ended. Elliot Finkel is Sid and Imogene's musical director and Lee Delano  will be their stage partner.  </P> <P> Concurrent with this happy occasion, MTV will begin on April 1 to present 65  half-hours taken from "The Best of Your Show of Shows."  </P> <P> MARY MARTIN is in and out of Cedars-Sinai in L.A. for more chemotherapy, and on  top of that, she is recovering from a recent auto accident that left her with a  chest fracture and a broken ankle. But the seat belt saved her life! (The star  already survived one serious car crash that took the lives of her pals Ben  Washer and Janet Gaynor some years ago.) In spite of these setbacks, Mary says,  "I've led a charmed life!" And she is in excellent spirits.  </P> <P> WHEN AVA GARDNER died, Harper's Bazaar was already on the stands with its story  about "Ava's Men." This week, People has its heart-stopping cover photo of the  beauty taken way back when by the late Philippe Halsman.  </P> <P> Here are a few additions to last week's coverage of Ava's funeral in  Smithfield, N.C. Many visitors to the funeral home were upset that the casket  was closed at the family's insistence. One group said, "Why, we've come all the  way from Arkansas to see Ava!" The person who seemed most grieved at the  graveside was Ava's longtime housekeeper, Carmen Vargas. Many mourners went on  to visit the Ava Gardner Museum in the star's childhood home.  </P></p>

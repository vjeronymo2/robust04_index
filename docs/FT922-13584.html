			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unionists expect a significant role THE Unionist MPs in Northern Ireland looked likely last night to play a significant role in the formation of the next government - if it is the Conservative party which is looking for a partner to sustain a Commons majority. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) hold 12 safe seats between them and last night gave indications that they would be prepared to support a minority Conservative government. Mr John Taylor the sitting UUP member for Strangford, said last night: 'We are not in the game of making deals. . . but we have no intention of voting down the Queen's Speech.' He added that the Unionists would be prepared to support a new government for as long as they considered it was in their interests to do so. In practice, that could require significant changes to Conservative policy on Northern Ireland. The UUP and DUP have a formal agreement to vote as a block at Westminster. They see a hung parliament as the opportunity to press for a replacement of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and the introduction of a stronger security policy for Northern Ireland. They have also said in recent days that they would vote against proposals for devolved assemblies in Scotland and Wales, if a similar assembly was not established in Northern Ireland. Voting was brisk throughout the day across Northern Ireland, against a backdrop of a heavy police and army presence on the streets to prevent possible disturbances. Officials of the four main parties reported a high turnout. Breaking a tradition of 25 years, counts began last night in six of the 17 Ulster constituencies and the first results were expected between 3am and 4am. Two of these seats are in the marginal constituencies of West Belfast and North Down. In West Belfast Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein was defending a 2,221 majority against a challenge from Mr Joe Hendron of the SDLP. In North Down, the independent Unionist Mr Jim Kilfedder was defending his seat against a combined challenge from the DUP, the Alliance party and the Conservatives. The UUP was also hoping to win back the South Down seat which it lost to the SDLP in 1987 by a majority of 773.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL VOTING RESULTS                            1.55am  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Scotland  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Seats     Gain    Loss   Per cent of vote  +/-  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Con         -

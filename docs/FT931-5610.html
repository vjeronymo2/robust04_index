			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Foreign companies warned over higher US taxes EUROPEAN companies would be rash to think the US Congress has relented in its demands for higher taxes on international businesses, Washington tax lawyers told a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in London yesterday. The EC will need to lobby in unison if President Bill Clinton's ambitious deficit reduction package, intended to raise a net Dollars 245bn over the next five years, is not to include swingeing new transfer pricing rules, the meeting was told. Multinational companies operating in the US - the largest group of which are headquartered in Britain - breathed a deep sigh of relief two weeks ago when Mr Clinton said in his State of the Union address that new transfer pricing rules would raise just Dollars 3.8bn over five years. His campaign speeches last year had hinted that foreign concerns would have to pay an extra Dollars 40bn in taxes. However, Mr Greg Jenner, partner in the US law firm McDermott, Will &amp; Emery, warned that higher taxes could yet be levied. President Clinton might be forced to find a further Dollars 20bn in revenue to fund programmes demanded by Congress as a price for approving the administration's deficit reduction package. 'It is important to keep in mind that the president's proposals were the first shot,' he said. 'Foreign companies are perceived as easy targets in the US, and should not think they are out of the woods.' Demands that foreign companies pay more taxes are based on popular views that, in order to minimise taxes, many manipulate prices charged on components passing from parent companies to their US subsidiaries. Foreign companies complain that these charges are unfounded, and say the new rules proposed by President Clinton - which call for transfer price analyses to be carried out at the same time as tax returns are filed - will show this. In the US, economists worry that higher taxes, and the uncertainty created by the transfer pricing debate, will discourage new foreign investment. Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of the lobbying group Westminster Strategy, said Mr Clinton's populist appeal meant that lobbying by European companies 'will have to be framed in terms of the interest of the American people, and what foreign investment means in terms of US jobs'. Given the strength of domestic lobbying pressure for foreign companies to pay higher taxes, he insisted that French, German or British companies would need to make their case as European companies. 'Europeans have to be seen as saying the same thing, in the same voice, with co-ordinated action formulated in coalition.' Companies needed to target four bodies: the European Commission, EC national governments, members of the Group of Seven industrial countries, and US state governments - particularly the home bases of such key US legislators as Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House ways and means committee, and Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Senate finance committee.</p>

Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports  that the prisoners, most of whom were released from Qezi'ot  prison, are now being driven home by bus.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin decided to release the  prisoners  as a goodwill gesture prior to the resumption of the Taba talks.  The prisoners belong to organizations that support the  political process. None of them were convicted of either murder  or manslaughter.</p>

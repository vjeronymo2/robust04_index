			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Bosnia heads for another winter of civil war: Moslem conditions mean virtual rejection of Geneva peace plan BOSNIA'S Moslem-dominated parliament yesterday defied Serbian threats and voted to reject peace plan maps put forward in Geneva, although it agreed in principle to the republic's partition into three ethnic mini-states. US President Bill Clinton voiced concern at the parliament's decision, declaring the ultimate cost of 'passing up this peace' might be very high. 'They want some more territory,' he said. 'I think they're entitled to some more territory, but I don't know if they can get it.' After a closed session in the shell-scarred Holiday Inn in Sarajevo, 58 Bosnian deputies voted to endorse the plan only on condition that territories taken by force are returned to government control. Seven deputies voted for outright rejection, with four in favour of unconditional acceptance. Since Bosnian Serb leaders have repeatedly refused to hand over any more land to their outgunned Moslem adversaries, the decision appears to have weakened hopes of an early peace settlement. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, earlier warned that conditional acceptance was tantamount to rejection. 'Enough is enough,' he said, adding that Serbs had made seven territorial concessions. After 18 months of war, Bosnian Serb forces hold about 70 per cent of Bosnia. Mr Karadzic has agreed to scale back his territory to 54 per cent but has stopped short of the additional 4 per cent of land, cited by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, as necessary to have the minimum essentials for the functioning of his land-locked, disjointed state. Despite pressure to endorse the accord, Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said: 'Territories taken by force, especially where genocide occurred. . . must be returned to their rightful owners. Otherwise, we are living in a jungle. It will be a new stone age.' The rejection left diplomats at a loss for the next step to broker a peace before the Balkan winter, and threw plans for the deployment of peacekeeping forces into confusion again. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, will meet today in Geneva. Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said the latest news on peace negotiations in the former Yugoslavia was 'rather pessimistic' and the Pentagon feared that Bosnia may suffer another winter of civil war. Nato diplomats in Brussels indicated that the conditional acceptance would not be enough for deployment of peacekeepers. With the prospect of renewed war, fears are also growing about the further fragmentation of Bosnia, heightened after Mr Fikret Abdic, a member of Bosnia's collective leadership, declared autonomy in the Bihac region, an isolated north-western pocket. Tens of thousands of people were reported to have taken to the streets in protest after security forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic seized police stations in five enclave towns and ordered a curfew, Croatian radio said. The Bosnian parliament yesterday ousted Mr Abdic from the collective leadership.</p>

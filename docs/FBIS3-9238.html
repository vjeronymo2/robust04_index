[Gligorov] Yes. When they first tried -- in October 1992 --  they did not achieve anything. The blockade could not prevent  our recognition by the European Union [EU] states. The impetus  for it came from an intra-Greek power struggle. Had the  Mitsotakis government remained in power then we would have  achieved a solution together with Vance and Owen. Yet, the new  head of government, Papandreou, feels bound by his  anti-Macedonian statements from the election campaign and is  trying to harness the EU to his cart. Yet, six EU countries  have already recognized us -- and now even the United States.  The Greek embargo is a nervous reaction to our success.    [Glenny] The Albanian party has split up into two factions.  The radicals have requested identical rights for the Albanians  as for the Macedonians at all levels. Does this worry you?    [Gligorov] The division of the Albanian ethnic group is a  normal democratic process. We must pursue dialogue with all  groups. So far we have survived because we have avoided the kind  of nationalism that erupted everywhere in the former Yugoslavia.    [Glenny] Do you think that the U.S.-supported Muslim-Croat  alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina will work?    [Gligorov] I have always been of the opinion that Bosnia-  Herzegovina should be preserved as one. The Muslim-Croat  alliance is one step forward. Yet, how will the Serbs react?  The United States is afraid that the war might spread to the  south, and it seems to be interested in preserving Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. If the  dispute were to come here it would mean a new war in the Balkans  -- which is why I cannot understand why Greece is acting the way  it is. If war were to break out here it would affect all Balkan  countries.    [Glenny] Is it true that Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic invited you to a Christian-Orthodox alliance with  Greece and Cyprus?    [Gligorov] There is the idea of a large bloc, which should  comprise Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece,  and Cyprus. Yet, Macedonia is looking toward Europe and is  against the creation of new alliances. I frankly said so to  Milosevic when he proposed to me the creation of such an  Orthodox alliance from Belgrade via Skopje to Athens and Cyprus.  I said that Macedonia would never join such an alliance that is  based on religion and nationalities. The Greeks are afraid of a  Muslim alliance, but we do not want that, either. We are hoping  for an associative membership agreement with the EU, which might  ultimately lead to membership in 15 years. I also wrote to  President Clinton that we would like to participate in NATO's  Partnership for Peace.</p>

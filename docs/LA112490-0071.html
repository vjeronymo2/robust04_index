			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CBS' 'BROKEN BADGES' NEEDS TO BE RECALLED  </P> <P> "Broken Badges" is a grating echo of "The A-Team" from Stephen J. Cannell, a  new CBS series about as dully formulaic and predictable as television gets.  Although regularly airing at 9 p.m., it premieres at 8 tonight (on Channels 2  and 8) with a distended two-hour episode so incredibly exciting and suspenseful  that you're constantly on the edge of your seat.  </P> <P> Poised to sleep.  </P> <P> What we get tonight are the beginnings of one of those special undercover  police units assigned to cases that regular cops can't or won't handle. The  location is a place called Bay City, Calif.  </P> <P> The leader will be police psychologist Eleanor Hardwick (Terry Donahoe), whose  by-the-book methods will clash with the street-toughness of Beau Jack Bowman  (Miguel Ferrer, who also plays forensics expert Albert Rosenfield on ABC's  "Twin Peaks").  </P> <P> A New Orleans Cajun cop destined to be the group's main member, Beau Jack  arrives in Bay City with a murder suspect he is supposed to turn over to the  local cops. However, the suspect escapes after being left alone in a crowded  airport, handcuffed to a baggage rack. A murder suspect left alone? So much for  credibility.  </P> <P> Beau Jack better retrieve the suspect, his chief screams at him on the phone,  or DON'T BOTHER TO COME BACK!!! He doesn't bother to come back.  </P> <P> Gradually, Bowman meets the other cops who at the end of the episode will be  his colleagues in the unit. Psychological misfits and dangerously unstable,  here they are: nerdy ventriloquist Stanley Jones (Jay Johnson), who has a  fistfight with his uniformed puppet; stressed-out Toby Baker (Ernie Hudson) and  J. J. Tingreedes (Eileen Davidson), a tattooed, leather-loving wild woman so  addicted to danger -- ooooooh -- that no other cop will work with her.  </P> <P> Somehow, these raucous clown cops will get their act together and track down  the murder suspect and the white-collar meanies behind an insidious plot to  undermine quaint old Bay City. It gets ugly. Sample dialogue: "I will not  hesitate to drop you like a set of keys, you got that?"  </P> <P> This story is not just full of holes, it is a hole, a huge one. Just how it is  that Beau Jack becomes Bay City Jack, working for yet another chief who hates  his guts, is a thing of wonder.  </P> <P> "Broken Badges," a series you want to drop like a set of keys.

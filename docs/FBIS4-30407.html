			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masaharu Gotoda, LDP Diet member] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Concerning Japan-U.S. talks,  product-by-product numerical quotas have been proposed by the  United States, and it is all right to oppose them as managed  trade. Furthermore, I don't think it admirable for the United  States to get concessions from its trade partners by threatening  them with possible sanctions.    From the U.S. standpoint, however, actual results have  fallen  short of expectations even after 33 negotiations in the past:  Japan makes promises, but it fails to follow through. Then, it  doesn't seem necessarily wrong [for the United States] to attach  great importance to results and to refuse to accept nothing less  if such results are not guaranteed.    As Japan has an annual trade surplus of 50 billion yen [Y]  with one country, and this surplus has been increasing, more,  there must exist something that Japan must correct on its own.  Not even clarifying its policy to reduce its trade surplus,  however, Japan rejects the U.S. demands totally, insisting that  its arguments are right. Is this an adult way to maintain a  relationship?    As economic problems between Japan and the United States  affect the world economy to a significant degree, it is  important to search for some compromise between the two nations.  It is too foolish for Japan to dismiss completely the numerical  quotas as managed trade without having any clear idea [of how to  reduce its trade surplus].    Also, if one proposes a national welfare tax plan, he's got  to have a vision for a welfare system to start with, and then to  have debates on how much of an increase in income tax he should  be asking the public to bear, after taking into consideration  the balance between the burden of tax and that of social  welfare. On the contrary, he [Hosokawa] abruptly proposed a  7-percent national welfare tax, without considering these basic  issues.    Mr. Hosokawa said that the issues had been deliberated by  the  government's Tax Commission. But, although the Tax Commission is  an independent council in form, it is in fact like a spokesman  for the government -- the commission's deliberations don't seem  to take public interests into consideration. The public cannot  acquiesce something that they are told abruptly without prior  discussions or visions. Restructuring of the cabinet also lacks  a sense of inevitability and vision. If the Hosokawa cabinet  continues to employ this kind of political method, it should  surely receive strong criticism.  <H5>  Unable To Control the Bureaucracy </H5>   Not much result has been attained in the area of  administrative reform, one of the Hosokawa cabinet's major  policy objectives. Although deregulation and decentralization  have been advocated, it is doubtful if there has been any  progress in these areas. Bureaucrats seem to have become more  influential ever since the Hosokawa cabinet came into the scene,  failing to control the rise of the bureaucracy.    For example, the national welfare tax plan mentioned earlier  can also be considered as a measure to secure the source of  funds at the time of income tax reduction. To be sure, as the  Ministry of Finance [MOF] argues, it is impossible to reduce  taxes without having another source of funds. Here, I think we  need to acknowledge this argument, for it has its own ground.  But, to reduce income tax by 6 trillion yen or so, they are  trying to increase taxes by approximately 9 trillion yen in  total, including 2.4 trillion yen from a 1-percent increase in  consumption tax. I can understand this as the logic of the  bureaucracy, but the public won't accept it.    I guess the Hosokawa cabinet didn't realize the difficulty  of  tax reform. Things are not that easy. If they [the cabinet]  wanted to reduce income tax as part of their economic stimulus  package, they should have dealt with it separately from the  increase in consumption tax.    In any event, if the bureaucracy tries to bring up a  self-serving logic, somebody has to contain it; being able to do  so is the true ability of a politician. The Hosokawa cabinet,  however, didn't have this ability.    How, then, can the cabinet order the bureaucracy to delegate  more power to local governments, or to loosen up regulations? At  present, 82 items of deregulation are on the list. But, how many  of these have real substance?    Now, how about the progress on reform of the economic  system,  another important agenda for Japan? This is also a difficult  task. The Japanese economy today is not at a stage where a few  improvement measures would suffice. Rather, it is at a stage  where we need to plunge a scalpel into the very system of the  economy. Japan will be looked upon by foreign countries as a  disturbing factor for the world economy if it continues its  economic activities based on the ideas of mass production, mass  merchandising, and mass market share. If Japan continues to  record a one-sided trade surplus, the world economy will not be  able to sustain itself.    How to reduce a surplus, or how to utilize the surpluses  accumulated within the nation in order to improve the lives of  citizens -- if an overall plan based on this kind of questioning  doesn't exist, economic plans themselves won't develop. What Mr.  Hosokawa has come up with so far are makeshift measures to  stimulate the economy. I believe he should increase the budget  for public works projects from the planned amount of 430  trillion yen.    Although reform of our election system is said to have  gained  a firm footing, it is just a small step toward political reform.  Redrawing voting districts, preventing corruptions, and so on --  all this being considered, we are still somewhere between 20 and  30 percent of the height of the mountain to climb. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Responsibility Also Lies With the Antireformist LDP </H5>   Yet, the support ratings for the cabinet are still  inexplicably high. Although they declined somewhat to 50  percent, compared to 70 percent around the time when the new  government was installed. But, they are still high. Frankly, I  think they show the flip side of the public dissatisfaction over  many years of Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] reign.  Responsibility lies with our party, because even though the  support ratings for the Hosokawa cabinet declined, those for the  LDP haven't improved.    A political party that is or will be in charge of the  government must maintain support ratings of 50 percent or so all  the time. The LDP in the old days did so. But, the party is now  one-fourth the size it used to be, receiving support ratings of  around 25 percent.    Once the coalition government is considered ineffective, the  LDP with its rich experience and human resources ought to regain  public confidence. But it hasn't. As it didn't carry out  self-reform for its rebirth, it has been unable to erase the  disappointment [felt by the public]. People are disappointed  with the coalition government and remain disappointed with the  LDP. I believe this is a crisis situation for Japanese politics  that has never before been experienced. Therefore, the most  important thing for the LDP to do now is to reform the party to  be reborn.    The LDP must clarify its ideas on how to deal with new types  of changes here and abroad and how to cleanse itself of various  stains it accumulated over the years. This unfinished business  is the agenda for party President Kono.    The reason I recommended Mr. Yohei Kono for the party  presidency is that I believed he would be the person to enable  the party to win the next election and regain its political  power. But Mr. Kono is now fettered by complex movements within  the party so that he is unable to flex his muscles. Unless he  overcomes this, the LDP will not be able to regain public  confidence or to win the election. Because he is not a head of  any faction, he cannot use the tactics of cooperating with other  factions, unable to exercise his leadership.    The current situation is still transitional, and although  the  factions within the party are on their way to disintegration, we  still have to use these factions to get things done. We must  find our way out from this situation and organize ourselves  around the party apparatus. Yet, we haven't come to this point,  and therefore I believe President Kono is having a rough time.  We should not be distracted by various movements in the leading  coalition parties and within our party. Regrettably, however,  everyone seems to be vacillating.  <H5>  Need To Strengthen Anticorruption Measures </H5>   Four related bills have been passed, and we are on the  threshold of political reform. As stated earlier, I want to rate  highly the Hosokawa administration's efforts to accomplish this  much.    However, the recent revision of law is a means toward  reform,  not the end. The fundamental goal is to activate parliamentary  democracy. In other words, having two opposing major political  powers and thus maintaining political tension, we will  occasionally have a change of administration. By creating this  kind of political system, the two parties will try to solve  political problems responsibly for the public. This is how the  system should be.    For example, we need to further strengthen anticorruption  measures. The case of general contractors' bribery of Mr.  Kishiro Nakamura is currently being tried. But, it contains some  difficult legal issues. I don't know how the trial will develop,  but I think it natural for the public, whose annual income is  around 6 million yen to 7 million yen, to give a harsh look at  the political world, where a single voice can mobilize 10  million yen. The public certainly thinks that money moves  politics.    As anticorruption measures that would lessen any further  public distrust in politics, we need to strengthen the  regulation holding a candidate jointly responsible for election  fraud and to expedite trials for election law violations. A  trial in Japan takes too long. I don't understand why no one has  suggested reform in this area. Also, there is room for  improvement in how political contributions by corporations  should be made.    However, as Japan is a corporate society, it has no  tradition  of contributions by individuals. Nevertheless, there is a  riskier side to individual contributions. In some instances, I  ask my secretary to return such individual contributions,  because I don't know if they are pure political contributions or  if they accompany some ulterior motives.    Even if corporate contributions are banned, there will  always  be some loopholes. Although individual contributions are the  norm in the United States, corporations are actually making  contributions to particular politicians through political action  committees. For example, a corporation pays extra wages to its  employees, and then makes the employees contribute the extra  amount in their names. As such contributions are made for the  benefit of the stockholders to politicians who have some  business-related political clout, they are definitely considered  as a bribe in Japan. Judging from this, anticorruption measures,  however strict they may be, have some loopholes. Therefore, the  issue rests on the attitude of each individual politician.    Still, we need to plug obvious loopholes and to create a law  that will make it difficult to find loopholes. The issue of [how  to apportion] voting districts still remains, as does reform of  the upper house and the electoral system for local assemblies.  As stated earlier, if the Hosokawa cabinet thinks that political  reform is already complete, I would say that's gross ignorance.  <H5>  Doubt About Komeito's Participation in the Government </H5>   How will the political situation develop from now on? The  key  to this question is when the next election for the lower house  will take place. Will it take place at the end of this year, or  next year? If the Diet is dissolved before then, the election  will be conducted according to the existing system. Considering  the significance of having reformed the electoral system, it  seems reasonable to employ the new system in the next election.    How will each party carry out its election campaign  according  to the new system? As it is a single-seat electoral system  combined with some proportional representation, the new system  will generate complex actions on the part of individual  politicians vying for nomination in particular districts or  trying to obtain candidacy in a block for proportional  representation. At the same time, there will also be some  breakups and mergers among political parties.    It is difficult to make a clear and accurate prediction of a  convergence [of parties] at this point in time. But, if I  venture to guess, I think there will remain at the end about  three political powers plus the Japanese Communist Party [JCP].  The ideal situation is to have two major parties. But, some  additional parties tend to appear in the middle, as in England  and Germany.    In the case of Japan, I don't know if a party in the middle  will be a small one as in England and Germany. It is possible to  have a situation where the party in the middle has the largest  power and the other parties on both ends of the spectrum are  small. In any event, the middle party always tends to belong to  the leading party.    I can't make a definite statement, but I believe that  Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] without the extreme left wing will join together.  Although the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is a bit different  from these two parties, it is highly likely that it may join  them, considering its relationship with the Japanese Private  Sector Trade Union Confederation. Adding to this a conservative  power centered on the LDP and another conservative power on  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], therefore, it is possible to  see three power centers.    Komeito and the JCP are alike in a sense, and their  participation in political administration will be strongly  resisted, I believe. They share the same kind of character, if  somebody orders the others to turn right, everybody turns right,  and everybody tends to say the same thing. Komeito has Mr.  Takeiri and Mr. Yano, both of whom are nice people to talk with  on a personal level. But, looking at it as a political party,  there are many problems.    Recently, Komeito has been saying that it doesn't mind  dissolving itself. Making its origin ambiguous by doing so can  be a strategy to gain influence on one of the conservative  powers. This may not work, however, because a candidate  supported by the Soka Gakkai [Komeito's major support base]  tends to lose votes from constituents of other parties. I think  many people see it as problematic to have this kind of candidate  participate in the administration.  <H5>  True Motives Behind the Alliance Between the Japan New Party </H5> and Shinseito    Realignment centering on the idea of combining the Japan New  Party and Shinseito is currently underway within the leading  coalition parties. Stating my conclusion first, I believe  breakups and mergers of political parties will continue until  the end of this century. There remain only seven years or so in  this century; that means there will be only two or three general  elections. The realignment currently underway is aimed at the  next election. After the election, another realignment will take  place for gaining power, based on the number of seats each party  wins.    The Japan New Party is like a reformist group among the  conservatives. By nature, therefore, it should associate itself  with Sakigake. On the other hand, Shinseito is a group formed by  the people from the LDP's Takeshita faction, and Komeito is a  party based on religion -- they are different in character. So,  it is difficult to understand when the Japan New Party acts in  concert with Shinseito and Komeito, rather than with Sakigake.    Nonetheless, the Japan New Party tries to cooperate with  Shinseito. It does so to maintain its political power. Putting  myself in Mr. Hosokawa's shoes, I think he wants to maintain his  political power for even a day longer. From Mr. Ozawa's  standpoint, he wants to build a larger power base than the LDP  for the next election. The cooperation is based on nothing but  these motives.    As far as Takemura is concerned, he seems to have spoken too  much as a cabinet secretary during the upheavals relating to the  National Welfare Tax and restructuring of the cabinet. But he is  a rare politician. He holds up an ideal in his political  activities and keeps chasing after the ideal. But he doesn't get  discouraged when he can't reach that ideal; he has a practical  side, too. In this sense, he is different from ordinary  politicians.    Hosokawa and Takemura share the same national sentiment.  Therefore, the Japan New Party was supposed to ally itself with  Sakigake. But, Hosokawa allies himself with Ozawa. Here lies the  difficulty of realignment.  <H5>  Opposing Ozawa's Theory of the Nation </H5>   Then, how does the national sentiment of Mr. Hosokawa and  Mr.  Takemura differ from that of Mr. Ozawa?    Ozawa says that Japan should become a "normal nation."  Behind  this thought is an assumption that Japan today is abnormal.    In today's international community, it is not normal for  Japan to pursue only economic activities without carrying out  its international responsibility; if requested by the United  Nations, Japan should use its armed forces abroad; if necessary,  we should revise our Constitution; and if you don't want to  revise the Constitution, we should interpret it in broader  terms, say, Japan can do such and such to some extent so as to  be a normal nation. This is Ozawa's view. I think Ozawa has his  own political philosophy, and that he is a politician with  strong power of execution -- he has his own point of view.    But, Takemura has a different view. I do, too, and so does  Hosokawa, I believe.    What will it be like if Japan uses its armed forces abroad  in  this violently changing international situation by going beyond  the line it has kept up until now? Considering its current  economic power, I see a risk that Japan may turn to  supernationalism and hegemonic ambitions, moving on to the  strengthening of its military power. Then, what will happen to  Japan? The United States may welcome this as long as Japan is  under its control. But, Japan may become isolated in Asia.    For example, the United States and China are now in conflict  over the human rights issue. But once they find a mutual  interest, they will join together readily.    On the other hand, if Japan starts building up its armaments  and entertains its hegemonic ambitions, its relationship with  China will break down decisively, and the situation in Asia will  become tense immediately.    Therefore, I can't agree with the idea of Japan becoming a  normal nation. As natural rights as an independent nation, Japan  should have some military capability for its citizens to defend  themselves from foreign aggressions. Also, since nuclear weapons  exist in the world, it is all right as an option for Japan to  remain under the U.S. nuclear umbrella pursuant to the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty so as to defend its citizens from  nuclear attack.    In any event, Japan should keep its principle of not using  military forces abroad. Instead of using military forces, Japan  should make positive contributions to the international  community in the areas of peace and public welfare. I don't  believe the use of military forces is the only way to contribute  to the international community.    The world is moving away at least from confrontation among  nuclear powers to a global society where nuclear weapons are  unnecessary. Regional conflicts may remain, but the world as a  whole is moving toward peace. What kinds of needs and meanings  are there for Japan to strengthen its military power and to  entertain hegemonic ambitions under the name of the United  Nations, pursuing a super power status along with the United  States?    Tribal conflicts and religious disputes are going on in  various parts of the world. It will not be known for the next  five to 10 years how the world will come to rest. In these  circumstances, how can we be so foolish to divide public opinion  into two on the issue of our Constitution? It would be all right  to debate this issue five or 10 years from now, but I don't  think we should have a political showdown that would divide  public opinion at this time.</p>

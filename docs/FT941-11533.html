			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Strong buying from a leading US investment house, together with renewed hopes of a reduction in interest rates, brought a squeeze in Footsie futures, sending the near month contract breaking through the 3,500 resistance level to finish at an all-time high, writes Joel Kibazo. A faltering start for the March contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,476 hinted at a quiet session ahead. However, demand by independent traders and the return of optimism on interest rates ahead of today's Bundesbank Council meeting, brought a turnround in the fortunes of the contract. The buying of 2,000 lots, reported to have been done by Goldman Sachs, added impetus to the rise, pulling the cash market higher. March maintained a strong premium for most of the session, but dealers said that with a shortage of stock in the equities there were few arbitrage opportunities. The March contract ended at a record 3,530, up 49 from its previous close and 13 points above its estimated fair value to cash which now stands at nil. Volume was heavy, reaching 22,214 lots by the official close. Traded options also saw hefty turnover, with 54,902 contracts dealt by the close, of which 18,176 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 8,465 in the Euro FT-SE option. Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,996 lots transacted and was followed by Argyll group at 3,163 contracts. A report from the Liffe showed turnover in futures and options in January 1994 having increased by 93 per cent from a year ago.</p>

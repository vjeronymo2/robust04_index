			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lotus posts sharp fall in third term Lotus Development reported a sharp drop in earnings for the third quarter. The US personal computer software company said that problems in its European operations were to blame for the reversal. Net income before non-recurring charges was Dollars 7.3m, or 15 cents a share, 60 per cent down on Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents, posted in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.2m, a 2 per cent decline from Dollars 240.1m in last year's third quarter. Lotus took charges of Dollars 67.9m for the acquisition of SoftSwitch and Edge Research, two software development groups, during the quarter. The company also took a Dollars 9m charge for restructuring its European operations. The net loss for the quarter, after charges, was Dollars 66.4m, or Dollars 1.39 a share. 'Third-quarter results proved disappointing, primarily due to poor performance of our European operations,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive officer. He also cited slower than expected sales through a volume purchase programme for corporate customers. The problems in Europe stemmed from slow demand for Lotus' office PC applications programs and a management shuffle, said Mr Edwin Gillis, chief financial officer. During the period Lotus appointed a new manager of its European operations. Revenues from communications programs, used for electronic messaging, now account for about one-third of revenues and sales of these products grew 72 per cent, year on year. Net losses, after charges, for the year to date were Dollars 35.3m, or 76 cents a share, compared with net income after charges of Dollars 25.9m, or 59 cents, in the first nine months of 1993. Lotus shares closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 34 11/16.</p>

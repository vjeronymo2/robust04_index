			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Own Information report: "Americans Are Sponsoring Our </F> Power Industry"]    [Text] The governments of the United States and the  Russian Federation have reached agreement on the provision to  Russia of a nonreturnable subsidy of $125 million for the  implementation of a program for the import of energy-saving and  nature protection equipment and materials. This is being done  within the framework of cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the United States in the sphere of the power  industry and environmental protection. The program is being  funded by the United States in stages beginning with a  nonreturnable subsidy of $10 million which will be distributed  by the Russian Federation Government between the state and  private sectors of the Russian economy to finance the import of  equipment, materials, and services.    The minimum value of a deal for the acquisition of materials  and equipment (the supplier in the United States will be  selected on a competitive basis) is $100,000 and the financial  resources in question will not be subject to taxation or customs  duties.    Those components of the state and private sectors in the  Russian Federation interested in obtaining such a subsidy must  submit their applications to the Russian-American joint council  created to oversee the general direction of the program under  the auspices of the Russian Federation Government's Commission  on Questions of International Humanitarian and Technical  Assistance.</p>

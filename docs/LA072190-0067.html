			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DE KLERK MEETS WITH MANDELA; 2ND ROUND SET  </P> <P> Amid worldwide calls to keep the peace process in South Africa moving, Nelson  Mandela and President Frederik W. de Klerk met privately for an hour Friday and  agreed to set Aug. 6 for a second round of talks between the government and the  African National Congress.  </P> <P> The meeting between Mandela and De Klerk, at the presidential offices in  Pretoria, came only two days after the ANC deputy president returned from a  six-week international tour. And it indicated that both the ANC and the  government want to quickly resolve the remaining obstacles to formal  black-white negotiations.  </P> <P> A joint ANC-government working group, set up during the first round of talks in  May, has been drawing up a plan to meet the ANC's demand that all political  prisoners be freed and all political exiles be allowed to return with immunity.  Although details of the group's report have not been released, it is said to  outline a phased release of political prisoners.  </P> <P> The report also will make provisions for deciding who is a political prisoner.  The ANC says about 3,000 prisoners have been convicted of politically motivated  crimes, while the government, defining political offenses less broadly,  estimates less than half that many.  </P> <P> Senior government negotiators have said they support the working group's  report, but the ANC has yet to make a final decision. The ANC's 37-member  National Executive Committee will meet Monday and Tuesday in Johannesburg to  consider the report as well as other matters.  </P> <P> A statement released by De Klerk's office Friday said the next round of  ANC-government talks will cover the recommendations on political prisoners and  review the progress that has been made on others of the ANC's obstacles to  negotiations.  </P> <P> While Mandela was touring Europe, North America and Africa, De Klerk lifted the  four-year state of emergency in three of South Africa's four provinces, going  most of the way toward meeting that ANC demand.  </P></p>

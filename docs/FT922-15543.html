			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Craxi drops hint on PM's post MR Bettino Craxi, Italy's Socialist leader, yesterday hinted that he would not seek to head a fresh coalition government if his party fared poorly in next Sunday's general elections. Until now both the Socialists and their Christian Democrat allies have based their election campaign on a call for a strong vote to ensure their long standing partnership could provide a stable basis for the country's next government. There has been an understanding that the premiership should change parties and be offered to Mr Craxi, who headed two coalition governments from 1983 to 1987. However, the Socialist vote risks being eroded by electoral discontent with the outgoing administration and recent allegations of corruption involving prominent party figures. In an interview published yesterday by the daily Corriere della Sera, Mr Craxi claimed to be confident about the outcome but added: 'Even a limited negative signal (from the electorate) would mean a defeat and we could not but draw conclusions - and natuthe 1987 elections, the Socialists obtained 14.3 per cent of the vote. Before this campaign, the party believed it could increase this percentage; but a lacklustre campaign and the arrest of Mr Mario Chiesa, a prominent member of the ruption charges have led commentators to predict that the Socialists will have difficulty retaining their share of the vote. Mr Craxi's threat not to offer himself as a candidate for the premiership appears designed to rally the Socialist vote behind him. It underlines the concern of the Socialists and Christian Democrats that they will fail to secure a parliamentary majority, with their two small allies, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI).</p>

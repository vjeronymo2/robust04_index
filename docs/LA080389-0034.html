			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Pat Harvey, an anchorwoman at Chicago superstation WGN-TV and formerly at CNN,  will be coming aboard KHJ-TV Channel 9 here to help anchor the station's  three-hour prime-time newscast, scheduled to premiere next year. Harvey will  join local news personalities Jerry Dunphy and Larry Carroll, previously  announced for the Disney-owned station's expanded news staff. If, as expected,  she is given a permanent anchor spot when she arrives at the station in  October, she would become the only black weekday anchor in Los Angeles. KHJ-TV  also reportedly is wooing former KABC-TV and KCBS anchor Terry Murphy and  KABC-TV sportscaster Jim Hill. The future of the station's current anchors --  Lonnie Lardner, Tom Lawrence, Linda Edwards and sportscaster Scott St. James --  is yet to be determined. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. AIR TERMINAL COST ISN'T OUT OF LINE;  </P> <P> PROJECT IS MID-PRICED COMPARED TO SIMILAR PROJECTS, SURVEY FINDS  </P> <P> Despite months of controversy about cost overruns and design changes, John  Wayne Airport's new $50-million passenger terminal is neither cheap nor  expensive when compared to similar projects nationally, according to an  informal Times survey.  </P> <P> A Times survey of 21 projects throughout the U.S. showed a wide price range,  from $59 per square foot of new terminal space in Fargo, N.D., to $357 per  square foot at Chicago's splashy new United Airlines complex.  </P> <P> John Wayne's new terminal is running about $148 per square foot.  </P> <P> Plagued by controversy from the start, the terminal is part of a $310-million  expansion program that also includes new garages, roads, bridges and airfield  improvements -- the county's biggest public works project ever. The project has  been beset by design errors, cost overruns, and mistakes in price estimates.  </P> <P> But with the topping off of the ironwork last month, the new terminal appears  to be progressing more smoothly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Behind Schedule  </P> <P> The Orange County Grand Jury, in one of its periodic progress reports, last  week warned that the project is 14 weeks behind schedule. But officials still  predict that the new structure will be occupied by April 1, although some  interior walls may not be painted by then and some gates may not be open to  aircraft.  </P> <P> To be sure, issues remain, such as the siting for a million-gallon,  above-ground fuel storage facility, business disputes between prime contractor  Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd. and subcontractors, and difficulty  in reaching the goal of 10% participation by firms owned by women and  minorities.  </P> <P> But according to Project Manager Richard Begley: "The worst is behind us. You  will see enormous progress from this point forward."  </P> <P> Begley has contended that the problems at John Wayne hardly stand alone.  </P> <P> Some examples found in The Times survey:  </P> <P> * In San Jose, a soils engineering firm failed to discover an underground  stream at the site of the city's new passenger terminal, causing delays for  pumping. Delivery of tons of granite from Italy fell behind schedule. And an  airport spokesman said the city is probably going to seek reimbursement from  the architect for some errors and omissions discovered in blueprints.  </P> <P> * In Nashville, Tenn., where a new $105-million facility nearly twice the size  of the new John Wayne terminal was completed in only 21 months, two  subcontractors went broke in mid-project. The head of the agency in charge of  Nashville's airport expansion was embroiled in a controversy over his ownership  of land near the airport. A fish on the endangered species list was found in a  stream near the new terminal site, and airport neighbors have sued to block  construction of a new runway that environmental impact documents previously  failed to mention.  </P> <P> * In Albuquerque, N.M., where a project doubling the size of the airport's  existing terminal will be completed later this month, the sandy soil beneath  the building shifted. The roof leaked on airline employees. The heating and  cooling systems failed.  </P> <P> * In Chicago, work began on some sections of the $500-million United Airlines  terminal before others had been designed. The new terrazzo floor cracked.  Construction workers went on strike. And the multimillion-dollar glass roof,  which was reflecting blinding streams of light into the eyes of air traffic  controllers, had to be etched with acid after it was already in place.  </P> <P> Despite such problems, officials at each of these airports used phrases like  "running smoothly" to describe their terminal-construction projects.  </P> <P> Problems occur, airport and airline industry officials say, because airport  projects are large, complex, and rely on armies of workers who have trouble  communicating. Some officials, such San Jose airport spokesman Steve Grossman,  are fatalistic. "I believe that on almost any project you're going to find some  of these things," he said. "But the bottom line is that, here at least, they  have not delayed the expected completion date because you make up time as you  go along."  </P> <P> The frenzied pace of airport building is part of a national boom in terminal  construction and remodeling due to intense competition among airlines for  market share and a need to replace inadequate, worn-out facilities that were  built to accommodate first-generation jetliners 30 years ago.  </P> <P> Denver, for example, plans to build a new airport at a cost of more than $2  billion. Chicago is going through a $2-billion airport-improvement program that  includes the recently opened, $500-million United Airlines terminal. National  Airport in Washington and its sister airfield, Dulles International Airport,  are jointly planning $1.2 billion in improvements. Dallas-Ft. Worth and JFK in  New York are each planning improvements totaling more than $1 billion. Orlando,  Fla., is in the midst of a $430-million expansion program, and San Francisco  anticipates spending at least $300 million.  </P> <P> And at Los Angeles International Airport, which was remodeled for the 1984  Summer Olympics, Delta Airlines last year spent more than $85 million  reconstructing its terminal, and several airlines are spending another $200  million combined on other terminal remodeling projects. The Federal Aviation  Administration reports that annual requests for airport development grants have  jumped from $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion just in the past three years.  </P> <P> "We need this construction boom," says Tom Browne, manager for airport policy  and administration at the Air Transport Assn., the industry group that  represents air carriers. "Most everything (new) that's going in is capacity  related. . . . There are more passengers and more planes. And some of the  capacity gains involve replacing the old with the new."  </P> <P> Air travel demand is expected to reach 750 million passenger boardings per year  by 2001, compared to 450 million projected for 1989.  </P> <P> Most airport terminal construction or remodeling is financed with revenue  bonds, which are repaid with airline landing fees and rents collected from food  vendors and car-rental agencies. When leased airport space goes up in price due  to remodeling or new construction, concessionaires charge the public  accordingly.  </P> <P> A Continental Airlines official, for example, recently stated that if Denver  builds a new, $2.3-billion airport, it could add $36 to ticket prices for  passengers going to or from that facility.  </P> <P> One industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new  passenger terminal at John Wayne Airport could add $5 to $7 to the airlines'  cost for each boarding passenger.  </P> <P> Comparing projects to see who is getting the most terminal for the money is  nearly impossible, according to airport managers, contractors and airline  industry officials.  </P> <P> San Jose has almost completed a new $33-million, 225,000-square-foot terminal  that will cost about $132 per square foot. For that price, San Jose is getting  10 new passenger gates, vaulted ceilings, a lot of glass and a stone-clad  exterior. In comparison, John Wayne's $50-million, 337,900-square-foot terminal  will cost about $148 per square foot and will have 14 gates, with most of the  same amenities. Conditions at the two construction sites are similar.  </P> <P> Nashville last year added a $105-million, 750,000-square-foot, 46-gate  terminal, for only $140 per square foot. The new terminal includes special  facilities equipped with fax machines and word-processing services for business  travelers. Nashville benefited from lower labor and materials costs due to  regional economic differences that set it apart from both the West and East  Coasts, or even the Chicago-Detroit area, contractors say.  </P> <P> Andrew Carlson, president of Sacramento-based Continental Heller, the general  contractor for San Jose's new terminal, considered the John Wayne project but  did not bid on it.  </P> <P> "We knew it was going to cost $55 million to $60 million, not the $42 million  that was budgeted," he said.  </P> <P> At John Wayne, the low bid was $18 million higher than the $42 million budgeted  by the county, leading to a major cost-cutting effort. A cost estimator said  that contractors were overcharging. A consulting firm countered that the cost  estimator had inaccurately priced many materials such as steel and concrete.  </P> <P> Because terminal designs vary, comparing costs can be difficult, Carlson said.  </P> <P> "You have to look at how much renovation is going on, and whether or not the  facility has to remain open for business while you're working," Carlson said.  "The Orange County terminal is going to be very stylish, and that adds to the  cost. But even that doesn't compare with Chicago, where the new United terminal  was designed as a masterpiece by a red-hot architect (Helmut Jahn). National  Airport in Washington, D.C., in contrast, is (going to be) a nice, simple  building -- nothing flashy.  </P> <P> "So asking what a new terminal should cost is kind of tough, says Carlson.  "Tell me. What does an automobile cost?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 21 AIRPORT TERMINAL PROJECTS IN U.S.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:1.67IN:2.11IN:2.11IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Square  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Cost/  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Airport  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Gates  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sq.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of Trade and </F> Industry on 30 December: "Needham Welcomes Opening of European  Economic Area"]    [Text] The European Economic Area [EEA] Agreement comes  into force on 1 January 1994 bringing new export opportunities  for UK companies. It will extend the EC's Single Market to  Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, members of the  European Free Trade Association [EFTA].  <H3>  Richard Needham, Minister for Trade, Welcomed the Launch of  the EEA </H3>   "The EEA will bring new export opportunities for UK  companies. The EEA covers 17 countries extending from the Arctic  to the Mediterranean. It removes single market nontariff  barriers, such as national standards, for businesses selling to  some 370 million consumers, in an area representing 40 percent  of the world's trade.    Although not a Customs Union, the EEA will provide for free  movement of goods, services, capital and people. By taking on  1,500 of the EC's single market measures, the EFTA states will  have to open areas of their markets previously closed to UK  exporters. For example:     -  Public purchasing contracts will  have to be open to our companies;    -  Many of EFTA's technical  standards for products will have to be aligned with those set by  the EC;    -  The EFTA states will be subject to rules on competition  and state aid based on the Community's rules;    -  Financial services  markets will be opened up giving UK firms greater freedom to  open branches in EFTA states;    -  UK professionals will be able to  practice in the EFTA states without the need to requalify;    -  UK  companies will benefit from EFTA co-operation in EC programmes  on R&amp;D, education, youth and training, small- and  medium-sized  enterprises, tourism and audiovisual services.    "UK companies are well placed to take advantage of the  Agreement. In 1992 we made 5.7 billion pounds of visible exports  to the EFTA states that will participate in the EEA. The  Agreement will enable UK business to build on that excellent  performance."  <H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>   1. The European Economic Area Agreement was signed in Oporto  on 2 May 1992. Entry into force had to await ratification of the  Agreement by all the participating EC and EFTA states. The last  states to ratify, France and Spain, did so on 10 December 1993.    2. Switzerland, also an EFTA member, decided in a referendum  in December 1992 not to participate in the EEA. The need to  amend the Agreement to exclude Switzerland [in a Protocol signed  on 17 March 1993] delayed the original target date for entry  into force (1 January 1993). Liechtenstein will join the EEA at  a date after 1 January 1994 yet to be decided, due to the need  to make special arrangements arising from its close trading ties  with Switzerland [with which it has a customs union].    3. The UK ratified the EEA on 15 November 1993. The  Agreement  will be implemented in the UK by the European Economic Area Act  1993.    4. Since the EEA Agreement was signed, negotiations on full  EU [European Union] membership have started with four of the  participating EFTA states -- Austria, Finland, Norway and  Sweden. The Edinburgh European Council set a target for the  entry of these four applicants into the EU by 1 January 1995.</p>

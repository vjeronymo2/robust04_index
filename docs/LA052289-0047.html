			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ATHLETICS ARE WINNING DIFFERENTLY THIS SEASON  </P> <P> At this time last season, the Oakland Athletics were already well on their way  to claiming the American League pennant. They were winning games with pitching  and the hitting of the Bash Brothers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.  </P> <P> They had a 29-14 record after 43 games and were leading the West by seven  games.  </P> <P> This season, half of the Bash Brothers tandem -- Canseco, who hit 42 homers and  stole 40 bases -- hasn't played a game because of a wrist injury, and although  they lead the West, they are unable to distance themselves from the Angels  </P> <P> Interestingly, even though teams are pitching around McGwire, the Athletics  have an identical record (29-14) after 43 games.  </P> <P> Instead of winning with power hitting, the Athletics have had to scratch out  runs and depend even more on their strong pitching staff.  </P> <P> Dave Parker snapped a tie with a bases loaded single in a four-run fourth  inning Sunday at Oakland and the Athletics held on for a 5-4 victory over the  Boston Red Sox to beat Roger Clemens (5-3) and remain a game ahead of the  Angels.  </P> <P> On a day when Curt Young didn't have his best stuff, young Todd Burns pitched a  strong 3 2/3 2/3 innings to improve his record to 3-0 and Dennis Eckersley  pitched a hitless ninth inning to get his 14th save.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy with my batting average (.251), but I am contributing," Parker  said. "We know that with McGwire in the lineup, we will get more pitches to  hit. I'm starting to see the ball better."  </P> <P> Parker, who drove in two runs in Saturday's victory, has raised his average 40  points and has driven in 10 runs in the last nine games.  </P> <P> About the only time Eckersley is noticed is the rare occasion in which he gives  up a run instead of getting a save. He did it in spectacular fashion Friday  night, serving up a grand slam to Dwight Evans that won the game for the Red  Sox.  </P> <P> Sunday, Evans hit his sixth home run in the second inning as the Red Sox gave  Clemens a 3-0 lead. Ordinarily, that's all the brilliant right-hander needs.  But not this time. He went the distance, yielding seven hits while walking  four.  </P> <P> Cleveland 2, Baltimore 0 -- It wasn't a victory, but after his first start in  two seasons, Brian Holton could smile.  </P> <P> As a relief pitcher last season, Holton played a part in the Dodgers drive to  the National League pennant and the world championship. For the Dodgers, he was  7-3 and had an earned-run average of 1.70. In six innings of postseason play he  gave up only one run.  </P> <P> Now 30, Holton was not unhappy that he was included in the trade with the  Orioles that sent Eddie Murray to the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Sunday at Baltimore, in his first chance to start, Holton went six innings,  giving up eight hits, but no earned runs. His record fell to 1-4.  </P> <P> His downfall came in the third inning when Felix Fermin reached on third  baseman Craig Worthington's error. It was the first error by an Oriole  infielder since Worthington committed one April 30. One run scored on two  singles and the other when right fielder Steve Finley made a wild throw trying  to double up a runner at first base after he made a fine catch.  </P> <P> "That's baseball," Holton said. "We're not going to be shut out every game. I  know I'll get rewarded later on. I feel pretty good."  </P> <P> New York 6, Seattle 2 -- Rookie Clay Parker, in just his third major league  start, pitched a five-hitter and struck out 10 at Seattle to beat his former  teammates.  </P> <P> Parker, a 26-year-old right-hander obtained in a trade for outfielder Henry  Cotto, took a shutout into the ninth.  </P> <P> He lost it when Scott Bradley singled and Ken Griffey, Jr. hit a line drive  that bounced off the head of diving center fielder Roberto Kelly for an  inside-the-park homer. It was the sixth home run for the talented rookie.  </P> <P> The Yankees beat ace left-hander Mark Langston, who is rumored to be on the  trading block. Langston (4-5) allowed eight hits and five runs in 6 2/3  innings.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, Texas 1 -- Although he had an 0-2 record, Twins' Manager Tom Kelly  thought Francisco Oliveras deserved another chance.  </P> <P> Olivares reponded by giving up only four hits in seven innings at Arlington,  Tex., to win his first major league game.  </P> <P> Detroit 4, Kansas City 2 -- Fred Lynn broke out of a season-long slump with  three hits, including a two-run double at Detroit to lead the Tigers to a  three-game sweep of the Royals. The Tigers are 3-0 since Manager Sparky  Anderson was sent home to rest.  </P> <P> Going into the game, Lynn was batting only .191.  </P> <P> Toronto 9, Chicago 3 -- The Blue Jays are starting to score runs, and they are  winning under interim manager Cito Gaston. They pounded out 12 hits at Chicago  to give them a 5-1 record since Gaston took over.  </P> <P> Nelson Liriano had three hits, including a go-ahead double in the sixth. He is  now nine for 11 in his hot streak.  </P> <P> George Bell and Ernie Whitt hit homers in the ninth and John Cerutti won for  the first time since last July. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Pal </F> Lederer and Gyula L. Ortutay; place and date not given: "I Am  One of the Star Witnesses"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Rumors spread  months ago about a closed meeting in which you said that,  regardless of the election results, the Foreign Ministry will  essentially remain in the hands of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF]. Do you confirm these rumors? If so, on what did  you base your opinion then?    [Jeszenszky] This happened about six to nine months ago, and  it was hardly a secret, because NEPSZABADSAG also mentioned it  after a few days. I said then that no one should think that the  future election results were clear and the MDF can be discarded.  I am still convinced that, six months ago, no one could  responsibly predict the present results. I counted on a more  balanced result at the elections, with good chances for the MDF  also to retain the Foreign Ministry. Naturally, this no longer  seems probable. My prediction was that, with a few percent  difference, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz], and the MDF would largely fare equally. If this had  actually taken place, the MDF would have been justified in  demanding the Foreign Ministry because foreign policy has been  one of the strong points of the party, thanks to Jozsef Antall's  strategic thinking and to the activity carried out here.  [passage omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] According to recent news, at the request of  the Czech Government, the Institute of International Relations  in Prague prepared a report on potential dangers and included  here its concepts regarding Greater Hungary.    [Jeszenszky] And Greater Germany too....    [NEPSZABADSAG] Was this report timed for the Balladur  conference in Paris?    [Jeszenszky] I cannot tell whether the timing was accidental  or deliberate. I have not yet heard about this institute. As  for the aforementioned formulation, it is rather propagandistic;  so far, we have only been able to hear about Greater Hungary  programs from Romania. This term is not even used in Hungary;  in professional circles, we use mostly the term "historical." I  do not think that one can find a program from recent years which  includes the creation of Greater Hungary. My answer to this is  that Greater Europe is the goal in Hungary's program.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In your opinion, has the Hungarian Foreign  Ministry done everything in its power to reduce the lack of  confidence prevailing in the neighboring countries?    [Jeszenszky] One can always find faults. Obviously, it is  impossible to fulfill every expectation. At the same time, I  have a good conscience about the last five years of the foreign  policy thinking of the present Hungarian Government. I know  what we said and what we did. We are talking about a consistent  line. Today, I regard the same things as necessary as in 1989.  I know that opinions have been voiced lately, particularly in  the election campaign, according to which the Hungarian  Government has contributed to this lack of confidence with its  statements and other things. I think one could not have done  more for building confidence. As early as at the beginning of  my office, I wanted to visit these countries, and I managed to  call on Belgrade, Zagreb, Prague, Bratislava, and naturally  Vienna in the first ten weeks. My visit to Bucharest would also  have taken place much earlier, if some events in the Romanian  Parliament had not occurred.    Irrespective of my meetings, the rapprochement of nations  along the Danube has always been my great desire. We signed  basic treaties with three states where the situation of ethnic  Hungarians has been settled through parliamentary legislation,  namely with Ukraine, Croatia, and Slovenia. The  Slovenian-Hungarian agreement on minority rights is an example,  and we are ready to sign such an agreement with any of our  neighbors, and this would be a good incentive for the basic  treaty. We have offered this to all our neighbors. These are  the facts; the rest is only interpretation. [passage omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you regard as your major personal  failure and success in your position as foreign minister?    [Jeszenszky] I am sorry that we did not succeed in creating  harmonious relations with all our neighbors, but I do not have  to regard this as my personal failure, because this did not  depend on my personal attitude or on that of the government. I  am dissatisfied with our contacts with the society, and this  equally refers to foreign policy and the government in general.  For example, in 1992, I had the opportunity to speak in detail  about Hungary's foreign policy problems and the foreign policy  issues of this area on Japanese television. There are very few  programs in the Hungarian Television in which one can explain in  detail what is happening in foreign politics. As for our  successes, I would mention the peace partnership with NATO and  the fact that Hungarian diplomacy did a lot for the content of  this partnership to improve compared with the original ideas. I  find it extremely important that we signed treaties with  Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on the same day on 6 December  1991, and with the EC ten days later. These are mostly results  of common thoughts and common action, but Hungarian diplomacy  played a considerable role in making many people and many  countries have a good impression about Hungary. We succeeded in  bringing a lot of excellent people into the Hungarian diplomacy,  and we succeeded in developing a ministry that functions well.  Perhaps this is what I regard as our major achievement.</p>

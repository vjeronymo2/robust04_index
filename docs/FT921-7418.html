			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: We need educating on equities - Serious Money THE GREAT and the good backed the formation this week of ProShare, an organisation devoted to the creation of a 'nation of shareholders'. But the average saver could be forgiven for being confused. The government's privatisation campaigns may have widened the shareholding public, with the number of private investors growing from 3m to 11m during the years of Tory rule. But 54 per cent of those investors own shares in just one company. Only about 330,000 people own shares in 11 or more companies - in other words only 3 per cent have built up a diversified portfolio. Here is the confusion. Many experts would argue that the most sensible way for the private investor to hold equities is via a spread of holdings. Take the Consumers' Association's excellent guide, Which Way to Save and Invest? It says: 'Because of buying and selling costs, it doesn't make sense to invest small amounts in shares - less than about Pounds 1,500, say. So to get a good spread - of say five to ten shares  - you'd need about Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 15,000.' Plenty of Weekend FT readers will fall into this category, which is why we write so much about share investment. But large numbers will not. So does it make sense to aim for a 'nation of shareholders'? It is one thing to encourage employees to hold shares in the companies they work for, as a means both of fostering esprit de corps and of encouraging key staff to remain. The incentives for this are all in place; to date, however, companies have tended to concentrate on executive schemes. Even employee schemes, however, have dangers. An employee who holds large numbers of shares in a company that goes bust loses both his job and his savings. How about shares in other people's companies? Privatisations, where the government strains every nerve and sinew to ensure the issue is a success, are a special case. Indeed, one could argue that the small saver is wily enough to realise this, which is why he has stuck to privatised stocks. One must also wonder whether many people are either just too cautious or just too impatient to invest in equities. ProShare's presentation this week included a graph showing how a portfolio of shares easily outperformed a building society over the 1980s. Indeed, it is perfectly fair to point out that, over the vast majority of ten-year periods, equities have pipped other assets. If ProShare were a unit trust, of course, it would be obliged to show a five-year performance record. Readers may recall how we showed how an investment in a building society easily pipped the FT-A All share and the FT-SE 100 Indices over the five years to January 1992. I suspect that most people view five years as quite a long term to hold an investment. Certainly, the FT has received many letters from those disillusioned with the performance of their PEPs after two or three years. What can also disillusion people is that the neat figures for equity performance shown by share enthusiasts are based on the indices. Few investors match the indices' performance. Some do better; but a lot do worse, because of the heavy costs (commissions, buy-sell spreads, tax) of dealing, and the difficulties of stock selection. Indded, there is another potential Catch 22 in this area. Part of the drive to encourage wider share ownership has centred on the need to bring down brokers' commissions, which seems a laudable enough aim. The snag is that the easiest way to offer cheap commissions is to run a dealing-only service with no advice. But surely advice is exactly what the small investor most needs? For all these reasons, we have tended to urge small investors who want to be involved in equities to opt for unit and investment trusts. Not only do these bring instant diversification, but they are very accessible for those who want to invest, say, Pounds 25 a month. Most private client stockbrokers will place a client with Pounds 20,000 or so into unit and investment trusts, rather than opt for a full-blown equity portfolio. Few could claim they are perfect. Over the past five years, the charges levied by the unit trusts, in particular, have got higher while their performance, relative to the indices, has been poor. It would be wonderful if we could import the American family of 'no load' (in other words, no initial charge) funds, which aim to meet the index. But the enthusiasts for wider share ownership are rather sniffy about unit and investment trusts. They are not the 'real thing', since they only give the investor a diluted taste of capitalism. It is perfectly fair for ProShare to seek to lobby on behalf of the small investor and to educate more people about the risks and rewards of share ownership. The spin-off Private Investor Association, which will be launched in May, will be worth a look. No doubt there are many Weekend FT readers who would reap long-term rewards if they shifted just some of their portfolios out of the building society and into equities. But I have the sneaking suspicion that if savers were properly educated about the nature of equities, some existing shareholders might be alarmed by the risks they have assumed. The net effect of ProShare's activities might paradoxically be to reduce the total number of shareholders.</p>

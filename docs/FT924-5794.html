			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd lauds victories won in EC RADICAL changes in the operation of the European Community would flow from the British presidency which will end next month, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, claimed in the Commons last night. More decisions would be taken at national level, he explained. He insisted that the part played by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in opening the way for a wider agreement on liberalising world trade - and the steps taken to ensure a single European market by the start of next year - would be seen as 'massive achievements'. Mr Hurd dismissed remarks by 'flustered' French politicians attacking the ineffectiveness of the British presidency and urged Labour MPs to be more careful in expressing similar sentiments. That did not deter Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, from arguing that the humiliating and total collapse of government policies in the wake of sterling's forced withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism had put Britain on the 'sideline in Europe'. He ended an appraisal of the achievements of the British presidency, based on the benchmarks set by the government itself, by awarding one mark out of 10. Labour MPs encouraged Mr Nick Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South-West when he complained that the whips had used a 'hard ball' when seeking to contain the recent revolt by Tory backbenchers over the Maastricht treaty when the government survived by just three votes. Tory backbench supporters of the prime minister's stance accused Mr Budgen of 'whingeing' when he complained that because of his decision to vote against the government Conservative party officials had sought to cause trouble for him in his constituency party. Mr Hurd welcomed the support given by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for the British initiative to ensure that more decisions were taken at national level through the so-called 'subsidiarity' procedure. He looked forward to decisions being taken at next month's EC summit in Edinburgh on the criteria and procedures for applying the subsidiarity test. Mr Hurd told those who feared the development of a federal Europe that, far from Britain being beleaguered in resisting an inexorable movement towards a European super-state, the tide was flowing in the opposite direction.</p>

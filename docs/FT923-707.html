			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE GLOOMY outlook for the UK economy led to a downbeat session in trading in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The market looked set for a strong day's business when the first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,700. This however proved to be the session's high point - the contract then went into retreat and by mid-morning was trading some 15 points below its opening level as worries over the economy surfaced. Sporadic buying around lunchtime helped bring about a brief rally in December before the sellers once again gained the upper hand. The poor performance on Wall Street only served to increase the downward trend in the contract. December closed at 2,650, down 33 on its previous close and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was a reasonable 9,461 lots. The volume in traded options reached 32,100 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,848 lots. BP was the most active stock option, trading 2,129 contracts, followed by GEC at 2,048.</p>

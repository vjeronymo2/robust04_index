			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / US preparing guidelines to prevent environmental racism The Clinton administration is preparing guidelines that would insert questions of environmental equity into decisions on all US government programmes. The guidelines would require federal agencies to make sure that their programmes do not inflict an unfair degree of environmental damage on poor communities or on racial minorities. They respond to growing complaints from civil rights leaders that pollution disproportionately affects minorities. A 1987 report by the Commission on Racial Justice found a pattern of 'environmental racism' in the siting of toxic waste dumps and incinerators, concluding that most of the largest and most dangerous landfills in the US were in communities with majority black or Hispanic populations. Mr Benjamin Chavis, who headed that commission, has since taken over as head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the US's oldest and largest civil rights organisation, and has taken the lead in urging that more attention should be paid to environmental equity issues in, for example, the reform of the Superfund law on toxic waste clean-ups. A subsequent report by the Environmental Protection Agency, however, concluded that although ethnic minorities were likely to be more exposed to hazardous chemicals, the pattern was determined less by race than by poverty. But community groups have filed racial discrimination suits to complain about the siting of incinerators and other treatment facilities in minority neighbourhoods, and the state of Louisiana last month cited concerns about environmental racism in refusing a permit for the construction of a toxic waste plant in a mostly black area. 'It's unfair to allow black communities to feel we are more lax in looking at permits in their areas than anywhere else,' said Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. Earlier this month the Clinton administration proposed the creation of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) fund paid for by the insurance industry as part of its overhaul of the Superfund laws. The draft legislation would also set up a new form of arbitration process for allocating responsibility for cleaning up waste sites, under the auspices of an independent expert.</p>

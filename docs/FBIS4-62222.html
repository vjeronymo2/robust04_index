			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fedor Sizyy report: "There Was No Portfolio for Minister </F> Travkin"]    [Text] It is no longer possible to find Nikolay Ilich  Travkin in Shakhovskiy Rayon. He has left for Moscow, his  secretary replied on the telephone. But to all appearances  member of the Government, Minister N. Travkin, appointed on the  eve of the holidays by Russian presidential edict, still does  not have a working position in the capital. Just try finding a  brand-new member of the government when you do not know what  range of issues he has actually been put in charge of. Maybe,  with his Hero of Socialist Labor medal, he is in charge of  construction? Or maybe, knowing that he is closely associated  with Stanislav Govorukhin, he is in charge of the fight against  corruption?    A polite tenor voice over the telephone from the president's  press service passed me on to his government colleagues:  "Travkin has been appointed one of their number, after all."  There were no further explanations.    At the government press service a surprised female voice  replied: "What, has he actually been appointed?" On the off  chance, I phoned around several more numbers of the service  whose name anyway indicates absolutely clear tasks -- the public  relations department. It is staggering that no one could tell  me anything sensible. In my search for Minister N. Travkin in  the vast "White House" labyrinths I resolved to perform an  almost heroic act and phoned the office of Government Apparatus  Leader V. Kvasov. His assistant promised to help me collect the  necessary information. Alas, after exactly one hour I was  handed on yet again -- to Sergey Surov, deputy section chief at  the government press center.    "It was not the government apparatus that prepared the  edict.  What is more, it says that Travkin has been appointed a member  of the government but certainly not a minister. We have no  comment to make," S. Surov replied.    [Sizyy] "Is this appointment a surprise to you?"    [Surov] "Let's say yes. But I do not believe that the  matter is closed yet. I think that you could get some kind of  explanation from the president's staff," S. Surov said, bidding  me good-bye.    People are now saying that Nikolay Travkin is the first  minister without portfolio in modern Russian government history.  And that his appointment has a direct connection with the  Democratic Party of Russia leader's signing of the agreement on  national accord. Meaning that the Russian Government is becoming  a government of "those in accord."</p>

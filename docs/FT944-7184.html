			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bad loans continue to hit Japan's banks Rising interest rates, falling demand for bank lending and the continuing need to write off bad loans combined to produce another grim reporting period for Japan's leading banks in the six months to the end of September. Aggregate pre-tax profits at the 11 'city' banks, the country's main retail banks, fell by more than 40 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Operating profit from the banks' core business activities declined by 6 per cent. During the period both short-term and long-term interest rates ended their three-year decline and since the summer have been rising steadily. The structure of the city banks' assets and liabilities means that their borrowing costs change more quickly than the rates at which they lend. As rates began to rise, therefore, their already wafer-thin margins were squeezed further. Worse, in spite of gradual economic recovery, demand for bank lending remains depressed as companies continue to adjust their balance sheets to rid themselves of the over-accumulation of capital investment in the late 1980s. Total lending by the main banks has been registering consistent monthly falls for the last six months. The slump in demand caused a fall in combined operating revenues of 5 per cent from a year earlier to Y10,602bn (Dollars 108m). At the pre-tax level, banks continued to suffer sharp falls as a result of their belated, but increasingly aggressive, provisioning for bad loans. Write-offs of non-performing loans were Y1,340.8bn, up by 35 per cent on a year earlier. The total of disclosed outstanding non-performing loans was Y8,726bn, down by Y222bn from the end of March. However, these figures include only loans to bankrupt customers and loans on which no interest has been received for at least six months. They do not include restructured loans, where interest rates have been cut to keep borrowers afloat. Many analysts believe that if these figures were added to the disclosed bad loan figure, total non-performing loans would double. Most banks continued to offset the damaging effects of the write-offs on their profits by selling part of their substantial holdings of equities in other companies. The largest six banks sold stocks on average to the value of two-thirds of their write-offs of bad loans. Without such sales profits would have been substantially lower. Against the trend, and analysts' expectations, two of the city banks managed to report increases in pre-tax profits. Sakura Bank, which has one of the highest proportions of non-performing loans on its books, saw pre-tax profits rise by 15 per cent to Y40.6bn. However, two factors helped the bank's performance: it sold the largest amount of equities of any of the banks - a total of Y153bn - and at the same time wrote off a smaller proportion of its bad loans. As a result the bank's disclosed bad loans, at Y1,446bn, are still above 4 per cent of its total loans. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which saw pre-tax profits rise by 24 per cent to Y25.5bn, also wrote off a relatively small amount of non-performing loans. The unique treatment of bad loans by Japanese banks was challenged in the wake of the mid-term results by a senior managing director at the largest bank. Mr Yoshifumo Nishikawa, of Sumitomo Bank, said it was time for banks to be more open about their non-performing loan totals and to move in to line with international practice by disclosing the real totals including restructured loans. Sumitomo has been the quickest of the banks to acknowledge the scale of its bad loans, and yesterday announced that it had written off Y196.7bn in the six months to September, and planned to write off an additional Y300bn in the second half of the year, compared with Y228.4bn for the whole of the previous financial year. The depressed lending market forced most banks to forecast substantial falls in operating, pre-tax and net profits for the full year to next March. The backlog of bad loans is likely to take several years to clear.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lvov -- UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense] held a news conference  on 12 April at its oblast branch headquarters on the results of  the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The oblast UNA  chairman, Andriy Shkil, told journalists that UNA-UNSO fulfilled  its minimum program in the election and now has three  representatives in parliament. Two of them, Oleh Vitovych and  Yaroslav Ilyasevych, were elected in Lvov oblast, the other,  Yuriy Tyma, in Ternopol. "Our deputies will not join permanent  alliances in the new parliament, but will cooperate and align  with certain forces on certain decisions and appointments. We  will cooperate with all forces, including Communists and  Socialists, on crucial issues of nation-building," said Andriy  Shkil.    A UNSO area commander, Ukraine People's Deputy Oleh  Vitovych,  said he believes that "one of the first issues to be raised in  parliament is the division of powers. There will be  disagreements regarding the need for a presidential election,  the functions of the Supreme Council, its speaker, the  president, and who will form the government. It is difficult to  imagine what ideas or tactics can bring together people of  different political views on these priority issues with respect  to putting an end to the plundering of Ukraine, boosting  production development, and, most important, preserving  Ukraine's territorial integrity."    Predicting the course of the future political struggle, the  news conference organizers agreed that the main threat to the  young state is posed by the "red directors", with their sights  firmly set on Moscow. Oleh Vitovych also warned against  excessive excitement over the western standards. In his  opinion, neither the Moscow, nor the Western model of societal  development is acceptable to Ukraine. It should rely on its own  resources and potential.    The news conference also noted that UNA-UNSO plans to be  most  active in the local elections. Andriy Shkil said that the UNA  leadership will consult experts in the near future to determine  its campaign strategy and tactics.    All of the journalists' questions were answered, except one:  "Will UNA-UNSO deputies come to the parliament session in the  camouflage military uniforms they normally wear, or will they  perhaps wear something more civilian?" This question is yet to  be discussed.</p>

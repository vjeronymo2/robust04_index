			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / EC monitor team pulls out from 'dangerous' Sarajevo EUROPEAN Community monitors withdrew from Sarajevo yesterday, declaring it was too dangerous to remain in the war-torn capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although local Serb leaders later declared a five-day unilateral ceasefire in Bosnia, the EC monitors' pull-out signalled pessimism about peace prospects in the breakaway Yugoslav republic. Serb irregulars, backed by the Yugoslav federal army, yesterday again pounded the capital, where the main television transmitter was knocked out. The army also continued to bombard the south-western city of Mostar, while Croat and Serb militias fought for control of a swathe of territory bordering Croatia. The ceasefire, due to start at 6am today, was called by an unofficial Serb parliament at a meeting in Banja Luka, north-west of Sarajevo. The Serb leaders called on the EC to renew its Yugoslav peace conference before the five-day ceasefire came to an end. If the EC failed to act, local Serbs would appeal to Serbs throughout the world to join them 'in their struggle for survival', they said. The EC pull-out coincided with other steps to isolate Serbia in an attempt to increase pressure for peace between the warring Yugoslav ethnic groups. The 52-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe decided in Helsinki to exclude the new Serb-dominated Yugoslav state from any decisions taken on Bosnia. Russia had earlier rejected excluding Yugoslavia from the CSCE. In addition, the US withdrew its ambassador from Belgrade, the Serbian capital, to protest at Serbian involvement in Bosnia. EC foreign ministers agreed to withdraw their ambassadors from Belgrade earlier in the week. More than 1,300 people have been killed, and more than 500,000 displaced or made homeless since the federal army attacked Bosnia after it was recognised by the international community six weeks ago. In London, Lord Carrington, chairman of the peace conference on Yugoslavia, said he was increasingly pessimistic about any successful outcome of the conference. He said: 'It looks even more unlikely that, in the present circumstances, a peace conference would be successful.' Lord Carrington rejected secret talks held last week between Bosnia's Serb and Croat leaders in which they planned to divide Bosnia, eventually annexing parts of it to Croatia and Serbia. He said this was 'basically a carve-up of Bosnia-Hercegovina and that, of course, would be quite unacceptable to the Community because it leaves the Moslems, who are the majority, out in the cold'. In Geneva, a UN envoy described Bosnia as 'a state of horror.' Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce, an official at the UN's High Commission for Refugees, said: 'What we are seeing is something like the Second World War with population centres being destroyed and towns and villages attacked, not as military objects, but with the sole purpose of driving the people away.' In Croatia, there is growing concern that the federal army, which still controls parts of eastern Croatia, is deliberately delaying the deployment of UN peace-keeping troops in the region.</p>

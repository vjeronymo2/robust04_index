			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Bets may have to be hedged after DIY downturn - Ladbroke It would be a brave gambler that took a bet against Ladbroke announcing its return to the UK casino business when interim results are announced on Thursday. Less certain is the extent to which the group will suffer from a downturn at its DIY chain, Texas Homecare. Ladbroke is expected to announce a 31 per cent drop in group pre-tax profits before exceptionals to about Pounds 43m. Much of the pain from Texas was taken in the second half of last year, when the group restated its profits. This leaves Ladbroke's 1994 first half competing against a period when profits were inflated by including potential rebates from suppliers for unsold goods. Analysts are looking for Texas to return profits of about Pounds 3.9m, against more than Pounds 15m last time. The UK hotels business will show some pick up, but depressed trading in continental Europe may offset that. Analysts and investors are keeping their fingers crossed for a pleasant surprise in the betting business. Rumours abound of a sharp upturn in credit betting during May and June. Expectations are that this will leave the betting business at least as good as last year's Pounds 40.5m, and perhaps even better. While the dividend is likely to come down from 4.9p to 2.5p, this has been widely expected since the drastic cut at the year-end. Overall, analysts expect the full-year dividend to be higher than last year's reduced payout of 6p, down 46 per cent. The real interest in these results, however, will be the expected announcement of the purchase of three London casinos for about Pounds 50m. Ladbroke needs the acquisition if it is to get into the rapidly growing US gambling market. Approval by the UK authorities, which expelled Ladbrokes 15 years ago, would give the group the credibility it needs in the US and abroad.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low at Pounds 12m aided by property gain Shares in Wm Low jumped by 9p to 147p yesterday, after the Dundee-based grocery retailer announced an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 12.1m and said margins were stabilising. Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, said that while price competition had knocked 0.5 per cent off the company's gross margin in the 28 weeks to March 19, an 'element of stability' had returned to the market. 'Everyone has looked over the precipice, seen what is down below, and decided they don't like it,' he said. Wm Low had been hit by price competition sparked off by J Sainsbury's 'Essential for essentials' promotion which began last October, as well as by discounters such as Shoprite. But price pressure had eased recently. The profits figure was flattered by a Pounds 5.03m exceptional gain on property disposals, including the Coatbridge retail park. Operating profits actually declined from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 8.53m, due partly to one-off store closure costs of Pounds 600,000 and costs of Pounds 200,000 covering redundancies at head office. The interest charge increased from Pounds 655,000 to Pounds 1.48m. Mr Spicer said the company was starting to benefit from economies of scale after closing smaller, underperforming stores. It had closed its remaining 12 small stores, and opened four larger stores. The average size of its 56 stores was now 16,500 sq ft. Total sales increased by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 246m (Pounds 240m), thanks to an 8.2 per cent increase from new stores. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.7p. Earnings per share increased to 15p (13.34p) basic and from 12.01p to 13.23p fully diluted. COMMENT Yesterday's news from Wm Low was somewhat brighter than its gloomy January trading statement - as reflected by the share price reaction. Its claim that stability was returning to the market echoed those of the big superstore groups. But Scotland, a focus for expansion by both discounters and the large multiples, will become increasingly competitive, and Wm Low could be squeezed in the middle. With a low-key expansion programme in a low-growth, low-inflation environment, Wm Low can hope for slow earnings growth at best. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 15m, excluding the property gain, put the shares on a multiple of 8.5, a discount to the sector which reflects the unexciting prospects.</p>

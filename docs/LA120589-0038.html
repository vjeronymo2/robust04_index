			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 23 INJURED IN TOXIC LEAK AT MEDICAL LAB  </P> <P> A leak of toxic liquid at a North Hollywood medical laboratory injured 23  people Monday and forced the evacuation of 200 employees, authorities said.  </P> <P> Several dozen firefighters, a hazardous-materials team and three ambulances  were dispatched to the Kaiser Permanente medical laboratory in the 10000 block  of Magnolia Boulevard about 10:20 a.m. after employees reported the leak, said  Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.  </P> <P> Sixteen people were treated at the scene for headaches, burning eyes, sore  throats and nausea, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> Seven others were taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank and Valley  Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys for treatment and were later released,  hospital spokeswomen said.  </P> <P> It was discovered that Freon, a clear, nonflammable liquid used in  refrigeration and air-conditioning units -- had leaked from a freezer inside a  storage room at the lab, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> Freon contains a series of fluorocarbon compounds that, if inhaled in large  amounts, can be fatal, said Dr. Mark Bayer of the Los Angeles County Regional  Poison Control Center.  </P> <P> The leak was contained to the storage room and employees were allowed back  inside the building shortly after noon, said Kaiser spokesman Allan Mann.  </P></p>

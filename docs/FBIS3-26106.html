Some dinosaurs collapse under their own weight  or, as the Chinese say, because the "overall climate" has  changed to the extent that oxygen and nutrients are hard to come  by. Others suffer the painful fate of incremental atrophy by  sheer force of irrelevance.    Last week, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) [CPC] put up a  valiant effort to prevent its Propaganda Department and related  yamens from going the way of absolute monarchy and primogeniture.    In the largest gathering of specialists in propaganda,  ideology, culture and the media since 1957, top cadres including  President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Propaganda Chief Ding  Guangen spoke about ushering in a new era of propaganda through  "the further liberation of thought" and "upholding the  construction of spiritual civilisation".    As the custodians of Marxism, however, CCP chieftains should  know that construction makes up only half of social engineering.  The other equally crucial half consists of destruction the  planned obsolescence of institutions that seem, to use Hong Kong  slang, to be obstructing the movement of the Earth.    The problem with an administration as intent on guarding its  turf as the CCP is that its accent has always been on  "construction", preservation, and aggrandisement.    On the economic side, this has resulted in up to two-thirds  of state enterprises and conglomerates dripping in red Ink.    Even before the June 4 crackdown in 1989, patriarch Deng  Xiaoping had emphasised the double-pronged strategy of economic  construction on the one hand, and the erection of the  police-state apparatus and "socialist spiritual civilisation" on  the other.    This "both fists be tough" credo, especially since mid-1989,  has resulted in a mushrooming of propaganda-related units, what  cynics call ideological or thought police whose task is to keep  out Western spiritual opium such as democratic ideals.    Aside from the Propaganda Department itself, other units  such  as the Culture Ministry, the Ministry of Radio, Film and  Television, state news agencies and publishing houses, as well  as departments responsible for overseas propaganda, held  strategy sessions last week to map plans for the 90s.    The agenda of these closed-door conclaves was how to  maintain  discipline in the ideological, media and cultural arenas after  Mr Deng's demise. For example, precautions are being taken to  suppress calls for political liberalisation that might appear in  the more racy provincial papers.    While addressing the conclaves, President Jiang indicated  "propaganda and ideological work" should consist of "using  scientific theories to arm people; correct press opinion to  guide people; lofty spirit to mould people; and superior  artistic creations to energise people".    In his remarks, Mr Deng pledged the party would give up such  Cultural Revolution-vintage measures as "mass movements" and  "large-scale criticism campaigns" to enforce orthodoxy. "We  will implement principles of democracy and the goal of guidance  through respecting and understanding people, showing them  concern and arousing their enthusiasm," he said.    Most of the time, however, the ideologues did not bother to  hide behind this veil of heavy-handed patronage and noblesse  oblige. In his talk to the propagandists, Premier Li demanded  that editors "guard against one-sidedness" and "provide a  correct guide to public opinion" . Presumably, a Chinese  journalist would be guilty of "one-sidedness" if his reports  fail to show the party in the best light.    Mr Deng came directly to the point in an unpublicised series  of "dos and don'ts" he issued last weekend. "Give help (to the  party), do not add confusion; sing the leitmotif (of socialism,  patriotism, collectivism) and avoid cacophony; pay attention to  social benefits and not the profit motive; observe propaganda  discipline and do not go your own way;sharpen your focus and do  not dissipate your energy, work hard at materialising your goals  and do not just go for show."    Mr Deng did not elaborate on what constituted "cacophony" or  "confusion". Yet Chinese media watchers said that his edicts  were in essence no different from those endorsed by a similarly  large-scale propaganda conclave in 1957, whose purpose was to  launch the infamous Anti-Rightist Campaign by ridding the media  and cultural scene of "poisonous weeds".    As the commissars were holding forth on the need to cleave  to  a reform and open-door policy in the media, authorities in  Shanghai last week closed down four financial tabloids suspected  of fanning speculation on the local bourse.    Restrictions on co-operative ventures with Hong Kong and  foreign media and cultural companies were tightened even as the  ban on the reception of international satellite TV programmes  continued. In spite of Mr Deng's commitment to "using well the  modern mass media", his department has killed uncountable  proposals by enterprising cadres and businessmen to start  quasi-private newspapers, magazines and TV stations.    It never crossed the mind of the ideological inspectors  that,  six years shy of the 21st century, it would no longer do for a  propaganda machine which reports to only one faction of a  political party with a declining number of practising members to  tell a nation of 1.15 billion what to read and what to watch on  television.    Or perhaps the incongruity has become apparent even to  cadres  inured to the mores of the Yanan caves. In a conversation in  English between the politburo's leading linguist, Mr Jiang, and  Political Consultative Conference member Israel Epstein a year  ago, the President expressed dissatisfaction that the Chinese  word xuanchuan ("to publicise, propagate, and conduct  propaganda") had invariably been translated as propaganda. "Can  we look for a more neutral, less stilted (English) term?" Mr  Jiang reportedly asked.    The fault, however, is with the party. Since the 30s, CCP's  translators have identified their Xuanchuan Bu as the Propaganda  Department, and its work as making propaganda. Some  bourgeois-liberal wags within the party have suggested  converting the Xuanchuan Bu into a Public Relations Department.  But then PR professionals do not usually take such draconian  steps as banning books or kicking avant-garde writers out of  political parties.</p>

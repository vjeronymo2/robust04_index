			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS: BY TRAIN THROUGH THE AMERICAS  BY PAUL THEROUX (HOUGHTON-MIFFLIN: $9.95)  </P> <P> At a time when airlines emphasize the speed with which they transport people,  Paul Theroux argues that traveling should be an end in itself: "We have become  used to life being a series of arrivals or departures, of triumphs and  failures, with nothing noteworthy in between." His descriptions of the Latin  American railways -- both the gleaming modern marvels and the dilapidated  wrecks -- are vivid and evocative. Curiously, he never seems to like the places  he visits or the people he meets in his travels: He maintains a disdainful  superiority, like a minister's wife accepting a contribution from the local  madame. The results are interesting, but cold; from Boston to Patagonia,  Theroux observes life without partaking of it.  </P></p>

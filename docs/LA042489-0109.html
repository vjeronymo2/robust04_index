			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOHNSON'S THERAPIST TESTIFIES ON STEROID USE  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's physiotherapist admitted today that he administered what he  believed were muscle-building steroids to Canadian athletes but said he never  discussed the topic with Johnson, his teammates or the doctor who supplied the  banned drugs.  </P> <P> Waldemar Matuszewski, a surprise witness at the federal inquiry into drug use  in amateur sport, said he assumed the chemicals he administered were steroids  but never confirmed that with Dr. Jamie Astaphan, Johnson's physician.  </P> <P> "I never asked, but I knew," Matuszewski told the inquiry. "Only steroids would  build muscles like that."  </P> <P> Speaking with a heavy Polish accent, the Warsaw-born Matuszewski, 42, gave a  confusing story in which he denied allegations made in earlier testimony that  he was part of widespread cheating by Johnson and his Canadian teammates.  </P> <P> Matuszewski also denied that he had injected steroids into Italy's top  sprinter, Pierfrancesco Pavoni, in Toronto in the fall of 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Testimony Disputed  </P> <P> Pavoni has also described testimony by retired Canadian sprinter Mike  Sokolowski as "absolutely false."  </P> <P> Sokolowski admitted using steroids and said he saw Matuszewski give Pavoni an  injection.  </P> <P> Inquiry spokesmen said last week that Peter Dajia, a shot putter once kicked  off Canada's Commonwealth Games team for failing a drug test, would be the  first witness when the inquiry resumed after a weeklong break.  </P> <P> Also expected to testify was hurdler Mark McKoy, one of Johnson's closest  friends who left the Seoul Olympics last year after the star sprinter tested  positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol and was suspended from  international competition for two years.  </P> <P> The commission does not adhere to a rigid hearing schedule, but spokeswoman  Barbara Fox said the current plans are for three weeks of testimony from  athletes, doctors and drug companies before the next recess.  </P> <P> Dajia, 25, who attended the University of Texas, tested positive for steroids  at the trials for the 1986 Commonwealth Games and was suspended from the  Canadian team.  </P></p>

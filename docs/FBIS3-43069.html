Morozov, chief of  Administration of Educational Institutions, addendum to Order No  23 of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, dated 17 Feb 93]    [Text]  <H5>  General statutes </H5>   1. Clinical residence is a part of the multilevel structure  of higher medical education in the Russian Federation, a form of  continuous professional education of physicians at higher  medical educational institutions and research institutions,  medical departments of universities, institutes for advanced  training of physicians, which is carried out in order to train  or retrain specialists, as well as to upgrade their  qualifications.    2. The right of institutions mentioned in Item 1 to train  physicians in the form of clinical residency is granted by the  Russian Federation Ministry of Health upon submittal of  appropriate petition, excerpt from the record of decision of the  scientific council and description of basic equipment of the  institution with subsequent licensing of such institution.    3. The main object of having physicians take clinical  residencies is to train highly qualified specialists for  independent work in health care agencies and institutions, or in  private practice.    4. Clinical residents are trained according to specialties  specified in the existing ``List of medical specialties,'' and  in accordance with the curriculum and syllabus for each  specialty. According to the Russian Federation Law ``On  Education,'' the mandatory minimum of the professional syllabus  for a specific medical specialty is determined by the pertinent  State standard. The syllabuses for clinical residency and  curriculums are approved by the scientific councils of  institutions that train clinical residents, and they are revised  every 5 years, with consideration of changes in the State  standard for educational minimum of professional syllabus for  each specialty.    5. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health reserves the  right to terminate physician training in the form of clinical  residency in institutions where such work is not organized  satisfactorily.    6. Clinical residency training takes place away from the  main  workplace. Training lasts 2 years. If the scientific council of  the institution providing clinical resident training raises the  question of extending clinical residency to 5 years, permission  is granted by the Russian Federation Ministry of Health on an  individual basis, depending on the specialty of training.  Residencies start on 1 September.  <H5>  Clinical residency acceptance and training </H5>   1. Physicians participate in competitions to be accepted for  clinical residency. Citizens of other nations, as well as  physicians referred by cost-accounting and departmental (with  the exception of those under the Russian Federation Ministry of  Health) medical institutions and organizations enroll for  clinical residence in medical educational and research  institutions of the Russian Federation on a contractual basis,  unless other procedures are stipulated in existing legislation.    2. All clinical residency entrants enjoy equal rights,  regardless of social origin and financial status, race and  ethnicity, sex, language, attitude toward religion, type and  nature of work, and place of residence. Restrictions are  permitted only on medical contraindications, as well as in cases  stipulated by Russian Federation legislation.    3. The rules for acceptance to a clinical residency  (conditions, procedure and time of acceptance, number and forms  of examinations, rating criteria) are established by  institutions that train physicians in clinical residency, they  are approved by decision of the scientific councils of these  institutions and must be published no later than 3 months prior  to receipt of documentation.    4. Individuals who have passed examinations and competition  have the right to be enrolled for a clinical residency.    5. To carry out clinical residency enrollment, the  administrator of the educational (research) institution  announces a competition with a time limit of at least 1 month  for applications, he appoints an acceptance commission chairman  and approves its members. The acceptance commission comprises  representatives of the main clinical specialties.    6. Target numbers for enrolling physicians in a clinical  residence are approved annually by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Health and reported to health care institutions and  agencies in January-February for the next school year.  Enrollment in clinical residence on a contractual basis is  carried out by institutions that have the right to train  clinical residents in excess of the target enrollment numbers  approved by the ministry. Reports on filling clinical residency  spaces in the current year and applications for the next year  are submitted to the Russian Federation Ministry of Health no  later than 1 October of each year, with indication of  specialties and bases of proposed training. The reports must  indicate: --number of physicians accepted for residency  (separately, according to target enrollment numbers and  contracts);--training specialty; --agencies (institutions,  organizations) who referred specialists for training  (separately, according to target enrollment numbers and  contracts).    7. The application for acceptance in a clinical residency is  addressed in the name of the administrator of the institution  that trains clinical residents, with enclosure of: --personnel  record form [ID] with photo, endorsed by the personnel  department, from the last place of employment or study (those  who have been unemployed for over 1 year fill out the form used  for personnel records at the place to which documentation is  submitted); --curriculum vitae; --referral-recommendation from  the last place of employment (study) describing the level of  professional training, business and organizational traits of  applicant, with indication of specialty and purpose of training,  and institution to which documentation is submitted for  enrollment in clinical residency (for individuals enrolling by  special referral and who have worked (studied) at least 1 year  prior to submitting documentation for enrollment in clinical  residency); --copy of graduation diploma from higher medical  educational institution; --passport, military card, and labor  book [work permit and record] are submitted personally by the  candidate for clinical residency.    8. Travel expenses for individuals referred to specialized  clinical residency and after its completion are paid by the  referring organizations (institutions). The return trip for  individuals who failed in the competition is also paid by the  referring organizations (institutions). Individuals who did not  complete their individual training program and whose clinical  residency was terminated prematurely pay for their own return  trip.    9. Physicians who have passed the competition for clinical  residency are excused from work by administrators of  institutions (organizations), in accordance with existing  legislation. A pertinent letter from the educational or research  institution that provides training of clinical residents serves  as grounds for such action.    10. Physicians undergoing clinical residency training are  paid a stipend at the expense of the training institution, in an  amount set by the pertinent enforceable enactments or an amount  set by the organization (institution) that referred them for  training on a contractual basis. Clinical residences who have  started training in places funded by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Health in accordance with the target enrollment  numbers, can receive a supplement to the set stipend from the  training institution's stipend fund; in addition, special  clinical residents be paid such supplements by referring  organizations (institutions). Clinical residents are granted  annual leave for a period equal to the duration of annual  vacations of practicing physicians in the same specialty; upon  completion of clinical residency, they are granted a leave for  the same period of time as the leave of practicing physicians in  the same specialty, which is paid by the educational (research)  institution that trained the clinical residents (for contract  residents, by the referring organization (institution)).    11. Physicians accepted for clinical residence receive a  stipend from the day of enrollment, but not prior to their  receipt of their final payment from their former job.    12. The period of clinical residency training is included in  the physician's work tenure.    13. There is mandatory provision of dormitory housing for  out-of-town clinical residents. 20. The duration of clinical  residency training can be extended by order of the administrator  of the institution where clinical residents are being trained,  for the duration of maternity or child care leave taken, in  accordance with existing legislation, as well as for the  duration of the resident's illness when it lasts longer than 1  month, but no longer than the duration of illness, in the  presence of pertinent findings by medical institutions. Clinical  residents who failed to start their training within 1 month or  who have skipped training for over 1 month without a valid  reason, as well as those who did not fulfill their individual  training programs within the established time, are subject to  being terminated by order of the administrator of the  educational (research) institution upon being informed by the  department (division, laboratory, etc.) head.    14. Expenses involved in extending the term of clinical  residency are paid from the stipend fund and resources for  personnel training provided by the institution that trains  residents or institution (organization) that referred the  physician for residency training on a contractual basis.    15. Physicians who have been terminated from a clinical  residency can be reinstated for the remaining training period by  order of the administrator of the institution which is training  clinical residents. A commission makes the reinstatement  decisions on an individual basis.    16. Upon reinstatement of clinical residents for the  remaining training period, allocation of a stipend should be  made on the basis of work tenure as of the time of reinstatement.    17. Transfer of clinical residents from one educational or  research medical institution to another is effected by the  administrators of these institutions by agreement with the  referring organization (institution).    18. Repeated clinical residency is permitted if the  candidate  needs to acquire another specialty.    19. When the individual program is successfully completed  and  with theappropriate level of professional training, it is  possible to end training at an early date, but duration of  clinical residency must be at least 75 percent of its planned  term.    20. Physicians enrolling for clinical residency through free  competition have the right to independent employment after  completion of this training.  <H5>  Special-purpose clinical residency </H5>   1. Acceptance for special clinical residency is carried out  according to the program of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Health or on the basis of a contract between the institution  that trains clinical residents and the institution  (organization) that refers the specialist.    2. Administrators of referring institutions (organizations)  are responsible for timely and proper screening of candidates  for special clinical residency.    3. Upon completion of a special clinical residency,  physicians must make themselves available again to the referring  institutions (organizations), and have the right to annul the  labor contract following procedure established by legislation.    4. All of the rights and duties stipulated in this Statute  apply to special clinical residents.    5. Institutions (organizations) that have referred  physicians  for special clinical residencies must provide them with  permanent employment in their specialty in a position that is  not lower than their previous one after they have completed the  training period.  <H3>  Forms of training and monitoring performance of clinical  residents. Rights and duties of clinical residents </H3>   1. Clinical residents are trained on the basis of an  individual program elaborated by the residents jointly with a  specially appointed department (division, laboratory, etc.) head  responsible for training, and it is discussed at department  (division, laboratory, etc.) meetings. An amended individual  training program, with consideration of the clinical resident's  comments, is approved by the administrator of the department  (division, laboratory, etc.) no later than 1 month after the  physician has started the residency.    Estimation of the work load of professor-instructor staff is  based on 3 hours per week per clinical resident, 75 percent of  the training time being devoted to the study of the main  specialty and 25 percent, to the study of allied disciplines.  The instructor to clinical resident ratio is l.0:3.75.    The list of mandatory allied specialties and disciplines to  be studied by the clinical resident is provided in training  syllabuses.    2. The load for study and medical-preventive [therapeutic  and  preventive] care in specialties is determined by the individual  program. Payment for on-call duty and other medical-preventive  work that is not provided in the individual program is made by  the medical-preventive institution. Clinical residents may  travel on assignment for up to 30 days for on-the-job training.    3. A clinical resident has the right to have a concurrent  job  in accordance with existing legislation.    4. Department (division, laboratory, etc.) heads are  personally responsible for the quality of training specialists  in clinical residencies, and their readiness for independent  work on all levels of practical health care.    5. The individual program provides for submitting reports on  areas of the main specialty and allied disciplines and  delivering papers periodically at department (division,  laboratory, etc.) conferences at least once a year. At the end  of each year of training, there is certification for all aspects  of training.    6. Upon completion of clinical residence, the individuals  receive a certificate, the form for which is illustrated,  (Appendix) which is attached to the diploma for basic higher  medical education.    7. Graduates of clinical residencies have the right to take  a  qualification examination for the title of specialist before an  independent certification commission. Specialists in the  educational institution that trained the clinical resident and  administrators of the institution where he worked prior to the  residency must not be members of the certification commission.  The certification commission works in accordance with the  Statute ``On Procedure for Certification of Russian Federation  Physicians for the Title of Specialist.''    8. A certificate in the established form, which gives the  right to independent medical work, can be issued to individuals  who have completed a clinical residency, on the basis of the  results of certification and decision of the certification  commission.  <H3>  Appendix to ``Statute on Clinical Residencies,'' approved by  Order No 23 of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, dated  17 Feb 93 </H3> <H5>  Russian Federation Ministry of Health </H5>   (higher medical educational institution, research  institution, institute for advanced training of physicians,  medical department of university)  <H3>  Certificate Added to diploma of basic higher medical  education Series 30 No </H3>   Issued to Doctor 20 (Surname, name, patronymic)    to the effect that he (she) was trained from 10 [date]  to 10 in a clinical residency at 30    (name of higher medical educational institution, research  institution, institute for advanced training of physicians,  medical department of university)    and has completed the full course in the specialty of 20    (name of specialty)    Administrator of educational (research) institution 40  (signature)    Secretary 40 (signature)    Official seal City Registration No 30 Date issued 10  <H3>  Russian Federation Ministry of Justice registered on 26  February 1993 </H3> <H3>  registration No 163  [stamp:] Exclusively for RV [ROSSIYESKIYE VESTI] </H3></p>

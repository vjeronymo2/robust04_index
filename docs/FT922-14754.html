			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / As they say in Europe: A poor standard of political insult THE FRENCH must have had enough of their own politics and elections this week, but this has not stopped them stepping up their coverage of events in Britain. They are fanning out over the sceptred isle, choosing significant destinations. Never anglophile, Le Figaro went to Edinburgh, where its rival, Le Monde, had been a little earlier. The latter has now put York on the front page, partly because it is the UK's most marginal constituency, and partly because Le Monde is one paper which can discuss York without its readers confusing this with the matrimonial affairs of the Queen's second son. For the business paper Les Echos, it was the gritty anonymity of the West Midlands. For Liberation, the daily paper of the youthful caviare gauche, it was inevitably Hampstead and Highgate and a large picture of the Labour candidate, actress Glenda Jackson. Marie Guichoux deployed her local knowledge in writing about 'Ham and High'  -as she called it, dutifully - where 'one must convince the outlying poorer districts while attracting the intelligentsia. Between the Freud Museum and the tomb of Karl Marx, there is to be found the greatest concentration of men of letters, psychoanalysts and great fortunes of London. Boy George, ex-King Constantine of Greece, John le Carre and Peter O'Toole are near neighbours.' Les Echos chose North Warwickshire, the marginal seat of treasury minister Francis Maude who was supported by the trade and industry secretary, Peter Lilley. They had a tricky encounter at one of the few economic success stories of recent years, the Betterware mail order firm, which employs 160 people. As the paper noted: 'Asked what they wanted from the next government, the directors of this small firm chorused: 'Tax concessions for investment.' Silence from the two ministers: such a measure appears in Labour's programme but not the Conservatives'.' In Edinburgh, Le Figaro's Jacques Duplouich enjoyed a similar frisson of schadenfreude, talking to rebellious elements there, and blaming the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, for any disaffection north of the border. He concluded: 'Whatever happens, the status quo is no longer possible. Whoever wins the election will have to undertake a revision of the Act of Union. Or expose themselves to serious trouble.' For Le Monde's Laurent Zecchini in York, it was the manner in which the campaign was being fought that proved interesting. 'Hardly any great rallies a la francaise, few walkabouts, but targeted and thematic meetings, perfectly controlled and, above all, making the most of television publicity.' Zecchini followed Tory leader John Major through the hospital in York, a new private trust under the recent reforms, and became one of the few correspondents to broach the fearful affair of Jennifer's ear. 'Labour employed every means of concentrating attention on the gaps in the national health service, notably the incredible waiting lists . . .' So there came about the film of Jennifer Bennett who had to wait 11 months for an ear operation. According to Zecchini, the huge controversy over some gaps in the film enabled the Conservatives 'a little hastily, to seize the opportunity to hurt (Labour leader) Neil Kinnock . . . they questioned his 'fitness to govern,' a modest statement that, in the conventional register of British political dialogue, constituted a grave attack against the leader of the opposition.' There, Zecchini was facing up to the huge differences in the political language of France and Britain. The actual words used by the Tory chairman, Chris Patten, to attack Kinnock were 'unfit to hold public office.' In France, to say the opposite and declare someone 'fit to hold public office' would imply grave character defects and attract a libel suit. Furthermore, the nature of debate in France is such as to make the jaded encounters of British politicians seem positively socratic. Across the Channel, it is quite normal to characterise opponents in a manner that only the most libertarian newspaper in Britain would dare translate. The result is to render it impossible to convey in the British media the precise qualities that make French elections so different. By the same token, it must be quite hard for the French to make British disputes appear significant when the worst insults sound like compliments.

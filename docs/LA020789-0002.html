			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that Iran will continue to export its  Islamic revolution, but not by force. "We have a concept," he told a Tehran  press conference, "and we're going to continue the policy to export the  revolution. But this doesn't mean we're going to export the revolution with a  gun." Iran has been restoring relations with Western countries and its Persian  Gulf neighbors in a new open-door policy aimed at ending a decade of  self-imposed isolation. "Except for the Palestine-occupying regime (Israel) and  the racist South African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we desire  good relations with other countries of the world," Velayati said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Berezhkov] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Jan--U.S. President Bill Clinton's  visit to Moscow was packed with important talks, meetings with  public and political figures, and protocol events. [passage  omitted]    At a routine briefing today, a high-ranking White House  spokesman, who asked not to be named, summed up the preliminary  results of the Moscow summit. He said that President Bill  Clinton had fulfilled the tasks before him: to confirm  partnership relations between the United States and Russia that  were established in Vancouver, to express firm support by the  United States for the economic and political reforms in Russia,  and also to develop ties with a wider spectrum of political  forces in the country.    According to the briefer, the main themes of the talks in  Moscow were economic reforms in Russia, the "Partnership for  Peace" program, and also disarmament. The White House spokesman  said that the most important event was, perhaps, the signing  this morning of a trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine,  and the United States on eliminating nuclear weapons deployed on  Ukrainian territory.    He said also that the leaders of both countries had  discussed  both yesterday and today the question of the presence of Russian  troops in Latvia and Estonia. "We think that progress has been  made in this area and very much hope that agreements on troop  withdrawal will be concluded soon between Russia and Latvia and  between Russia and Estonia," the White House spokesman said.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DRUG-FREE PROGRAM IS CAMPUS HIT  </P> <P> "Friday Night Live" has opened to rave reviews in Ventura County this year as a  hip approach to persuade students to "drive sober and drug-free."  </P> <P> The program, which began in November, has spread to four county high schools in  Moorpark, Fillmore, Westlake Village and Port Hueneme. Several others are  considering joining the statewide program that has enrolled more than half of  the students in California high schools over the past six years.  </P> <P> To join Friday Night Live, students sign an application stating their  commitment to promote driving and partying sober and drug-free. In return,  members receive identification cards that resemble a credit card.  </P> <P> Students can use the cards for discounts at local businesses, including  restaurants and music stores.  </P> <P> "We feel very strongly about the benefits of Friday Night Live," said Kathy  Staples of the Ventura County Alcohol and Drug Programs. The schools began the  program last fall with the aid of a $30,000 state grant.  </P> <P> Dale Hoffman, hired with half of the money to be the program's part-time  coordinator, said he is seeking donations from area businesses to continue  Friday Night Live past its state funding deadline. The grant expires June 30  and next year's grant from the state has been reduced to $15,000.  </P> <P> To promote participation in Friday Night Live as "being cool," students receive  T-shirts, buttons, pens and wristbands in Day-Glo colors with the Friday Night  Live logo.  </P> <P> "You can see lots of Friday Night Live buttons on kids' backpacks around  school," said Jonathan Kaplan, a Westlake High freshman and Friday Night Live  member.  </P> <P> Friday Night Live also encourages students to schedule social events  themselves.  </P> <P> "Kids have a lot of energy," Kaplan said.  </P> <P> "They want fun activities, and if the events are free, it really makes it good  for kids."  </P> <P> In addition to dances, members have participated in picnics and scavenger hunts  and plan to go on kayak and rock climbing outings.  </P> <P> "Younger kids flock to this program and assume leadership roles," said Melanie  Ashen, a Westlake High Spanish teacher.  </P> <P> In addition to peer pressure to drink or take drugs, some high school students  must battle drugs or alcohol at home. Ashen said she has had students talk  about their parents keeping "cocaine on the coffee table at home."  </P> <P> To raise awareness of substance abuse, parents of Friday Night Live members are  asked to sign an agreement stating that they will not permit their children to  be served alcohol or to use illegal drugs.  </P> <P> "When a 15- or 16-year-old comes up after a weekend activity and says, 'Thanks  for the best time of my life' or 'Thank you for changing my life,' no monetary  reward can equal it," Hoffman said.

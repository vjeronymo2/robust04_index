			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: MARLBOROUGH'S VIOLETS ARE IN BLOOM  </P> <P> Marlborough School in Los Angeles' Hancock Park, a school that calls its  students "violets," has reached 100 years, without wrinkles. More vibrant than  ever, it sends five seniors to Harvard this year from a class of 70.  </P> <P> Last weekend, the violets staged a black-tie gala at the Western Heritage  Museum to culminate a year's activities and a final weekend, including an  alumnae luncheon (honoring "A Woman From Each Decade"), a headmaster's wine  reception, an evening of musical comedy ("Then and Now"), a Saturday of  seminars and a Sunday of class reunion brunches at homes all over the city.  </P> <P> Centennial Celebration Committee chairman Terry Von Hagen Bucher, class of '59,  who spent five months in Antarctica this year doing postgraduate research on  penguins, was ecstatic about the celebration: "Marlborough has succeeded for  100 years because of people; people will help us survive another 100 years."  </P> <P> At the black-tie gathering trustees chairman Susanne Fitger Donnelly, '50,  noted: "The one thing that we hope will never change is the teaching of values  -- that is what has distinguished Marlborough in its 100-year history."  </P> <P> The committee chose Pam Mullin and Barbara Myerson to chair the party and the  duo staged a huge tent washed in mauve lights and projected violets on the tent  ceiling. Then the crowd danced the night away on a black-and-white  checkerboard. Among the many were Louise (centennial co-chair) and Peter Reich,  Patti and Pat Doheny (she was the generations tea co-chairman with their  daughter Kacey McCoy, who was at Cate School for son Patrick's graduation),  Suzy and Don Crowell, Bill and Daryn Horton.  </P> <P> Trustees Peter Mullin, Hugh Evans, Donn Miller, Marjorie Wong Chen and Dr.  Henry Takei were among the crowd. Shelley Dickerson and Betsy Barash flew in  from New York. Said trustee Martha Porter Mitchel (wearing splendid green  taffeta) on the arm of husband Glen: "We have come a long way and all these  Marlborough students look terrific." Said Peter Mullin: "Marlborough has  changed in the sense that the curriculum is a broader experience. From a proper  girls' school, it now prepares students for a broader and more complicated  world."  </P> <P> COOLING DOWN: There were no penguins, no polar bears, no snow or icicles --  except on the invitation Lisa Williamson designed for the "housecooling" party  in San Marino of the English manor house owned for years by her grandmother,  the late Ruth Chandler von Platen. Warren (Spud) Williamson, Sue Dulin and  Norman (Tad) Williamson, Mrs. Von Platen's children, extended the invitations  to old and close friends because they are parting with the manor house and its  five acres of gardens, the scene for countless black-tie Christmas parties,  weddings and charity affairs.  </P> <P> The night was special for Spud and Alyce Williamson's son, Henry. Not only was  it his 27th birthday, but he announced his engagement to Robin Ferrante,  daughter of Lucy and Orlando Ferrante (a Disney executive) of San Marino. It  also was special for Adams, Duque &amp; Hazeltine attorney Waller Taylor. The  house was built for his grandmother, the late Mrs. Frank Emery, in the 1920s.  </P> <P> For the occasion, the hosts imported Igor and His Cowboy Jazz Band from  Arizona. There was a lot of heated stomping by a good percentage of the  Polytechnic Class of 1943 -- Spud's class -- including Bill Taverner, Karl von  Platen Jr., David Wilson, Ben Shattuck, Stuart O'Melveny, Anne Shattuck.  </P> <P> The party was held under a huge clear tent with sparkly lights, not too unlike  that erected when Sue Williamson and Bob Dulin married. All their children were  there -- Jim Dulin, Cinnie Herr and Ken Dulin with their respective spouses,  Sarah, Frank and Sally. The Jim Dulins and the Herrs live in Chicago, the Ken  Dulins in Denver. More good friends were Sally and Bill Wenzlau, Sallie and  Harry Colmery, Connie and Gordon Fish.  </P> <P> Toward the end, Tad Williamson picked up his banjo, and to the whistles from  son Jonathan, played those old-time sing-along favorites while his wife,  Victoria, and son Fred and his new wife, Kate, and son Chandler and daughter  Emily gave support.  </P> <P> More in the crowd were Charles Thornton, Dodie and Otis Booth, Martha Chandler,  Ruth Williamson, neighbors Julie and Art Pizzinat, Sally Lewis, Gwen and Bob  Cheesewright, Frannie Clayton, Anne and Susan Babcock, Mimi and Nelson Jones.  Attempting two parties in one night, Spike and Debbe Booth, Bob and Janice  Carpenter and Eunice and Doug Goodan managed to attend both the housecooling  and the Marlborough centennial.  </P> <P> LEADERS: Not always does the YWCA of Los Angeles bestow its Athena Award, its  ultimate tribute. Caroline Ahmanson, Judith Murphy, Anna Bing Arnold and Ann  Shaw are the previous recipients over 15 years. At a huge luncheon at the  Bonaventure, the fifth Athena Award went to Harriet McElroy Luckman, wife of  architect Charles Luckman and herself architect of the Muses and Les Dames de  Champagne. "I share this with all of you," she said. "We couldn't get along  without us."  </P> <P> Receiving Silver Achievement Awards were Ruth Ashton Taylor, communications;  Betty Kozasa, public service; Joan A. Payden, business and industry  (entrepreneur); Nancy Dicks, business and industry (corporate), Varnette  Honeywood, creative arts; Brenda Levin, professions/science; Janet Evans,  sports; and Vikki Carr, volunteer community service. Maria Contreras-Sweet  chaired the luncheon.  </P> <P> SALUTES: The Coro Public Affairs Awards recognize leadership and dynamic  community involvement -- and that an individual makes a difference. Bettina  Chandler and Roger Kozberg co-chaired the black-tie Coro Foundation dinner at  the Century Plaza with the aid of Terri Childs, Coro Foundation chairman.  </P> <P> The salutes went to Bill Stout (introduced by state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp  as "a reporter with guts, brains and integrity") and to E. Grace Payne  (introduced by Ira Distenfield, president of the Board of Harbor Commissioners,  as the tenacious executive director of Westminster Neighborhood Assn., the  agency assisting 10,000 children and adults in South-Central Los Angeles).  </P> <P> It was an evening with pluses: Craig Fuller, former chief of staff to then-Vice  President George Bush and now partner with Anne Wexler and Nancy Reynolds in a  Washington consulting firm, moderated the "Media and Leadership" discussion  between Charles Peters, the Washington Monthly editor-in-chief, and Jack  Nelson, Los Angeles Times Washington bureau chief.  </P> <P> BUSY TOWN: Artist Peter Adams chairs the Friends of the Jeffrey Foundation "An  Evening With Steve Allen and Friends" Wednesday at the Beverly Hills Hotel. . .  .  </P> <P> California Institute of the Arts president Steven Lavine and his wife, Janet  Sternburg, give a party in their Encino home Thursday honoring this year's  honorary degree recipients -- choreographer Paul Taylor, playwright Luis Valdez  and CalArts trustee Donn Tatum. . . .  </P> <P> Luncheon chairman Greta Peck plans a whopper of a day for Operation: Children  on Thursday at the Beverly Hilton; Ricardo Montalban and Sybil Brand will  receive accolades, and Michael Novarese will premiere his fall fashions. . . .  </P> <P> AND MORE: Mel Torme, Tony Orlando, Norm Crosby and Ed McMahon headline "A Night  Under the Stars" for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. and the Jerry Lewis ALS  (Amniotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Clinical Research Center at the Beverly Hilton  on Friday. Ralph Mann and Katherine Lurie are co-chairs. . . .  </P> <P> The Los Angeles chapter of the American Jewish Committee honors lawyer Ronald  L. Olson with its 1989 Learned Hand Award at a dinner Thursday at the Beverly  Hilton. Dinner co-chairs include John E. Bryson, Southern California Edison  executive vice president; Geoffrey Cowan, former state chairman of Common  Cause; lawyer Alan V. Friedman; Tom Johnson, publisher and chief executive  officer of the Los Angeles Times; and entertainment lawyer Bruce M. Ramer. The  Rev. Jesse L. Jackson is keynoter.  </P> <P> THE SEASON: Buckley School host its Donors Reception on Thursday at Ma Maison  with headmaster Walter Baumhoff on hand. . . . Mayfield Junior School continues  celebrating its British heritage with its Tallyho English Country Evening on  Saturday at Flintridge Riding Club, following on the heels of the tea Mollie  O'Melveny held for alumni mothers. The Tallyho party is dedicated to Sister  Jeanne Marie Hatch. . . .  </P> <P> Aaron and Candy Spelling chaired the send-off party for "Cycle for  Scholarships." This is the effort in which Nathan Reynolds, 55, headmaster of  Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, is cycling across the United States,  expecting to arrive May 27 in Washington and hoping to raise $350,000 for the  school's financial aid program.  </P></p>

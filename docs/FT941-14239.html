			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Labour leads attack on homes reform Labour joined forces with some of Britain's leading pressure groups yesterday to attack the government's proposals to reform the allocation of council housing to the homeless. The proposals, which came in a consultation paper issued by Sir George Young, the housing minister, would abolish the rule allowing people classed as 'statutorily homeless' - many of whom are single mothers - to receive an automatic right to a council house. Under the proposals all applicants for council accommodation would have to join a waiting list. However, local authorities would single out people who were in emergency need of housing and place them in temporary accommodation. But these people would have to compete with everyone else on the waiting list before receiving a secured tenancy. The 'fast track' by which these people now acquire council accommodation in perpetuity would be abolished. The reforms could disadvantage single mothers who make up some 45 per cent of the statutorily homeless, and now receive priority. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, attacked the policy, saying that a chronic shortage of affordable homes had created the problem. He added: 'With Labour, 100,000 new homes were built for rent by councils and housing associations. Under the Tories that has been cut to a third.' Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the housing charity, claimed that the new system would leave families moving from one temporary home to another until a secure tenancy could be found. 'Do we really want to see families who don't know where their children will be at school next term or whether they will be able to get to their job, if they have one, and what the future holds for them?' she asked. However, Sir George said yesterday that the proposals were aimed at curbing the practice by which people living with their parents left home, declared themselves 'statutorily homeless' and received accommodation ahead of other applicants. This, he said, was to the dis-advantage of people who stayed with parents while joining a housing association waiting list. Under the new proposals, people who leave their parents' home would not be treated as an emergency. Sir George also said that he would be looking at ways for local authorities to offer applicants rented accommodation in the private sector. This would be paid for by housing benefit up to a certain level, possibly topped up by a local authority grant.</p>

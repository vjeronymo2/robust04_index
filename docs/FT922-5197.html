			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Aid plan for Names considered THE Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, will tomorrow consider a plan for helping the Names - whose assets back dealings - who have lost most. There is still no certainty, however, that such a plan will be adopted, Lloyd's said. A council sub-committee, advised by merchant bank SG Warburg, has been considering possible schemes in recent weeks. The sub-committee will need to make firm recommendations to the council tomorrow if any scheme is to be ready for Lloyd's annual meeting of Names on June 24.</p>

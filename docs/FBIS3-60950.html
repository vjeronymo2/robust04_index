[see items TA3012053593 and NC3012094693  in previous Terrorism Report] They managed to cross what the  enemy and its agents call the border strip in southern Lebanon  as well as the enemy's security fences. They arrived in  northern Palestine and the Dan area and clashed with a  mechanized military patrol in Upper Galilee in a heroic and  daring operation that continued from 0300 to 0430 on 30 December  1993. They destroyed an enemy military vehicle, killing or  wounding some of its occupants. This forced the enemy to use a  large number of its troops as well as airborne paratroopers in  the operation.    The statement issued by the Fatah Movement, the General  Command of the al-'Asifah Forces, added: The enemy has admitted  that the operation took place, acknowledged that it suffered  some casualties, and attempted to minimize its losses, as usual.  However, it has repeatedly said through its news media that it  is the first operation of its kind for a long time in which our  heroes have managed to breach the Zionist entity's security  fences.    During the heroic clash with the enemy, three fedayeen were  martyred. They are the following: Patrol commander heroic  martyr Lieutenant Ahmad Amin Qa'qur, born in 1971, Amman, he  hailed from Tarqumiyah, Hebron; heroic martyr 1st Sergeant  Ashraf Hammad Mansur, born in 1970, Dar'a, he hailed from  Beersheba; and heroic martyr 1st Sergeant Ahmad Rafiq al-Mallah,  born in 1973, Nahr al-Barid, he hailed from 'Illar, Tulkarm.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data give gentle support to Dow Wall Street US share prices firmed slightly across the board yesterday, but trading was subdued ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday break, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.41 up at 3,687.58. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.33 at 462.36, while the American SE composite was ahead 2.47 at 463.51 and the Nasdaq composite 6.36 higher at 753.18. New York SE volume totalled 230.6m shares. As on Tuesday, prices opened firmer following early gains in bond prices. At 2pm, when the bond market closed early, the benchmark 30-year bond was up slightly, and the yield had eased to 6.3 per cent. Bonds have rallied strongly over the past two days, which has helped to alleviate the worries of equity investors. With interest rate concern temporarily shelved, share prices have been able to post modest advances. Although the day's economic news was mixed, it was positive for equities on balance. Government reports on weekly unemployment insurance claims and October durable goods orders were both moderately bullish, and sustained the recent pattern of statistics revealing a steadily expanding economy. On the debit side, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell in November. This, however, did not surprise investors. Over the past year, one of the features of the economic situation has been consistently weak consumer sentiment. While there was some steady buying, trading activity throughout the day was relatively subdued, with many participants winding down their activities as they prepared to leave for the long Thanksgiving weekend. Technology issues were in favour. Hewlett-Packard moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 73 5/8 and IBM, which benefited from a ratings upgrade by broking house Smith Barney Shearson, finished Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 55 1/8 . Compaq strengthened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 70 1/4 . Philip Morris moved up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 as investors reacted positively to news that the big food and tobacco group is planning a significant corporate restructuring that will involve a large number of plant closures and workforce reductions. The restructuring, plus accounting changes, will force the company to take a charge of Dollars 952m in the fourth quarter. Auto stocks, hit by selling earlier in the week, rebounded. Chrysler appreciated Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54, Ford Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 61 and General Motors Dollars 1 to Dollars 53 3/4 . Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 80 1/8 after a Delaware court removed 'poison pill' provisions in the company's merger agreement with Viacom. The news raised hopes that rival bidder QVC Network may succeed with its higher offer for Paramount. Viacom advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 3/4 and QVC Network declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 3/4 . Canada The Toronto market staged a mild improvement as it shrugged off worries over Ontario's debt ratings and reports that the 1993-94 federal budget deficit may hit a record CDollars 45bn. The TSE 300 index ended 8.1 ahead at 4,223.3 and advances led falls by 379 to 340 after volume of 55.6m shares.</p>

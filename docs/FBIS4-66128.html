			<p>BFN     [Text] Lisbon, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec began a two-day visit to Portugal today, the  first visit on this level in the history of Czech-Portuguese  relations.    Shortly upon his arrival he met Chairman of the Assembly of  the Republic Antonio Moreira Barbosa de Melo to discuss the  question of the Czech Republic's joining the European Union (EU)  and other European structures.    During the talks Zieleniec presented the Czech Republic as a  stable country, which wants through its own strength to become  an economically and politically equal partner of European  countries. Our foreign policy wants to dissolve the fears of the  EU so-called south wing, to which the EU economically less  advanced countries belong, that after being accepted to the EU  the Czech Republic would pump money out of its funds and would  thus restrict the development resources of these countries.  Everything indicates that Lisbon understands this fact.    Portugal is the third EU country to ratify an agreement on  the Czech Republic's associate membership of the EU. By  ratifying the document on May 12, the Portugese parliament  endorsed the process of the Czech Republic's integration into  Europe.    The problem of the Czech Republic's succession to agreements  signed by Portugal and the former Czechoslovakia is the second  important point on Zieleniec's agenda. Besides an agreement on  cultural and scientific cooperation this problem also concerns  the economic field. An agreement on the prevention of double  taxation between the two countries is to be signed on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson's trip around the world, on which he aims to ski every day in 1994 and to notch up 5,000 miles on the slopes, is proving such big news in North America that he and his companion Lucy Dicker, are struggling to find time to ski. He reports: 'When we reached Pebble Creek, near Pocatello in Idaho, three TV crews were waiting for us. In the gathering dusk they were torn between interviewing us and filming us skiing. There was just enough light for one run - a steep mile of scratchy moguls - and my fall at the end was gleefully captured on camera. 'That night, the potato state was treated to TV pictures of Wilson on the deck . . .' There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two in Zermatt or runner-up prizes of champagne by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on January 1 (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).</p>

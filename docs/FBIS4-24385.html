			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- The people's courts  have concluded the trials on two major smuggling cases in Rushan  city, Shandong Province and Zhuhai city, Guangdong Province.  With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, Liu Qishan,  Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning, who were charged with smuggling, and  accepting and offering bribes in the smuggling case of the  Rushan Commerce Bureau, and Yang Mingji, who was charged with  smuggling in Zhuhai's cigarette smuggling case, were executed by  shooting in Weihai and Zhuhai, respectively, today.    Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,  announced this result of the people's courts' verdicts at a news  briefing on harshly punishing major smugglers today.    It has been learned that the cigarette smuggling case in  Rushan is a serious one in which smugglers and law enforcers  colluded with each other, and the smuggling activity was covered  up by armed personnel. In July 1993, Fan Zhanwu, political  commissar of the frontier security subbureau under the Weihai  Public Security Bureau, and Liu Ning, deputy director of the  operation department, worked out an "emergency circular on the  issues concerning smuggling units' surrendering themselves to  the police according to stipulations," which provided that  smuggling units that "turn themselves in" to the Weihai Frontier  Security Subbureau will be "fined" on the principle that they  still "keep their capital." To keep their previous promises,  Fan and Liu separately released this information to Liu Qishan,  director of the Rushan City Commerce Bureau, who had bribed them  many times, and implied that he may take this chance to engage  in smuggling. No sooner had Liu Qishan and others got the hint  than they contacted smugglers in South China to smuggle  cigarettes. On 16 July, when Liu Qishan was informed that the  boat loaded with smuggled cigarettes was on the high seas, he  immediately dispatched Jiang Hai, an employee of the commerce  bureau, to go through the procedures of "turning oneself in" at  the frontier security subbureau, whereas Fan Zhanwu dispatched  Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Weidong to bring three persons,  carrying four submachine guns, to greet the boat off Rushan  City. Before Wang Weidong and his men embarked, Liu Qishan gave  them 5,000 yuan as "labor money" and demanded that they  underreport the quantity of smuggled cigarettes. On the  afternoon of 19 July, Wang Weidong and the other three armed  persons escorted the boat loaded with over 9,900 cases of  smuggled cigarettes to the wharf of Rushan Port, and Sun Xiping  and Wang Xuefeng, persons in charge of the Rushan Public  Security Bureau, brought some 20 policemen and three police cars  to the wharf to "maintain order" at the request of Liu Qishan.    On the same afternoon, customs officers had twice rushed to  the wharf of Rushan Port to seize the smuggled goods and halt  the unloading, but were stopped by Fan Zhanwu on both occasions.  To avoid armed conflicts, the customs officers withdrew after  reaching an agreement with Fan Zhanwu and others that the  cigarettes should not be unloaded, the boat should not leave the  wharf, and that someone be assigned to keep watch on the boat.  After the customs officers left, Wang Xuefeng, who was in  charge of the lookout for the boat, called Liu Qishan, who  immediately organized the unloading and sale of the smuggled  cigarettes. The smuggled cigarettes were able to be unloaded  and sold because Yan Shili, director of the operation department  under the frontier security subbureau, had ignored the higher  authorities' ban on unloading the cigarettes during the  unloading. After that, only 3,000 cases of smuggled cigarettes  were sealed up, as Liu Qishan planned, to cope with the  investigation of relevant departments. The whole smuggling  activity was covered up.    After the case was reported, Wang Jianzhi, secretary of the  Rushan City party committee, heard an overall briefing by Liu  Qishan and helped Liu Qishan and others avoid legal punishment  by repeatedly inciting Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and others to  come up with measures for self-protection and synchronize their  story to conceal the facts.    In addition, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi,  and others had, on many occasions, extorted or accepted large  sums of bribes from others. Among which, Liu Qishan received  over 62,000 Renminbi in bribes; Fan Zhanwu, over 154,000 yuan;  Liu Ning, over 258,000 yuan; and Wang Jianzhi, over 221,000 yuan.    After the public trial, in accordance with the law, the  intermediate people's court of Weihai City reached a verdict of  the first instance on the 11 defendants involved in the Rushan  smuggling case, sentencing Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning  to death; sentencing Wang Jianzhi, defendant of the same case,  to death with a two-year reprieve; sentencing Sun Xiping to life  imprisonment, Wang Xuefeng and Yan Shili to a fixed-term  imprisonment of 20 years, Wang Weidong and Qiu Guojian to a  fixed-term imprisonment of five years, and Jiang Hai to a  fixed-term imprisonment of three years with a three-year  reprieve. At the same time, the court also fined the Rushan  City Bureau of Commerce, which was guilty of smuggling, 100,000  yuan. After the court reached the verdict of the first  instance, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi, and  others disagreed with the verdict and filed an appeal. After  rejecting the appeal, the Higher People's Court of Shandong  decided on 11 May 1994 to maintain the original verdict. The  Supreme People's Court approved the death sentence for Liu  Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning on 23 May.    In February 1993, Yang Mingji, former head of Sanzao Border  Brigade, concurrently head of its antismuggling group, under the  border branch of the Zhuhai City Public Security Bureau of  Guangdong Province, colluded with smugglers in smuggling  cigarettes from Macao to be sold in Zhuhai. According to the  agreement, Yang Mingji was to provide armed cover for the  smugglers, for which he received cover fees. From 8 to 28  March, on four occasions, uniformed police carrying arms,  including Lin Shouru, under Yang Mingji's leadership or  dispatched by him, drove a speedboat to sea to provide armed  cover to freighters engaged in smuggling cigarettes and escorted  them to the Sanzao Dock. They also helped the smugglers sell  cigarettes. A total of 2,300 boxes of cigarettes were smuggled,  worth 5.17 million yuan. Yang Mingji and others received  172,000 yuan protection fees, and Yang himself got 48,000 yuan.    The intermediate court of Zhuhai City reached a verdict of  the instance, sentencing Yang Mingji and Lin Shouru to death.  Yang and Lin disagreed the verdict and filed an appeal. The  Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province rejected the appeal,  kept the original verdict, and reported, according to law, to  the Supreme People's Court for approval.    At the news briefing, Zhu Mingshan said: The antismuggling  struggle is a long-term and arduous task. Relevant departments  should coordinate closely, resolutely combat local protectionism  and departmental protectionism, work hard to enforce law  strictly, and spare no effort to punish smugglers and criminals.  At the same time, it is imperative to apply party disciplinary  rules and state laws to strictly deal with those who intercede  for law-breakers through bribery, who interfere with the  handling of cases, and who protect and wink at smugglers, in  order to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening to the  outside world, and economic construction.</p>

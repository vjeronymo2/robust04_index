			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASE DON'T TESTIFY, TOBY  </P> <P> I really don't mind that Roy Schaeffer's cat, Toby, has an appraiser's  certificate ("Appraiser Certificate Really the Cat's Meow" by H. W. Moss Oct.  14).  </P> <P> I'm sort of a live-and-let-live guy, and if Toby needs a hobby, appraising real  estate seems harmless enough. It's just that I don't want Toby to be testifying  as an expert witness in eminent domain valuation cases, which -- judging from  the reported court decisions -- he seems to be doing with regularity.  </P> <P> GIDEON KANNER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Kanner is Editor and Publisher of a monthly periodical on eminent domain.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 6 (AFP) -- The question of whether to  continue with nuclear tests is a "major point of disagreement"  between the conservative French government and socialist  President Francois Mitterrand, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  on French radio Friday.    In a review of French defence strategy Thursday evening,  Mitterrand told defence chiefs the current moratorium on testing  nuclear warheads would remain as long as he was president.  Mitterrand's mandate ends next May.    Throwing a defiant challenge to any successor, almost  certain  to be a right-winger, he said future presidents would not dare  to resume testing for fear of offending the whole world by  relaunching the nuclear arms race, and urged them to move to  computer-simulated tests.    Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was  "a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants  to keep its options open.    No one questioned Mitterrand's authority as head of the  armed  forces until the end of the mandate, but "he cannot anticipate  what his successor will do," the minister commented. "It is for  the future president (...) to explain his vision to the French  people."    As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further  nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added.    A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used  stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a  "vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a  "vision of the future."    The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded  vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking  account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend  ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling  coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR).    Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the  president's  arguments.    This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain  an  independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military  command, to allocate more money to computer research and  strengthen overall disarmament, he said.    "There is no question today of rejoining the military  organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said  Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow  us to move on from nuclear tests one day."    Mitterrand, speaking to military and civilian defence chiefs  at his Elysee palace after the adoption of a bill setting out  France's defence strategy for the next six years, had said  French nuclear weapons would remain "under sole French control."    He said he stood by the late president Charles de Guaulle's  1966 decision to pull out of NATO's military command. "I firmly  maintain this decision. Nothing will make me change it," he  said.    Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his  country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear  warheads.    The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered  submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently  targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64  missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150  kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 2 KYODO -- Hisashi Owada, Japanese  ambassador to the United Nations, declared Monday [2 May] that  Japan will make clear its resolve to get permanent membership on  the U.N. Security Council [UNSC]. "It is very important to make  clear Japan's determination," Owada told Japanese reporters four  days after presenting his credentials to U.N. Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    He said Japan would try to achieve the objective without  antagonizing other countries. "The sentiment in the U.N. and  the world community is that Japan should play a more active  role," he said.    Owada also said it is "very important" for the U.N. to  engage  in peacekeeping and other related activities, adding there is  still room for Japan to do more within its peacekeeping  cooperation law.    Owada, father of Crown Princess Masako, took up his U.N.  post  on April 28, replacing another career diplomat Yoshio Hatano.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Shipbuilding side helps Kvaerner to record year Kvaerner, one of Norway's biggest publicly quoted companies, yesterday announced record pre-tax profits for 1993, helped mainly by solid advances in the diversified group's shipbuilding and oil and gas activities. Last year pre-tax profits rose 41.5 per cent to NKr1.32bn (Dollars 177m) from NKr932m in 1992 as sales increased 23 per cent to NKr24.58bn from NKr20bn with advances made in all five of the group's business areas. The result was better than domestic analysts' forecasts and Kvaerner has proposed lifting the 1993 dividend payment to NKr5.50 a share from NKr5. Kvaerner expects the group in 1994 to show a profit, before unrealised foreign exchange items, matching that achieved in 1993. Group operating costs rose to NKr22.4bn in 1993 from NKr18.35bn in 1992, mostly due to acquisitions. Accounts were charged with net financial items of NKr36m - including gains on securities of NKr79m against losses of NKr65m in 1992 - compared with NKr14m in 1992.</p>

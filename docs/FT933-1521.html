			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Recovery for More O'Ferrall - Improved UK orders expected to make up for France and Belgium THE REVERSAL of a two-year decline in its main markets helped More O'Ferrall, the hoardings and bus shelter advertising company, more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds 936,000 to Pounds 2.08m in the six months to June 30. Sales at the company, which has operations in the UK, the Irish Republic, France, Belgium and Taiwan, climbed to Pounds 31.6m (Pounds 28.6m) in spite of the sale of two US businesses at the beginning of this year. The shares rose 22p to close at 330p. Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said: 'Most of our revenue and operating profits are earned in the second half of the year. The downward trend seen in 1991 and 1992 has been reversed and the company is now growing and growing profitably.' Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said: 'The position in the UK improved in the second quarter. In the third quarter that improvement was maintained. 'It is still a market that is patchy and the all-important fourth quarter at this stage is still wide open.' He added that the improved level of orders in the UK should compensate for any shortfalls in France and Belgium. The company is watching developments in the planned privatisation of London Transport Advertising, the London Transport department that is the capital's largest poster contractor and generates sales of Pounds 23m a year. 'They would certainly offer a very interesting opening in the London market,' said Mr Gore-Andrews, adding that the company's bus shelter business would not be affected. Mr Gore-Andrews said tobacco advertising now accounted for 7 per cent of turnover in Belgium and about 6 per cent in Britain, but the company had acted to minimise the impact of any possible ban throughout Europe. 'The job of our marketing has been to broaden the base of customer demand in all our markets, so that we are not too dependent on one sector.' Currency fluctuations translated revenue falls in local currencies into revenue gains in sterling in both France and Belgium. The Belgian business turned in operating profits down at Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 1.32m), in spite of an increase in sites. Turnover was Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 5.49m). Mr Turnbull said last year's 'fairly drastic cost cutting measures' had helped the French activities lift operating profits to Pounds 603,000 (Pounds 263,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.42m). Operations in Taiwan posted a 'useful' Pounds 148,000 operating profit against last time's Pounds 28,000 loss. Turnover was Pounds 494,000 (Pounds 1.23m). In the UK and Ireland, the company's main market, a sales increase to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 16.5m) resulted in an operating profit of Pounds 958,000 (Pounds 241,000), with the number of sites increased by 170. Interest charges fell to Pounds 744,000 (Pounds 857,000). The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.2p, payable from earnings per share ahead to 4.4p (2.1p).</p>

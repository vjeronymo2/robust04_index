			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLEMAN SUES HIS MOTHER FOR MALICIOUS  PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Actor Gary Coleman filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit Friday in Los Angeles  against his mother, two days after a judge turned down her attempt to have a  conservator appointed to take control of his affairs.  </P> <P> Coleman, former star of the television sitcom "Diff'rent Strokes," claims  Edmonia Sue Coleman knew the claims she made in the conservatorship petition --  that her son's nearly $7-million estate was being mismanaged and the actor's  kidney condition was not being properly treated -- were false when the court  papers were filed in December, 1989.  </P> <P> Gary Coleman's suit claims his mother sought a trustee for him in retaliation  for a separate lawsuit he filed last June against her and others, accusing them  of misappropriating $1 million from his estate from 1985 to 1988. Gary  Coleman's new suit asks for $25,000 in damages.  </P></p>

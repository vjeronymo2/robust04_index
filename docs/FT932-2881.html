			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Bundesbank to question Waigel MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, is expected to be closely questioned on the critical state of the country's public finances at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. The 16-man council, which will also review interest rates and the state of the economy, will seek assurances from the minister that spending will be cut. Although Mr Waigel is regarded as a lame duck in Frankfurt, his renewed attempts to cut expenditure are seen as the key to a resumption of the Bundesbank's interest rate reductions. Ballooning government deficits, and a borrowing requirement expected to reach DM150bn (Pounds 60.9bn) this year after DM130bn in 1992, are now the main obstacles to further moves. Signals from the central bank yesterday suggested that the internationally important 7.25 per cent discount rate would not be reduced. In the morning the bank left the securities repurchase rate, at which it supplies funds to the banking system, unchanged for the sixth week in succession. Mr Waigel's credibility suffered when the government's first attempt at savings resulted in a hefty package of tax increases, against Bundesbank urgings. It was damaged further when he later found a DM100bn hole in the government's expected revenues, and then tried to leave Bonn via a failed bid to become prime minister of Bavaria.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Fahrudin Behic] </F>   [Text] Unfortunately I have to send you bad news from  Gorazde. After 10,000 shells of all calibers, after superhuman  fighting and unprecedented heroism of the defenders, the defense  line has been breached in the southern part of the battlefield  on the right bank of the Drina. The situation is exceptionally  dramatic, while fresh columns of refugees are moving into the  town center from villages on the right bank.    The villages of Ahmovici, Uhotici, Kodzaga Polje, and some  other villages from this area have been emptied of their  inhabitants. Many civilians have been killed. Those who have  succeeded in getting out in the face of strong aggressor forces,  are trying to cross to the left bank and have somehow get into  the town. In the town, however, the situation is extremely  dramatic.    At about 1900, artillery shelling intensified. Howitzer  shells are being used to systematically target houses one by one  in Vitkovici, (Vaci), and (Vinarici). Many people have been  killed. It is not possible to get information from the military  hospital because everyone is involved there in giving help to  the injured.    Infantry attacks also intensified at 2000 on the southern  approaches to the town. No one knows what things will look like  and what will happen in the night ahead. If anyone wants to  help Gorazde they should do so immediately. For many people  here tomorrow will be too late.</p>

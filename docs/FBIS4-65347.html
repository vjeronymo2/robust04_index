			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karl-Ludwig Guensche: "Wanted: A Place for </F> Russia in Europe"]    [Text] Bonn -- Karl Lamers, the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group's foreign  policy expert, has spoken out for reconsidering the West's  support for Russia. In a paper entitled "How To Help Russia? --  Ways and Limitations of Supporting the Reform Process," he says  that Russia's preconditions for transferring to a democratic  constitutional state and a market economy have "clearly  deteriorated as a result of the parliamentary elections and the  continuing economic crisis." Millions of people in Russia today  associate reform policy with instability, supply shortages,  unemployment, high crime rates, a declining international  reputation, and the loss of Russia's superpower status. Europe,  and Germany in particular, is especially interested in a stable,  economically sound, and predictable neighbor to the east. Help  for Russia, therefore, means "an active security and peace  policy." Yet, Western support can only be effective if Russia  itself does everything it can to promote the reform process,  Lamers emphasized. "The country does not need fewer, but more  reforms." The West must be prepared to be Russia's partner and  to install a network of friendly cooperation between the  European Union, NATO, and Russia. But it must also be prepared  to show Russia its place. "Claims to special rights and looking  for special ways do not help Russia." Although Russia must find  a place in Europe that is appropriate to its size, "being part  of the new Europe also means giving up its superior role, not  insisting on special rights vis-a-vis its neighbors."    Unless Russia answers the central question as to whether it  wants to be a "national state or an empire," as long as it  considers its role of world power more important than  establishing an efficient administration, a modern economy, and  a social security system, the country will not come to rest, the  CDU/CSU expert warns. That is why further financial aid to  Russia -- especially by the IMF -- should not be granted as "an  advance signal of trust, but only as an acknowledgment of  reforms effected so far." Otherwise, this would mean awarding  premiums for "wrong decisions instead of reforms."</p>

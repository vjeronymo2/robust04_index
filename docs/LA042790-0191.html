			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OAKLAND A'S LA RUSSA TRADES WORDS WITH FAN  </P> <P> Oakland A's manager Tony La Russa got involved in some unusual pregame activity  Thursday night when he exchanged angry words with a spectator at Memorial  Stadium.  </P> <P> Chris Watson, 23, of Towson, Md., said La Russa challenged him to a fight.  </P> <P> Watson listed his vital information as 6-foot-3 and 320 pounds; La Russa, 45,  is 6-1 and 190 pounds.  </P> <P> Asked if he had challenged Watson to a fight, La Russa said, "I don't have any  comment." He paused before adding, "He made an uncalled-for family reference."  </P> <P> The incident occurred during Oakland's batting practice, about an hour before  the start of the A's-Orioles game. Watson was sitting with two friends in the  seats alongside the first-base line when La Russa walked past with a baseball  bat in hand.  </P> <P> Watson initiated the exchange by shouting a comment about La Russa's wife.  After a brief, loud conversation that caught the attention of nearby  spectators, La Russa knocked over Watson's beer -- which had been sitting atop  the tarpaulin -- with the handle of his bat.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'I hear you have a good-looking wife,' " Watson said. "He said,  'Do you have a problem with my wife?' Then he said, 'Why don't you step out of  the bleachers, and we'll see what kind of problem you've got.'  </P> <P> "He offered to fight me after the game. He told me to meet him by the bus on  the third-base side, and he said he'd be there.  </P> <P> "That old man thinks he's going to kick my ass? Look at me. He won't kick my  ass. If he hits me, I'll take his paycheck for the year."  </P></p>

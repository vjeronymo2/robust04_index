			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Higher return, no extra risks - The investors / New uses for familiar instruments BACK IN 1987, it was called 'portfolio insurance', and was blamed in large part for the collapse of share prices in New York and, by extension, around the world. Today, it is called 'dynamic asset allocation'. But it all adds up to the same thing: an attempt by investors to use financial derivatives to protect and enhance the value of their assets. Fund managers have traditionally used derivatives for one of two purposes: to protect themselves against losses on assets they are holding; or to shift their exposure between markets quickly and cheaply. Now, a third use of derivatives is taking hold: to generate a higher return from a portfolio without increasing the risk profile. A growing number of hedge funds are on offer to investors, employing trading strategies based on derivatives to boost investment return. Such specialised vehicles are most common in the US, and are slowly becoming fashionable in Europe. Innate conservatism on the part of many investors makes such schemes difficult to sell. 'It is almost impossible to get a German pension fund to use options,' says Mr Jonas Martenson, of the Brussels-based Europtec fund, which claims to have been the first Europe-wide hedge fund a year ago. Institutions in the Netherlands, Sweden and UK are currently the most susceptible to funds that specialise in options trading strategies, he says. A further use of such investment techniques is to tailor the return on a particular portfolio more closely to the fund manager's objectives. 'For fund managers, the question is how you engineer a particular kind of pay-off profile. The whole of option theory is about that,' says Prof Stewart Hodges, director of the financial options research centre at the University of Warwick. At present, however, the bulk of fund managers use derivatives in only a limited way, if at all. Stock index futures remain the main vehicle for hedging equity market exposure, though some institutions have used other ways of putting a floor under their investment portfolios. Royal Insurance in the UK, for instance, paid around Pounds 7m for a put option in the run up to the UK's general election earlier this year, to protect itself against a stock market collapse. Index futures also remain the favourite way of shifting exposure quickly between markets, making it possible to avoid the heavy costs associated with liquidating one equity portfolio and building another. 'If the market is big enough, it is entirely sensible for an institution that wants to take a view, or change a position in a market rapidly, to use futures,' says Mr David Wilkie of consulting actuaries R. Watson. 'You could run a small portfolio without buying any shares at all. It's an economic way of doing it.' However, even this use of derivatives is frowned upon by many investment managers. 'It enables you to take decisions too quickly,' says Mr Peter Stanyer, head of investments at the British Rail pension fund. 'For it to be expensive, and take time to shift assets from one market to another, may be a good thing.' While considerable resistance remains, the institutional obstacles to the use of derivatives by fund managers have largely been dismantled in recent years. The UK provides a good illustration of the advances that have been made - and the drawbacks that remain. The tax position of derivatives was cleared up in the 1990 Finance Act. Last year, the Securities and Investment Board produced rules on 'efficient portfolio management', outlining when the use of futures and options was an acceptable practice. And earlier this year, the London Financial Futures and Options Exchange published valuation guidelines intended to standardise performance measurement for fund managers which use futures and options. In practice, however, considerable obstacles and doubts remain. Liffe's recommendation on the valuation of options, for instance, is not universally accepted. 'They shouldn't be valued at market value, but on prudent lines,' says Mr Wilkie. At the moment, 'different companies do it different ways and no one has thought a lot about it,' he complains. Nor have the SIB's regulations made it clear in all circumstances when investment managers can use derivatives. It requires 'congruence' between an underlying investment and a derivative used to hedge it - a vague term that has the managers of unit trusts (open-ended mutual funds) scratching their heads. Some have interpreted it to mean, for instance, that an equity investor should not buy an index future unless its underlying portfolio has at least a 90 per cent correlation to the index - highly unlikely for anyone except the manager of an index-tracking fund. Further interpretation of regulations lies ahead: the European Community's third life assurance directive, for instance, will limit use of derivatives to hedging, not speculation. Drawing the line between the two is likely to exercise regulators' minds further. While uncertainties like these remain, many investment managers and trustees continue to stay away from the derivative markets, prefering not to bridge the psychological (and educational) divide. The psychological resistance stems in part from the fact that fund managers are generally judged against their peers, rather than in the light of their absolute investment return. 'Fund managers all want to be part of the herd,' says Prof Hodges. 'They are all worried about tracking errors.' When markets move sideways or down, that defensive approach to investment management may no longer hold sway. Such an approach, however, is still a long way off.</p>

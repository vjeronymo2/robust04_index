The spy suspect was identified only as Yi Pok-hon, age 32.    An NSP official said on Thursday Yi fled the country in  April  1990 soon after he was placed on a wanted list on swindle  charges.    Later in September 1991 he joined the "Asia Sharon," a  criminal organization, based in Dacca, Bangladesh, and worked  for North Korea while at the criminal ring, the official said.    Yi is suspected of having entered North Korea six times from  April 1992 through November 1993 to receive espionage training  and instructions.    The official said he was first picked up by North Korea in  April 1992 when he called at the Pyongyang Embassy in Bangkok to  solicit its help in giving shooting training to "Asia Sharon"  gangsters.    The instructions he received from North Korea were to  assassinate anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over bosses of  organized criminal rings in South Korea.    The NSP official said Yi gave 1.5 million dollars to North  Korea for giving military training to "Asia Sharon" members and  also supplied some espionage items such as forged passports,  visa cards and traveler's checks to Pyongyang.    He is further alleged to have arranged a contract for the  sale of 500 million dollars' worth of North Korean weapons to a  guerrila organization in a Southeast Asian country.    Yi was arrested by public security authorities of China on  last March 8, deported to Korea and was carried away by the NSP  on arrival at Kimpo Airport.</p>

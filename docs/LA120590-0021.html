			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMIRALS PUNISHED FOR NOT AIRING JET PROGRAM FLAWS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: CAPTAIN ALSO REMOVED. CHENEY WAS UPSET ABOUT NOT BEING INFORMED OF  $1-BILLION OVERRUN, DELAYS.  </P> <P> The Navy said Tuesday that it has removed three senior military officers,  including a vice admiral who oversees naval aviation programs, because they  failed to report serious flaws in the secret A-12 attack aircraft program.  </P> <P> An investigation report released by the Navy concluded that information about a  projected $1-billion overrun and a one-year delay of the A-12 development  program never reached Defense Secretary Dick Cheney when he undertook a major  review of the A-12 and other programs last March and April.  </P> <P> Within weeks of issuing upbeat findings and testifying to Congress in late  April that the program was in good shape, Cheney was left embarrassed by the  disclosure by the A-12's prime contractors that the aircraft program faced  major financial and schedule problems.  </P> <P> The punishment issued against the three Navy officials is among the most severe  in recent history. Vice Adm. Richard C. Gentz, commander of the Naval Air  Systems Command, will retire no later than Feb. 1, 1991, the Navy said. The  A-12 program executive officer, Rear Adm. John F. Calvert, and the program  manager, Capt. Lawrence G. Elberfeld, have been reassigned to other duties and  received letters of censure from Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III.  </P> <P> The Navy report found that senior Navy officers erred by failing to anticipate  substantial cost overruns on the A-12 and failing to warn of greater risks in  the program in meetings with Defense Department officials. An independent  Pentagon analyst found after two days of study that the program would incur a  $1-billion overrun, but that information did not reach Cheney either.  </P> <P> A little more than a month after Cheney completed his rosy review of the A-12,  the two firms jointly developing and producing the attack plane, McDonnell  Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., warned the Pentagon of impending  financial disaster. The companies then disclosed to investors on June 11 that  they would post major losses in the program when they reported their  second-quarter results.  </P> <P> The Navy report concluded that the two firms were "overly optimistic" in their  cost projections to the Navy before their disclosures. It said the companies'  program managers "perceived significant pressures from upper management" to  keep up the flow of cash to the program by being optimistic about its progress.  </P> <P> The controversy goes to the heart of a longstanding problem in defense  procurement, in which deficiencies in weapons programs are suppressed and left  to fester secretly, until their disclosure creates political bombshells.  </P> <P> Despite repeated reforms, critics contend that the military services  chronically withhold politically damaging information in an effort to protect  their budgets and their programs. Indeed, the Navy report concludes: "Unless  means can be found to solve this abiding cultural problem, the failures  evidenced in this report can be anticipated to occur again in the same or  similar form."  </P> <P> "This is a clear signal to anyone in acquisition that the bad news has to come  up the ladder," a senior Navy official said Tuesday. "If it doesn't, then  you're out of here."  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, the nation's two largest defense firms,  are developing the A-12 under a fixed-price contract awarded in June, 1986,  which carried a ceiling price of $4.78 billion. Costs above the ceiling were to  be borne by the two firms.  </P> <P> The carrier-based A-12 Avenger, which will use stealth technology to evade  enemy radar, would replace the existing A-6 Intruder fleet in attack bombing  missions. The aircraft, which is being assembled in Tulsa, Okla., could  eventually cost $100 million each to produce.  </P> <P> The overruns and the high price tag are expected to generate increasing  political pressures against the program.  </P> <P> The Defense Acquisition Board, a panel of senior defense executives that  controls major programs, will review the future of the A-12 program Friday.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics have been pressing for major concessions  in their contracts that would essentially bail them out of losses that will  reach more than $500 million for each firm. With the schedule problems facing  the two firms, a delay in full-scale production is likely.  </P> <P> A McDonnell spokeswoman said the company "is in the process of reviewing the  inspector general's report with our partners at General Dynamics. We have  solved the technical issues in the program and believe we have an excellent  aircraft and plan to deliver that aircraft under the direction of the Navy's  new management team. We remain committed to progress and successful completion  of this very critical program."  </P> <P> But the Navy report indicates that the program was long troubled and remained  so until earlier this year.  </P> <P> The report found that "there was early evidence of trouble affecting the  production schedule." By the summer of 1989, the Navy's program manager had  indications that the first flight date of June, 1990, would be missed.  </P> <P> Aircraft tooling should have been in place by December, 1989, and aircraft  assembly started, but they were not. The firms, meanwhile, overestimated their  ability to recover, displaying at best "a plain lack of objectivity," the  report said.  </P> <P> The aircraft was much heavier than designed. Stop-work orders were issued to  redesign parts for lower weight. Production was continually delayed. Parts were  in short supply. Although production reports going to the Navy should have  indicated all of these problems, nobody was paying attention, the Navy probe  found.  </P> <P> The Navy even paid the firms for work that was not complete, the study found.  And finally, the Navy exercised a $1.2-billion production option for six  aircraft on May 31, 1990, even though senior officials were "aware of recent  information indicating significant cost schedule and technical risk not  previously displayed to senior management."  </P> <P> Garrett blamed the failure to provide accurate cost and scheduling estimates to  Cheney not on the Navy's procurement system but rather on "errors of judgment  and failures within the program management chain of supervision," according to  a memorandum he sent to Cheney Nov. 29. The memorandum was released Tuesday.  </P> <P> Congress is sure now to question whether Garrett himself, along with  Undersecretary of Defense John Betti, exercised poor judgment or may have been  involved in a cover-up.  </P> <P> Cheney, who said he found the Navy investigation report disturbing, asked  Donald J. Atwood, deputy defense secretary, to review the A-12 program and the  individuals involved. Recommendations are expected as early as next week.  </P> <P> Also released Tuesday were findings by the Defense inspector general that were  highly critical of Betti for putting too much credence in "general assurances"  by the contractors that the project could be completed on time and within the  cost ceiling.  </P> <P> Gaylord Christle, deputy director for cost management under Betti, was asked  March 26 to conduct an independent cost analysis of the A-12. Within two days,  he concluded that it was headed for a $1-billion overrun, according to a letter  from Inspector General Susan J. Crawford to Rep. Andy Ireland (R-Fla.).  </P> <P> But Christle's analysis -- completed about one month before Cheney's public  announcement April 27 of the upbeat findings in his so-called major aircraft  review -- was never provided to the defense secretary, Crawford's letter says.  </P> <P> The Navy report referred to Christle's analysis as a "last-minute effort" and  said that, even though Christle briefed Navy officials on his finding, they  were not aware of its significance.  </P> <P> It was Ireland who called for the probe after he questioned why Cheney  testified to the committee that the A-12 was in good shape only weeks before  the contractors disclosed that the program was a year behind schedule and far  over its contract ceiling. Ireland said Tuesday that the House Armed Services  Committee would hold hearings on the incident as early as next month.  </P> <P> Ireland said the inspector general's report illustrates fundamental flaws in  the practice of military program managers relying on contractors for their cost  estimates. In an interview, he said that suppressing negative information is a  widespread problem.  </P> <P> "It is very typical of the Defense Department," Ireland said. "You have all  these people with vested interests -- not only their personal careers. So many  of our programs are literally jobs programs that they have a life of their own.  </P> <P> "Within the bureaucracy, nobody wants to take responsibility. So they don't  pass the information on."  </P></p>

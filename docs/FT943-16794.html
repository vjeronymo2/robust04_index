			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Vendome slips 5% to SFr431.5m Vendome, the Dunhill and Cartier luxury goods group, saw pre-tax profits slip 5 per cent to SFr431.5m (Pounds 196.1m) in the year to March. In sterling terms profits were up 3 per cent. Lord Douro, deputy chairman, said: 'Considering the very difficult economic conditions around the world the fact that both companies maintained their positions is a very remarkable achievement.' Turnover amounted to SFr2.6bn, against SFr2.5bn. These are the first annual results since the group was created from the merger of the luxury goods interests of Rothmans, Dunhill and Richemont. It is now 70 per cent owned by Richemont, a Swiss holding company. In addition to SFr48.6m of costs directly related to the reconstruction, it resulted in a number of non-recurring items which affected profits. These included royalty income which will not recur following the sale of the Dunhill tobacco trademarks to Rothmans and the unwinding of Dunhill's currency hedging arrangement. Excluding all these factors the company said operating profits would have slipped only 0.6 per cent in Swiss francs against the 5.3 per cent fall reported. Mr Joe Kanoui, chairman, said the merger of Cartier with Dunhill had gone well. 'When the merger was announced some Dunhill shareholders were worried about a possible culture clash. But there has been a smooth integration of people who are learning from each other's culture.' Lord Douro, formerly chairman of Dunhill, said it had performed better than he expected a year ago. He said economic conditions had improved over the year, particularly in the US and Europe, although the recovery in its important Japanese market remained 'uncertain'. 'It would be premature to assume any durable recovery in the majority of the principal markets,' Mr Kanoui said. Because of a fall in the tax charge, which will remain below the normal 25 per cent level for another year, earnings per unit were 21.9p. There is a single gross dividend of SFr0.18, which shareholders can receive as a net UK dividend of 6.94p excluding any associated tax credit. See Lex and International Companies</p>

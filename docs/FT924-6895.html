			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Insider dealing bill criticised DIRECTORS whose companies build a stake in another company in advance of launching a takeover bid could become guilty of a criminal offence if the government goes ahead with proposed legislation, the Institute of Directors and the Law Society claimed yesterday. In the latest broadside against the proposed new insider dealing law now passing through parliament, the two organisations added that directors could be liable to prosecution under a wide range of circumstances, such as when their companies bought their own shares in the stock market. The concern focuses on the exemption in Schedule 2(3) of the Criminal Justice Bill, which would apply to anyone who dealt with insider information which was deemed to be 'market information'. The exemption was added to the bill only a month ago after an outcry in the City. However, in a letter to Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, the IoD warned that the exemption from prosecution would not protect company directors. Mr Bill Knight, chairman of the Law Society's company law committee, said the exemption was inadequate because it applied only to dealings that were 'reasonable'. He said: 'We cannot know in advance what is reasonable.' The exemption also fails to protect underwriters, Mr Knight added. As a result, they could find themselves open to prosecution when they agree to take on underwriting commitment on the basis of unpublished information. The Treasury has tried to calm market fears by announcing that it would issue guidance on how the law would be applied.</p>

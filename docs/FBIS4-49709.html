			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Farm Plan Aims To Maximize Production"] </F>   [Text] In a major effort to stem the continuing shrinkage  of arable farmland, the government has mapped out a nationwide  agricultural zoning programme that will specify how farmland is  to be used.    Designed to coordinate the use of agricultural resources, it  focuses on tapping all available land to boost farm output.    Under the plan, which is to be unveiled later this year, 10  major farming regions have been targeted for the production of  grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat.    They are administered by the state and are located in  Northeast China's Three Rivers Plain (Heilongjiang,  Songhuajiang, and Usuli Rivers) and Songhua-Liao Rivers Plain,  the region of Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River, the  northern region of East China, and the middle and lower reaches  of the Yangtze River.    The state-level development zones cover 15 provinces and  municipalities and account for 39.2 percent of the country's  total farmland involving 36.6 percent of total population.    In addition, 16 areas have been selected as provincial-level  development zones, according to Zhang Qiaoling, director of the  Department of Agricultural Regional Planning under the Ministry  of Agriculture.    Priorities include upgrading the country's vast low-yield  farmland and developing unused land, Zhang said yesterday.    "There is great potential for in-depth development of  agricultural resources in the country through boosting the per  hectare output of all available land," she said.    According to Zhang, low-yield land covers 86.7 million  hectares or 86 percent of the country's arable land, 78 percent  of its aquatic farms, and a quarter of its woodlands.    A recently concluded three-year survey by the Agricultural  Ministry and other departments shows that of China's 100 million  hectares of farmland, 20 million hectares have poor soil, 20  million hectares suffer from water shortages, 13.3 million  hectares are barren hilly terrain and 3.3 million hectares are  saline-alkali soil.    Yet many of these areas can be transformed through new  farming techniques that will increase output by as much as 100  percent, she said.    But she added the country can only improve a small portion  of  its waste land, uncultivated hills, shoals, and offshore waters  for agricultural use.    Based on the survey results, the government's development  scheme will coordinate resources to maximize agricultural output.    The 10 zones set up so far each has a blueprint covering  harvesting, animal husbandry, rural industry, farm machinery,  forestry, water and soil conservation, groundwater, feeds, and  mineral fertilizers.    Zhang said that in the past, resources have been wasted or  exploited because of lack of coordination.    And in the past few years, more farmland has been taken over  by industry and residential development, she said.    Some 133,000 hectares of farmland are also lost each year to  natural disasters while a total of 26.7 million hectares of  grassland have become less productive or barren because of  overuse, the survey said.    According to Zhang, at least 123 million hectares of arable  land -- at the current per hectare output -- are needed to feed  and clothe China's population by the year 2000, which stands at  about 1.2 billion at present.    To compensate for this deficit -- China has 100 million  hectares of arable land -- the government plans to boost the  output of 33.3 million hectares of low and medium-yield fields  by the year 2000.    Over 3 million hectares of wasteland and barren land will  also be reclaimed under the programme's first phase.</p>

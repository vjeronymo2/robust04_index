			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Merger will create Japan's largest paper manufacturer JUJO PAPER and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, two leading Japanese paper producers, yesterday announced a merger that will create the country's largest papermaker. The merger follows two difficult years for the Japanese paper industry, which rapidly expanded production capacity during the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s, only to find demand and prices falling sharply last year. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that it will investigate trading in the shares of Jujo and Sanyo-Kokusaku, as prices of both companies rose sharply in a variable market before the exchange suspended trading in the stocks. Jujo had risen Y26 to Y536 and Sanyo-Kokusaku by Y27 to Y578. Jujo, the third-ranking company, and Sanyo-Kokusaku, fifth-ranked, reported sharp profit falls of 49 per cent and 68 per cent respectively last fiscal year, despite cuttingproduction costs and bolstering earnings with sales of securities. Executives of the two companies said the paper market had been damaged by 'excessive competition' and that the yet-to-named new company, to be formed next April, would rationalise production facilities and 'stabilise the paper industry'. However, like all Japanese companies, the new management will find it difficult to reduce its workforce. Miss Caroline Stone, paper industry specialist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the merger could take five years to produce positive results. 'It is very difficult in Japan for management to reduce staff. Apart from sheer size, it is difficult to see what Jujo paper will gain from Sanyo-Kokusaku. Perhaps it is just the attraction of being the biggest,' Miss Stone said. The likely emergence of Jujo as the largest company in the industry is a blow to Oji Paper, the present market leader, as Jujo was separated from Oji group - a member of the Mitsui family of companies - after the Second World War in an attempt to rid Japan of its monopolies. After the planned merger, Jujo-Sanyo will have a 17 per cent market share and Oji about 16 per cent. In the late 1960s, Oji, Jujo and Honshu, another original member of the Oji group, planned to reunite, but the move was opposed by Japan's Fair Trade Commission. The announcement of the agreement comes 20 years after the merger that created Sanyo-Kokusaku itself. The company still shows signs of having been unable to blend the separate management structures. Mergers in Japan often result in disillusionment among workers in the smaller partner, who feel at a disadvantage in the new hierarchy. Under the agreement announced yesterday, the president of the new company will be Mr Takeshiro Miyashita, the Jujo president, while the more ceremonial post of chairman will go to Mr Choji Kuramochi, the current chairman of Sanyo-Kokusaku, which will essentially be dissolved. The problems in Japan's paper industry, forced this year to cut production levels to reduce inventory, were also highlighted yesterday by reports of a restructuring at Daishowa Paper, the second-largest maker, which had been ordered by its banks to reduce debt through asset sales. Japanese paper companies are known for supporting their often weak operating profits with sales of securities or property holdings, but the continuing downturn in both the stock and property markets has limited these sources of funds. Daishowa's banks are understood to have asked the Saito family, which oversees the company, to increase their investment to strengthen its financial position.</p>

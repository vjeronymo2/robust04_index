			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>   [Text] At mass rallies held in the capitals of Malema and  Lalaua Districts of Nampula Province today, President of the  Republic Joaquim Chissano said the promoters of war in  Mozambique have begun to return to the country, because they are  convinced conditions have already been created to take the reins  of power. Speaking to large crowds, Chissano mentioned the cases  of Portuguese nationals currently residing in South Africa and  Portugal as the ones returning to Mozambique, where they have  launched a campaign to discredit the Mozambican Government.  Chissano said the campaign is based on the old colonial  principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves.  He said such people have always backed Renamo [Mozambique  National Resistance] in the destruction of Mozambique, though  they never believed in the capacity of Afonso Dhlakama's  movement to govern anything.    The president of the republic said the destruction of the  town of Lalaua, while it was under Renamo occupation for 45 days  beginning July 1991, was ordered by those who have never  accepted the country's independence. Chissano was referring to  people who abandoned Mozambique before and after independence to  settle in Portugal.    The president of the republic warned the residents of the  two  towns that in the current multiparty system there are people who  promote campaigns on behalf of their parties, promising to  resolve the nation's problems in a short period of time.    Chissano's speeches in Malema and Lalaua focused on peace,  national reconciliation, and hard work on the basis of unity of  all Mozambicans from north to south of the country. The  Mozambican head of state accused those who claim that the  Mozambique Government is formed mainly by southerners, of  promoting division in the country. Chissano said that that was  not true, giving as an example the various ministers included in  his delegation who come from different parts of the country.  Chissano added: Frelimo chooses competent people for  government posts, regardless of their ethnic origin.    Malema residents demanded from Joaquim Chissano that  passenger services be revamped along the recently renovated  Nacala railroad. Nampula residents often travel on tank cars and  rail cars. The residents also complained about serious cases of  police brutality at railroad stations. Asked to explain the  lack of passenger coaches, the director general of the  Mozambique Railroad enterprise said that there were 200  passenger coaches in 1975, but today there are only 46  throughout the country. The others, he said, were destroyed  during the war. Chissano commented on this issue, saying: those  who destroyed the rail cars should buy them, instead of asking  us for money.    As in his visits to Gaza, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, the  president of the republic urged Malema and Lalaua residents to  vote in large numbers during the October elections to choose the  best representatives of the Mozambican society for the future  government.    Chissano returned to the city of Nampula this evening.  Tomorrow, he is scheduled to leave for Nacala where he will  assess the damage caused by the Nadia cyclone and address a mass  rally. Chissano will meet the province's businessmen after his  return from Nacala.</p>

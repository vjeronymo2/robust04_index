Both leaders expressed satisfaction over Sino-Finnish ties  and said they are ready to further promote the all-round  development of the political, economic and trade relations  between China and Finland.    Li said his visit is the first of its kind by China's CPPCC  chairman to Europe and the purpose is to deepen mutual  understanding, expand exchanges and enhance cooperation.    The Chinese leader is currently on an official goodwill  visit  to five European countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark  and Belgium.    China and Finland are far off in distance but enjoy close  links, Li said, adding that both countries have tremendous  potentials for mutual cooperation.    On his part, President Ahtisaari said Finland and China have  been enjoying sound relations, which have not been affected by  changing international situation.    He stressed that finland is fully understanding the Chinese  Government's efforts to define its policy according to China's  own historic and practical conditions.    In a meeting with Finnish Parliament Speaker Riitta  Uosukainen, Li said that China, which is deepening reform and  accelerating its opening to the outside world, can learn a lot  from Finland especially in advanced technology and management  expertise.    Uosukainen said the Finnish Government attached great  importance to its relations with China, to China's viewpoints  and the will of the Chinese people.    While Finland needs to strengthen its ties with the European  Union, she said, it is even more willing to enhance its  friendship and cooperation with China.</p>

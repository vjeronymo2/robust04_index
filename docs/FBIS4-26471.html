			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The U.N.  Security Council approved today a French initiative of sending  troops to Rwanda on a humanitarian mission despite strong  opposition from Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who has claimed  that such an intervention is against the U.N.-back Arusha  agreement.    The Tutsi-dominated RPF said the Arusha peace agreement,  which was signed in August, 1993, permitted no foreign military  presence in Rwanda, thus it regarded sending French troops to  Rwanda as a violation of the agreement.    The vote on the initiative is 10-0, with five abstentions by  China, Brazil, Pakistan, New Zealand and Nigeria.    Under the resolution, France will deploy as early as  Thursday  [23 June] a French-commanded 2,700 French and Senegalese troops  in Rwanda with the mandate of saving lives and setting up safe  havens for refugees. The mission will last two months.    The Council said in the resolution that is was deeply  concerned by the continued slaughter of civilians and by an  expected delay of at least two months before all U.N.  peacekeeping troops can be deployed.    Speaking to reporters after the Council meeting, Gerald  Gahima, spokesman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) said the  Council resolution was "totally unacceptable."    The United Nations may have its "choice" of sending troops  to  Rwanda, but it has also to bear the "responsibility" for its  action.    He demanded the U.N. withdrawal from Rwanda the U.N.  Assistance Mission for Rwanda (Unamir) because the mission had  become groundless for U.N. violation of the Arusha agreement.  [sentence as received]    "We can not handle with two forces at one time," he said.    The RPF has long accused France siding with the  Hutu-dominated government and said the French Government trained  the Hutu presidential guard, which has done most of the killings  since April, after the Rwandan president was killed in a plane  crash.    China said, before the Council's voting, that gaining  support  and cooperation from warring parties is an indispensable  condition for the success of any U.N. peacekeeping operation.    Since there was no assurances of cooperation from the  warring  parties, China would abstain the draft resolution, said Chen  Jian, deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.    Chen also reminded Council members of the lesson of the U.N.  mission in Somali, which has been widely regarded as a U.N.  failure in injecting forces without the consent of the warring  parties.</p>

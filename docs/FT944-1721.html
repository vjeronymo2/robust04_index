			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television Like many winning formulas, Picture This (10pm BBC2) is so simple you wonder why nobody thought of it before. Prompted by a miner's disdainful remark (nemesis later strikes) about lavatory-cleaning, the programme constructs a chain (no pun intended) of apparently undesirable jobs, throwing up much professional pride and personal integrity. The toilet cleaner in turn would never stoop to prostitution - cue a prostitute (Central Casting stuff, this: a dominatrix with all the gear) who whips her punters but hates cruelty to animals: cue a sympathetic abattoir-worker, and so on. The absence of television critics from this display of fragile dignity makes a curious omission. The stale flavour of cliche permeates Milner (9.30 BBC1): the seedy investigative lawyer with marriage problems, snooty colleagues, seeming inadequacy - the formulaic anti-hero, in fact. Mel Smith tries to make it as a straight actor, amiable but not really convincing, supported by an unexciting cast of decent second-raters.</p>

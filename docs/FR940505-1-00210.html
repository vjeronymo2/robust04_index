			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For flexibility, EPA is also proposing optional engine-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for diesel-powered and incomplete vehicle engines used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in MDVs with GVWR between 8,501 and 14,000 pounds. (Under CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle control program, such MDV engines have the option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to certify to engine-based standards.) Manufacturers of such MDV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines may elect to comply with the chassis-based program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in this section or they may elect to certify to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine-based standards described in Section B. of this appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reader is directed to that section for more information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed engine-based standards and other MDV/engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Authority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As explained above in Section III.A.2.a of the preamble, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating a FIP under section 110(c), EPA may take any actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the state could take. As section 209 of the CAA provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that California is not preempted from adopting and implementing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle emissions control program provided its program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfies the criteria of section 209(b), EPA believes that it,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acting on behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a motor vehicle program or supplement California's own motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of section 209(b) for a waiver of federal preemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That section provides that EPA is to grant California a waiver of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preemption if the State determines that its standards ``will be,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare as applicable federal standards.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 209(b) further provides that no waiver is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted if EPA finds that (A) the determination of the State that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health and welfare as the otherwise applicable federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is arbitrary and capricious, (B) State standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) the State standards and accompanying enforcement procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not consistent with section 202(a). EPA has interpreted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency criterion as meaning that California motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and accompanying enforcement procedures must satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leadtime requirements of section 202(a)_that they be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologically feasible within the leadtime provided, taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account the cost of compliance_and not impose inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification test procedure requirements such that the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle could not be used to comply with both state and federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements (see e.g., 43 FR 32182 (July 25,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978), 40 FR 30131 (July 18, 1975), 43 FR 1839 (January 12,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the enhanced in-use compliance program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light and medium-duty vehicles that would be applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and engines in California under the proposed FIP would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the section 209 waiver criteria. Thus, California could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake the enhanced in-use compliance program described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this appendix, and, therefore, EPA has authority under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 110(c) to undertake the proposed programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standards are at least as protective as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise applicable federal standards (e.g., the Tier 1 NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMHC standards in the case of light-duty vehicles and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally applicable NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and NMHC standards in the case of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and engines covered by the medium-duty and heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of the enhanced in-use compliance program). Indeed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these standards are at least as stringent as the comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that California has already adopted and for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waivers have already been granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the need to meet compelling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 209(b) (see, e.g., 49 FR 18887 and 18890 (May 3, 1984),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58 FR 4144 (January 13, 1993)). Moreover, the magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, including mobile source emissions (discussed above in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III.H.2 of the preamble), provides ample evidence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for more stringent motor vehicle emission standards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 202(a), EPA believes that its proposed enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance program is consistent with both the technological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility and certification elements of that criterion. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reasons explained below, EPA believes that the enhanced in-use compliance program is technologically feasible within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leadtime provided, taking into account the cost of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, no aspect of the enhanced in-use compliance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes any new certification test procedures that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with either existing federal or California test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure requirements. Consequently, EPA believes that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed enhanced in-use compliance programs satisfy this prong  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 209 as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Enhanced In-use Compliance Recall Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, EPA has enforced emissions standards through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an in-use testing program commonly referred to as the ``recall''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program (39 FR 44375, Dec. 23, 1974), as provided by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 207(c) of the CAA. This section requires manufacturers to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedial actions if EPA finds that a ``substantial'' number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, although properly maintained and used, fail to conform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an applicable emissions standard during their useful life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing a recall program under the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance program that is different in several aspects compared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the program established pursuant to CAA section 207(c) for 49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state vehicles and engines. The differences and the rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for them are described fully in the paragraphs below. The recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions described in this section apply to 1999 and later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duty vehicles certified to the chassis-based standards described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the previous section. These recall provisions also apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-highway HDEs and nonroad engines, except as noted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall provisions contained in section B for HDEs and section C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonroad engines below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has based the enhanced in-use compliance recall program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on its current recall program, where possible. Thus, aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program not specifically discussed here will be the same as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the current program (see 40 CFR part 85 subpart S). For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, all test procedures utilized will be current Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, with the exception of ambient temperatures used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evaporative emission and running loss testing and the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in all testing. EPA will utilize CARB's ambient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures and CARB Phase II reformulated gasoline in recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If CARB decides to enforce the enhanced in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall program and assume responsibility for the recall program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB will likely use its own detailed recall methodologies, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it has received waivers under section 209 of the CAA, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate changes to ensure compliance with the changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below. EPA requests comments on the use of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall practices where not modified below, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible performance of recall testing by CARB using their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed enhanced in-use compliance recall program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in detail in the following sections: (a) Recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards (b) consideration of maintenance, tampering, and abuse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) test vehicle selection, (d) testing throughout the vehicles'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life, (e) vehicle family selection, (f) criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring recall, (g) mandatory owner participation in recall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repairs, (h) geographic extent of recall, (i) technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility, and (j) alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: G10, IFIs, the IMF and the gift of the Gab The world's international financial institutions (IFIs) are in the business of making a yawn out of a crisis. The drama surrounding the west's financial bail-out of Russia and the other successor republics of the former Soviet Union is a case in point where one world problem has been dressed up in the most boring language imaginable. The full story involves getting to grips with such financial arcana as the Group of 10 - a club of the world's richest industrial nations that, for reasons that would take too long to explain here, is comprised of 11 countries - and another monetary obscurity, the General Arrangements to Borrow (Gab). Early today in Washington, G10 finance ministers and central bank governors will meet to activate the Gab. This humdrum sentence is a stark warning that putting Russia and the other republics on the road to market capitalism will cost the west dear and could outrun existing financial resources. The Gab, in IFI-speak, is a 'facility' by which the 11 G10 nations can lend currency reserves to the IMF so that it, in turn, can lend more to countries in need. Barring last-minute surprises, the G10 will reach an agreement in principle today to use the Gab to finance a Dollars 6bn IMF stabilisation fund to support the rouble - with the proviso that Russia and other republics using the rouble as their currency comply with strict IMF monetary and economic conditions before they can tap the fund. It will be the first time the Gab has been used to help finance an IMF support programme since 1978 and since the Gab agreement was changed in 1983. Those changes boosted the cash available to the IMF through the GAB to SDR17bn when expressed in the fund's own reserve currency (about Dollars 23.2bn) and allowed its use to support IMF lending to countries other than G10 members. In 1983 Saudi Arabia also agreed to provide SDR1.5bn of credit that could be used with the Gab. The 1983 changes were agreed to give the IMF sufficient resources to deal with the Latin American debt crisis. It is a measure of the fund's current problems that it survived the 1980s without using the GAB and is only now calling on the G10 to assist. The Gab is not activated on trivial grounds. According to IMF rules, the fund's managing director may only draw on the GAB 'if, after consultation, he considers that the fund faces an inadequacy of resources to meet actual and expected requests for financing that reflect the existence of an exceptional situation associated with balance of payments problems of members of a character or aggregate size that could threaten the stability of the international monetary system.' (my italics) Taken at face value, these conditions might suggest the Russians, having renounced communism, now constitute a greater threat to the international monetary system than when the former Soviet Union was pledged to the destruction of the capitalist west. A more plausible explanation for the IMF turning to the G10 is that it is strapped for cash. At first sight, no statement could seem further from the truth. The fund has capital of Dollars 123bn, or SDR90bn, derived from the subscriptions of its member countries. It also has borrowings from Japan and Saudi Arabia to finance special operations. However, the IMF cannot use all its resources to support economic reform because there will always be some members in trouble and so recipients of loans. But its liquidity in recent years has been remarkably stable. At the extreme, it believes it could draw on around 60 per cent of total quotas, or SDR54bn, to meet the needs of its less fortunate members. Adopting a more cautious approach to reflect possible balance of payments problems among fundamentally sound countries, the fund's usable resources based on quotas fall to around SDR40bn. The fund has already loaned about SDR25bn of which about SDR4bn is covered by borrowings that will have to be paid back over the next two to five years. For the time being, the IMF's 'pure liquidity' is estimated at between SDR21bn and SDR22bn. The problem facing Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, is that these funds will be increasingly in demand over the next six to nine months. In 1990, the IMF committed itself to lending between SDR4bn and SDR5bn. Last year the figure went up to SDR10bn and a further SDR10bn of commitments is expected this year. Of these commitments, an estimated SDR7bn to SDR8bn still has to be disbursed. The queue of countries wanting support is growing daily: Russia is in line for a Dollars 4bn IMF standby credit as well as the Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation loan to help fill an estimated financing gap of Dollars 24bn this year. The other 14 former Soviet republics could require total western support of Dollars 20bn in 1992, some of which would come from the fund. India is in the throws of far-reaching market-oriented economic reforms that require and deserve financial support. Southern Africa, with 13 nations suffering from the worst drought this century, will also have big claims on the IMF. The 1990s have so far thrown four great challenges at economic policy makers. German unification, the reform of eastern Europe, the economic transformation of the former Soviet Union and reconstruction after the Gulf War may increase total investment needs by more than Dollars 100bn a year between 1992 and 1996, according to the IMF. Throw into the equation the blocking so far by the US Congress of a quota increase for the fund to lift resources drawn from membership subscriptions by 50 per cent to around SDR136bn, and it is clear why Mr Camdessus has asked the G10 to activate the Gab. One of the few near certainties in an uncertain world, is that the IMF's managing director will be back for more support from his richest member countries before long.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Confusion over County guarantee - Court Report A FORMER County NatWest director yesterday told the Blue Arrow trial that his memory was confused over any guarantee given by County to County NatWest Securities, its market-making co-subsidiary, in connection with CNWS's Blue Arrow stake taken in the 1987 rights issue. Mr James Riddell, then County's financial control director, first told the court he had always believed that no guarantee had been given to CNWS. However, he was challenged by Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting, about references to a guarantee in notes he had written in early November 1987 after discussions with Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor with Travers Smith Braithwaite and one of the defendants. Asked why he had written that a guarantee could not be given to normal market-making stock, Mr Riddell said he did not know. He then said that it was an 'overall statement' which did not go into detail. Later he said: 'You have demonstrated that at the beginning of November I knew that there was one, but the significance of it did not impinge upon me.' Mr Purnell also challenged Mr Riddell on another note written after the discussion with Mr Keat. This said if CNWS had a guarantee its holding could no longer be regarded as trading stock, the market-makers exemption from disclosure would not apply and aggregation would follow. Mr Riddell said he had not considered aggregation was an issue because appropriate legal advice had been taken. He had been looking at the matter in an accounting framework, rather than a legal context. Later, he told Mr Purnell he had understood the guarantee covered any losses in bonuses earned by CNWS traders. Mr Riddell also said that in his discussions with Mr Keat about the end-of-year accounts, he had considered transferring shares from County to NatWest, the parent bank. Asked about a discussion concerning the possible backdating of the documentation for this, Mr Riddell said Mr Keat had told him such tampering with documents was a criminal offence. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OREGON HAS DIFFICULTY OBTAINING CHILD CARE  DEBT  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Oregon attorney general's office said that state may have a  hard time collecting money owed by the Ecclesia Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Members of the controversial religious group that was founded in Los Angeles  owe the state more than $30,000 for care for children of the group, officials  have said.  </P> <P> The state took 53 Ecclesia children into custody in 1988 after the beating  death of Dayna L. Broussard, 8-year-old daughter of group founder Eldridge  Broussard Jr. Four group members were convicted in the death.  </P> <P> A judge ruled in June that the parents must pay for the care.  </P> <P> Phil Lemman of the attorney general's office said last week that the state is  keeping tabs on their employment status. The group has formed a construction  company, Troy's Construction, and is trying to buy property in Portland, Ore.  Lemman said it might be difficult to force the firm to comply with orders that  it withhold wages to meet the state payments.  </P></p>

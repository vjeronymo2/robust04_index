			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Three accused over bomb attack Three men appeared at the Old Bailey in London yesterday charged in connection with an IRA attack last year on a gas holder at Warrington, Cheshire. The assault would have caused the loss of many lives if all the bombs had exploded, the jury heard. Pairic MacFhloinn of Dublin and Denis Kinsella of Nottingham deny causing an explosion likely to endanger life, attempting to murder a policeman, causing him grievous bodily harm with intent, kidnapping a motorist, attempting to murder a policeman in a pursuing car and possessing a firearm with intent last February. Denis Kinsella's uncle John Kinsella, also of Nottingham, denies possessing Semtex with intent. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

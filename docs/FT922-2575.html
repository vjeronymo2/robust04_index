			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Courts Charter to be issued later in year THE Courts Charter, which is due to be discussed at the prime minister's six-monthly seminar on the Citizens' Charter on Friday, is not likely to be ready for publication before the end of the summer. The Lord Chancellor's department, which with the Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for drawing up the new charter guaranteeing standards of service and facilities for court users, said yesterday it was still at an early draft stage. The Lord Chancellor's Department is one of only a handful of government departments which has yet to publish information about standards of public service in its area as part of the charter initiative. The Justice Charter for Scotland, which sets out the standards of service which all users of the Scottish justice system can expect and what will be done if services do not come up to standard, was published as early as last November. The English charter is likely to be modelled on the Scottish version. It sets standards of service for the police, courts, prosecuting authorities and prison service and describes the action being taken to improve the quality of services.</p>

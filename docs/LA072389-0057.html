			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMPING ON BRITAIN;  </P> <P> MOTHER COUNTRY BY MARILYNNE ROBINSON (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $18.95; 261  PP.; 0-374-21361-5)  </P> <P> The announcer of the British Broadcasting Co. radio program, "The World News,"  signs off in a clear and pleasant voice, untroubled by calamity. "This," the  broadcaster says, "is the end of 'The World News.' " It is a phrase easy to  misconstrue. Anthony Burgess, author of "Clockwork Orange," thought so, too.  Another of his books is called "The End of the World News."  </P> <P> American essayist and novelist Marilynne Robinson tells us in "Mother Country,"  her own end-of-the-world news, that Great Britain is the largest commercial  producer of plutonium in the world. Great Britain is also "the largest source,  by far, of radioactive contamination of the world's environment."  </P> <P> Nuclear waste arriving in England from client countries -- Japan, Germany,  Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland and Spain among them -- is likely to enter  England at the port of Dover for transport by train on a diagonal cross-country  journey via London to Cumbria on the shores of the Irish Sea.  </P> <P> There, at Sellafield, on a site shared with Calder Hall, Britain's first, aging  and still-operating nuclear power station (1956), the waste is processed by  government-owned British Nuclear Fuels.  </P> <P> Sellafield is near the Lake District, a countryside so beautiful, one map  exults, "few places can compare." It is Wordsworth country, Beatrix Potter  country, shepherd's country; fells and dales with wonderful names: Windermere,  Buttermere. But the lambs on the deep green hills are radioactive.  </P> <P> At Sellafield -- called Windscale until the disgrace of a major nuclear  accident in 1957 -- the houses are radioactive. So are -- because of 30 years'  contamination, occasional bursts of high emission and irradiated slicks -- the  Irish Sea and its spray, the sand, the seaweed and flotsam, the fish, the boats  and the wind. One in 60 children in nearby Seascale village dies of leukemia, a  rate 1,000 times the national average.  </P> <P> Really.  </P> <P> The nuclear accident at Chernobyl was a boon to Sellafield apologists. Its  fallout, they say, contaminated Cumbrian fields and lambs. No one had tested  local livestock for radiation before Chernobyl; no one, in fact, tested the  livestock for months after. (And the only post-Chernobyl Geiger-counter  readings on the west coast of England were made by a high school science  class.) But Sellafield is closer to Cumbria than Chernobyl is, by many thousand  miles, and "so productive of contamination that there is no reason to look  elsewhere for a source."  </P> <P> What happens at Sellafield? The waste products of British and foreign nuclear  reactors are delivered, cleansed with solvents (if "cleansed" is the right  word), processed to yield usable, salable plutonium and uranium, and disposed  of (if "disposed" is the right word).  </P> <P> Sellafield is part of the power industry (in England a government monopoly)  because it handles the wastes of British reactors which produce power.  Sellafield has a military function because its processing produces  weapons-grade plutonium for British military use. Its civilian cum military  function, Robinson says, "limits its accessibility to EEC (European Economic  Community) inspection, among other advantages."  </P> <P> Britain has long produced its own toxic wastes. It was, after all, the cradle  of the Industrial Revolution. Britain has long imported chemical toxics, for  profitable disposal. Now it has found that disposal of imported nuclear waste  is profitable, too.  </P> <P> Britain's attitude toward virulent waste is relatively carefree. There is no  legal obligation, for instance, to warn developers that a site has been a toxic  dump. There is no restriction on the use of radioactive materials in British  goods. Poisoning the well, Robinson says, is "established practice . . . a bit  of 19th-Century tradition."  </P> <P> According to Robinson and the many journalists whose articles comprise the  20-page Selected Bibliography at the back of "Mother Country," Britain is still  poisoning the well.  </P> <P> "Their solution to the problem," Robinson says, "amounts to extracting as much  usable plutonium and uranium from the waste as they find practicable and  flushing the rest into the sea or venting it through smokestacks into the air.  There are waste silos, some of which leak uncontrollably. In an area called  Driggs, near Sellafield, wastes are buried in shallow earth trenches. Until the  practice was supposedly ended in 1983 by the refusal of the National Union of  Seamen to man the ships, barrels of nuclear waste were dropped routinely into  the Atlantic. In other words, Britain has not solved the problem of nuclear  waste, and has, in fact, greatly compounded it in the course of producing  plutonium in undivulged quantities."  </P> <P> Two kilometers or 1.2 miles offshore, a "lake" of plutonium lies under the  Irish Sea, formed by the million-gallon-a-day discharge from Sellafield's  pipeline. A contaminated slick in 1983 brought radiation to levels ten thousand  times background.  </P> <P> Incredibly, "Sellafield is no secret," yet the press outside Britain does not  report its significance. Despite censure in the world courts, despite local  protest and that of the nearest international neighbors, despite criticism in  the British media, Sellafield is expanding. Sellafield must expand, to handle  the increasing volume of nuclear waste entrusted to it.  </P> <P> "Mother Country" is not itself investigative reporting, but a sequential  interpretation of other people's reportage. It is not a primary work of  science; its data was gathered by British journalists. This second-stage  journalism, from a citizen-of-the-world stunned by what she read in British  newspapers, is a tocsin meant to warn Americans -- or anyone who will listen --  of a grave situation.  </P> <P> How can such things happen? So asks a book-within-the-book where Robinson looks  to the past, even unto Poor Law of the 14th Century, for the secrets of  national character. What does she find? That beneath the famous civility the  British have always wasted lives and credited the idea of human surplus; that  there have in the past been policies of depopulation. That there is a lack "of  positive, substantive personal and political rights." That industrial illness  and accident are common and customary. That there has never been a minimum  wage. That many factors, including the Official Secrets Act, restrict the flow  of information. That the (non-elected) Permanent Civil Service is professional  and very powerful. That bumbling amateurism is still respectable, with chilling  ramifications -- an inability to gather meaningful statistics, for instance, or  to keep track of such crucial documents as half the mortality data on workers  at Windscale. That the citizenry is passive. That it is hard to locate  responsibility, and that profit is motive and justification enough for almost  anything.  </P> <P> With such friends we need no enemies.  </P> <P> When Robinson wrote a novel, she chose to call it "Housekeeping." Now, in this  earnest nonfiction, she is aghast at how Britain's house is kept.  </P></p>

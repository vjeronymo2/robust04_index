			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Turkmens revert to the days of the Khan: The certain result of Sunday's presidential election in Turkmenistan VOTERS go to the polls on Sunday to elect a president in the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan. They know who the winner will be. Mr Saparmurad Niyazov, the former Communist party boss, is standing for a further term and has brooked no opposition. A committee of the republic's compliant ruling council approved his candidacy and allowed no others to register. The state-run newspapers and just about everyone on the streets say no one really minds. Mr Niyazov has clearly instilled fear in the local population - few will criticise him, even privately. The ubiquitous response to anything but routine questions about Mr Niyazov is, 'People don't speak about that.' At the same time, political analysts add that Turkmens look for central, strong leadership, and note that Mr Niyazov won the October 1990 election with 98.3 per cent of the vote. 'If you had all the possible opposition candidates registered, possibly Niyazov's victory would be only 92 per cent,' said a western resident. The Benetton shop in downtown Ashkhabad purveys, for hard currency, a colourful selection of beachwear. And buyers snapped up five new Renaults this month at the former Soviet republic's first western trade fair. But modernity is coming only fitfully to Turkmenistan, which is still ruled largely like the nomadic, desert kingdom it once was. The conservative Mr Niyazov is in many ways as powerful as was the Khan of Merv whom the Bolsheviks destroyed. Turkmenistan's series of Khans had power of life and death over their subjects before the 20th century. 'Communism here was just the old feudalism in red colours,' said a Russian who grew up in Ashkhabad. 'Now the system has just passed back to the old way.' More to the point, said an ethnic Turkmen, 'In this country there are not laws. There are instructions.' Mr Niyazov was educated in St Petersburg and is Russified. Indeed, he is said to consider Russia something of a big, wiser brother, to be consulted on the various foreign proposals that cross his desk. Mr Niyazov rose through Party ranks and was appointed Turkmenistan's first secretary by then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. He is an engineer by education and is married to a Russian. His excellence as a political strategist, was demonstrated by his survival after the Soviet Union's collapse in December. In a land where, until relatively recently, you had to be able to recite your tribal background and ancestors for seven generations to get anywhere, Mr Niyazov is an orphan with no provable ancestry at all. In addition, though, there is the former Communist party structure built up over the last seven decades. Mr Niyazov juggles them. 'His power comes from the past, and from his personality. He's a very capable man,' said an Asian scholar on the region. Helping to strengthen Mr Niyazov's position as well is the absence of Moslem fundamentalism despite a largely Sunni Moslem population. Mr Niyazov has concentrated power in his office and that of two lieutenants. They are his trade minister, Mr Valeri Otsersov, an ethnic Russian; and his investment committee director, Mr Atah Chariov, who has ancestors from the important Tekke tribe of Merv. This concentration makes Mr Niyazov's 16-member ruling council largely superfluous, and frustrates investment initiatives by foreigners and locals alike. As factories and flats quickly go private throughout the former Soviet Union, Mr Niyazov has declared that in Turkmenistan no dwelling shall be sold for a decade, and that the state will relinquish no share of its enterprises. Mr Niyazov's conservatism is rooted at least partly in fear of the business 'mafias' that have sprung up elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, according to state officials. 'If we give up state property to private people, there will just be a lot of theft,' said Mr Abdi Kuliev, foreign minister. Western and regional interest has been high. The wealth expected from Turkmenistan's natural gas and oil - 10,000bn cubic metres of proven natural gas reserves and 213m tonnes of oil, according to the state - has attracted ample attention. Turkmenistan is negotiating to supply Ukraine and other republics for hard currency, while Italian interests are seeking to arrange a barter deal under which they would finance a refinery. But foreign approaches have so far run up against the republic's go-slow attitude to development. Its location between China to the east and Iran and Turkey to the west and south are also selling points. One project going ahead is a venture with Iran to build a railway which provide the final link of a track from Beijing to Istanbul. Mr Niyazov has lavished attention on his frequent foreign visitors, housing some in the old Communist party hotel and holding banquets in their honour. But this attention - representatives of General Motors and Rank Xerox have called this month - has not quickened his pace of reform. He apparently feels in no rush. 'The people here have nothing against the old traditions,' said a Russian professional based in Ashkhabad. 'That's why Niyazov's position is quite stable.'</p>

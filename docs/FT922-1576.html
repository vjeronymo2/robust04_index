			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Accuracy of retail sales statistics Sir, Mr Roger Saoul claims ('Appeal should be for better statistics', June 18) that the official retail sales statistics are, and have been for some time, misleading. This is not so and he will be glad to hear of the progress we are making. Until the end of last year, the official monthly retail sales index was based on a voluntary inquiry addressed to about 3,500 retailers covering about 60 per cent of retail sales. This provided a generally sound indicator but did have some weaknesses. In particular, a small number of large retailers chose not to take part and it was difficult to achieve a statistically sound sample if we had to rely on the co-operation of volunteers. From January 1992, the inquiry was made compulsory and the panel extended to comprise a carefully selected sample of 5,000 retailers of all types and sizes covering around 70 per cent of total retail sales. All large retailers are required to contribute and the sample is more truly representative. Results from the new inquiry were introduced when the April estimate was published last month. There will be further improvements to the system of retail sales statistics. We are about to launch a quarterly inquiry to large retailers to collect information on sales by different product categories. We shall also be pursuing the possibility of a better breakdown by types of business to improve the usefulness of the detail currently published monthly.

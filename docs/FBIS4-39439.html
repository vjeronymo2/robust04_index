			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Chubarov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- The coming signing of a package of  agreements with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) will be a "major step on the road to  implementing a strategy of creating political conditions for an  equitable partnership between Russia and the leading Western  powers". This was stated today by Russian Federation Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his flight to Paris. The head of  the foreign policy department flew out to the French capital to  take part in a special meeting with ministers of the  member-states of the OECD which unites the most developed  countries in the world.    The ceremony of the signing of a declaration on cooperation  between the Russian Federation and the OECD and also an  agreement on the OECD's privileges and immunities in the Russian  Federation will take place in Paris tomorrow, 8 June.    Dwelling in this connection on Russia's relations with  Europe, the minister announced that at the end of the month a  big agreement might be signed with the European Union at summit  level. "Thus," he added, "this summer we will already start to  reap the economic harvest of our political partnership."    At the request of journalists, A. Kozyrev expressed his  opinion on the "nuclear problem" on the Korean peninsula and the  calls by some countries for economic sanctions to be introduced  against the DPRK. "In the final count," he said, "it may come to  a stage-by- stage introduction of sanctions. But before that  all the other possibilities should be exhausted, including the  possibility of holding an international conference."    Speaking of Russia's possible participation in the  "Partnership for Peace" program, the Russian Federation foreign  minister stressed that this program not regarded by the Russian  side as a panacea. In Istanbul at the end of the week he is to  take part in a session of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council. "This course of action is in keeping with our strategy  for European partnership," A. Kozyrev said. He said that in the  near future the Russian president will make initiatives on this,  initiatives in which the central role in the coordinating the  process of integration in Europe is allotted to the CSCE.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Congress wins flawed Punjab elections INDIA'S ruling Congress party yesterday won a majority of seats in the new Punjab legislature in elections tarnished by a low turnout following threats and a boycott call by Sikh militants. The turnout of less than 30 per cent was seen as a victory for pro-independence Sikh militants who have been responsible for violence in Punjab since 1983. The militants are expected to intensify their movement for independence and more violence awaits Punjab under Congress rule. Observers do not expect the Congress government to stay long in power and forecast the early reintroduction of direct rule from New Delhi. This is because the party is in no position to reach a deal with the federal government that will be acceptable to the militants or the people. Before the election, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, had been discussing a 'Punjab package' for the state but delayed its announcement until a popular government was elected in the state. The package involves, among other things, making Chandigarh, the common capital of Punjab and Haryana, the capital of Punjab alone. The package is based on an agreement in 1986 between the late Sikh leader, Mr Harchand Singh Longowal, and the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi, then prime minister. The agreement proved unworkable then and is likely to meet the same fate again.</p>

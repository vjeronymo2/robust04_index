			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Entranced by the voice of an angel - Music The year was 1955, the place a large auditorium in Johannesburg, and the occasion a concert featuring one of the world's most famous and highly esteemed singers. It was her first in the country, and awaited with the highest excitement: for, even in the postwar period before the anti-apartheid arts boycott began to bite, South Africa was a somewhat out-of-the-way place for the world's truly front-rank musicians. So when one such as this soprano did arrive, the waves of anticipation tended to ripple far beyond the small, confined pool of Johannesburg concert-devotees. I was nine. I had already been exposed to the concert hall on a single occasion a few years earlier (a piano recital offering inter alia some of the Schubert pieces I was myself struggling to learn at the time - not a great success, of which all I now recall is the discomfort of having to sit still for an achingly long time in 'smart', scratchy, flannel trousers). But the prospect of hearing a singing voice of this calibre seemed to perk up even my artistically unenthusable parents. In turn this conveyed itself to me; there was also something intriguingly exotic about the singer's name  -much longer than the Johannesburg norm, Victoria to begin with and something or other to do with angels at the end - which gave an attractive tinge to my expectations of the event. (The stimulus of memorable names on a child's imagination should never be underestimated.) The concert itself I remember hardly at all in detail - I have, for instance, no idea what she sang - and almost entirely in terms of its general impact upon me: an awareness of something marvellous sweeping over me that grew ever greater; a sense of disbelief turned to wonder that the singing voice could be so powerful yet so joyously unforced, could go so high and low, could sometimes move so fast and at other times hold itself so long, quiet and steady; above all, a thrill at the way the sound seemed to make itself part of the listener's very being. Of the lady herself I have only a vague but treasured image, which has been superimposed upon by the subsequent (adult) occasions I encountered her - a dark-haired figure in a shining dress with a cape who smiled as though she were the friend of every small boy in the hall, and made magic. Indeed, magic it was: at some point during the evening I must have become convinced that this singer was really an enchanted emanation of music itself. In this parcel of suffused, inarticulate sensations I also trace the belief, formed under her influence, that 'real' music, music that illuminated your inner being in this way, had always to be sung music, and that the art of such singing was a gift that only a few lucky people would ever be able to practise. Later on I came to learn that the last conviction was the most reliable  - the others were gradually amplified, and corrected, by other inspiring musicians, instrumentalists and singers with other kinds of voices and personalities. But to this day I retain the feeling of an Aurora-like awakening from sleep which the experience achieved in me. Victoria de los Angeles, the singer in question, celebrated last month her 70th birthday. As (to judge from a recent series of Radio 4 interviews with her) she remains a person of undimmed spiritual and emotional radiance, it gives me peculiar pleasure to think that this small reminiscence may also serve as a timely tribute and expression of private gratitude to a great and glorious artist.</p>

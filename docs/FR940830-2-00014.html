			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Authority to Use MSC Rates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MSC Worldwide Container Agreement contains authority for MTMC approved ITGBL carriers to use MSC negotiated ocean rates. Section C&hyph;5 of the Worldwide Agreement defines the Government as the U.S. Government, its agents, and contractors. The ocean carrier is obligated in accordance with Sections C&hyph;4 and C&hyph;6 of the MSC Worldwide Container Agreement to transport cargo tendered by the Government. The ocean carrier will perform services in accordance with MSC contracts upon proper ordering by an authorized ITBBL carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Ordering Activity Designation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MTMC, as the Administrative Contracting Officer for MSC will designate ITGBL carriers with accepted Code 3 rates on file, as ordering activities of the Government. As an ordering activity of the Government, the ITGBL carrier will have authority to book containers on behalf of the Government within the limits of delegation and subject to Government oversight. Ordering activity authority will allow the ITGBL carrier to utilize MSC negotiated rates. The ITGBL carrier will be responsible for exercising its administrative authority in accordance with the delegation authority granted by MTMC, and with the terms and conditions of the MSC container agreement with oversight by MTMC. ITGBL carriers designated as ordering activities of the Government will sign an agreement acknowledging the terms, conditions, and responsibilities, associated with the delegated authority. A listing reflecting those ITGBL carriers designated as ordering activities of the Government will be provided to the MSC ocean carriers prior to the effective date of the cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Withdrawal of Ordering Activity Authority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MTMC may revoke the ordering activity authority of any ITGBL carrier who fails to comply with the terms, conditions, and responsibility associated with use of the MSC negotiated rates. This will preclude the ITGBL carrier from further participation in Code 3 traffic for the remainder of the solicitation period and cycle. Repetitive violations of ordering activity authority may result in removal of the ITGBL carrier from further Code 3 participation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Ocean Carrier Cargo Allocations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the low cost ocean carrier will be offered 75 percent of the available cargo on a given route. The remaining 25 percent of the cargo will be offered to other participating ocean carriers. All Code 3 HHG shipments, under this test will be offered initially to the low cost ocean carrier and included in the 75 percent cargo allocations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Ocean Container Bookings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MTMC will provide port information and administrative institutions to ITGBL carriers and adjust such instructions, as required, to provide for compliance with HHG distribution requirements. ITGBL carriers will be required to adhere to these instructions. ITGBL carriers will offer all Code 3 shipments to the ocean carrier establishing the lowest MSC rate for the applicable route unless instructed to do otherwise by MTMC. If the shipments are declined by low cost ocean carrier, a nonavailability statement will be issued by the ocean carrier and required to accompany the ITGBL carriers billing to the appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. Container Utilization. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ITGBL carriers participating in Code 3 traffic will be required to optimize ocean container utilization. Imposition of utilization factors are necessary to incentivize optimal loading of containers since MSC rates are based on rates per measurement ton utilizing 100 percent of the inside cubic capacity of the container regardless of the actual of HHGs loaded in the container. (See paragraph a. 10.(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 7. Coloading.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To permit carriers ability to continue traditionally accepted commercial coloading practices, carriers may coload Code 3 shipments. Code 3 shipments may only be coloaded in ocean containers with Code 3 shipments. The ITGBL carrier's Ordering Activity will be revoked if it is found that Code 3 and Non-Code 3 shipments are coloaded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 8. Payment of Ocean Charges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ITGBL carrier who orders services from the ocean carrier on behalf of the Government is responsible for payment of MSC ocean rates to the ocean carrier. Ocean freight charges shall be earned by the MSC ocean carrier upon delivery of the shipment to the destination named in the shipping order in accordance with MSC's agreements and rate guides. Payment by the ITGBL carrier shall be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice from the MSC ocean carrier of evidence of delivery whichever occurs later. ITGBL carriers will be reimbursed for over-ocean movement costs for Code 3 shipments tendered to the low cost ocean carrier or when a nonavailability statement is provided by the low cost ocean carrier indicating the shipment was refused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 9. Failure to Pay Ocean Carrier.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the Government is responsible for payment of ocean charges if the ITGBL carrier fails to pay the MSC ocean carrier. MSC will maintain a reserve fund for use in paying the ocean carrier. MTMC will initiate set-off action against ITGBL carriers for ocean charges, applicable interest, and any other costs incurred for nonpayment of ocean charges. Designation of ordering activity authority will be revoked, and the ITGBL carrier will be precluded from further participation in Code 3 traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 10. Reimbursement of Ocean Charges._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The ITGBL carrier will be reimbursed for its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred by the use of MSC's contract carriers based on the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment. The ITGBL carrier will be paid that portion of the average ocean charges in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph a.10.(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The ITGBL carrier will be paid its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred under Code 3 shipments based on multiplying the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment shipped with the ITGBL carrier against an MSC determined ocean rate factor. The MSC ocean rate factor is based on dividing MSC's total ocean charges for the movement of a standard 40 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; by 8 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; by 8 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;6 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; dry ocean container (40 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; standard container) of general cargo over a specific traffic channel by the average amount of net hundredweight of HHG  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;cargo that can be loaded into that size container. The average net hundredweight of HHG cargo that can be loaded into a 40 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; standard container is calculated to be 130.41. That 130.41 net hundredweight is calculated by using a load factor of 10 average size Type II containers (152A) in a 40 standard container. At 189 cubic feet each, these 10 average Type II containers will hold 13,041 reduced to a hundredweight factor, divided into the MSC calculated per 40 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; standard container rate for a given movement shall be the applicable ocean freight reimbursement factor. This MSC ocean rate factor is then multiplied against the net hundredweight of the ITGBL carrier's shipment over that channel and the ITGBL carrier is paid the resulting amount. The predetermined ocean freight reimbursement factor for each Code 3 channel shall be computed by MSC and provided to the applicable paying office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The ITGBL carrier will bill the appropriate finance and accounting office responsible for payment of transportation charges for Code 3 shipments. Over-ocean charges will be identified as a separate line item charge on the public Voucher for Transportation Charges, SF&hyph;1113. An MSC Over-Ocean Charge Item will be included in Chapter V of the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation. This item number must be reflected on the SF&hyph;1113 with the over-ocean charge. All billings must be supported by appropriate documents identified in the Tender of Service, Figure A&hyph;8, of the Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (PTMR), DOD 4500.34R, with the following exceptions; the shipping order must be submitted in lieu of billing document number 8, commercial ocean bill of lading, and a copy of the nonavailability statement must be submitted, in order to justify payment, for those instances where the low MSC ocean carrier refused the shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

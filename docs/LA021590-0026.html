			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. HAWKINS  </P> <P> It is truly regrettable that Rep. Gus Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) has decided to  resign after 28 years of fine representation. Hawkins has been a strong and  powerful advocate for education, health and housing -- the most important  issues of our times.  </P> <P> His tenure has been unblemished, in contrast to mounting evidence of the  decline of ethics in government.  </P> <P> As a member of a school board, I am especially sorry to see him go. As chair of  the House Education &amp; Labor Committee, Hawkins has fought hard to obtain  more funding and support of educational programs and schools. Just last month,  he proposed substantial funding in the new federal budget that would have  nearly doubled federal spending in education. Perhaps the Administration will  listen, particularly since new studies have shown how effective Head Start, one  of Hawkins' favorite projects, can be.  </P> <P> Rep. Hawkins will long be known for his efforts to improve the lives of all  citizens. His shoes are big, but I have no doubt that Assemblywoman Maxine  Waters (D-Los Angeles), whom you identify as his "heir apparent," will continue  his tradition.  </P> <P> I'll miss you, Gus.  </P> <P> THOMASINA M. REED  </P> <P> Board of Education Member  </P> <P> Inglewood Unified School District  </P></p>

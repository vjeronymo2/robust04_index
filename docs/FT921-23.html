			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Write-downs mar Santos year SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday reported a net loss of ADollars 111m (USDollars 85m) for the year to the end of December after writing down the value of its Timor Sea and US activities by ADollars 225m. Santos said its pre-tax operating profit of ADollars 223m was a record, with the exception of 1985 and 1990, when oil prices exceeded ADollars 40 a barrel for part of the year. Oil prices averaged ADollars 28 in the year to December. The group said net profit before abnormal items was ADollars 114m, compared with ADollars 137m in the previous year. However, the result was struck after foreign exchange losses of ADollars 11m, compared with ADollars 1m in the previous year. The 1990 result also included a profit of ADollars 12m from the sale of UK operations. The write-downs, which were foreshadowed in the 1990 annual report, follow a disappointing exploration programme in the Timor Sea. Of 12 wells scheduled to be drilled during the year, eight were dry and the remainder were postponed or abandoned. The biggest write-down was ADollars 154m against unsuccessful exploration expenditure in a number of permit areas which will be relinquished this year or next. A further ADollars 80m related to producing licences acquired with Peko Oil. The group said it would maintain an active exploration programme in the Timor Sea. However, it plans to drill only five exploration wells and carry out 15,000 kilometres of seismic testing this year. Santos said it would begin exploration efforts this year in the North Sea, Cambodia and Colombia, where interests had been acquired since June 1991. Exploration would continue in the US and Malaysia, but would be reduced in the Timor Sea and the Cooper Basin in South Australia. The US write-down of ADollars 40m reflects a lower valuation for the group's gas assets. The board said the group's US assets were now centred on Weeks Exploration, a growing exploration company with good growth potential. Sales revenue fell 7.6 per cent ADollars 656m from the 1990 record of ADollars 709m. The fall was caused by lower crude oil prices compared to 1990, when the Gulf war inflated prices, and lower volumes for all products except naphtha. The directors declared an unchanged final dividend of 10 cents per share, fully franked.</p>

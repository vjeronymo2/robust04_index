			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (4): The big one that missed Miami - Hurricance Andrew was bad but it could have cost a lot more but it could have been much worse. Had Andrew hit Miami last August instead of less built-up areas of Florida and Louisiana, the damage would have been much greater than the Dollars 15.5bn in losses the storm actually caused. Even so the impact of the hurricane on the local reinsurance market, which contributed to Dollars 22.97bn in catastrophe losses for the year as a whole, has been stark. Last year's losses have depressed industry profitability and put many smaller and medium-sized reinsurers under further financial strain leading many to reduce their involvement in the market and a decline in capacity, with the resulting fall in capacity forcing a sharp increases in prices. The scale of the hurricane has also served to highlight a longer term trend in which catastrophe losses are becoming bigger and more frequent. Losses from catastrophes rose steadily during the 1980s with the annual toll reaching Dollars 2.3bn in 1983, Dollars 2.8bn in 1985 and Dollars 7.6bn in 1989, when claims from hurricane Hugo alone amounted to Dollars 4.2bn. During 1990 and 1991 losses stayed at a high level, amounting to Dollars 2.82bn and Dollars 4.72bn respectively. Figures for the first three months from Property Claims Services, the body which collates data for the industry, indicate that the trend is continuing. Anticipated claims for the first quarter amounted to Dollars 2.8bn. The bulk of the first quarter loss was provided by a large storm which hit 24 southern and eastern states between 11 and 14 March. Claims from the World Trade Center bombing on 26 February amount to more than Dollars 510m. 'The industry has to accept that the traditional pattern of periods of low loss frequency punctuated by the occasional bad year is no longer applicable,' commented the specialist newsletter Catastrophe Reinsurance. Rates have risen sharply. Reinsurance premiums which were moving gently upwards at last year's mid-year renewals rose sharply at the end of the year and have climbed higher again this year, bringing the US firmly into line with the hardening market in Europe and elsewhere. Increases of rates ranged from 10 per cent to 100 per cent on January 1993 renewals. Further tightness, especially in the property market, was evident at mid-year renewals. The terms and conditions of many reinsurance policies sold to US buyers have tightened. According to Mr Alan Cranfield, reinsurance broker with Alexander Howden, pro-rata reinsurance treaties bought by US companies are now much more likely to include caps on the catastrophe exposures that they cover. Mr Cranfield said that 90 per cent of such policies included caps at the the mid-year renewals, compared with 70 per cent at the end of last year. Reinsurers are also more likely to insist that insurers agree to accept bigger deductibles, retaining more of their risks on their own books. This in turn is prompting many insurers to reduce the amount of cover they offer to their own policyholders, especially in areas highly exposed to catastrophe risks such as coastal Florida. In the longer term the trends seem certain to put many smaller reinsurance companies under increasing financial pressure, leading to a further consolidation in the market. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, says that 1992 losses drove up the industry's combined ratio (expenses plus claims against premiums) to 118.2 per cent compared with 106.3 per cent in 1991, leading to a sharp depression in profitability. In spite of its capital gains of more than Dollars 870m, the earnings of the US reinsurance industry plummeted during 1992. Profitability as measured by return on revenue dropped 10 percentage points to 2.88 per cent in 1992 from 12.95 per cent in 1991. The industry's pre-tax profits declined by 51 per cent to Dollars 963m compared with Dollars 2bn in 1991, while profits - as measured by return on equity - fell by 747 basis points to 6.34 per cent in 1992. Excluding realised gains it fell to 0.59 per cent. S &amp; P's figures show that the industry's better capitalised reinsurers have fared better than their weaker rivals, generally posting better results. 'Simply put, larger well-capitalised reinsurers are in a better position to withstand such devastating losses,' say Thomas Walsh and Mary Ann Gangemi, of Standard &amp; Poor's. Financially stronger well positioned reinsurers have been able to 'cherry pick' books of business from both primary companies looking to leave the reinsurance business and professional reinsurers who have lost market share or status. The top 10 reinsurers' increased their market share to 57 per cent in 1992, compared with 44 per cent in 1985 and 53 per cent in 1991, say S &amp; P. The top 20 reinsurers are responsible for more than 75 per cent of net premiums written. Beyond the top 20 almost 90 per cent of premiums are underwritten by only 35 companies. 'The consolidation process, accelerated by the most recent string of catastrophes, is expected to continue as many of the smaller firms deteriorate financially due to the less profitable business written in recent years,' say S &amp; P's Walsh and Gangemi. 'These losses will require further loss reserve strengthening which for some will create unbearable pressure on an already fragile capital base,' the two analysts add.  ------------------------------------------    TOP 10 US REINSURERS BY NET PREMIUMS        written in 1992 (Dollars m)  ------------------------------------------ General Reinsurance         1,870 Employers Reinsurance       1,410 American Re-insurance       1,010 Prudential Re                 704 Constitution Reinsurance      383 Swiss Reinsurance             376 Skandia America Re            372 Transamerica Re               354 Transatlantic Re              323 Munich American Re            323  ------------------------------------------ Source: Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Group  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PORT CHIEF COULDN'T RESIST LURE OF CONVENTION CENTER  </P> <P> When Joseph F. Prevratil signed up last year as the new executive director of  the Port of Long Beach, he described the job as "an opportunity that comes  along once in a lifetime."  </P> <P> Harbor Commission Chairman George F. Talin Sr. predicted that Prevratil "is  going to be to the port what Babe Ruth was to baseball." Prevratil showed  promise of becoming a dockside version of the venerated Sultan of Swat by  reorganizing harbor management.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Work on Other Project  </P> <P> Last week, however, he abruptly quit after about a year on the job to become a  private consultant. His first client will be the city, which intends to hire  him to direct the planned $80-million expansion of the Long Beach Convention  and Entertainment Center. The city manager said Prevratil will also work on  other redevelopment projects.  </P> <P> Switching from department head to consultant will allow Prevratil to handle  other clients as well, which will boost his income. One of the stated reasons  for Prevratil's departure was his desire to earn more money.  </P> <P> Prevratil, 51, is known as a disciplined manager whose hard-nosed demeanor  could leave port executives trembling. Port sources said he knocked heads with  members of the Board of Harbor Commissioners on occasion, but Prevratil and  harbor commissioners said no clash was serious enough to figure in his decision  to resign.  </P> <P> Prevratil said he became interested in heading the convention center effort  when he was involved in protracted discussions about the port's role in  financing the project. Harbor commissioners also acknowledged the importance of  having their port chief, with his management and marketing skills, at the helm.  </P> <P> To a large extent, the city is staking the future of its revitalized downtown  on the project. The expansion would allow the city to compete for mid-sized  conventions, a step up from the smaller trade shows. Civic leaders envision  hoards of delegates filling the three major new hotels built downtown -- with a  fourth on the way -- and dining at new restaurants along Pine Avenue.  </P> <P> Though the port plans to put up the money, the city Redevelopment Agency is  overseeing the expansion. The port is seeking a legal opinion from the city  attorney about whether it can use its funds for a non-port use such as the  convention center.  </P> <P> The expansion also would involve dealing with contractors, negotiating a new  operating agreement and marketing an enlarged complex.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Gleam in His Eye'  </P> <P> During discussions about the expansion and the port's role, Talin said  Prevratil's name came up repeatedly when talk turned to the issue of who would  manage the project. "Over the last several weeks with the commission and Joe,  you could see the gleam in his eye," Talin said.  </P> <P> Prevratil said "it became evident" that the convention center project would be  too large an undertaking to handle in addition to his port responsibilities.  </P> <P> As a consultant, he will report to Susan Shick, the city's redevelopment  director, and work with the harbor commission and Redevelopment Agency board.  Donald L. Westerland, chairman of the agency's board, said he is delighted to  have Prevratil head the project. "We wanted someone to ride herd on this whole  project," he said.  </P> <P> Just how much authority he will be given in his role as a consultant remains to  be seen. Shick said Prevratil will be handled "like any other consultant" and  that decision-making "(will be) left to the (redevelopment) board."  </P> <P> City Manager James C. Hankla said Prevratil's consulting fee will approach the  $110,046 annual salary he received at the port. He reportedly took a  substantial cut in pay to come to work at the port last year. As president of  Wrather Port Properties Ltd., where Prevratil led the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose  complex out of a decade of losses, he reportedly earned more than $180,000 a  year.  </P> <P> But harbor commissioners balked at trying to push Prevratil's annual salary  higher than Hankla's $118,218.  </P> <P> "I hate like hell to lose a good man like Joe Prevratil," Talin said. "If I had  my druthers, we would have paid Joe another $40,000 or $50,000, but we couldn't  do it."  </P> <P> While his city pay remains substantially the same, Prevratil's new status will  allow him to accept other work. Hankla said Prevratil will have to disclose his  clients and cannot accept any other clients who would put him in conflict with  his city duties.  </P> <P> The city charter forbids the city manager, city attorney and executive director  of the port from taking outside consulting jobs or other employment.  </P> <P> As the port's executive director, Prevratil shook up management with a major  reorganization and cleaned house among top directors. He complained that under  the old structure, too many department heads reported directly to the executive  director. He streamlined the system by creating three managing director  positions that reported to him. The managing directors were given  responsibility for the departments. One of those directors, Paul Brown, has  been named acting executive director.  </P> <P> Harbor commissioners generally concurred with Prevratil's changes. But there  were some differences, including times when commissioners would pass over  Prevratil's hand-picked candidates for key jobs.  </P> <P> "Yes, he had people he wanted and recommended but the procedures on personnel  were followed," Harbor Commissioner C. Robert Langslet said. "His people were  certainly in the running."  </P> <P> With firm management already in place, Langslet, Talin and Commissioner Joel  Friedland said they are in no hurry to appoint a new executive director.  </P> <P> The port thrives. It handles more tons of cargo and moves more containers than  any other port on the West Coast. About 5,400 vessels called on the port in the  last fiscal year, discharging cargo ranging from bananas to cement to toys.  About $35 billion of imports and exports moves across its docks.  </P></p>

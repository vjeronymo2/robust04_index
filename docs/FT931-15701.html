			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / France tones down its Bosnia camps threat FRANCE yesterday moderated its threat to use force to liberate Bosnian prisoner camps single-handed, but reserved the right to do so as a last resort if the United Nations failed to sanction international action. Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said a suggestion by Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, that France was ready to act alone and use force 'was misinterpreted'. 'What Dumas said, and what President Francois Mitterrand says is that France is available if the United Nations decides on action and is ready to go ahead together with others,' Mr Joxe explained. Mr Bernard Kouchner, health and humanitarian affairs minister, will shortly lead a delegation to Bosnia to examine camps there and report back to the UN to demand a mandate to use force, said an official of the Elysee Palace. He will also negotiate the liberation of prisoners where possible. The government fully accepted there is for the moment no UN mandate to use force to back up the French-inspired UN resolution voted last month which demands the closure of the detention camps, said the official. The Security Council would have to vote a new resolution if force was to be used to free the prisoners. President Mitterrand, who under the constitution is head of the army, would prefer to act with a UN mandate, but did not exclude acting independently, the official added. France was seeking a UN decision within days and felt the plight of prisoners was so serious that action should be taken independently of the deadlocked Geneva peace talks. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday said he did not believe France would unilaterally intervene in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and clearly hinted it would undermine the UN's peace efforts. Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday denounced the French proposal as an 'election stunt'. Mr Karadzic also criticised the role of the French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon. The Bosnian government yesterday said it had requested the replacement of Gen Morillon, and the Sarajevo commander, Egyptian General Hussein Abdel Razek. Bosnia had previously said it had lost confidence in Gen Morillon and his staff, following last Friday's assassination of deputy prime minister Hakija Turajlic while under UN protection. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference yesterday backed a call by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for armed intervention if Serb forces continued to shell Bosnian Moslems, Reuter reports from Dakar.</p>

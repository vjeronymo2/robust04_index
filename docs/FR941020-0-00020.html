			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Indicated Companies and Hadson contend that posting of tariff waivers should be continued. They argue that tariff waivers can provide competitive benefits to affiliates as significant as discounts and that viewing such waivers at the pipelines' offices is unduly burdensome. Hadson contends that requiring shippers to travel to pipeline offices to view waivers is an anachronism in an age when computer technology can provide such data instantaneously. Hadson contends that complaints should continue to be posted because they may help shippers detect patterns of abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will not reinstate the requirements to post tariff waivers and complaints on EBBs. Complaints are individual concerns between the pipeline and their customers and complaints that are resolved amicably would not generally provide indications of abuse. Complaints which are not resolved can be referred to the Commission, and the Commission will be able to discern any patterns of abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to tariff waivers, the potential benefits from EBB postings may be outweighed by the programming and other computer and administrative costs of placing such waivers on pipeline EBBs. The Commission, however, agrees that shippers should have reasonable access to such waiver information without having to travel to pipeline offices to copy the waivers. The Commission, therefore, will amend Standard K to require pipelines to provide a copy of the log of tariff waivers to anyone requesting it within 24 hours of the request. The pipelines can then choose the most expedient method of complying, whether that may be posting the tariff waivers on their EBBs or providing them using facsimile machines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Coordination of the Affiliate Requirements With Part 284 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pipelines have requested that the Commission coordinate its affiliate regulations with some of its Part 284 regulations to eliminate duplicative requirements and make these requirements consistent. ANR/CIG contends that the Commission should eliminate the requirement to include in the initial reports required by &sect;284.106(a)(3) the points between which natural gas is to be transported and the state of the source of gas, because the Commission, in Order No. 566, removed similar maintenance requirements relating to source and destination of gas. Columbia/Columbia Gulf and Tenneco contend that the requirements for pipelines to file discount information under &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv) is unnecessary since pipelines must maintain even more extensive discount information under &sect;250.16(d). Tenneco further argues that the semi-annual storage reports required by &sect;&sect;284.106(g) and 284.126(g) require information also required by the affiliate regulations and only one requirement should be retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will not make piecemeal changes in its Part 284 requirements in this proceeding. For example, the Part 284 discount reporting requirements are not identical with the requirements of &sect;250.16(d): the Part 284 reports are publicly available while the more extensive &sect;250.16 information is not. Similarly, in the EBB proceedings in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, the Commission has been considering industry proposals to replace the initial reports with an electronic Index of Purchasers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission already is examining its regulations in light of the changes caused by Order No. 636 and revisions to these requirements will be made at the appropriate time when all the regulations can be considered as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 563&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Since &sect;270.203 has been removed, the Commission is revising the definition so as to maintain the same coverage as the previous definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Outdated Regulations Pertaining To The Sales of Natural Gas Production, 59 FR 40240 (Aug. 8, 1994), III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Accordingly, the definition of marketing will be revised to ensure that no substantive change occurs. The revised regulation will read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the NGPA, sales by pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not be first sales. The Commission used its authority to define pipeline affiliates as making first sales to prevent possible circumvention by pipeline affiliates of the maximum lawful price provisions of the NGPA. 15 U.S.C. 3301(21)(A)(v).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 3301(21)(A)(i)&hyph;(iv). Thus, the prior definition of marketing in &sect;161.2 applied both to sales for resale and direct sales made by pipeline marketing affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing or brokering as used in this part and &sect;250.16 of this chapter means a sale of natural gas to any person or entity by a seller that is not an interstate pipeline, except when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the seller is selling gas solely from its own production;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the seller is selling gas solely from its own gathering or processing facilities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) the seller is an intrastate natural gas pipeline or a local distribution company making an on-system sale. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This definition effects no change in substantive coverage under the regulations. The regulations continue to apply only to pipeline affiliates that are engaging in gas sales activities that would compete with independent marketers. The definition does not apply to producers, gatherers, and processors, acting in their traditional roles of selling gas from their own production, gathering, or processing facilities, or to intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies acting in their traditional roles of making on-system sales of gas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These entities will be included as marketers only to the extent that their activities go beyond their traditional roles and they make sales for which an independent marketer could compete. Because the revision has no substantive effect on the rights of any party, the Commission determines that good cause exists under the APA for finding that notice and public comment on these revisions is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;A, 54 FR 52781 (Dec. 22, 1989), FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

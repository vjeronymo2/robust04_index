			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Ponomarev: "Heightened Hysteria Envelops the </F> the Pentagon Too?"]    [Text] The unimaginable commotion in the U.S. mass media  over the problems in the nuclear sphere which have emerged on  the Korean peninsula is spreading. It seems that the U.S.  Defense Department has also given way to the hysteria being  fueled by some newspapers and television companies.    THE WASHINGTON TIMES asserts that concrete plans are being  hastily drawn up in the Pentagon in case of an outbreak of  military actions. As far as can be judged, it is primarily a  matter of reinforcing the South Korean troops deployed in the  region of the DMZ dividing North and South Korea. Pentagon  experts believe that the configuration of forces there is now  clearly to Seoul's disadvantage: The South Korean Army has only  a few large combined units in the vicinity of the Zone, totaling  21 divisions, whereas the DPRK has concentrated two-thirds of  its armed forces there, comprising 1.2 million men in all.    Because of this, it is reported from Washington, the  Pentagon  is examining options for transferring U.S. troops into the DMZ  area. Right now the number of American troops on the Korean  peninsula totals 36,000 men. But they can quickly be bolstered  by a further 26,000 Marines stationed in Okinawa. It is also  planned to move additional armaments to the threatened region  and to top up reserves of equipment and ammunition, in  particular the so-called "bunker bombs" designed to destroy  hardened underground targets. Among such targets the U.S.  generals primarily class installations associated with the DPRK  nuclear complex in Yongbyon.    Citing "informed sources," the U.S. press writes that the  intelligence services have already transferred additional  skilled staff to South Korea. They are being employed to  analyze and evaluate information received from artificial earth  satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, and bugging devices located  at sea and on land.    Citing the magazine DEFENSE NEWS, ITAR-TASS also reports  that  the U.S. Defense Department intends to make use of the latest  acoustic technologies to identify and chart underground passages  and tunnels which it is suggested that Pyongyang has  constructed. These installations, allegedly created for "covert  penetration" of South Korean territory, are supposed to be  revealed by studying the concussion [detonatsiya] resulting from  exploding special charges, using a method developed by the  "Eliant Techsystem" [name as transliterated] company.    These are just a few of the items appearing in the U.S.  press  on the subject of Pentagon preparations for a possible war on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

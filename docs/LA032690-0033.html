			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2,000 MARK SLAYING OF ARCHBISHOP  </P> <P> Ten years and a day after Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero was shot  to death while celebrating Mass in his country, more than 2,000 people gathered  Sunday on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall to commemorate his assassination  and to protest U.S. presence in Central America.  </P> <P> Rally participants included members of at least 50 church, labor and student  groups.  </P> <P> The demonstrators railed at U.S. foreign spending, saying that in the last 10  years, the country has sent more than $4 billion in military and economic aid  to military-backed governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Panama.  </P> <P> The assassination of Romero, an outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and  military leadership, was blamed on a former El Salvadoran National Guard  intelligence officer. Protesters said that because an arrest by  government-controlled law enforcement agencies is not likely, the murder  remains unsolved.  </P> <P> "It's not our own people funding this war (in El Salvador)," said Gladis  Sibrian, of Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Revolutionary  Front of El Salvador, the strongest of the leftist opposition groups, which the  Salvadoran government has refused to recognize. "The fighting won't end and  negotiations over how to run my country are not possible until the U.S. ceases  funding the Salvadoran government."  </P></p>

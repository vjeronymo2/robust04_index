			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Gardening: The perennial pleasures of spring - Robin Lane Fox prepares to strike an economic blow for a better garden on a shoestring BEFORE LONG, better weather ought to have caused gardeners' sap to rise: act now while enthusiasm is fresh and strike an economic blow for a better garden on a shoestring. Seeds are no longer as cheap as they were and, admittedly, I sometimes grow them for the hell of it, just to see if I can make them come up. It is no longer time to postpone the plunge, but the first seeds to go in are not the most obvious. It is still too early to be sowing tobacco plants, cosmos daisies and all the mainstays of summer bedding which grow quickly and will be too far advanced if started before March. Perennial flowers are another matter. Among these early sowers, I am casting my net more widely and am being prompt with less-familiar perennials which ought to flower from July onwards. Geraniums are obvious candidates, especially now that so many colours have been selected and bred for seed-raising: even for amateurs, cuttings are almost a matter of the past. I leave most of the geraniums to others, but carnations are another matter. Not long ago, I was editing Vita Sackville-West's old gardening columns when I was carried away by her description of the Chabaud strain of carnation. Their colours, she felt, had the quality of a Van Gogh painting - I remember that she described some of them as bistre. On the spur of a good read, I tried to grow my own, but started too late. From a sowing in mid-March, I had none of her fancies, no bistred beauties or blooms of old blood-red. The wretched plants never flowered at all. Once bitten, never shy: you know the gardening instinct. So, this year I am starting Chabaud carnations from seed in the first week of February. Somewhere in Britain, people must still grow them happily because garden centres stock them on open shelves in their standard ranges of seed from Suttons or Thompson and Morgan. The seed will germinate in the usual amateur's pot, filled with a standard seed compost and covered with a tight stretch of cling-film to retain the heat and sweat. Chabaud carnations like heat in order to spring into growth. They will germinate in a warm cupboard, below the spare bath towels, if you remember to retrieve them and roll back the cling-film at the first signs of emergent shoots. My other early sowings will owe much to the tremendous seed list of Chiltern Seeds in Cumbria, north-west England. Seeds and catalogues are available by 'phone and credit card round the clock on 0229-581-137. This year's catalogue is the company's 17th and is bigger than ever. Early sowers can have a field day in it, but I would direct you to three of my successes from 1991: two whites and a blue which is now available in a new, exciting form. If you sow them at once, they will flower later this summer and ought to last for several years. The two whites are valerian and Gaura Lindheimeri. White valerian is a floppy plant but it is wonderfully elegant against its green-grey stems. Most seedsmen sell only mixtures in which a few whites are confused with the dull pink forms, but Chiltern Seeds has joined the small list of segregating stockists (of which Butchers of Shirley, near Croydon, south London, is another). The Snowcloud variety is a truly white valerian which is willing to flower in its first season if sown within the next week or so. In good soil, it might even reach 4 ft. Here, it would equal the Gaura, my white companion. At home, these flowers are wild in Texas, but anyone can raise them by the dozen from a seed packet, even if they neglect them as badly as I sometimes have after sowing. They give you masses of white flowers like a willow herb which is flushed with a touch of deep pink, and they appear at a late season and height which borders need badly. Successes are good for morale and, in 1991, my happiest successes were with Chiltern Seeds' several varieties of balloon flower. Their formal name is Platycodon, and I first learnt to love them in botanical gardens. Their huge, balloon-buds ask to be popped open like large, angular campanulas. They have an awkward habit of disappearing below ground after flowering in August and appearing again rather late in spring. Nonetheless, they are marvellous performers in open soil. All the forms are good, but this year we have a new F1 hybrid which sounds sensational. It is said to flower in its first year if sown early and reaches only about 6 in - perfect for pots. It will grow and improve in later years, surviving the winter so long as you do not dig it up by mistake when dormant. Anyone can raise it from seed as easily as dreary old marigolds. Its name is Sentimental Blue, which sounds wonderfully soft-hearted. Dozens of plants will come up from a packet at only Pounds 1.35: nurseries would charge you Pounds 1.80 for a single plant. Plan for your own blue balloon show and catch the sentimental mood by sowing as soon as you can.</p>

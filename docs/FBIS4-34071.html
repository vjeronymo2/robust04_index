			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Planning and  Cooperation Minister Luis Maira today said that President  Eduardo Frei's government will reallocate public expenditures to  be able to more effectively fight the poverty affecting 4.5  million Chileans.    Minister Maira asserted that together with the Finance  Ministry efforts are being made to draft a budget that, while  observing a balanced allocation of funds, "will allow us to use  the resources as best possible, granting priority to the various  public sector projects."    The minister announced that a Latin American Social and  Poverty Funds Network [Red Lationamericana de Fondos Sociales y  de Pobreza] will be created in Santiago on 20 June.    To this purpose a regional meeting to discuss "alternatives  to financing programs designed to overcome poverty" will be  held. A total of 21 Latin American and Caribbean delegations  will participate in this event.    The current government has made the struggle against poverty  its priority target. The government intends to pull the 1.2  million Chileans who currently live in extreme poverty out of  this situation.    Today Maira explained that the National Program to Overcome  Poverty has no populist purpose.    The Planning Minister said: "We have carefully tried to  avoid  creating overblown expectations. We have not set regional  targets or objectives that could suggest improvements greater  than conditions will allow."</p>

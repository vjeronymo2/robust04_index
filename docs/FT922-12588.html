			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Russia opts for crisis over chaos In nine days of stormy debate in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies, the country's post-communist legislators issued a stern warning by passing an uncompromising resolution effectively crippling President Boris Yeltsin's radical economic reforms. However, by yesterday the Congress conservatives had climbed down and adopted a declaration giving Mr Yeltsin and his reformers full support. John Lloyd in Moscow analyses the outcome THE CLOSING moments of the current session of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies may produce surprises yet, and it certainly would be a surprise if the delegates demonstrated a collective will and capacity to injure the government seriously, so long as that government is supported by President Boris Yeltsin. This does not mean that no harm has been done. The cost of the concessions that the president and the government made before and during this parliament has yet to be presented. But it looks high: energy price rises to be postponed, taxes lowered, social security and other benefits raised, industry given Rbs200bn in credits. The international financial institutions are worried, but western politicians are saying nothing critical while the congress remains in session. Mr Donald Mulford, the US assistant treasury secretary who saw First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar on Tuesday, said, and then only reluctantly and sotto voce, that the measures 'may' have an adverse effect on the budget deficit. Patently, they will. Now, however, political survival is what counts, and this congress session has shown that Mr Yeltsin remains unchallengeable so far, even though there is a majority of deputies opposed to government policy. The government's offer of resignation was obviously a tactical ploy but still enough to whip the congress into line. It dropped its insistence that a new government be presented by May, leaving the government free to pursue what Mr Gaidar said would be 'rather tough restrictions' on credits, together with high interest rates. In one sense, this parliament should have been able to exert its will: it reflects, though it does not represent, the frustrations of a people undergoing economic miseries and uncertainties, and reflects them because the deputies have local knowledge of their constituents' sufferings. However, the deputies cannot fully represent them because they hold their seats on the old system of election, with many essentially nominated by the defunct Communist Party and the institutions such as trade unions which were the party's creatures. They are thus inhibited and ultimately fearful of pressing criticism to the point where they would win and then have to take responsibility for a programme. The more astute probably know they have no workable plan, nor any competent nominees for a new cabinet. The parliament was crippled by its contradictions. The deputies most willing to deploy a populist critique of the pro-market reforms were those least able to claim a firm mandate, while the deputies who had come in on a democratic ticket were bound by loyalty to 'their' government and president. This leaves much of the electorate disenfranchised: the mass of people have experienced few benefits from reform but still have no credible representatives and cling to Mr Yeltsin as a figure of authority, albeit a harsh one. The opposition was further emasculated by the behaviour and personalities of two of the men closest to the presidential seat. Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, said before the Congress that he was not going to repeat his strongly expressed critique of the cabinet, and he kept his word. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, naturally played a larger role: he has been, ex officio, the producer of this drama. No 'speaker' in the western sense, he directs barbs from his dais to wherever he wishes, especially at the government, the members of which he called 'little boys who get scared," trying by their resignation threat to blackmail parliament. He has dismissed the IMF as both unwanted and unable to deliver the money promised by the Group of Seven. He was 'sorry' for the US if it had no better policy than to support Mr Gaidar. Yet, in the end, he pledged loyalty to Mr Yeltsin because he cannot operate outside the president's circle and thus at best, or worst, can only seek to hobble the government, not destroy it. Mr Yeltsin has had, in Mr Gaidar, a more determined opponent than he could have thought before the congress. Mr Gaidar's four months in office has seen an extraordinary assumption of political maturity. He has grown from being only an academic-cum-journalist into a statesman, from a novice politician who carelessly said he would only be in office a few months to a fighter for his cause. Mr Yeltsin, absent from the Congress since Saturday in another typical retreat from engagements and visibility, has had his status confirmed rather than enhanced. Like Mr Gorbachev before him, he remains dominant in part because he does not directly oppose any of the main characters or forces below him, even when they are fighting each other. Thus Mr Khasbulatov's parliamentarians, Mr Rutskoi's supporters in the military-industrial complex and Mr Gaidar's cabinet can all see in him 'their' leader. This has its risks, as Mr Gorbachev's career shows, but Mr Yeltsin does not yet have to struggle with an opponent as determined as he himself was in opposing Mr Gorbachev. And, though many of the Russian Federation's republics and regions are straining for greater autonomy, even independence, they are not yet to be compared with the Baltics or Ukraine. Little actual progress has been made. The main new measure to be put before the congress - a new Russian constitution - has not been tabled and may not be, or, if it is, will be unlikely to secure the required two-thirds majority. The old, Soviet-period constitution remains in force, much amended, and may have to serve for some time. But the government, and something called reform, remains. Chaos is averted, and Russian society and its government can turn back with relief to mere crisis.</p>

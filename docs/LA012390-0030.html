			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: AN EXTRA HELPING OF ADS WITH YOUR DINNER, MADAM?  </P> <P> I can't get too worked up over someone taping a phone call between my mother  and me on a cellular phone. It would serve them right. The same goes for  eavesdropping on my conversations with my kids' answering machines. Big deal.  Every day it's the same message: "Make me a grandmother!"  </P> <P> What we really should be screaming about is how advertising is invading our  privacy. In recent years we've all become walking billboards for designers.  Professional athletes are as subtle as demolition balls. Hot-air balloons hover  over us with corporate logos and billboards dot the countryside. I half  expected Manuel Noriega to wave and shout as he left the plane in Miami, "I'm  going to Disneyland!"  </P> <P> Now it seems the last frontier of privacy is about to be assaulted by  commercialism -- dining out.  </P> <P> Someone got the bright idea that waiters and waitresses have nothing to do  except introduce themselves, tell you about the specials not on the menu,  announce the soup du jour and the catch of the day, take your order, deliver  your drinks and bread, toss the salad, elevate the pepper mill like a chalice,  set fire to your food, recite the litany of the desserts, serve coffee and  disappear for two hours with your credit card. So an ad agency is suggesting  waiters and waitresses model clothes and fill you in on where to buy them and  how much they cost.  </P> <P> Get real. I have more conversation with my waiter now than I've had with my  entire family over the past two years.  </P> <P> There's more. Also under consideration is a magazine/menu that will run ads for  food, beverages and banks (that makes sense) and offer food and drinks named  for advertisers. ("Could I suggest starting off with a Lincoln S&amp;L Lite  Hemlock, sir?")  </P> <P> In my heart, I know it won't stop there. When someone is late for his  reservation, he'll be awarded the No Excuses Jeans Award. Strangers will sit  down at your table and say, "I'm not a doctor, but I own a white coat and  pretend I am when I eat out, and you need more fiber in your diet."  </P> <P> It will only be a matter of time before a rabbit with a drum and two Energizer  batteries will march through your stall in the powder room.  </P> <P> It may seem like a little thing. First a book of matches in the center of the  table with the name of an insurance company on it, and the next thing you know,  there will be a fax machine to place your order for Stud's (or whatever his  name is) leather jacket.  </P> <P> I'm probably getting paranoid, but the other night in our favorite restaurant,  every waiter there looked like Ed McMahon.  </P></p>

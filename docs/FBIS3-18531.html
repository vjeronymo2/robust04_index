			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta </F> by Roberto Petrini in Rome; date not given: "Exporting Is Good,  Investing Is Better"]    [Text] Rome -- Paolo Baratta has experienced the golden  months during which our exports have galloped ahead from the  best vantage point, that of minister of foreign trade.  Throughout 1993 the figures arriving on his desk bore witness  to booming sales of our products on foreign markets. The  overall result, in provisional figures released by the Bank of  Italy on Monday [28 February], was a positive balance of 50  trillion lire compared with just 3.8 trillion in 1992.  Economist, banker, and minister in charge of privatization in  the Amato government, Paolo Baratta is particularly attentive to  the manufacturing sector, where the recovery should take root;  an approach which inspires a sense of prudence in him. "Exports  have grown, but there are obstacles to be overcome and there are  still knots which must be untied," he explained, seated in his  office. "There will certainly be a recovery, there should be no  doubt of this," he adds, but implies that it will not be plain  sailing.    [Petrini] Minister Baratta, our exports are doing extremely  well, and shouts of enthusiasm are coming from every quarter.  Are we already out of the trough; are we a country unafraid of  rivals on its international markets?    [Baratta] We must be very careful not to interpret this data  with unwarranted optimism. Let us understand each other: The  figures are extremely positive and we are very satisfied.  However, if we look at Italy's market shares in the  industrialized countries, we realize that these have not grown:  In the United States, we have remained at around 2.4 percent,  in France, we have fallen from 11.8 percent in 1992 to 9.8  percent in the first 11 months of 1993. In Germany we have  fallen from 9.7 to 7.8 percent, and in Japan from 1.8 to 1.6  percent. On our markets, we have still not returned to our 1987  shares. In short, we have increased volume, but this has not  served to increase our penetration on Western markets. The  opposite, however, is true for the Far East, and in general for  all newly industrialized countries, where we have seen a real  and genuine boom.    [Petrini] Does this mean that the export boom could be  short-lived?    [Baratta] The danger exists. The fact is that the failure to  enlarge our market shares may be because the effects of the lira  devaluation have not yet completely worked through. If this was  the reason, there would be no need to worry, but would mean that  we still have large margins to take advantage of. However,  there is also another hypothesis: that our penetration of  wealthy and developed markets is not as easy because we still  have problems of competitiveness, of technology, and of the  organizational structures of our companies.    [Petrini] Is our production system able to consolidate our  presence abroad?    [Baratta] It is here that we win or lose. There are certain  factors which allow us to be optimistic. Our businesses, and in  particular the small and medium-sized ones, have demonstrated an  extraordinary liveliness, the "animal spirits" [words in  English] are there. But we have to act politically in order to  achieve industrial development within the new framework of  international competition: We have to be prepared to invest  many more resources in new products, in research and in the  human factor. We need to invest more in helping Italian  companies access the new markets.    [Petrini] What do our entrepreneurs need to do to ensure  that  the 1993 boom is not wasted?    [Baratta] They need to work on enlarging their markets. Move  to conquer international demand which is growing, even if very  far from home. They need to draw the correct lessons from the  devaluation: This is not a chance event, but a stimulus for  getting reorganized, for acquiring better technical structures  domestically and better sales structures abroad.    [Petrini] The lira devaluation has been pointed to as the  key  factor in the upward movement of our exports. Is this true?    [Baratta] Yes, the devaluation has had a major impact. But I  would not want to overlook the fact that, in recent years,  demand from newly industrialized countries has increased. The  fact is that the upward movement in our exports predates the  devaluation. Moreover, I would not overlook the agreement on the  labor costs which has allowed us to contain the growth of  internal costs.    [Petrini] Industrial production has picked up in the last  three months, exports are moving ahead, and internal costs have  been contained. Are these the preconditions for our economy  taking off?    [Baratta] No, these conditions are not enough. We need to  take advantage of all the opportunities which the foreign  markets offer. We need therefore to continue to secure  international credibility, financial stability, low interest  rates. We also need a very tough approach to the management of  public finances, in order to have resources available for the  numerous actions which are a necessary part of a medium-term  policy of supporting public and private investments. In  addition, we need to reduce, as soon as possible, taxation on  companies, bringing it down to the levels of the most favored  European partners.    [Petrini] In short, for you the recovery is not then just  round the corner. Is this right?    [Baratta] One can say that signs of recovery exist. We can  say that we are really in an economic recovery when we see new  investment decisions. It is certain that the recovery will  come, but it is too early to say when and how.    [Petrini] You say that small companies are reacting well;  however, there remains the question of the major industrial  sectors, of chemicals and steel making. Can the old apparatus  of previous state intervention contribute to the recovery?    [Baratta] The newly privatized industries are in certain  cases less interested in exporting. Nonetheless, in this world  we have seen a genuine revolution in behavior, a revolution  which in fact has sidelined statism as a way of being and  thinking. Since the summer of 1992, when the state said that it  would not put one lira more of equity into public industry, we  have seen a profound "privatization" of behavior. And in the  world of the newly-privatized companies, new managers are  growing up who, in a few years time, will provide us with  positive surprises.    [Petrini] And are the major private groups ready?    [Baratta] In the last two years there has been a major  tightening up coinciding with the European single market. It is  no longer possible to have a little reserve in public contracts,  and the idea that production can be protected by national  legislation has disappeared. Special attention or protection is  no longer available. This too has been a revolution.</p>

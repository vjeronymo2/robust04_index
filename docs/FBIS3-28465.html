Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this is a  deliberate act of perfidy against the DPRK.    In a commentary titled "We Have No Intention To Negotiate  With a Faithless Partner" the analyst says:    It is unequivocally stipulated in the agreement reached at  the contact between the DPRK and the United States late last  year that the DPRK was willing to accept an inspection purely  for the continuity of safeguards. Such an inspection is clearly  distinguished from routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to  the legal requirements of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT]. It is based on the special position of the DPRK which  has temporarily suspended the effectiveness of its withdrawal  from the NPT. Still less can the "special inspection" be a  matter of argument.    Nevertheless, the United States is urging the DPRK to accept  a comprehensive inspection. This cannot be construed otherwise  than an act to intentionally render the situation complicated  and obstruct a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue.    No less grave is the fact that the United States has broken  its promise to refrain from using all forces including nuclear  weapons and threatening the DPRK with them. This is really the  height of impudence, a mockery of the DPRK and the negation of  dialogue itself.    The United States seems to think that it can force upon  others more than what they promised while it can break its  promise, because it is a big power. But we can never accept  such a notion.    We will not entreat the United States to keep its faith. It  is our will to answer faith with faith, and strong arm with a  tough stance.    The U.S. hardline conservatives must stop running riot,  clearly seeing whom they are dealing with.</p>

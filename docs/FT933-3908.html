			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / EC hopes to reform Lome Convention THE European Commission yesterday unveiled plans to overhaul the Lome Convention, the much-criticised regime governing trade and aid with 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Mr Manuel Marin, EC Commissioner responsible for development policy, said it was vital to introduce tighter controls to counter inefficiency and corruption, while bolstering democratic reform and the private sector. Mr Marin, a Spanish Socialist, said the Lome Convention had to be tailored to the new post-cold war world where Africa was competing with other regions such as eastern Europe, Russia and Latin America for EC aid. Mr Marin called for Lome funds to target civil society and strength democracy, good government and the rule of law. 'It may be unfashionable to say so, but we need to create a national bourgeoisie in Africa,' he said. The 1975 Lome Convention grew out of the old Yaounde Convention, where most of the beneficiaries were French colonies. Britain's entry into the EC increased the membership in Africa and widened it to the Caribbean and Pacific, but at the expense of efficiency and coherence. The Fourth Lome Convention (1990-2000) provides for Ecu12bn (Dollars 14bn) in the form of grants, soft loans and interest rate rebates over the first five years - a 20 per cent increase on Lome III. But a recent European Parliament report said only one-third of projects produce results. Mr Marin's most controversial proposal would involve stopping the automatic payment of EC aid money to Lome clients.</p>

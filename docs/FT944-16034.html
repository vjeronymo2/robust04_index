			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Accountants set up review body The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday confirmed it has set up a working party to consider the future regulation of the profession. The move, which marks a watershed in the institute's attitude to the present system of self-regulation, brings the professional debate on standards into the public arena. The review will be seen as another blow to efforts to forge agreement on reform between the six leading accountancy bodies which meet on the so-called Bishop committee. Mr Chris Swinson, a partner with BDO Stoy Hayward, will chair the working party, which will bring proposals before the institute's annual conference in January. Mr Swinson said: 'The paper will review tensions which exist in the regulatory framework and ways in which they can be relieved.' The move brought a sharp reaction from the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA), which recently floated plans for a general accounting council for the profession. That plan was described by Mr Roger Lawson, the institute's president, as 'dead on arrival' and an abdication of the profession's responsibilities. Ms Anthea Rose, ACCA chief executive, said yesterday: 'There appears to be confusion in the institute hierarchy about what it actually does want.' The institute's review is likely to focus on trends such as rising public expectations of accountability and the loss of privileges in the profession. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, the institute's chief executive, said the debate mirrored that in other professions facing regulatory problems, such as lawyers and chartered surveyors. Mr Swinson said there were tensions between the role of the institute in regulating standards on behalf of the government and its traditional role in monitoring ethics and training. The institute said its plans for a review pre-dated ACCA's announcement of its scheme for a general accounting council. It saw debate about structures as following on a long debate on the issues. The working party's other members are all senior members of the institute's council. They are Mr John Collier, Mr Douglas Llambias, and Mr Ian McNeil, former president.</p>

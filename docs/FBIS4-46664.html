Fugarov; UDC 528:629.783]    [Abstract] The passive spacecraft (PSC) Etalon-1 and  Etalon-2 were launched into a high circular orbit in 1989 for  geodetic and geophysical research. Immediately after the launch  Glavkosmos began measurements of the laser ranges to the PSC.  The observation network consisted of Ternopol and Yevpatoriya in  the west and Maydanak, in the high mountains, in the east.  Observations were made only at nighttime in the entire part of  the visible arc each 30 minutes. During 1989-1990 ten foreign  stations were incorporated into the network (all but one in the  northern hemisphere). In the preliminary processing stage  corrections were introduced into the measurements to take  atmospheric refraction into account without the humidity  component and reduction to the center of mass. The accuracy of  laser measurements of range by Glavkosmos instruments is 25 cm,  but by foreign stations it is a few centimeters. The principal  perturbations for the Etalon orbits were gravitational  attraction of the Earth, Moon, Sun, planets and radiation  pressure. But accuracy requirements dictated allowance for the  influence of solar system planets, higher order geopotential  harmonics and solar radiation in the shaded sectors of the orbit  and radiation reflected from the Earth. Table 1 gives the  results of processing of PSC observations. The consistent  parameters of the constructed model of motion made it possible  to decrease the errors in predicting the parameters of motion of  the Etalon PSC by a factor of 1 1/2-2. This model affords a  possibility for evaluating different effects such as the  influence of solar radiation pressure in shaded sectors of the  orbit with allowance for refraction and absorption by the  Earth's atmosphere and the influence of radiation reflected from  the Earth, taking into account the seasonal-latitudinal change  in albedo and other small perturbations.</p>

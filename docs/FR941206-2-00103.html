Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (8) above, (i) a market maker that obtains an excused withdrawal pursuant to Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws prior to withdrawing from NPROVE may reenter NPROVE according to the conditions of its withdrawal; and (ii) a market maker that fails to maintain a clearing arrangement with a registered clearing agency or with a member of such an agency, and is thereby withdrawn from participation in ACT and NPROVE for Nasdaq [National Market] securities, may reenter NPROVE after a clearing arrangement has been reestablished and the market maker has complied with ACT participant requirements. Provided however, that if the Association finds that the ACT market maker's failure to maintain a clearing arrangement is voluntary, the withdrawal of quotations will be considered voluntary and unexcused pursuant to Schedule D and these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.

If all market makers decline the order consistent with Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 promulgated under the Act, the order will be automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation at the new inside quotation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [A market order will be delivered to a market maker for execution at the current inside market (buy orders will be executed at the best offer and sell orders at the best bid)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a limit order has previously been entered into NPROVE at a price superior to the best bid or offer, the incoming market order will be repriced to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a price equal to the limit order price plus 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to buy or the limit order price minus a 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to sell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [match the price of the limit order] and will be displayed for 15 seconds to all market makers whose current quotation equals the applicable inside quote[, in the case of an unpreferenced market maker in the case of a preferenced order].

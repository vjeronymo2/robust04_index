Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037.

However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers will not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) In no event shall the contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> (END OF CLAUSE) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ALTERNATE I (XXX 1994) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Publication for sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This paragraph only applies to technical data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights or a license to make an unrestricted release of technical data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

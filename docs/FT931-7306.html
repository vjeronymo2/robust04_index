			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Emu rethink call by Bank official A SENIOR Bank of England official yesterday suggested that European Community governments should look again at the rules they had agreed for determining when EC member states would become members of the planned European economic and monetary union. Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's executive director for international affairs, told the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee that the 'convergence criteria' setting the conditions for entry into the final third stage of Emu under the Maastricht treaty did not address several important issues that would confront countries approaching union. The criteria stipulate that EC member states should have brought their inflation rates, interest rates and budget deficits broadly into line before moving ahead to a European single currency and central bank. But Mr Crockett said countries should also ask themselves whether their economies were flexible enough for such a step and whether they could absorb economic shocks such as German unity. He said he would have welcomed the inclusion of other economic criteria such as unemployment in the Maastricht package and would like to see countries consider the question when they review the Maastricht Treaty and plans for economic and political union in 1996. Mr Crockett stressed, however, that he was not seeking a relaxation of the strict anti-inflationary tone of the plans for Emu. There was general agreement that price stability was important as the basis for sustainable growth. Expressing his own view, Mr Crockett said he believed that there were significant advantages in giving 'more autonomy' to central banks to achieve that goal. Answering questions from Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, Mr Crockett agreed that the Maastricht treaty contained the germ of a serious constitutional conflict in Europe over exchange rate policy.</p>

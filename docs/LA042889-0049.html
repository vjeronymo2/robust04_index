			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FLEDGING SANTA CLARITA VALLEY ARTS COUNCIL NEEDS MONEY TO REACH GOALS  </P> <P> Civic arts groups have long graced such communities as Moorpark and Thousand  Oaks. Last fall, Simi Valley got its own professional theater troupe.  </P> <P> Now the Santa Clarita Valley has its own arts council, a new organization that  aspires to promote music, dance and theater in such communities as Newhall,  Valencia and Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> "People have realized that there is a place and a need in our lives for  cultural events," said David Bozman, an engineer who is co-chairman of the  fledgling organization. "People said, 'Let's go ahead and do it. The time is  now.' "  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Valley Arts Council's long-range goals will be to arrange for  regular arts performances in the valley and to help the city of Santa Clarita  raise money for a performing arts center, Bozman said.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita's recent cityhood inspired several residents to form the group. A  little more than a month ago, flyers were sent throughout the valley to attract  anyone interested in forming an arts council. More than 50 people attended the  first meeting.  </P> <P> Council members now are wrestling with such immediate duties as drafting bylaws  and electing a board of directors.  </P> <P> Once those tasks are taken care of, the council hopes to begin some small  fund-raising efforts and organize a summer concert series that would showcase  local talent. The group said it has already booked the San Francisco Opera  Company to perform "Carmen" at William S. Hart High School for one night in  March, 1990.  </P> <P> "It's a big deal for us," said Carmen Sarro, a Santa Clarita City Council aide  and arts council member. "Now all we have to do is come up with the money for  it."  </P> <P> The council also has committed to offering the Nutcracker Ballet at the high  school in December.  </P> <P> The next meeting of the Santa Clarita Valley Arts Council will be at 7 p.m. on  May 8 in the student dining hall of The Master's College, 21726 Placerita  Canyon Road, Newhall.  </P></p>

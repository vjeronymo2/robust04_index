			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Marston at Pounds 20m DOUBLED marketing expend-iture helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the regional brewer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m over the year to March 27. However, trading conditions continued to be difficult and the outcome, under FRS 3, included bad debt provisions of Pounds 2.5m, of which Pounds 1m was taken as an exceptional charge. Advertising and promotional spending of Pounds 3.7m paid off with a 32 per cent increase in sales volumes of draught Pedigree, a substantial increase in canned Draughtflow Pedigree, and a 31 per cent rise in Low C sales. With some evidence of an upturn in consumer activity in the last few months of the year, operating profits rose from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m on turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 127.7m. Managed pubs increased profits more than 30 per cent for the fifth consecutive year. Some Pounds 9.9m was invested in pub improvements and Pounds 2.2m was spent on acquisitions. Volumes in tenanted pubs declined 5 per cent overall, but tenants on new six-year agreements achieved a 1.5 per cent increase in sales while those on the old agreement saw volumes fall an average 8 per cent. Earnings per share before exceptionals rose to 17.66p (16.53p). A proposed final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 5.4p (4.91p).</p>

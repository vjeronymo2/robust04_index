			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Frenchman who helped transform IMF: Obituary of Pierre-Paul Schweitzer Mr Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, managing director of the International Monetary Fund from 1963 to 1973 and the first of three Frenchmen to put their distinctive stamp on the institution, has died at the age of 81. In a statement yesterday, Mr Michel Camdessus, the current managing director, paid tribute to Mr Schweitzer's 'leadership and foresight and his spirit of innovation at a time when the international monetary system and the IMF itself had to undergo profound transformations'. The most obvious legacy of Mr Schweitzer's term was the creation of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs), designed as an international reserve asset to meet the exigencies of the growing instability of the US dollar in the late 1960s. In the event, concern about the US deficit did not abate and the Nixon administration was first, in August 1971, forced to close the official gold window and impose an import surcharge and domestic wage and price controls. In December, the Smithsonian agreement heralded the beginning of the end of the fixed exchange rate system by realigning currencies and increasing the official price of gold to Dollars 38 an ounce. Mr Schweitzer, deeply involved in all these negotiations, also presided over a great expansion of the IMF's membership and, therefore, of its influence over national economic policies through the conditions it imposed for making available financial assistance. Mr Schweitzer was born in Strasbourg to a distinguished family; his uncle, Albert Schweitzer, was a Nobel Peace Prize winner. He joined the French inspectorate of finance before the war, fought in the Resistance and was interned at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Before moving to the IMF, he served as director of the French treasury and as deputy governor of the Bank of France. After his IMF tenure, he served as chairman of Petrofigaz, the state energy concern, and on several company boards, among them Unilever and Robeco. His son, Mr Louis Schweitzer, is currently president of Renault.</p>

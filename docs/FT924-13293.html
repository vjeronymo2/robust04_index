			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: National Express in the fast lane - The coach company's route to the market IT HAS BEEN a long time coming, but after years of deregulation and privatisation, Britain's public transport sector is about to see its first operator make a debut on the London stock market. In the next few weeks National Express, the country's biggest express coach service operator, plans to seek a listing through a placing and offer for sale likely to value it at more than Pounds 50m. The flotation is a logical consequence of the privatisation policies pursued so vigorously in the transport sector since the Conservatives took office in 1979. Airlines, airports, ferries, ports, roadfreight and buses have all gradually been divested by the state. Some, such as British Airways, BAA, Associated British Ports and NFC, have also found their way to the stock market. But National Express is the first bus or coach operator to seek a listing. The reason is that bus privatisation is still a relatively recent phenomenon. Although the break-up of the state-owned National Bus Company began in 1986, it took two years to complete and, amid the turmoil that has accompanied the deregulation of the bus market, few companies are sufficiently well-established to consider a flotation. National Express is slightly different. Express coach services were deregulated in 1980 and the big battles for market share were fought while the company was state-owned. When National Express was bought by its management in 1988, it was well-established as the dominant player. Today, National Express white coaches with double arrowhead insignia are familiar on Britain's trunk roads and motorways. The company has 180 routes linking 1,000 towns and cities and about 80 per cent of the express coach service market. It is less well-known that National Express owns few vehicles. It contracts about 55 coach operators to run its routes at fixed rates, using their vehicles painted in the National Express livery. The company makes its money from the difference between the fares it collects and the amount it pays its contractors. At first glance, this has not proved particularly successful. The prospectus for the flotation is expected to show pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.24m on turnover of Pounds 113.8m in the year to December 1991, compared with losses of Pounds 2.91m on turnover of Pounds 125.8m the year before. However, National Express has changed since these losses were incurred. In July last year, the company was acquired by a management team headed by Mr Ray McEnhill and Mr Adam Mills and backed by a consortium of venture capital investors. Mr McEnhill and Mr Mills have considerable experience in passenger transport. In 1986 they formed Drawlane, one of Britain's biggest private sector bus companies. Drawlane companies count among the biggest suppliers of National Express services, so Mr McEnhill and Mr Mills are severing connections with their previous company to avoid conflicts of interest. According to the new management, National Express's losses in 1990 arose from misguided acquisitions, and the losses in 1991 were caused by write-offs incurred in disposing of them. On continuing operations, Mr Mills says, National Express would have made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.8m last year, and the company is likely to come to the market on a profits forecast topping that figure. The proportion of shares to be sold has yet to be fixed but 75 per cent of the tranche will be placed and the other 25 per cent sold in an open offer. Advisers are Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Smith New Court, the stockbrokers. Experience of previous privatisations is likely to stimulate interest, with investors wondering whether they are looking at another transport success story such as British Airways or NFC. On the other hand, National Express operates in a mature market. An increasing proportion of long-distance journeys are by car with rail accounting for much of the rest. Coach travel accounts for only one or two per cent, mostly those at the budget end of the market by students and the elderly. Other adverse influences include downward pressure on fares as British Rail's InterCity sector seeks to fill empty seats with special offers; EC legislation reducing coach speeds (and, perhaps more significantly, the speed of the lorries on the road in front of them) and rising traffic congestion, bringing the threat of greater delays and/or road tolls. Still, National Express is optimistic. It is planning to counter the down-market image of coach travel and stress its modern-day comforts, such as air-conditioning, videos and hostess service; it sees good growth in its Speedlink airport services, expanding on the back of rising air travel and it says it has several tricks up its sleeve which are too confidential to talk about. Pressed on the last, it hints that rail privatisation is opening up opportunities for companies that see themselves as surface transport companies instead of just bus or coach operators. Mr McEnhill says: 'It would be amazing if we weren't paying very close attention to it.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Patu] </F>   [Excerpts] The parties that have presidential candidates  have prepared government platforms based on amendments to the  Constitution despite the fact that the constitutional revision  process is paralyzed.    All the government platforms so far prepared foresee  amendments to the Constitution. FOLHA has done a study of the  proposals of the parties that intend to launch their own  candidates for president of the Republic. [passage omitted]    PDT [Democratic Labor Party] -- Proposal Reduces Federal  Taxes    The proposals to amend the Constitution included in the  preliminary PDT platform are:    -- Tax reform, by reducing the number of federal taxes from  eight to four (Article 153).    -- Increase national budget allocations for social programs  -- such as health, basic education, and housing -- for states  and municipalities (Articles 20 and 32).    -- Modify the number of deputies per state in the Chamber of  Deputies so that the number of deputies is proportional to the  number of inhabitants per state (Article 45).    -- Cancel special retirement pensions for professionals not  subject to stressful activities such as, for example,  congressmen (Article 201).    PSDB/PFL [Brazilian Social Democracy Party/Liberal Front  Party] -- Parties Disagree Over Income Tax Rule    The PSDB and the PFL are still discussing proposals for  constitutional amendments. The main points are:    -- Tax reform, by reducing the number of taxes (Article  153).  The two parties disagree over income tax rules.    -- Reform the social security system so as to increase  minimum wage retirement pensions (Article 201).    -- Redistribute federal budget allocations for states and  municipalities (Articles 20 and 32).    -- Make the state monopoly in the fields of oil and  telecommunications (Articles 176 and 177) more flexible. The  PFL wants monopolies abolished.    PT [Workers Party] -- Reform Affects Labor Union Structure    The amendments included in the PT preliminary government  platform are:    -- Tax reform, by including a program to guarantee a minimum  income (Article 153).    -- Redistribute federal budget allocations among the federal  government, states, and municipalities (Articles 20 and 32).    -- Eliminate single labor union membership by allowing a  labor category to be represented by more than one labor union  (Article 8).    -- Make changes in Labor Court powers (Article 114).    -- Establish external control over judicial branch decisions  (Article 99).    -- Ensure party fidelity (Article 17).    PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] -- Government  Platforms Seeks To Modify Federal Budget Allocations    The main amendments proposed by the PMDB range from creating  new taxes to changes in Chamber of Deputies representation.    -- Tax reform: The PMDB government platform does not explain  what amendments it considers necessary (Article 153).    -- Reform the social security system (Articles 201 and 202).    -- Redefine federal budget allocations among the federal  government, states, and municipalities (Articles 20 and 202).    -- Make public monopolies more flexible (Article 17).    -- Ensure party fidelity (Article 17).    -- Make changes in the representation of the states in the  Chamber of Deputies (Article 45).</p>

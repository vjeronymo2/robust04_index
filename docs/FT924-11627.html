			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / EC and US negotiators try to avert trade war TOP European Community and US farm negotiators held a series of urgent phone talks yesterday in an effort to avert an internationally damaging trade war. In Brussels a statement from EC officials last night said both sides were anxious to maintain contact 'to achieve a rapid and successful conclusion' of trade reform talks. The declaration came amid signs of a widening split within the EC and mounting diplomatic pressure on France, widely blamed for blocking a farm trade agreement this week, to drop its objections. Mr John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday launched a four-point initiative to rescue the EC-US negotiations on farm subsidies which broke down in Brussels on Wednesday. A crisis was triggered when EC officials refused to agree to US demands for reform of the EC's oilseeds subsidy regime. US farmers argue the regime has cost them Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in lost exports. The British and German leaders agreed that the EC would have to shift its position to ensure the continuation of the talks in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). They agreed that: Mr Ray MacSharry, European farm commissioner, should be told to return to the negotiations. The European Commission must be told that the talks cannot be allowed to founder. The US administration must be reminded how 'dangerous and damaging' retaliation would be. The need to reach a settlement should be brought home to all concerned. Their initiative was launched as it became clear that a phone call made by Mr MacSharry to Mr Ed Madigan, his US counterpart, late on Thursday persuaded US leaders to refrain from immediately imposing punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn of EC farm exports. Within the EC, a sharp message was being conveyed at a political level by Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary, who said Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had 'conflicting loyalties' between the interests of Europe and his home country France. Mr Heseltine warned: 'I very much hope he will now see that the overwhelming view of the European people is that he should act as the European that he is and conclude a deal with the Americans.' He noted also that President Francois Mitterrand of France had played a full part in the EC summit in Birmingham last week which was committed to achieving a deal. In Brussels, Mr MacSharry has been rallying support to try to clinch a deal on agriculture with the US, which could lead to the conclusion of the six-year old Uruguay Round. Officials in Brussels and Washington were seeing whether each other's 'bottom lines' could be reconciled, a senior Commission official said. Inside the Commission, there were increasing signs of a divide over whether or not to settle with the US. Senior officials say there is a clear majority in favour of the deal Mr MacSharry wants to negotiate. This would cut the volume of EC subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent and the value by 36 per cent.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Era of low retail margins forecast RETAILERS will have to restructure their businesses to cope with a permanent era of low margins, the Verdict retail consultancy said yesterday, John Thornhill writes. It expects weak demand and overcapacity to depress the sector's profitability for the foreseeable future. It suggests that devaluation of the pound will not spur an immediate rise in retail price inflation because retailers can ill afford to pass on price rises when consumer demand is so weak. Verdict also expects inflation in shop prices to remain steady at about 4 per cent for the coming year, rising to just over 5 per cent by 1996. Verdict on Retailing 1996.

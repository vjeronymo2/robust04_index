			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [14 April] in Bonn, Iraqi  Kurd leader Jalal Talabani came out in favor of preserving the  unity of Iraq but rejected any coexistence of his people with  Saddam Husayn's dictatorship in Baghdad. "We will never again  return beneath the yoke of Saddam's brutal dictatorship," the  secretary general of the "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan" said at  a Kurdish-German event.    Talabani stressed that the Kurdish federal state in northern  Iraq, which was proclaimed in 1992, can and will survive. "We  are well organized and we are willing to pay the price for it,"  he stated. The next goal is the liberation of those oil-rich  parts of Kurdistan that are still occupied by the Iraqi military  at the moment. He complained that the Kurds in this region are  not only persecuted by Baghdad but also suffer under the  sanctions imposed by the United Nations.    He affirmed Kurdish solidarity with the other Iraqi  opposition groups in the struggle against the regime in Baghdad.  Accusations of separatism are completely unfounded, he said.  The Kurds want the establishment of a democratic Iraq with a  federal system as the best guarantee to preserve their cultural  identity. Talabani, who also met with Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel in Bonn, criticized Western politicians, who see Saddam's  regime as the guarantor of Iraq's unity. In reality, the  dictatorship is the greatest enemy of unity, because it divides  the nation, Talabani stressed.</p>

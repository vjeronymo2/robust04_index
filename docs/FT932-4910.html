			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / The land of the rising surplus: The dilemma posed by Japan's trade imbalance If Japanese officials had any hopes that they could avoid a confrontation with the US over the two countries' strained trade relations, last week's Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development talks in Paris must have dispelled them. At the OECD ministerial talks, the US subjected Japan to unrelenting criticism over its trade surplus. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the surplus was a drag on world growth and warned: 'That must change.' Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, reiterated the US demand that trade agreements with Japan deliver measurable results in reducing the surplus. This week, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is expected to outline proposals to halve the Japanese trade surplus to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, partly by demanding that Japan agree on targets to deliver shares of its domestic markets to foreign exporters. US business is also delivering to Tokyo a stream of demands for market access. After US apple growers pressed their case in Tokyo last Thursday, it was the turn of semiconductor producers on Friday. They will be followed next week by construction companies . It will not be easy for Japan to satisfy US requests: its capacity to pump up domestic demand to suck in imports has been significantly curtailed since the mid-1980s. Japanese officials are sceptical about how quickly the current account surplus, worth Dollars 117.6bn in 1992 and expected to reach Dollars 140bn this year, can be reduced. The surplus with the US is worth about Dollars 50bn. Mr Nobuyori Kodaira, director of the Americas division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, remarked: 'The factors behind the US trade deficit cannot be expected to change overnight.' The scepticism reflects the mixed success of past attempts to reduce the surplus. The most concerted effort was during the late 1980s, after Japan's current account surplus rose to Dollars 87bn in 1987. Largely in response to foreign pressure, Japan cut interest rates to expand domestic demand and boost imports. At the same time, the US and Japanese governments set up the Structural Impediments Initiative to examine trade imbalances. The policy was successful as far as economic growth and import demand were concerned. The Japanese economy grew by 4 per cent a year or more between 1987 and 1991, while the current account surplus fell to Dollars 35.8bn in 1990. However, the boom also created a damaging side-effect. It prompted an unsustainable rise in land and stock prices amid the rampant speculation of the late 1980s. As economic growth has slowed over the past two years - down to 1.3 per cent last year - demand for imports has fallen sharply. The terms of trade have also shifted since 1990. The fall in oil prices has reduced Japan's import bill, while the strength of the yen has inflated dollar-denominated export prices. The result has been a relentless rise in the current account surplus from just over 1 per cent of Japanese GDP in 1990 to 3.2 per cent last year. As a senior US business executive in Tokyo puts it: 'The measures of the late 1980s were a political success because they defused the tension. But economically they failed. The US is right back where we started.' That is only partly true. While the problem is familiar, the context for talks about reducing Japan's trade surplus is different from that of the mid-1980s. The end of the cold war has shifted the basis for the relationship. The US alliance with Japan, built on the need to contain communism in Asia, anchored the relationship even when trade tensions threatened to drive them apart. Economics has emerged as the dominant issue, and the Clinton administration appears to want to take a more assertive approach than its predecessors. In addressing the problem of its surplus, Japanese politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists will face tougher choices than in the 1980s. During the past 10 months the government has announced plans to spend more than Dollars 200bn to steer the economy away from outright recession. It has succeeded, only to find itself confronting the equally pressing task of renegotiating its trade relationship with the US. Macro-economic policy has been adjusted, partly to cut the surplus. Official interest rates are at an all-time low of 2.5 per cent, and since last August the government has announced special pump-priming measures worth Y24,000bn to revive the economy. Change has also been forced upon it by the appreciation of the yen. A chorus of complaint from Tokyo has accompanied the yen's rise this year from about Y125 to the dollar to about Y107, an increase that has made Japanese exporters less competitive. Senior Japanese government officials hoped the spending measures would satisfy the US. But Mr Bentsen describes them as a 'useful first step'. He wants the Japanese government to use higher public spending and tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand. There is a limit to what macro-economic policy can achieve, however. In the late 1980s, growth of about 4 per cent a year was required to reduce Japan's trade surplus significantly. Even the most optimistic forecasters do not believe such growth is possible until late 1995. The scale of stimulus required to promote such growth is opposed by the Bank of Japan and the finance ministry. They argue that the economy would start overheating again, while the public finances would be compromised. A senior Bank official explained: 'We will set our policy according to our long-term domestic needs, not international calls for higher growth.' For the ruling Liberal Democratic party, neither of the main alternatives to macro-economic stimulus is appetising. The first is to forge bilateral trade agreements with the US. Mr Kantor has identified seven sectors for talks: cars, car parts, semiconductors, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications and construction. The political risk for the LDP is that market share agreements would alienate Japanese exporters already hit by the high yen. Special agreements with the US would also antagonise Japan's other trading partners. However, if Japan rejects such deals, negotiations will shift to issues potentially more sensitive for the LDP. The second alternative would be reform of the so-called structural impediments of Japanese attitudes and business practices, which many foreign companies allege discriminate against them. Senior Japanese officials expect the US to renew calls for Japan to become a more consumer-led society, which saves less and spends more. The gross savings ratio in Japan in 1990 was 34.6 per cent of GDP, compared with 14.4 per cent in the US. The opening of markets has supporters among Japan's younger politicians and consumer groups, as well as Bank of Japan governor Mr Yasushi Mieno and senior officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But for structural reform to succeed, the LDP would risk alienating some of its most important constituencies, by opening up relatively protected industries such as construction, retailing and agriculture. The construction industry is a vital source of funds for the LDP; and the party's base is in rural constituencies. In the late 1980s the LDP briefly squared the circle. It stimulated the economy, cut the trade surplus, mollified Washington and still satisfied domestic supporters because high growth avoided painful economic change. It will not be so easy this time. In the next few months the government will tread a tortuous path between alienating the US by resisting its demands, loosening the finance ministry's grip on public purse strings, and forcing its domestic business supporters to accept reform.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         JAPAN'S TRADE PROFITS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               1985   1986   1987   1988  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current account surplus Dollars bn            49.2   85.8   87.0   79.6 Current account surplus to GNP (Per cent)      3.6    4.2    3.6    2.7 Imports to GNP (Per cent)                      8.7    5.7    5.3    5.6 Real economic growth rate (Per cent)           5.2    2.6    4.3    6.2 Contribution of foreign demand to economic growth (Per cent)                              1.2   -1.0   -0.6   -1.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               1989   1990   1991   1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current account surplus Dollars bn            57.2   35.8   72.9  117.6 Current account surplus to GNP (Per cent)      2.0    1.2    2.2    3.2 Imports to GNP (Per cent)                      6.7    7.3    6.0    5.5 Real economic growth rate (Per cent)           4.8    4.8    4.1    1.8 Contribution of foreign demand to economic growth (Per cent)                             -0.9   -0.2    1.4    0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Fuji Economic Review  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italy in Support of Macedonia"] </F>   [Text] "The Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi feels  that the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is irrational and that, as a man  who puts the economy in the forefront, he can simply not accept  this as a form of communication with another country,"  Macedonia's Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski emphasized at  yesterday's press conference, following his visit to Italy.  Crvenkovski emphasized that Berlusconi had promised that at the  next EU meeting on Corfu, he would express the Italian stance in  relation to the Greek embargo, in front of the Greek government  representatives.    The Macedonian Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with  what Macedonia displayed on a cultural plan within the framework  of the manifestation "Macedonia in the Honor of St. Cyril," but  also on a political plan, after the realized contacts with the  high-ranking officials of Italy and Vatican.    Branko Crvenkovski underlined that a particular emphasis in  the talks was placed on Italy's economic participation in  Macedonian and the East-West project, which, together with its  sub-projects, such as the gas line and the traffic route, offers  possibilities for a joint appearance of construction workers  from both countries on the Albanian market.</p>

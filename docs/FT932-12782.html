			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): How to challenge a rates assessment - In a Nutshell Businesses regard their rates bill as a fixed overhead but in many cases they can challenge an assessment and reduce its impact, according to a new guide from surveyors Nelson Bakewell. The Occupier's Guide to Commercial Rates explains how the rating system works with particular reference to the transitional arrangements brought in following the last revaluation in 1990. Rate demands are frequently hard to decipher because of the complexity of the law and a lack of standardisation, layout and detail contained in the forms, the guide states. Rating authorities often make inaccurate assumptions or fail to apply the transitional calculations correctly. The guide explains the circumstances in which businesses may appeal against their rate demand and points up the importance of making sure that the next re-rating, from April 1995 but based on notional rental values of April 1993, is accurate.

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Councils face 1% limit on pay rises in spending squeeze LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be told next week that they must contain the increase in their pay bills to just over 1 per cent if they are to make room for any real increases in services. As ministers confirmed that local authorities were one of the principal targets of the spending squeeze in the Autumn Statement, the signs were that the increase in council budgets will be limited to about 3 per cent. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will seek to enforce the clampdown with a 'capping' regime for council budgets. But there was acknowledgement in Whitehall that in the south of England it will mean a sharp increase in bills when the community charge is replaced by the council tax in April. Officials said a transitional relief scheme will provide a partial cushion for households in southern England, but those with properties in the top bands for the new tax would be expected to absorb increases of up to Pounds 300 a year before receiving rebates. Across the country as a whole the typical household bill is likely to be more than Pounds 600 against the Pounds 560 total this year for two community charge bills. Ministers are aware that the tax could prompt serious rebellion by Tory backbench MPs, but will argue that the cabinet's decision to hold the level of grants for local authorities was essential to protect capital programmes. Subject to a final deal with the administrator of Canary Wharf, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, has won approval for the Jubilee Line extension to Canary Wharf. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present the scheme as a model for co-operation on other public-private sector projects. Mr MacGregor had to accept reductions in London Regional Transport's other investment programmes and cuts in his department's roads programme. Mr Howard will also indicate that the squeeze on the standard spending assessment, which provides the basis of central government finance for local authorities, will be offset in part by a relaxation of the rules limiting their use of capital receipts. Ministers said that although the restrictions on accumulated capital receipts would remain, councils would be permitted to spend a higher proportion of future receipts.

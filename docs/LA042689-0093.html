			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL BACKS OFF ON CUTBACK THREAT  </P> <P> The emergency room at Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte will remain open to all  patients, its board of directors decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The hospital had warned that it might stop accepting patients brought to the  emergency room in ambulances unless state and county officials approved a plan  to convert 23 hospital beds to more profitable use in an affiliated nursing  home.  </P> <P> The hospital's proposal was submitted to the county Health Services Department  in August. Mike Costello, the hospital's executive vice president, said that  after "a long bureaucratic stalemate," the Los Angeles Office of Statewide  Health Planning and Development approved the change April 13. The Health  Services Department must still act on the plan.  </P> <P> Santa Teresita lost $400,000 in operating the emergency room in 1987. Losses  climbed to $600,000 last year. Officials say they can cover the losses with  money made from the new beds in the nursing home.  </P></p>

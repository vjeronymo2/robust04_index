			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "Analyzer"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United  States has become quite a controversial issue now. A feeling  has emerged that the Clinton Administration is trying to  blackmail us and force us into a situation that binds our hands.    The global situation today has made the United States a  superpower. It is resorting to various types of tricks to make  us sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] when in Asia,  Pakistan and China possess nuclear weapons.    The United States has been keeping an eye on us after we  successfully test-fired the five missiles -- Agni, Prithvi,  Akash, Trishul, and Nag. At first, it supported Pakistan on the  Kashmir issue and later calmed down after the resolution on  Kashmir was defeated at the Geneva Human Rights Conference.    The United States could not prevent China from continuing to  manufacture nuclear weapons. It has decided to provide F-16  fighter planes to the Benazir Bhutto government.    With the help of these aircraft, Pakistan can easily target  our numerous vital installations, including nuclear power  plants, and destroy them. A long border exists between India  and China. It is a historical fact that even when China-India  friendship was flourishing, China invaded us in 1962 and  committed aggression against our territory. Nevertheless, while  Chinese strength is emerging, the United States wants us to halt  even the tests of missiles like "Agni".    There is a feeling that India floundered during the recent  talks between the representatives of India and the United States  in London. However, the prime minister has, time and again,  said that we will not succumb to any pressure on the NPT.    The events occurring after the visit of U.S. Deputy  Secretary  of State Talbott, however, conform to the prevailing view that  the United States is stepping up its pressure on India.    Earlier, there was a report that Dr. Abdul Kalam, the great  scientist hailing from Ramanathapuram, who is known as the  "father of missiles" would be transferred from his post.  Opposition leader Vajpayee raised the question whether this  scientist, who brought laurels to the country by producing  "Agni," was going to retire. The government immediately  announced that that Dr. Abdul Kalam's tenure would continue.    The NPT is discriminatory. What is the justification for the  countries who have already amassed a lot of lethal nuclear  weapons, to ask a country, which has acquired only the technical  know-how, to sign the NPT first? Our thinking so far has been  that the NPT will not apply to India.    The situation changed a little since signing the GATT  accord.  An opinion has emerged that as stated by the United States,  5+2+2 [the five recognized nuclear powers plus Germany and Japan  plus India and Pakistan] countries can hold talks on the subject.    Our government has not made any categorical announcements on  this in the parliament. Opposition leader Vajpayee says that  the prime minister should assure that he will not discuss  anything other than economic issues during his visit to the  United States.    Leaders like Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and the  ruling party's Professor Tiwari are apprehensive that the prime  minister's visit can culminate in some dangerous consequences.    Political observers opine that Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao's  first meeting with President Clinton will create problems when  Clinton's political maneuvers are totally against India.    Among international circles, it has clearly been felt that  Clinton, who is very particular about providing the F-16 nuclear  bomb carrier to Pakistan, is trying to arrest India's growth and  crush it.    About 20 years ago a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran  in  Rajasthan on 18 May 1974, for peaceful purposes only. That  underground test made it clear to the world that we have the  capability to manufacture nuclear bombs.    Subsequent prime ministers, however, including Indira  Gandhi,  did not show interest in conducting nuclear bomb tests.    Thereafter, India made several achievements in nuclear  energy. Today, we are also in a position to manufacture nuclear  weapons by taking a few steps. Chidambaram, the chief of the  Department of Atomic Energy [name and title as published] has  said: There is nothing that India cannot accomplish.    At first, the five countries -- United States, Soviet Union,  China, the United Kingdom, and France -- have been recognized as  nuclear powers. But, as per the accord on nuclear  nonproliferation in 1967, it was decided that barring these five  countries, no one should manufacture nuclear weapons. The  accord reached in this connection is called the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, known as the NPT. So far, 140  countries have signed it.    Iraq also signed the treaty, but it manufactured nuclear  bombs by producing plutonium. South Africa is another country  which signed the treaty but covertly manufactured nuclear bombs.  North Korea also did the same thing.    So far, several countries, including India, Pakistan, and  Israel have not signed the treaty. The funny thing is that  Israel has been put on the list of honorary countries possessing  nuclear capability.    No one has ever tried to prevent the countries that  legitimately manufacture nuclear weapons in the name of the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or to eliminate the threat they  pose. On the other hand, the United States is using this treaty  as a tool to prevent several peaceful projects, including the  launching of satellites. On this basis only, it put  restrictions on Russia in supplying cryogenic engines even to  India. Therefore, not only India, but France, Argentina, China,  South Africa have not accepted the NPT.    After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia,  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus possess nuclear weapons.    Hence, including Germany and Japan with the already existing  five nuclear countries, there are seven countries manufacturing  nuclear weapons. By adding India and Pakistan, it has been  calculated that there are five+two+two nuclear countries. The  United States wants all of them to end their nuclear tests.    As a first step, the United States wants the halting of  tests  for all missile programs, including "Agni".    If the Agni, Akash, and Trishul missiles are installed on  our  borders, they will help us face any attack from Pakistan or  China.    Already, due to resource constraints, we are not able to  provide the armed forces with the necessary sophisticated  weapons. Under these circumstances, if important missiles like  "Agni" are crippled, it will benefit certain countries such as  Pakistan.    Therefore, the Rao government is constrained to convince the  people that the country should go nuclear. Otherwise, as  India's enemies could wage a war against it at any time, it has  no recourse other than face a very delicate situation. Only  after this realization, several reports about the pressure  exerted by the United States began appearing. The Indian  Government is also constrained to explain to the people and the  parliament about its position every now and then.</p>

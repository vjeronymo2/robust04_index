			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Met Office claims an 84% accuracy rate A TOTAL of 84 per cent of public weather forecasts were accurate in the year to March 1992, the same level as the previous year, the Meteorological Office said yesterday. The accuracy rate is helped by good weather and 1991 was the warmest year on record, the Met Office said. Since it failed to predict the hurricane that swept parts of the UK in October 1987, the Met Office, a government agency funded mainly by the Ministry of Defence, has invested heavily to improve its forecasts' accuracy. Its new forecasting model, launched in the past year, which brings together weather forecasting and predictions of global climate change, cost Pounds 5m. The Met Office cost the taxpayer - through the MoD - Pounds 71.1m in the year to March 1992, compared to Pounds 58m the year before. Professor Julian Hunt, the chief executive appointed in January, said: 'The government now wants to see the net cost of the Met Office reducing.' The MoD has set a target of an annual cut in the Met Office's net operating costs of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent - around Pounds 1m - in each of the next five years. The Met Office plans to cut 200 staff based at MoD sites, from its present staff total of 2,500. Prof Hunt said that as well as cost control, the Met Office needed to concentrate on presenting weather information more clearly. The Met Office has found the proportion of people who can remember television weather forecasts that they have just seen is 40 per cent or lower. 'We also find it disappointing that despite our severe weather warning forecasts just as many high-sided vehicles are blown over as ever,' Prof Hunt said. The Met Office's total costs in the year to March 1992 were Pounds 122m, almost half of which was staff costs. This compares with costs of Pounds 110.2m in the previous year. The costs were partly offset by Pounds 44.9m from selling forecasts to other government departments and businesses, a rise of Pounds 4.9m on the previous year. The income included Pounds 13.9m from television, radio, press, shipping and energy companies.</p>

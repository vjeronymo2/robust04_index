			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / People: GA looks for change The promotion of Bob Scott to the board of General Accident Fire and Life Assurance, the UK operating board of the Perth-based insurance composite is symptomatic of the wind of change at the traditionally cautious Scottish company. An Australian who has spent much of his working life in New Zealand, Scott came into the GA fold following the takeover of NZI in 1987. He then moved to the UK in 1990 to spearhead a restructuring of the company's sluggish UK operations. Now 50, he is one of a number of younger executives to emerge at GA in recent years. The finance director, Barry Holder, is in his mid-40s. It has been a tough two years. GA has rationalised its branch structure, cutting over a thousand jobs, and has survived a confrontation with brokers over its determination to sell a greater percentage of its home and motor policies directly to the public. Yesterday's appointment is an indication that Scott has impressed the powers that be in Perth. After two years of heavy underwriting losses, GA's first quarter results were last month showing glimmers of a turnround in the company's UK performance.</p>

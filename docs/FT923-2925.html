			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Grand Met looks to US GRAND Metropolitan, the British leisure group, yesterday joined the flood of companies taking advantage of low US interest rates to raise money in the domestic US bond market as it moved to refinance Dollars 800m of its short-term debt. Grand Met issued seven, 12-and 30-year bonds to repay some of the commercial paper it has issued to launch acquisitions in recent years, including its takeover of US group Pillsbury in 1989. Corporate borrowers have benefited from the falling differential between the rates paid by borrowers and the US government. Last summer, Grand Met launched 20-year bonds at a spread of more than 90 basis points over US Treasuries, compared with a spread now of 77 basis points on its 30-year bonds. Due to falling US rates, the company had been able to issue longer-dated bonds at an all-in yield of around 1 percentage point less than a year ago.</p>

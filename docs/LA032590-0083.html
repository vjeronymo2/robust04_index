			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CATCHING FORMER NAZIS AT AIRPORTS;  </P> <P> TRAVEL: THE DROPPING OF VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR GERMANS LETS POSSIBLE WAR  CRIMINALS ENTER THE COUNTRY. BUT A FEDERAL AGENCY IS WAITING FOR THEM.  </P> <P> The flight from Europe to America and the Florida cruise that he had won in a  contest looked like the vacation of a lifetime to the West German.  </P> <P> But, when the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation got word  that the man had just landed at Boston's Logan Airport, officials in Washington  checked their computers and found that he had been a member of Hitler's dreaded  SS and was a designated war criminal.  </P> <P> So, instead of basking in the Caribbean sun, he was sent packing straight back  to Germany.  </P> <P> The incident, one of a small but growing number of rejections at U.S. entry  points, reflects a little-known aspect of the Office of Special Investigation,  best known for stripping the U.S. citizenship of ex-Nazis linked to wartime  persecution and deporting them.  </P> <P> The rejections are another means of "exacting some justice" against Nazi  offenders, said the office's director, Neal Sher.  </P> <P> Apprehensions of ex-Nazis at U.S. airports, while infrequent, are increasing  because of a pilot program, begun in 1988, that allows citizens of West Germany  and seven other countries to visit the United States without first obtaining a  visa from a U.S. embassy abroad, as previously had been required.  </P> <P> The old procedure provided time for the person's name to be checked against  State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service "watch lists" --  rosters of individuals who are barred from entering the United States -- and  for any questions to be resolved.  </P> <P> The pilot program was adopted to save resources, promote tourism and  reciprocate with countries that do not require U.S. travelers to obtain visas.  </P> <P> Since last October, immigration authorities have turned back nine individuals  at U.S. airports for Nazi-related activities, Sher said. But, with travel to  the United States increasing, he expects the numbers to continue to rise.  </P> <P> The experimental visa waiver program, which runs until next year, has led to  such airport incidents as that of the cruise-bound West German, who was called  to Sher's attention at 11 p.m., after the man had arrived at Logan Airport.  </P> <P> Sometimes, there is not enough time or information to turn back the traveler at  the point of entry.  </P> <P> For example, Sher said that during last year's Christmas holiday travel season  he was called by INS authorities at Kennedy Airport in New York about another  West German who was on a list of persons sought by the French for World War II  activities.  </P> <P> The individual -- Sher would not disclose names -- admitted having belonged to  an infamous SS unit responsible for massacring captured Canadian soldiers  immediately after D-Day, when the Allied forces landed in France.  </P> <P> But the West German insisted that he had not joined the unit until August,  1944, two months after the massacre took place.  </P> <P> "We couldn't verify immediately, so he was allowed in," Sher said. Then Sher  and his deputy arranged to interview the man, who had come to the United States  to visit his son at Princeton University.  </P> <P> "It was an intense interrogation," in which the ex-SS member finally admitted  to having joined the unit before D-Day, Sher said. "He was carrying orders from  one squad to another, and they discussed what was being done to the Canadians.  It was vicious."  </P> <P> When the man was notified that he had to cut short his visit and return to  Germany, "he felt offended and just couldn't understand why we were doing this  after all those years," Sher said.  </P> <P> To guard against such occurrences during the pilot program, a State Department  spokeswoman said, foreigners are urged to apply for visas at U.S. embassies if  they think questions might be raised about their entry.  </P></p>

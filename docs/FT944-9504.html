			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: First closure of Peregrine fund Peregrine Investments Holdings, the Hong Kong-based investment bank, yesterday announced the 'first closure' at Dollars 500m of its Asian Infrastructure Fund and gave details of its investments. The fund, which was launched earlier this year, will invest in Asian telecommunications, transport and power plants, underlining a growing trend towards private financing of infrastructure, especially in the emerging markets. It has already raised some Dollars 590m. is well on track to meet a target of Dollars 1bn by the time of its final closure next year and should eventually match in size the AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund, which closed in June with Dollars 1,086m committed. Peregrine's fund is co-sponsored by Frank Russell Company, the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank and investors associated with Mr George Soros' Quantum Fund. Its advisory board is chaired by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur who runs Hopewell Holdings, the property and infrastructure conglomerate. Three of the fund's initial investments are in Consolidated Electric Power Asia companies, a group controlled by Hopewell, with Dollars 50m each to be channelled to CEPA units in Indonesia, Pakistan and India. The fund has also committed to four other projects: an initial Dollars 26m in a 108km four-lane toll road linking Chengdu in Sichuan with Mianyang; up to Dollars 50m in a telecommunications project providing broad band digital transmissions between Europe and east Asia; and up to Dollars 75m in a 235mW combined cycle power station in Andhra Pradesh, in India. The utilities in which the fund is investing offer 'stable and predictable cashflows, but because these economies are growing so quickly they do have the characteristics of growth stocks,' pointed out Mr Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Badri Koplatadze article: "Reut's Deputy Has Become </F> Defense Minister. Tengiz Kitovani Has Returned To Georgia."]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Kitovani's Return From His Travels </H5>   During the closed session [of Parliament on 26 April], the  recent return from Moscow of former Defense Minister Tengiz  Kitovani was the focus of journalists' attention. Kitovani  looked extremely self-confident and enthusiastically answered  journalists' questions. The former minister views the new  [defense] minister [General Vardiko Nadibaidze] with extreme  skepticism. Kitovani believes that Vardiko Nadibaidze will be  unable to live up to people's hopes. In addition to this, many  problems are arising in the Army that is unaccustomed to  Nadibaidze's style of work.    Tengiz Kitovani gave a similarly negative assessment of the  personality of [former minister] Murman Omanidze. "How can I  have a good opinion of Omanidze who has stolen so many millions  of dollars," said Kitovani. Kitovani pointed out that Omanidze's  rapprochement with the Union of Traditionalists was highly  doubtful given that he [Kitovani] was the founder of the union  along with [former Supreme Council Chairman] Akaki Asatiani.  Regarding Omanidze's intention to become a parliamentary deputy  for Rustavi [major industrial town southeast of Tbilisi],  Kitovani stated: "This will be possible only if he buys up the  whole of Rustavi." It is interesting to note that [former  Deputy Interior Minister] Davit Zeikidze, who incurred the wrath  of parliament, is also planning to take part in the elections in  Rustavi. Kitovani characterized the terrorist acts that have  been taking place in Georgia as state terror. He touched upon  his trip to Russia and pointed out that he had visited certain  circles there. "We should view the situation in Georgia from  there," stated the former minister. According to him, people in  Russia have a very bad view of Georgia and so long as  Shevardnadze remains in power, the situation will not change.  Kitovani explained this by saying that Shevardnadze had nothing  to be proud of when he left Russia and, in general, according to  Kitovani, if Shevardnadze resigns in time, the situation will be  saved. Kitovani explained Shevardnadze's return to Georgia in  the following way: "We brought him here so that people could  really see the situation that would take shape. Otherwise, they  would have constantly been pinning their hopes on Shevardnadze  alone."    Tengiz Kitovani cannot see any difference between democratic  and reactionary Russia as everyone wants to rule and conduct his  own policies. In his opinion, we will be unable to move out of  the sphere of Russian influence. This was already decided in  Malta. "We had a chance to leave then. If we had been more  clever, we would have used it," said Kitovani. "However, now it  is necessary to establish mutual understanding with those who  are interested in the Caucasus." Kitovani mentioned the bad  actions of our neighbors [Russia] and reminded journalists of  what battalions had fought in Abkhazia. Regarding his meeting  with Zhirinovskiy, Kitovani explained Volfovich's real  intentions. He views Abkhazia as an integral part of Russia.    As for Abkhazia, Tengiz Kitovani stated that it was lost and  that there was little chance of getting it back. "Shevardnadze  was the principal reason for our losing Abkhazia," said Kitovani  and added that he was guilty of many crimes. He mentioned  Shevardnadze's visit to Kazakhstan and China as being one of the  reasons for the loss of Abkhazia.    In response to REZONANSI's question as to what he thought  about the current inspection of the Ministry of Defense, he said  that he had nothing to fear and, if there had been something,  the whole world would have known about it by now.    Finally, Kitovani pointed out that Georgia should be a  parliamentary republic and that one-man management should be  abolished as this, in Kitovani's view, will lead us to  dictatorship.

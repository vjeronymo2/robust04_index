In response to a question  by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency, Zlenko said that "all  signatories of the statement on nuclear disarmament of Ukraine  should fulfil their obligations."    Earlier this week Ukrainian leaders stated that Ukraine may  suspend the withdrawal of warheads unless Russia starts  transportation of nuclear fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power  stations.    "We are entitled to issue a statement and take corresponding  measures in order to fulfil obligations assumed under the  trilateral statement," Zlenko said. Asked about the U.S. role  in the fulfillment of obligations under the statement, Zlenko  said: "We are talking about equal partnership. Each side should  assume equal obligations."</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: NEW RESTAURANT IN LA JOLLA;  </P> <P> CHINESE CUISINE ARRIVES BY THE WAY OF DES MOINES  </P> <P> Although not quite an internationally acclaimed capital of good eating, San  Diego can boast chefs and cooks from Paris, Brooklyn, Rome, Hong Kong,  Florence, Tokyo, Athens, Oaxaca, New Orleans and hundreds of other large and  middling dots on the globe.  </P> <P> With the opening of the new Pei's of La Jolla, the city's roster of restaurant  origins has expanded to include Des Moines, Iowa, where restaurateur James Pei  has operated a Chinese restaurant since 1979.  </P> <P> An employee at Pei's (pronounced pies, as in a la mode) who previously worked  at the Des Moines establishment said that restaurant has 300 seats, enjoys  enormous popularity and is "packed all the time."  </P> <P> The question that naturally arises is, can 200,000 Des Moinesians be wrong?  </P> <P> The answer would seem to be, on occasion.  </P> <P> Within days of Pei's opening, word flew around the restaurant community that a  Chinese restaurant of unusual and even extraordinary elegance had arrived to  challenge not only other Chinese houses, but also La Jolla restaurants  generally. And, with its marble entry, crisp linens, fresh flowers and graceful  decor, Pei's is handsome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Exotic Touches  </P> <P> Pei's menu announces that the restaurant serves "distinctive Mandarin cuisine."  This claim aside, the employee shared the information that, in Des Moines, the  two overwhelmingly popular dishes are garlic chicken and Mongolian beef. After  sampling both of these over the course of three visits, the impression was  gained that Pei's speaks Chinese with a twang more distinctively Middle  American than Mandarin.  </P> <P> Both dishes were, in fact, quite good, if not exotic or particularly  sophisticated. There was good authority to the garlic chicken, the flavor  breathy but not overpowering, the diced chicken demurely mated with mushrooms  and water chestnuts. The Mongolian beef, teamed not only with the usual  scallions but also with savory chunks of onion, was succulent in the real sense  of the word, and seemed not unlike a good steak smothered in onions.  </P> <P> If anything, a sort of Sunday supper calmness characterizes much of the  cooking, which sometimes is sedate to the point of seeming sedated. The food is  served abundantly and with some style, but the addition of a little verve would  make it better.  </P> <P> The page of specialties that opens the menu, for example, sometimes promises  more than it delivers. This is true with dishes designated as spicy and hot,  which are sometimes incendiary and sometimes bland, a situation that robs the  designation of reliability.  </P> <P> A case in point is the "princess" prawns, described as "deep-fried large prawns  blended with our special hot sauce." The fact of this description was a plate  of greasy, batter-fried shrimp, served with a bowl of sweetish, sticky sauce.  </P> <P> There are good dishes on the specials list, though, most notably a pair made  with beef. The orange-flavored beef, which many local restaurants prepare with  varying success, consisted of crisply fried shreds of meat coated with a deeply  pungent sauce based on dried tangerine peel. The dish, called "Pei's beef,"  consisted of thin slices of very tender meat that seemed to have been lightly  breaded in minced garlic, and the finished product had a deep, fine flavor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homemade Touch  </P> <P> The appetizer list amounts to a roll call of old acquaintances, some of them  friendlier than others. There are acceptable won ton, for example, and the  dubious but delightful crab Rangoon pastries (because they contain cream  cheese, they seem Chinese only by virtue of their won ton skins, but they are  delicious), as well as barbecued pork and spareribs and rather tasty teriyaki  beef. Egg rolls had the virtue of being homemade, and were likable for the  fresh cabbage in the filling; too many eateries these days resort to the frozen  commercial variety, which fry up mushy and awful. Pot stickers are plump and  juicy, but served simply with soy sauce, another example of Pei's Midwestern  bent. Dumpling aficionados know that these tasty packages must be accompanied  by soy sauce enlivened with gingered vinegar and chili oil. The special won  tons billed "spicy hot" were exactly that.  </P> <P> The kitchen also turned in a mixed performance with the more standard entrees  listed under meat, fowl, seafood and vegetable headings. The pork moo shu  filling is light and savory and the pancakes tender and tasty. Snow white  chicken is a similarly satisfying dish, a simple combination of sliced chicken  breasts, Chinese forest mushrooms and vegetables that have great delicacy and  are a wonderful prelude to something hot.  </P> <P> The hot dishes can disappoint, however, because they often are heated with red  pepper flakes, which rasp the throat and provide heat without flavor. Szechuan  "black paper" peppers perform the job much more subtly and would be preferable  in such dishes as the ma la chicken, or slivered breast meat with mushrooms,  and in the "fish-flavored" scallops, which added water chestnuts to the  mushroom garnish but were less fishy than flavorless. The usual sweet-sours,  soft noodle (lo mein) dishes and fried rices round out the entree selections.  </P> <P> Unlike most Chinese restaurants, Pei's actually offers a wine list, and one of  respectable length, although selections under $20 are in the minority. There  are several light Chardonnays on the list that seem comfortable with Pei's  cuisine.  </P> <P> PEI'S OF LA JOLLA  </P> <P> 7660 Fay Ave., La Jolla  </P> <P> 456-6666  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, with one glass of wine each, tax and tip, $30 to $60.  </P></p>

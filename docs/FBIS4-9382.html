			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- NATO, issuing the  latest ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, has openly taken the side  of the Moslems, says Aleksa Buha, Bosnian Serb republic (S.R.)  foreign minister.    In an interview published by the Belgrade daily POLITIKA  EKSPRES on Monday, Buha described NATO ultimatums as "a two-way  support which not only protects the Moslems from the Serb  defence, but enables them to fire unobstructed at the Serb army  and civilians." The NATO Council has threatened to launch air  strikes against Bosnian Serbs unless they withdraw their heavy  weapons to 20 km from the Moslem enclaves, U.N.-declared "safe  areas" of Gorazde, Zepa, Tuzla, Bihac and Srebrenica.    Buha said that talks on Friday and Saturday between S.R.  President Radovan Karadzic and U.N. chief for the former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, with the mediation of Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic, had implied a promising course in  resolving the "most difficult crisis in months."    Buha added: "We were well on the way to iron out the  disputes  with the U.N. Protection Force and furthermore, to reach an  accord on Gorazde. But just as we have sighed with relief, a  NATO ultimatum letter arrived and somewhat discredited the  accord."    He said that NATO's unsynchronized involvement with  additional ultimatums had created further confusion and  primarily imposed a dilemma on who among a multitude of  international organizations had the final say -- the United  Nations, NATO or "a big power which has made both organizations  its instruments."    Akashi and Karadzic, with Milosevic's mediation, have agreed  on an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde.</p>

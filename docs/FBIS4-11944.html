			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analyses" by Ranjit Kumar] </F>   [Text] The supply of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan will  bring about a qualitative change in the strength of the Pakistan  Air Force. The Pakistan Air Force presently has 37 F-16's and  it is said that a similar number of additional F-16's will be  supplied to Pakistan. Pakistan is demanding 71 such aircraft  for which it has paid $660 million in advance; it is highly  possible that the United States will fulfill this demand by  first supplying 38 F-16's and then another batch of 31 at a  later stage.    This decision by the United States will provide a great  setback to its nuclear nonproliferation targets. India could  decide to massively deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles in response  to the new consignment of F-16's to Pakistan. India only has  started deploying Prithvi surface-to-surface missiles with a  range of 250 km and out of respect for international concerns,  no decision has been made about the deployment of Agni  surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 2,500 km. The plan  was to test three types of Agni missile and only a political  decision regarding their deployment needs to be made after  successful tests. Now that Pakistan is acquiring F-16's, which  are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, India will be forced to  give up its hesitations regarding the deployment of long-range  missiles. In response, Pakistan too will deploy M-11 missiles  in much greater number with the help of China. A single step by  the United States will start an unprecedented arms race in South  Asia, which it will not be able to stop. In the end, this arms  race could prove fatal for the United States' own interests.    The statements issued recently by various level officials of  the U.S. Administration's Departments of State and Defense make  it clear that the United States is prepared to supply F-16's to  Pakistan. Robin Raphel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for  South Asia, during her current Indian visit is full of flattery  while talking about relations with India, but she has not given  any assurance on retracting the U.S. step of supplying F-16's to  Pakistan which has adversely affected the Indian security  environment. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's  comments to the U.S. Senate on 24 March makes it clear that the  United States wants to give F-16's to Pakistan. Talbott, when  he visits India on 6 April, will add insult to injury by asking  India to cap its nuclear program because he is seeking a similar  assurance from Pakistan.    The logic for giving F-16's to Pakistan at this time is that  the United States will ask Pakistan to accept conditions in  return for the F-16's. These conditions will lead to a freeze  of its nuclear program at the present level, or in the American  terminology, to cap its nuclear program. The capping of  Pakistan's nuclear program will mean that it can maintain its  current nuclear capability, but it cannot further enhance it.    At the beginning of the last decade the United States gave  F-16's to Pakistan on the pretext of saving it from Soviet  attacks from Afghanistan. Following India's protests, the  United States argued that Pakistan is being supplied such  conventional arms to make it feel secure and it then refrains  from making nuclear weapons. It is interesting that Pakistan  then not only acquired F-16's but continued its nuclear program  as well. What guarantee is there now that Pakistan will cap its  nuclear program forever in accordance with the pledge that it  will make to the United States?</p>

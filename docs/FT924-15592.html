			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Collecting: Traditional dealers on top - Nicholas Powell tests the water for Paris' contemporary art fair this month WHILE the art world prepares for the huge Paris contemporary art fair FIAC this month reports are going round New York that no fewer than 100 Parisian galleries have been forced to close by the recession. The figure is inflated, but it is true that an unprecedented purge is on after years of careless prosperity. Galleries in France doubled in the 1980's from just over 500 to more than a 1,000, while sales of modern and contemporary paintings at auction tripled between 1985-1990. Galleries working not directly with artists but specialising in quick resales sprang up not only around the trendy east end Bastille area but also on the Right Bank. This year the effects of the 1990 contemporary art market crash which started in New York began swathing through Paris. Prices for paintings have dropped by a rough average of 50 per cent and turnover has fallen proportionately. Not only speculative dealers but quality dealers have been hit. Isy Brachot, who also has a gallery in Bruxelles, closed his Left Bank Paris headquarters this year. Baudoin Lebon, a specialist in leading French artist Jean Dubuffet, had to file a petition in bankruptcy. Galerie Daniel Lelong, which represents stars such as Francis Bacon and Spanish artist Antoni Tapies, has been forced to shed half its staff and close one of its two Paris premises. Antoine Candau, one of the first dealers championing young contemporary artists to set up in the Bastille area, has gone out of business. Most well established galleries with good stocks and good stables of artists, however, are weathering the crisis. Brand new galleries with low overheads representing up and coming, low priced artists are even beginning to open in the streets around the Bastille. The real test of the health of Paris's and Europe's contemporary art market comes when the week long Paris FIAC (Foire Internationale de l'Art Contemporain), one of the world's top fairs, opens in the Grand Palais on October 24. Some 100,000 people are expected to visit 161 galleries, 87 of them from abroad, representing works by some 700 artists. Some 400 more dealers applied to take part and were refused. Last year economic gloom frightened a lot of people at the FIAC into showing very staid, classical material. This year looks like being livelier now that the gloom has become chronic. A large number of stands are staging particularly fine one man shows. Paris dealer Marwan Hoss is showing 20 recent large format works by reclusive Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, his first Paris exhibition in 10 years. Jacqueline Moussion is showing the work of the French based Haiti born artist Herve Telemaque and the Korean Moon-Seup Shim. The works by the former are stark combinations of minimalist sculpture and videos evoking Haiti and its ills. Those by Shim form an altogether more tranquil collection of sculptures in iron. Jacqueline Moussion thinks it quite normal that some Paris galleries should have disappeared while others, like hers, ride out the recession. 'Most of those who have gone to the wall were merely commercial and didn't know what art is. The best dealers always refused to supply their artists' works to the galleries and auction houses out for short term profits. Dealers who work with a stable of artists, foreign galleries, museum curators and collectors will survive.' MEANWHILE, the presence of the world's biggest spender, the Sultan of Brunei, was reported stalking the jewellery section of the Biennale des Antiquaires which was greeted with understandable joy. For this year the 120 participants at the world's grandest antiques and fine art show spent as never before - FFr 50m all in all - to make the event as spectacular an attraction as possible. It has been a huge success. Only a few days after the opening of Biennale, which ends tomorrow, big sales were being reported. Paris dealer Yves Mikaeloff's stand was soon deprived of its star exhibit, a massive, FFr 12m, mahogany and gilded bronze commode made in 1770 by French cabinet-makers Severin and Foullet - the client insisted on taking it with him. Mikaeloff also sold two paintings, five drawings and a William Morris carpet while his neighbours, tapestry specialists Galerie Chevalier, parted with eight pieces ranging from FFr 80,000 - FFr 2m, all to new clients, on the first day. The overall quality of the art has never been so high. Thanks to 18th century French specialists such as the Antiquaires a Paris group, the quality of furniture is top notch. Jean Lupu boasts a very rare Riesener table of 1780 from the Roseberry collection and a rosewood and porcelain plaque desk made by Martin Carlin for the marriage of the Comte d'Artois, brother of Louis XVI. Carlton Hobbs from London, a newcomer, is showing extremely fine 18th-19th century Russian and English furniture. The standard of Old Master paintings is better than ever with specialists such as Agnew's and Richard Green from London and Haboldt and Tassel from Paris joined this year for the first time by Colnaghi, who set up a gallery in Paris earlier in the year. A major attraction on the Colnaghi stand and perfect for the French market was La Baigneuse, a masterpiece by 18th century aritst Francois Le Moyne which recently surfaced in Brazil. Newhouse Galleries of New York, teamed up with Verner Amell of London, are showing an historical and exceedingly fine imaginary landscape by three leading Italian artists of the day - Canaletto, Pittoni and Cimaroli, commissioned in 1722 by the Irish actor and playwright Owen McSwiny on behalf of Lord March. It was on offer for Pounds 950,000. Nearby, hangs one of the very last paintings by Chardin we will ever see on the market - an exquisite still life of peaches, pears and a beaker of wine of 1760. Dealers in highly specialised fields had clearly made an effort to display exceptional stock. Sarti of London had a Virgin by 15th century Florentin painter Gherardo Starnina and a late 16th century Italian marble marquetry table top which both deserve to go straight to a museum. Brussels based Chinese art specialist Gisele Croes, one of several oriental art specialists present, attracted a lot of attention from museum curators with an exhibition of Han and Tang period earthenware figures, Shang period bronzes in perfect condition and nine exceedingly rare sculpted bronze plates from the Dian kingdom, representing hunting scenes and with price tags of between Dollars 80-100,000. Decoration on the grandest of scales is catered for, too with several furniture dealers chosing to wall their stands with antique wood panelling. Achkar Charriere boasts painted panels with inset canvases by late 18th century painter Fassin from Liege. Gismondi of Paris has late 18th Century, light blue and green panels complete with a bas relief panel by sculptor Clodion. Axel Vervoordt from Antwerp offered one room of 18th century French white colonnaded bookcase panelling and a complete Louis XIV room stripped to its original light green paint in order to set off, he said, his antique Chinese bronzes.</p>

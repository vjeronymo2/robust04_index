			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Pension funds 'too exposed to shares' COMPANY pension funds are overcommitted to equities and face 'real and imminent' risks from the recession, according to a leading actuary and consultant. Mr Tim Gardener of Mercer Fraser, one of the UK's top three firms of pension consultants, told a meeting of 150 senior investment managers last night: 'It is possible that the next big pension scandal will not be caused by fraud but may instead be caused by the combined effect of optimistic actuarial assumptions and an inappropriate asset strategy. 'The problems and dangers are now so acute that it is time for us to advise our clients actively.' If those views are accepted by pension funds, the equity market may suffer badly. On the other hand, there may be positive implications for the government, which will need to sell vast quantities of gilt-edged securities over the next few years. Mr Gardener said that traditional balanced management - investment in a variety of assets such as equities, bonds and property at the managers' discretion - was out of date. The average fund now has more than 85 per cent of its assets in equities, failing to provide adequate diversification. Pension funds, Mr Gardener said, were providing protection against long-term inflation, but the real risk in the short term was the recession. That affected the increasing number of mature schemes - those paying out large amounts of current pensions. Mr Gardener warned: Pension fund surpluses were beginning to run out after two years of low dividend growth. Much of the surplus remaining is caused by actuaries writing up assets above market value because of expectations of dividend growth. Dividend growth has fallen below the commonly assumed 4 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent a year and there could be 'nasty surprises' as companies are forced to raise their pension contributions. As head of the asset planning services division of Mercer Fraser, Mr Gardener suggested to investment managers that mature schemes should move towards a better balance, with a higher proportion of bonds. Only immature schemes with few early pension liabilities could safely follow a higher-equity strategy, and in fact an all-equity benchmark might be appropriate for them. Mr Gardener concluded: 'Traditional balanced fund management is no longer relevant. It is no longer balanced, it protects against the wrong risks, and unless the UK and the rest of the world make a sharp recovery from recession the risks are real and imminent.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, the International Cooperation Fund Belarus  [ICFB] held a meeting devoted to the conversion of former  military towns. In Belarus, there are 16 such settlements that  are to be handed over to various religious groups and the ICFB  according to a government resolution. These organizations, with  the help of investors and other sides that are involved in this  process, should convert them into convalescent spas for people  who suffered from the Chernobyl disaster, nursing homes, hotels,  and other facilities. [Begin recording]    Unidentified Reporter: Nikolay  Nikolayevich, how will the ICFB carry out the conversion of  military towns?    Unidentified ICFB official: At a recently held  ICFB conference, which was attended by all leading religious  groups and officials of the nine ministries that support our  work, a decision was adopted on the ICFB's participation in the  conversion of military towns. A meeting with representatives of  the Chernobyl Union -- which has already taken over some  military towns -- showed that the Chernobyl Union supports this  idea. A meeting between Ivan [name indistinct] and  representatives of leading religious groups confirmed that the  government agrees to hand over military towns to the ICFB and  Belarus' leading religious groups. [end recording]    To begin with, officials of the involved organizations will  visit those facilities to inspect the buildings. Later,  reconstruction and modernization of those facilities will begin,  to ensure that military towns serve the people well. The idea  is good, if only there are enough resources to implement it.</p>

Commenting on the Indian  foreign secretary's interview with Zee TV, the Foreign Office  spokesman said in Islamabad today that India has kept the  Kashmiris under bondage. Pakistan is asking India to free the  Kashmiris, enabling them to decide about their fate, the  spokesman said. The Indian foreign secretary, in his interview,  had said India could never think of handing over Kashmir to  Pakistan for the sake of peace. The Foreign Office spokesman  said India was the first to take the Kashmir issue to the United  Nations and had made an unequivocal commitment before the world  body to hold fair and free plebiscite in occupied Kashmir in  order to ascertain the will of the people, but, the spokesman  added, India is now finding excuses to wriggle out of its clear  pledges in the shape of UN resolutions.</p>

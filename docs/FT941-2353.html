			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Housebuilders voice concern at sharp rise in land prices Land prices have risen exceptionally quickly over the past 12 months, stoking inflationary pressures in the housing market and the general economy, housebuilders warned yesterday. Prices for quality sites have risen by an average of 20 per cent nationally during the past 12 months and by up to 50 per cent in south-east England, according to Mr David Wilson, chairman of Wilson Bowden, one of Britain's most profitable housebuilders. He blamed restrictive planning policies by local and central government for creating a shortage of good sites and forcing up the price of land as the housing market started to recover. Mr Roger Humber, director general of the Housebuilders Federation, said the government's determination to display its green credentials meant there was a serious shortage of sites in areas where people wanted to live. He said that might rebound on the economy as higher land prices started to feed through to higher house prices. The government's only weapon to restrict house price inflation would be to increase interest rates - harming other parts of the economy. 'We could have a rerun of the late 1980s if house prices start to chase up land costs,' Mr Humber said. Builders may face serious difficulties, however, if house prices initially rise more slowly than land costs. According to Halifax Building Society, house prices rose 1.2 per cent in 1993, and are forecast to rise a further 5 per cent this year. Pressure on land prices is likely to increase further, with many builders, including Wilson Bowden, announcing share issues to finance land purchases. Most plan to increase their output substantially over the next few years. Sales by Wilson Bowden increased by about a tenth during the first 11 weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period in 1993, according to Mr Wilson, who says the recovery is still patchy. That has not prevented a big rise in land prices. According to Countryside Properties, which builds mainly in Essex, Kent, Hertfordshire and London, land prices in the past 12 months have risen from Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000 an acre to Pounds 450,000-Pounds 500,000 an acre.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeremie city hall employees have been on strike for  several weeks to demand overdue salaries. It is impossible to  communicate by phone with Jeremie. Our regional correspondent  came to Port-au-Prince, having noticed a slight improvement in  maritime transport. Jean-Obed Maturin has a report:    [Begin Maturin recording, in Creole] The city hall employees  continue to demand 10 months of overdue salaries. The employees  have asked the minister of the interior to act on their behalf  because they can wait no longer. The city hall employees in  Jeremie stopped working several months ago.    The population in Jeremie is again begging the telephone  company's managers to do something about the telephone lines in  Jeremie, which have been out of service for five months. The  telephone line failure completely isolates Jeremie from the  other departments and from foreign countries. The company's  employees spend their days without working. Many of the  population hope that the company's managers in Port-au-Prince  will take the case of Jeremie into consideration and not dismiss  their complaints.    Maritime transport resumed two weeks ago, with the ship  FRETA  and a few others bringing a little life to Jeremie, which was  almost dead. However, even though these activities have resumed,  the cost of living has increased in Jeremie. [end recording]</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Long-distance pacesetters - Performance / Last year was gloomy, but the horizon offers encouragement - Investment trusts THE PERFORMANCE of investment trusts in 1990 offers a salutary lesson to investors: that the search for short-term profit may end with fool's gold. Average net asset values in the sector fell 25 per cent over the year - underperforming the FT-A All-Share index by 11 per cent. Of 206 trusts tracked by brokers County NatWest Woodmac, only 39 managed to beat the All-Share. And only one trust in this sample, F and C Enterprise, was able to maintain its share price over the 12-month period. Explanations for this dismal showing are easy enough to find. The strength of the pound, which gained significantly against most major currencies like the dollar, the yen and the Deutsche Mark, hit the value of trusts' overseas assets on translation into sterling. The relatively poor performance of overseas indices, meanwhile (notably those of Japan and other Pacific Basin countries), inevitably prejudiced the returns of investment vehicles which had 50 per cent of their assets overseas at the start of last year. Looking at performance over a longer time-frame restores the morale of fund managers, and provides the main justification for investment in investment trusts. Figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) indicate that the sector as a whole has shown banks and building societies a clean pair of heels, looked its unit-trust rivals squarely in the eye, and generally kept pace with the UK stock market as measured by the All-Share index. On average, for example, a Pounds 100 investment in a UK general investment trust grew to Pounds 175 in the five years to last December, or almost Pounds 475 over the 10-year period to end-1990. Leaving the money in a building society over these periods would have left the investor with just Pounds 155 and Pounds 239 respectively, while he would have been even worse off in a bank deposit account. The AITC monthly figures (available from financial advisers, stockbrokers, or direct from the Association) are the best source of comparative performance statistics. Two main yardsticks are used - share-price total return, and net-asset-value total return, which in each case is a measure of the combined performance of the capital growth and income. The share price is what investors pay for their shares in the market. The NAV is the current value of the assets backing each ordinary share issued by an investment trust: it comes after deduction of all the liabilities due to creditors, and all capital with a claim to repayment ahead of ordinary shareholders. Movements in net asset values are useful, because they arguably show more accurately than share prices the skill, or otherwise, of the investment manager. Share prices, on the other hand, represent the actual value of an investment to the shareholder in the market, and may therefore be deemed a more appropriate guide. The difference between the share price and net asset value is known as either the discount or the premium. At their simplest, these are a reflection of the imbalance between supply and demand for investment-trust shares, and can have a major impact on performance. Last year, for example, a 4 per cent premium for trusts investing in the emerging markets of Asia had turned into a 17 per cent discount at the end of last year as investor enthusiasm waned. This year, by contrast, has seen a revival of interest in small companies, and investment trusts have been identified as a means of buying exposure to the sector. Trusts like TR Smaller Companies have seen their discount narrow, while Kleinwort Smaller Companies and Aberforth Trust shares have both been on a premium in recent weeks. It cannot be said often enough that past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future. One-year figures, although keenly watched by investment managers themselves and publicised in the press, are less reliable than five- and 10-year statistics when it comes to gauging a trust's consistency. Certainly, trusts with general investment objectives can be usefully judged in this way, though the potential for takeover or re-rating in a high discount should not be overlooked when it comes to making a choice. Apart from looking at performance in isolation, it is as well to put trust records into perspective. The normal yardstick is the FT-A All-Share index, which reflects how the UK stock market as a whole has behaved. The advantage of this is that it is well understood by the majority of investors. The drawback is that, with many trusts largely or even wholly invested outside the UK, it is not a particularly fair or meaningful comparison.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          THE TOP 20 PERFORMERS: END FEBRUARY 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (total return on Pounds 100, income reinvested) Five years                            Ten years Candover                 471.5        Capital Gearing          1,519.3 Capital Gearing          404.7        Lowland                  1,177.5 GT Japan                 291.0        TR City of London          829.6 Martin Currie Pacific    268.4        F&amp;C Eurotrust              793.9 New Throgmorton (1983) - inc             264.2        English National  - def    787.7 Pacific Assets           263.4        Securities Trust of                                       Scotland                   785.0 Drayton Far Eastern      261.4        Fleming Japanese           770.9 Rights &amp; Issues - inc    257.4        GT Japan                   762.6 TR City of London        244.7        Law Debenture Corp         746.2 English National  - def  243.3        Murray Income              745.7 English National - pfd   232.0        English National - pfd     735.6 Rights &amp; Issues  - cap   228.1        Bankers                    732.2 Fleming Claverhouse      226.2        Fleming Enterprise         716.0 Govett Oriental          225.5        Fleming Claverhouse        703.0 City &amp; Commercial - inc  224.7        Second Alliance            690.3 Securities Trust of Scotland                 224.0        Murray Smaller Markets     683.9 Law Debenture Corp       223.3        Dunedin Income Growth      670.4 Merchants                223.2        Alliance                   658.7 Foreign &amp; Colonial       217.6        Fleming Far Eastern        642.3 Fleming Enterprise       216.6        Merchants                  625.5 Average                  182.2        Average                    549.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of Investment Trust Companies/County NatWest WoodMac  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

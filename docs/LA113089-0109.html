			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LAST-MINUTE GOAL LIFTS JETS OVER RANGERS  </P> <P> Brent Ashton's goal with 11 seconds remaining in regulation Wednesday night  gave the Winnipeg Jets a 5-4 victory over the New York Rangers at Winnipeg,  Canada.  </P> <P> Ashton took a pass from Dale Hawerchuk, swung around defenseman James Patrick  and beat goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck through the pads with a backhander to  knock the Jets back to .500.  </P> <P> "We're a skating team and we talked about that between the second and third  (periods). We came out skating and that's the way we play our best hockey,"  Ashton said.  </P> <P> The Rangers, 3-6-1 in their last 10 games, overcame a three-goal first-period  deficit and went ahead at 10:32 of the second period when Tomas Sandstrom  scored his second goal of the game and 14th of the season.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, Quebec 2 -- Bobby Smith scored two first-period power play goals  and added an assist as the Canadiens beat the Nordiques at Montreal.  </P> <P> Besides Smith, Stephan Lebeau, Mats Naslund and Stephane Richer scored for the  Canadiens, who had a 4-0 lead before the Nordiques scored in the third period.  </P> <P> Washington 5, Detroit 3 -- Calle Johansson's goal with 2:53 left in regulation  spoiled a Red Wing comeback bid at Detroit.  </P> <P> Johansson beat Detroit goaltender Sam St. Laurent with a wrist shot from the  slot for the game-winner after Detroit scored three goals in a 3:23 span midway  through the period to tie the score.  </P> <P> Shawn Burr scored the first two goals for the Red Wings.  </P> <P> Toronto 3, Vancouver 2 -- Vincent Damphousse scored at 3:48 of overtime to  complete a Toronto comeback before 13,434, smallest crowd of the season at the  Pacific Coliseum.  </P></p>

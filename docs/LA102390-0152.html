Kendrick said Monday.  </P> <P> The eight-performance run of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The  Pirates of Penzance" grossed $432,945, or 63.8 % of the potential gross,  Kendrick said.  </P> <P> Kendrick had told The Times earlier that paid attendance would have to exceed  65% for the Center to break even. The engagement "will require subsidy,"  Kendrick said Monday.  </P> <P> Prego Ristorante of Irvine raised about $1,500 for the Irvine Barclay Theatre  at the restaurant's fifth annual grape harvest celebration, "Festa della  Vendemmia," according to Prego manager Louie Salcito.

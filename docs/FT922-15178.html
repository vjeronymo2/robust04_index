			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: No slackening, orders confident Kinnock MR NEIL Kinnock last night launched the final phase of his general election campaign with a confident prediction of victory at the largest political rally in Britain since the second world war. At a Pounds 150,000 Labour extravaganza in Sheffield, Mr Kinnock told 10,000 supporters: 'In nine days' time Britain is going to have a Labour government.' The party would win because 'people know we will govern as we have campaigned - strongly, positively, looking to the future.' By contrast, the Conservative government was portrayed as a spent force: 'They have no vitality and they are rapidly losing the remnants of their integrity.' Senior party figures echoed his confidence that the Conservatives would be defeated on April 9. Despite last night's opinion polls, strategists said there was overwhelming evidence that Labour support had been firmly established above 40 per cent. That would be enough to deprive Mr John Major of his majority. But Mr Kinnock has warned colleagues that the last 48 hours of the campaign will be crucial in determining whether Labour secures an overall majority. He has ordered that there should be no slackening in the disciplined campaigning which has given his party the lead. Last night's rally was designed to reinforce the party's confident image and lift the morale of its supporters as it enters the final days of campaigning. Framed by giant video screens, Mr Kinnock sought to reinforce his image as prime minister-in-waiting with a dismissive attack on the Conservatives' 'negative' campaigning. While Mr John Major traded in 'sour insults', Labour would 'carry on fighting for the British people.' Setting Labour's task as healing the divisions wrought by 13 years of Conservative government, Mr Kinnock signalled that education, health, housing and social welfare would be at the centre of his campaign until polling day. He accused the Conservatives of seeking the end of 'free schooling' and the privatisation of the National Health Service. In a scathing reference to Mr Major's 'soapbox' campaigning he said: 'What's at issue in this election is not the soapboxes that people stand on. It's the cardboard boxes that people live in.' Mr Kinnock said Labour's alternative prospectus for the economy and social provision would be based on the experience of successful competitor countries. That meant support for investment and innovation and an understanding that it was essential for a modern government 'to support research, to improve the transport system, to foster long-term industrial development, and to make a continual commitment to raising standards of skill.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 07, BNS -- Latvia will abstain from  making an official application for the NATO membership until  Aug. 31, the prospective deadline of the Russian troops'  withdrawal, said Alexander Kirsteins, the head of the Saeima  (parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee.    Latvia will, however, seek possibilities to sign bilateral  military cooperation pacts with the alliance's member states,  like the Jan. 3 accord with Denmark, Kirsteins said.    Kirsteins described as absurd a country's request for  acceptance to the NATO while it is still occupied by a foreign  army.    The Latvian government received an official invitation to  join the NATO summit in Brussels next week, which is scheduled  to consider the participation of the East European states to the  Partnership for Peace program.    The Latvian army could act in the NATO framework regardless  of its newness and poor ammunition, noted Kirsteins.    Latvia would have the chance right after the projected  Baltic  Peacekeeping Battalion receives budget funding, and Latvia and  Russia reach a final accord on troops' withdrawal, said  Kirsteins.    The Latvian army cannot expect the NATO to extend funds for  the purchase of weapons unless the foreign troops are pulled out  from its territory.    Kirsteins staunchly rejected any possibilities for Latvia to  cooperate with Russia in the military sphere because Russia was  presently "the sole military force threatening to the Latvian  security."    As reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry made a statement  Jan. 5 urging the NATO to grant security guarantees to countries  that expressed a wish to integrate into the organization.    Latvia puts a foreign political priority on political and  military cooperation with the NATO and its separate member  states to get accepted to the alliance in the future, the  ministry said.    As reported, Lithuania officially asked for the NATO  membership Jan. 4.</p>

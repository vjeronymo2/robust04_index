			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Bundesbank hails German pay deal THE Bundesbank yesterday welcomed the 3 per cent public sector pay deal between the government and unions as a step in the right direction. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice president, said many Germans still had to adjust to the changed economic situation since German unification. 'It is indisputable that our country is now living beyond its means,' he said. The deal was struck hours after the Bundesbank announced a surprise cut in interest rates in an attempt to ease pressures on the economy and tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism. 'It is even better news for the economy than the Bundesbank decision,' said Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman. But further evidence of the depth of the recession came with a sharp rise in unemployment in both east and west. Joblessness rose by 10 per cent across the country, up 232,200 in the west to 2.258m, and up 93,600 in the east to 1.194m - or almost 3.5m unemployed in the united economy. The unemployment rate now stands at 7.4 per cent in the west, from 6.1 per cent a year ago, and 14.7 per cent in the east - without including about 1.8m more workers in the east on job creation and retraining programmes. The pay deal, struck late on Thursday night between the major public sector unions and the government, will affect 2.3m workers. It will be backdated to January 1 and is in line with the more optimistic expectations of economic observers. It could save a further DM3.7bn (Pounds 1.5bn) from public spending at all levels in 1993, according to the Finance Ministry. In a television interview last night, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he expected the next pay negotiations for 1.85m white-collar civil servants to be settled at 'well under 3 per cent'. At the cabinet meeting, summoned to consider the gloomy annual economic report, which forecasts a decline in gross domestic product of up to 1 per cent, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned against excessive pessimism. He said the economy was facing a 'cyclical downturn after 10 years of steady growth'. As for the public sector pay deal, he said it was the 'beginning of a change for the better' in pay policy. In a separate speech, Mr Tietmeyer dismissed criticism that the Bundesbank move was either too premature - coming before any agreement in the government's promised solidarity pact - or too little, too late. Stressing the bank's moves not simply to cut its discount rate by 0.25 percentage points, and the Lombard rate by 0.5 points, but also to relax its minimum reserve requirements, he said the decisions were a reaction to 'the changed internal and world-wide economic conditions, without endangering our stabilisation course. . . This was a necessary decision which neither changes nor endangers the fundamental policy of (monetary) stability.' Mr Tietmeyer gave firm support to the government's proposed savings package, while stressing that changes could be made, if they did not reduce the total volume of savings in the programme. It is intended to reduce public-sector spending by some DM20bn a year by 1995. 'Monetary policy cannot indefinitely compensate for the necessary adjustment in the public sector, without causing great damage both to our economy and to our partners in the European Monetary System,' he warned.</p>

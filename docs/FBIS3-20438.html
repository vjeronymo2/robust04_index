The hog production  and sales situation this winter and next spring will not  experience very great fluctuations.    According to information supplied by the Ministry of  Agriculture, at the end of the third quarter of this year, hog  volume reached 388 million head, the number of hogs removed from  the inventory was 244 million head, and total pork output  reached 24.2 million tons, an increase of 8.6 percent, 6.5  percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Included, the 8.2 percent  growth rate of pork and the hog production situation can be  considered hopeful.    Along with the growth in hog production, in recent months,  pork prices also have generally risen nationally. According to  State Statistics Bureau statistics of pork prices in 35 large  and medium-sized cities in September of this year, pork prices  on average increased by 17.8 percent over the same period last  year. Within that, Beijing's 64.4 percent rise, Tianjin's 20.8  percent rise, Chongqing's 34.2 percent rise, and Guiyang's 47.2  percent rise were rather pronounced.    The relevant department of the Ministry of Agriculture  analyzed this and they believe that brisk consumer demand is an  important factor leading to the simultaneous rise in pork  production and prices. From January through September, urban and  rural resident cost of living expenses increased by 29 percent  and 17 percent, respectively. If the price factor is deducted,  they are 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively. This cannot be  separated from this year's rather rapid growth of state fixed  asset investment. Experts in the field estimate that  approximately 40 percent of fixed asset investment funds are  converted to cost of living funds. So, despite the rise in pork  prices, with the exception of epidemic areas, the hog and pork  markets have not experienced a "difficulty in selling hogs," and  buying and selling have remained brisk.    As a result of the spread of hoof and mouth disease, hogs  cannot be transferred out of some infected production areas and  sales regions must concentrate on transferring meat from those  production areas unaffected by the epidemic, such as Sichuan,  causing meat prices in these regions to rise further. The state  commerce system purchases, sales, and reserves have decreased,  and market adjustment capabilities have been reduced, also  creating a rise in meat prices. As of the end of September,  state commerce system hog purchases were down by 34.3 percent  and reserves were down by 44.1 percent.    Feed prices rose and the cost of raising hogs increased,  another important factor leading to the rise in pork prices.  According to Ministry of Agriculture statistics on the cost of  raising hogs from 160 points on the information network, in  addition to the rather large rise in such feed production costs  as water fees, electrical fees, and oil fees, the rural market  price of corn rose from 0.64 yuan per kilogram in January of  this year to 0.74 yuan per kilogram in September and hog feed  prices reached as high as 1.29 yuan per kilogram. Some rather  highly intensified hog producing units were rather sensitive to  this. Because large-scale pig farms and specialized hog raising  households near urban areas were rather greatly affected by the  rise in feed prices, pork supplies around large cities  correspondingly decreased, directly pulling up urban pork  prices. The good consumption of high-quality, high-priced fresh  meat and lean meat and meat products by residents of large and  medium-sized cities also to a certain extent strengthened the  rising trend in pork prices.    Despite this, relevant personnel at the Ministry of  Agriculture still are rather optimistic about hog production and  sales this winter and next spring. They believe that the  response from various regions and the level and development of  current prices indicate that this year's national hog production  growth is settled and current pork supplies are not at all  considered too high and hog production and sales this winter and  next spring will not experience great fluctuations.    According to their analysis, compared to the rate of  increase  in production costs, pork prices still should not be considered  too high. According to the composite indicator of comparative  hog and grain prices, current hog and grain comparative prices  still have not reached the levels from the beginning of the year  and are still in the rebounding stage. September comparative hog  and grain prices were 1:5.87; May's were 1:5.4; and at the  beginning of the year, they were 1:6.23. Hog raising profits are  not great. Precisely because of the rise in pork prices in the  last half of the year, the rare situation of a decline in the  price of sows and piglets in May and June has been turned around  and hog production is tending to stabilize.    In addition, in the general background of widespread price  increases, current pork prices also are not considered high.  According to data provided by the State Statistics Bureau,  compared to the same period last year, from January through  September cost of living prices of residents of 35 large and  medium-sized cities throughout the nation rose 18.9 percent.  Within this, non-staple food prices rose by 18.0 percent and  among non-staple foods, the prices of aquatic products rose by  29.6 percent; meat, fowl, and egg prices rose by 15.8 percent;  and pork prices rose by 14.8 percent.    But Ministry of Agriculture officials also point out that if  feed prices continue to rise too rapidly or meat prices continue  to rise to the point that they restrain the rate of consumption,  it could affect hog production in the second half of next year.</p>

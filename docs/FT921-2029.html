			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Commission censures Brierley bid vehicle ROSSINGTON Investments, the vehicle for a bid for Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) by two companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, was reprimanded yesterday for an apparent breach of corporate regulations. Rossington, which is jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG, Sir Ron's UK company, announced on Wednesday that it had reduced its ADollars 127m (USDollars 95.4m) bid for ACIL from 23 cents a share to 21.5 cents. The reduction reflected Rossington's revised valuation of ACIL following the group's agreement to make a ADollars 14m out-of-court settlement to the liquidator of Spedley Securities, with which ACIL has been engaged in a legal battle. Sir Ron accused ACIL of 'gratuitous capitulation' which was 'so inexplicable that, in the absence of a credible explanation, it will be necessary to pursue the issue of directors' liabilities for breach of duties and responsibilities to shareholders'. However, Mr Michael Braham, the New South Wales regional commission of the Australian Securities Commission, the corporate regulator, said Rossington's announcement of its lower bid 'may have caused the market to be misinformed'. Mr Braham said the ASC refused Rossington's application to reduce the bid price on Tuesday and informed the company of its decision on the same day. The ASC said it would decide next week whether to take any action against Rossington. ACIL has rejected Rossington's bid, which the directors said was 'highly conditional,' and poor value for shareholders. ACIL shares closed 1 cent lower on the day at 22 cents. Rossington's bid for ACIL is the first joint takeover attempt by the two companies with which Sir Ron is associated since he acquired GPG in 1989. He resigned as Brierley Investments' chairman in 1990 but remains a director. The bid is conditional on the cancellation of ACIL's plan to sell to Lion Nathan of New Zealand its 50 per cent share in National Brewing Holdings, formerly the brewing arm of Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings. ACIL would also be required to cancel a ADollars 220m float of Bass Strait oil royalty holdings planned by Weeks Petroleum. ACIL holds a shareholding of 96 per cent in Weeks, but does not control the board. Lion Nathan says it has 'an absolute and binding contract' for the purchase of National Brewing, which would give it 100 per cent control of the Tooheys, Castlemaine XXXX and Swan brands. ACIL, formerly known as Bell Resources, was once a vehicle for takeover activity by the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, who died last year. It was later part of the Bond group, which crashed last year.</p>

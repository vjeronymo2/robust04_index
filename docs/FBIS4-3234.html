			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- An "electronics town"  will rise in the northeastern part of Beijing, where most of the  city's electronics industries are now located, in five years,  official sources here said today.    The town will aim at upgrading old industries and old  enterprises, the sources said.    In the locality, there are now 17 large and medium-sized  state- owned enterprises, two large joint electronics ventures  and several scientific institutes, employing a total 44,000  people.    A survey of ten major electronics enterprises in the  locality  shows that they lost 313,000 yuan in 1992, while in 1988 they  made profits totalling 29.84 million yuan.    According to a plan approved in March this year, enterprises  in the locality will be transformed into joint ventures,  shareholding companies and conglomerates, to help improve their  management and market performance.    Besides electronics development and manufacture, the town  will also house trading, banking, real estate, information and  other industries.    According to the sources, the city government will extend  special policies to support the new town. For example, the part  of taxes from enterprises within the town that goes to the city  coffers will be refunded to them as encouragement for technical  upgrading.    By the year 2000, the authorities expect, the town will  reach  10 billion yuan in industrial sales and five billion yuan in  trade and services a year.</p>

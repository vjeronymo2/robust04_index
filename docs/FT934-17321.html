			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / NBC makes push into Europe NBC, the US network broad-caster, is making its biggest push into the European market with the purchase of a majority stake in Super Channel, the satellite company available in nearly 60m homes across Europe, mainly through cable networks. NBC was last night believed to be signing a Pounds 40m deal to buy 75 per cent of the channel. The target is controlled by the Marcucci family, which has broadcasting and industrial interests in Italy. The US company is likely to continue the general entertainment thrust of the channel in the immediate future while increasing the amount of business and financial news. Earlier this year CNBC, the NBC cable channel in the US that specialises in business news, said it planned to expand in Europe and eastern Asia. Mrs Marialina Marcucci, the Super Channel managing director, bought the channel in 1988 for Pounds 9 and paid Pounds 2.5m to creditors. The channel, set up in 1987 by a consortium of UK independent television companies plus Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group was at one stage losing Pounds 1.5m a month. The Marcuccis have invested Pounds 25m in building the channel's network across west and eastern Europe. Credit Lyonnais will hold a 25 per cent stake in the channel, although the Marcucci family is likely to retain an interest in that stake and Mrs Marcucci is expected to remain on the Super Channel board. It is believed the Marcucci family decided a leading company such as NBC was needed to take the channel to its next stage of development. Mrs Marcucci intends to set up a television programme production business in London and is already in talks to acquire a medium-sized independent production company specialising in factual programming. Super Channel found it difficult to compete with large broadcasters for recent films and exclusive sporting events but instead developed niche magazine programmes such as Film Europe. It also carries programmes from FT TV, the television programme-making arm of the Financial Times. In countries such as Austria, Switzerland and Holland, executives say, Super Channel has 3 per cent of the television audience.</p>

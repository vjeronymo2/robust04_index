			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The ever-improving  investment environment in this capital of the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region has brought in a steady flow of overseas  investment, according to Nanning Mayor Xie Ruxuan.    Xie said that in the first four months of 1994, Nanning  signed 40 cooperation projects with overseas firms, involving 18  million U.S. dollars in total foreign investment.    In 1993, the city approved the establishment of 242  foreign-funded firms, involving 82.4 million dollars in total  overseas investment, he said.    Nanning currently has 386 foreign-funded businesses in such  areas as transportation, energy, farming, construction, finance,  commerce and real estate, the mayor said.    Of the 386 businesses, 19 involve an investment of at least  10 million dollars each, he added.    Since 1992, Nanning has stepped up infrastructure  construction to pave the way for the influx of overseas  investment, he said.    For example, the capacity of automatic telephone exchanges  in  the city soared to 65,000 lines in 1993 from 15,000 lines in the  previous year.    Xie announced that an investment fair and a commodities fair  will be held in Nanning June 15-18 to seek overseas investment  in urban construction and property development, he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY CHARACTERS DRESSED TO EXPRESS FUN AND FANTASY  </P> <P> As vice president of costuming for Disney's theme parks and resorts, Bob Phelps  helps a lot of people get dressed every morning. Five thousand employees at  Disneyland in California and more than 15,000 employees in Florida's Walt  Disney World wear a complete suit of clothing ("We provide everything but the  underwear") designed, manufactured and regularly laundered by Phelps and his  bicoastal staff.  </P> <P> "Our apparel operation has got to be Disney's best-kept secret," Phelps muses.  "Look at us -- we have an inventory of 3 million wardrobe pieces for  restaurants, hotels, security, retail -- everything you can imagine. And yet,  to the clothing industry, we're virtually unknown."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Completes the Settings  </P> <P> Ironically, the operation's low profile may be the strongest indicator of  Phelps' success. Disneyland costume designer Tom Pierce explains: "Our parks  offer highly themed settings: a turn-of-the- century Main Street, a subtropical  jungle, and so on. The clothing worn by cast members (Disney's vernacular for  its theme-park employees) complements the setting. In fact, if we're doing our  jobs correctly, the costume almost disappears into the scenery."  </P> <P> While visitors to the Disney parks may not always see what employees are  wearing, the themed apparel still contributes to their experience.  </P> <P> "We try to give a bit of theatrical flair to almost everything we create,"  Pierce says. "That way, every contact a visitor has with a cast member has a  built-in element of fun."  </P> <P> Although the costumes may communicate a subtle message to park guests, their  effect on employees is unmistakable. As Phelps explains it: "Take a 19-year-old  guy and put him into our steamboat pilot costume. It's very detailed to the  period and the role: a navy blue vest and jacket, lots of brass buttons, a  visored cap. He can't put it on without also putting on the mantle of authority  and responsibility that go with it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Than Employee'  </P> <P> Phelps and his staff call their product costumes; the word uniforms is not in  their vocabulary. He adds: "We also refer to all public areas of the parks as  'on-stage.' When you go on-stage, you're more than an employee -- you're a  performer."  </P> <P> Before joining Disney, designer Sandra Huber pursued a stage career, creating  costumes for Southern California's top theaters. Although she now may be called  upon to outfit waiters and tour guides, they receive the same design  consideration she once reserved for Broadway stars.  </P> <P> Huber says: "We first ask ourselves, 'What story are we telling in this area of  the park? What are we trying to communicate to our guests?' "  </P> <P> Disney's costumers, feeling that the fabrics commonly used in creating career  apparel offer too limited a design palette, frequently send a staff of buyers  on cross-country searches for just the right colors, patterns and weaves.  </P> <P> "Right now, I'm designing clothing for sales clerks who will work in a shop  themed to Los Angeles in the 1940s," Huber mentions. "The women will wear plain  cotton-print dresses, World War II vintage, nothing very fancy. Believe it or  not, we just couldn't find fabric that looked or felt authentic -- until our  buyers discovered a small firm in the Midwest that markets to rural  communities, where styles change very slowly. Sometimes the simplest designs  require the most effort."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trial Wearings  </P> <P> As soon as a new costume comes off the drawing boards, several prototypes are  assembled and are then wear-tested by the people who will be performing their  jobs in them. The designers receive detailed reports on the garment's fit,  appearance, comfort, possible safety problems, adequacy of pockets and dozens  of other details.  </P> <P> Pam Haynes, who directs the operation of the department, says that a negative  report from the field "can send the costume back to Square 1 -- extensive  redesign. As an in-house supplier, we can't just take the money and run. We  live with our accomplishments -- and our failures -- every day. That's how you  really learn."  </P> <P> A green light from the garments' users does not necessarily mean a costume is  ready for production. First, it will undergo testing at Walt Disney World,  where the hot tropical sun and humidity (and, inevitably, perspiration) create  the ultimate durability test for clothing. While there, the garment is sent  through industrial laundry and dry-cleaning equipment at least 25 times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Durability Test  </P> <P> "Most of the fashion industry requires its clothing to retain its appearance  after five launderings," Haynes explains. "If a garment can keep its looks  after 12, it is considered indestructible. We expect our costumes to look great  after more than 100 cleanings."  </P> <P> A typical day's work for a Disney costumer is anything but typical; the parks  might need a tuxedo for Mickey Mouse . . . or a 15-foot-long spangled cape for  a circus elephant . . . or an eye patch for a robotic pirate. The costumers  have been asked to re-create famous costumes from the past, including Judy  Garland's gingham dress and ruby red slippers from "The Wizard of Oz" and  Bogart's famous trench coat and fedora worn in "Casablanca."  </P> <P> And yet, outside Disney, the designers remain unknown. Phelps comments: "We've  been approached a few times by other corporations who would like to give their  people -- the employees who have contact with the public -- a little bit of the  Disney flair. It always surprises us, because we really don't promote  ourselves."  </P> <P> But Bob Phelps and his staff may not linger in anonymity for too much longer.  One day the world may discover -- in the case of Disney -- clothes really do  make the mouse.  </P></p>

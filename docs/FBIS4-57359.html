			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A special ceremony was held at the Ecuadoran  Foreign Ministry this afternoon between Salvadoran Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria and Ecuadoran Foreign Minister  Diego Paredes Pena. After signing some treaties and agreements,  both foreign ministers met with reporters. Salvadoran Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria was asked the most questions by  journalists. They questioned him about various topics of  national and international interest. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] I have a question  for both foreign ministers. Regarding the situation in Haiti,  would your government support an armed intervention?    [Paredes] We believe in democracy, and we hope Haiti will  soon return to democracy. We believe all necessary steps must  be taken within the framework of respect for the will and  self-determination of peoples for the return of democracy. We  believe the de facto rulers of Haiti and President Jean Bertrand  Aristide are greatly responsible for ensuring the country's  return to a democratic system. We in Ecuador do not believe in  armed intervention. We believe in the free will of the people,  and we hope that the pressures that have been applied will be  enough to make the de facto authorities act sensibly and allow  that country to live in democracy.    [Reporter] The same question for the Salvadoran foreign  minister.    [Salaverria] We are thinking along the same lines. The use  of force is increasingly less necessary. Once we have an  international market that adheres to the GATT, I believe the  pressures that may be applied in the area of trade might be  stronger and more effective than a military force. An embargo  has been tried in Haiti, and it has not yielded results. Other  methods are being tried out to make it work, however. As the  foreign minister said, de facto military rulers have a huge  responsibility to their people and to the international  community. The position they have maintained cannot be kept up  much longer. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

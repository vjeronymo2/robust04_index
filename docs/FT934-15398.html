			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Italian privatisation Italy's privatisation programme has taken two steps forward and one step back. The restructuring plan for Ferruzzi-Montedison emerging in Milan appears to be winning support from lenders. If a speedy settlement can be reached, the privatisation of Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano - both of which have large exposures to the crumbling Ferruzzi empire - might be achieved by the year-end as planned. However, the confusion over the resignation - later withdrawn - of Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, points to deep divisions in government over privatisation. It is hard to believe that the rift arose from a technical argument about the most efficient method of selling state assets. Privatisation by public offer would result in more diffuse ownership than sales dominated by groups of large investors of the type favoured by Mr Savona. Given the close links between Italian industry and state, how the argument is resolved will determine the degree of political influence over privatised companies. A Ferruzzi solution which met the aspirations of international investors and bankers would be encouraging. Some important points of principle appear to have been won. The group's profitable operating subsidiaries will continue servicing bank debt, which will please the foreign banks that did not lend at holding company level. The planned disposal of investments ranging from media to cement looks like a partial victory over family interests. If that signals a commitment to solutions which avoid favouring narrow self-interest, privatisation can only benefit.</p>

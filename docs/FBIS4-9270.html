			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 21 (CTK) -- The Democratic Union  of Slovakia (DEUS) will support small and medium-sized  businesses, strive for the acceleration of privatisation, the  maintenance of microeconomic stability and the speeding up  restructuring in the Slovak economy, Slovak Deputy Premier Roman  Kovac said today.    Speaking to journalists, Kovac said that DEUS was to be  founded on April 23 through a merger of the government parties  Alliance of Democrats (AD) of Milan Knazko and the Alternative  of Political Realism (APR), the leadership of which includes,  besides Kovac himself, Premier Jozef Moravcik.    Referring to DEUS's programme of economic transformation,  Knazko said that certain of its principles were in general more  similar to the Czech variant of transformation than to "what has  been called economic transformation in the past 21 months  (during the previous government of Vladimir Meciar, which fell  in mid-March)". Differences between DEUS's programme and the  Czech one lie in Slovakia's changed situation after it became  independent on January 1, 1993, Knazko added.    Kovac said that DEUS would stress the right of citizens as  the only people who can decide on the country's problems. DEUS  will also strive to secure the economic development in Slovakia,  as well as the development of the educational level. "A state  which does not understand how important the education is, loses  its chance to compete with the advanced world," Kovac said.    Reacting to the description of DEUS as a liberal party to  the  right of the centre, Kovac said that "there exists one  millimetre distance to the right of the centre as well".    On the forthcoming merger of the AD and the APR, Knazko said  that "it is a merger following on from certain political  experiences." He said that the deputies' group of the two  parties was today joined by a new member. However, he declined  to give his name. "He will certainly announce it himself,"  Knazko said.</p>

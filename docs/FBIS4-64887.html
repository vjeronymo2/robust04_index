			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Delcroix Wants To Apply </F> Consumer-Friendly Principle to Army Procurement"]    [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Delcroix wants future Army  procurement to take place according to a Test-Aankoop [Belgian  consumer association] principle, where only the price-quality  ratio is decisive. Delcroix does not support economic  compensations. If such compensations nevertheless continue to  play a role in the future, then their extra cost should not be  pushed onto the Army. The minister made these comments during a  speech in Hasselt on Saturday [7 May].    "Contracts including compensations turn out 10 to 25 percent  more expensive," Delcroix said. Moreover, decisionmaking  procedures which take account of defense issues only are quicker.    The minister is opting for a system of two tenders, with and  without compensations. Compensations should at no time be an  obstacle to decisionmaking within the Army.    The compensations system, which has existed for decades, has  been viewed in an unfavorable light since the Agusta affair. "A  parliamentary committee is investigating the system, but  apparently the MP's have not sorted things out," the minister  said.    "Some committee members appear to be doing a big U-turn.  From the original position that `compensations are synonymous  with corruption' to `compensations must remain possible and an  MP must be able to intervene for his region,'" Delcroix  continued.    The minister said "it was unacceptable that Army contracts  should take place only because an economic benefit was attached  to them." As defense minister, he did not support compensations.  They slow down decisionmaking procedures and defense no longer  has the resources to be an instrument for economic development.    "That is an area for the regions par excellence. If Economic  Affairs or the regions believe their own industry must be  promoted, then it must subsidize the price difference. In  addition, compensations must be oriented toward the future and  not be a short-term emergency measure," the minister said,  adding other demands. Compensations should not end with the  delivery of the last item ordered, should enable high-tech  investments, give access to markets which were otherwise  unreachable and be open to verification.</p>

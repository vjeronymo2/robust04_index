			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Opec divisions over production cuts The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday failed in its first attempt at its Geneva meeting to orchestrate a production cut to bolster weak prices. The ministers will try again today. An Opec official last night said cuts of 4-6 per cent were being considered, with the possibility of according special treatment for three members which had shown restraint in September when Opec last raised its output ceiling, to 24.52m barrels a day. The three are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, some of Opec's largest producers. Delegates later denied there was a specific plan and one indicated that enthusiasm for cuts was mainly confined to smaller producers. Another delegate noted that even a cut of as much as 1m b/d would not be credible if it triggered a new round of quota cheating, Opec's perennial problem. 'A nominal cut of 1m b/d could turn out to be an actual cut of only 600,000 b/d,' he warned. 'A meaningful cut is one that is adhered to.' Earlier, ministers tried to gauge the level of support from sympathetic independent producers for a co-ordinated worldwide cut. They were told that eight countries - Russia, Oman, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Brunei, Malaysia and Colombia - had agreed to make cumulative cuts of 200,000-250,000 b/d.</p>

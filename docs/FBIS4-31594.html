			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of interview with Mirko Galic, director of Croatian </F> Radio-Television, by Boris Komadina; place and date not given:  "Television Is No Cathedral"]    [Text] Mirko Galic's appointment as the new director of HRT  [Croatian Radio-TV], following the initial hesitation, has  evoked many comments, mainly favorable. Mirko Galic is one of  the best-known journalists in Croatia, a former editor of DANAS,  and until recently a correspondent of VECERNJI LIST and VJESNIK.  Thanks to his reputation as a superb professional, many believe  he will contribute to opening up government television and  blunting the attack of numerous European institutions on  Croatian TV [HTV].    [Komadina] When did you first learn that you were being  considered for director of HRT?    [Galic] My name had been "in the pot" for some time, both  for  that and for certain other positions, which neither excited me  nor interested me all that much. I am happiest when I can do my  job as a journalist in peace, at present my job as a  correspondent, unburdened by any kind of intrigues, especially  those involving me and about me that are created by others  without my knowledge. There have been such cases. They had me  moved over to television before it was a serious consideration.  And it became serious in the last two or three months, precisely  since the Washington agreement. That is when the proposal was  made to me, for the first time in Washington as a matter of  fact, that I should help to create the kind of television  Croatia needs. I did not accept at first, you can well imagine,  because I am not sure I can do that, nor to what extent I will  have the proper conditions. I examined myself, but also the  circumstances, before I decided to accept.    [Komadina] To whom did you talk, and what reasons decided  you  in favor of accepting that post?    [Galic] I talked with those people with whom I had to talk  about a decision like that. I did not manage to talk to everyone  I wanted to, because some were away from Zagreb at the time. It  seems to me that we agreed on what was most important for  me--that my job has to do with the programming, not the  technology or the finances of Croatian Television. That is all I  would know about anyway: I have been a journalist for 25 years,  I have gained some experience, I have certain ideas, I still  have some determination and energy. The rest is not up to me.    [Komadina] Is it true, as we have heard, that you talked  twice to President Tudjman, who accepted your condition for  precise delimitation of powers at HRT?    [Galic] There is no secret or mystery about those to whom I  talked. I do not see what the problem is. I did not arrange  conferences with those people after every meeting. With Mr.  Tudjman, those were really working conversations, they were  really frank and open, exclusively about those conditions under  which I would go to work in television. I received the  guarantees I requested; they still need to be elaborated so that  there are no misunderstandings. I have always believed that  preparations are half of the job; that is why I endeavored to  such an extent to have my rights and also my obligations and  responsibilities defined. That part of the agreement is still  not finished. There is time yet, the government has (only)  appointed me, I still have not taken up my duties as director.    [Komadina] From the French perspective, how do you see the  continual and clear accusations of the work of HRTV by European  parliamentarians?    [Galic] Television is what is most visible in any country;  it  is a screen presented to the world. We should be aware that  Croatia will be judged for a long time on the basis of its  television. France can afford a television that ruins the  picture of a democratic country; in one study, it was in only  25th place in the ranking of the freedom of the media (Belgium  is first), and that is because of its television, which is more  under commercial than political pressure. Croatia cannot afford  that, first, because it needs an open and democratic television  in order to develop a democratic culture and the culture of  democratic thinking, and second, because television represents a  part of its European test. The Council of Europe, as the first  step, and the European Parliament, as the second, require a  candidate to guarantee an independent and pluralistic  television. If everything goes well, toward the end of this year  Croatia could cross the first European threshold in Strasbourg.  But when delegations of the Council of Europe come to Zagreb  soon, I can imagine with quite a bit of confidence what they  will ask: How does television express the pluralism of political  life? How does the state exercise its influence on television  (and more broadly on the media)?    [Komadina] As future director of HRT, what is your comment  on  the fact that Croatia is one of the rare countries (if not the  only one) in which legal private television stations do not  exist?    [Galic] I personally am an advocate of private television, I  had taken that position in a study done a year ago, when my  coming to HTV was discussed for the first time. Public  television--I like that name more than the name government  television--is still the backbone of public information; private  television should furnish elements of competition and dynamism.  But the conditions should be clearly defined for them both, so  that we know what standards and quality have to be met, what are  the relations between the domestic and foreign programming, what  are obligations concerning the news, and so on. It has seemed to  me, and it still does, that Croatia ought to have two public  channels, the first more on the serious side and the second more  on the entertainment side, one private national channel and  several regional private television stations. Meanwhile, we  ought to define the standards and the code, appoint a special  independent council (the present one is too cumbersome) that  would monitor how television, both public and private, is  respecting its basic obligations as to objectivity, pluralism,  and the distribution in programming.    [Komadina] Do you think that HRT must be a "cathedral of the  Croatian spirit"?    [Galic] Croatia has its cathedrals, they should be given  freedom to do what belongs to them. But let television be  television. If you really want my slogan, I would say that it  should be Croatian, democratic, and European. Incidentally, that  is what I said in all my conversations.    [Komadina] What is your comment on Mr. Vrdoljak's statement  that you never would have been heard of, that you would have  been anonymous, if it had not been for television?    [Galic] Many have called my attention to that statement,  some  have asked me to react. As though it were offensive. I laughed  when I read it. I do not know what else Mr. Vrdoljak said, maybe  that statement sounds different in context. But I do not intend  to prove to him nor anyone else that I am not an anonymous  journalist and that I did exist even before television. It is  true that television expands the borders of a journalist's (any  journalist's) recognition, and that is exactly what I always  wanted to avoid. With television, after all, one loses a portion  of privacy. Vrdoljak's statement is probably an element of his  style. As far as I am concerned, it will not affect  collaboration.    [Komadina] Please comment on the charges which have been  made  that you are "a man for all times," which allude to your work on  DANAS and in the socialist system in general.    [Galic] I heard that question once before, and my answer was  the same as I make to you: Regimes come and go, the journalists  remain! If, of course, they are professionals, if they are not  too close to the regime, if they are not "regime journalists."  What would it be like if the corps of journalists changed with  every change? You are right if you are thinking that 1990 was  not an ordinary change, because that was the beginning of the  time of democracy, which contrasted with and followed the period  of one-party government, that is, totalitarianism. But can  democracy remove people, professional journalists? Especially  those who in the period of one-dimensional thinking displayed  courage in expressing other and different thoughts, even  opposite thoughts. I am not certain that in citing DANAS you  have chosen a good example: That publication, while I headed it  (I am not talking about what it was before or afterward), was  ahead of the times, precisely because it was disseminating a  certain pluralism, because it was developing free criticism,  because in the time of the "Croatian silence" it was defending  certain threatened Croatian interests, from politics to  language. It might seem to you today that that was not very  much, but for that time, believe me, it was too much. My head  was frequently on the block.    [Komadina] Many consider you the most successful editor in  the recent history of Croatian journalism. Why did you leave  DANAS just when it had reached its peak?    [Galic] I will let others speak to how successful or  unsuccessful I have been. I will give you just two figures: When  I took over the periodical, it had a printing of 43,000 (30,000  sold), and when I left the printing was 110,000 (more than  90,000 sold). I left because I was tired: It was not easy to run  an editorial office that was markedly heterogeneous, to  withstand the constant criticism from the Vjesnik establishment  and the great threats from outside, which came even from the  prosecutors. In 1988, the Journalists Society awarded me the  annual prize for the editing of DANAS. The citation is worth  reading today: The first sentence speaks about the good things I  did, and the rest about mistakes, about failures. On the basis  of that citation, I should have been punished, not rewarded. I  knew the background: When some of the powers that be at that  time heard that I had been given a prize, they made an uproar:  How can you give an award to DANAS? Because the decision could  not be changed, they changed the citation. I can say that most  of the editorial staff was on my side, that within the  establishment a certain stratification began into supporters and  critics of DANAS, that there were allies and opponents even in  Croatian politics.... But when I submitted my request to leave,  no one said: Don't! Some were overjoyed.    [Komadina] How would you describe the situation in Croatian  journalism at the moment?    [Galic] It is typical of the postcommunist period: There has  been a stratification, everything is still at the halfway mark.  If aggression against Croatia had not broken out, it all would  probably have gone faster, from privatization of the media to  definition of journalists. But even so, the changes are obvious,  especially in the newspapers, which are moving over a broad  front, from the papers that support the government and the  incumbent party, and then papers which maintain a certain  independence and nurture pluralism, to periodicals whose  sympathies are oppositionist. That is democracy. One can only  wish for it to go further and faster and for commercial  interests not to smother serious journalism.</p>

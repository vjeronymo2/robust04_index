			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Canada and US in timber deal Canada and the US will soon announce a new 'consultative mechanism' to head off potential disputes over softwood timber. Under the bilateral pact, Canadian softwood construction timber exports to the US will not attract import penalties and the US timber industry will be able to examine how Canadian provinces, especially British Columbia, levy cutting royalties and fees. The US industry has argued for years that some Canadian provinces charge low royalties and give their producers an unfair advantage in the US market. Canada exports more than Dollars 4bn of softwood timber a year to the US, Asia and Europe. Government officials will meet regularly to monitor bilateral timber trade. The pact will enable the US to return Dollars 600m in duties collected after imposing a 6.5 per cent countervailing duty on Canadian softwood in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA-SANTEE ROUTE'S FINAL LINK APPROVED BY STATE PANEL  </P> <P> State transportation officials Thursday approved the final 10-mile stretch of  California 52 that will eventually link Interstate 5 in La Jolla with  California 67 in Santee.  </P> <P> Meeting in San Francisco, the California Transportation Commission approved the  project's environmental impact statement, clearing the way for the $335-million  roadway scheduled to be completed in four stages by 2003.  </P> <P> The proposed route will begin at Santo Road, in Tierrasanta, near Interstate  15, skirt the north side of Mission Trails County Park, before turning  southeast, crossing over Mission Gorge Road, Cuyamaca Street and Magnolia  Avenue to California 67. Caltrans offi cials said construction plans include  interchanges at those streets and Mast Boulevard.  </P> <P> California 52 now runs from Interstate 5, through University City, under  Interstate 805, to Interstate 15 in Tierrasanta.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Jim Larson said construction of the freeway strip is  expected to begin in the summer of 1991.  </P> <P> "Initially, we're talking of getting to 125 in about five years," Larson said.  An extension of California 125 is under construction from Interstate 8 north  through La Mesa, El Cajon and Santee, where it will intersect the California 52  extension.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Ecstatic Over Approval  </P> <P> Larson said local Caltrans officials were ecstatic over the commission's  approval.  </P> <P> "We're happy as a lark," he said. "It's been a long, drawn-out process. There  has been a tremendous effort by our employees to put together this program.  We're already in the starting block."1  </P> <P> Construction and approval for California 52 had progressed at a snail's pace.  The project was approved by the Legislature 30 years ago. The first segment,  from Interstate 5 to Interstate 805, was approved in 1962, but it was not  completed until 1970. The second segment, linking Interstate 805 with  Interstate 15 and Santo Road, was approved in 1972 and opened 16 years later,  in July, 1988.  </P> <P> Larson, noting that the final 10-mile link is not expected to be completed for  another 14 years, said: "In freeway work, we look that many years ahead."  </P> <P> The last major hurdle, approval of an environmental report, took five years to  complete, transportation officials said. Several routes were considered before  the commission narrowed the number to three alternatives, then to the final  plan approved Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $150 Million for Property  </P> <P> Caltrans officials said about $150 million of the project's $335-million cost  will be spent on acquiring property, rights of way and resettlement costs.  Another $11.7 million will go to build a 77-acre habitat in Mission Trails  County Park for the least Bell's vireo, which is on the endangered species  list. The final environmental report also included a realignment of the roadway  to avoid vernal pools near Santo Road.  </P> <P> Initial plans for the new strip call for a four-lane freeway that will  eventually be widened to six lanes, Larson said. Once completed, California 52  is expected to reduce traffic on Interstate 8 by 20%. Caltrans officials said  some sections of Interstate 8 now carry about 270,000 vehicles a day.  </P> <P> The new road is also expected to ease congestion on Mission Gorge Road and  other surface streets that connect Santee and San Carlos with Interstate 15.  </P></p>

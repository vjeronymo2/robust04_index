			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY ACCEPTS PLAN TO RETURN SEIZED PROPERTY  </P> <P> East Germany tentatively agreed Friday to return property seized by the  Communist regime over the past 40 years, opening the floodgates for hundreds of  thousands of West Germans who want to reclaim the homes and businesses they  thought they had lost forever.  </P> <P> The draft agreement signed by the East and West German governments is the first  major step toward resolving the most emotionally charged issue of German  reunification.  </P> <P> The issue is "one of the most difficult with regard to the German-German  division, which personally concerns and affects many people," said Rudolf  Seiters, chief of staff for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> The four-page document, released in Bonn, did not specify how much property or  how many owners could be affected, nor did it estimate the cost of carrying out  the historic treaty.  </P> <P> But government officials in both countries previously have estimated that as  many as 1 million pieces of property in East Germany were expropriated by the  Communist regime toppled in a bloodless revolution last November.  </P> <P> Just who owns what and where has become a painful controversy in recent months  as hundreds of West Germans have showed up unannounced on East German doorsteps  with old deeds, demanding their abandoned family homes.  </P> <P> East Germans have come to dread what they call simply "the visits."  </P> <P> Friday's agreement protects the rights of East German tenants living in  disputed apartments or on disputed property, offering former owners unspecified  compensation instead of the property.  </P> <P> The two governments agreed that former owners were entitled to compensation but  could not retrieve their property if apartment, commercial or public buildings  now stand on the land.  </P> <P> West Germans have, among other things, asserted that deluxe hotels and part of  East Berlin's famed Alexanderplatz now stand on property that once was theirs.  Claims also have been staked against villas and estates used by corrupt former  officials of the Communist government.  </P> <P> The treaty also applies to East Germans whose property was confiscated by the  Communists, and to heirs in cases where original owners have died.  </P> <P> However, it does not cover property seized during 1945-1949 by the Soviets  during their postwar administration of territory that became East Germany when  the country was founded in 1949.  </P> <P> "The Soviet and East German governments see no possibility of reversing the  measures taken at the time," the statement said, adding that the West German  government "takes note of this in light of historic developments."  </P> <P> In part, the document said that "expropriated landed property will be returned  to its former owners or their heirs. . . . "  </P> <P> The East German government is expected to release details on applying for  compensation or reclaiming property, giving claimants a six-month period to  file.  </P> <P> Companies nationalized by the Communist government will be returned to their  previous private owners, or compensation will be paid, the agreement said.  </P> <P> Many factories and firms have taken steps to privatize themselves since East  Germany elected its first democratic government March 18. It was not  immediately clear whether these companies would also automatically revert to  original ownership.  </P> <P> A "socially acceptable compensation" is to be ironed out for East Germans who  unwittingly bought appropriated land or own buildings erected on confiscated  property, the statement said.  </P> <P> However, the accord states that any property obtained through "unfair  machinations (i.e., misuse of power, corruption, intimidation or cheating)" is  not protected and that the title "is to be reversed."  </P> <P> The clause will probably be applied to property owned or claimed by members of  the former Communist hierarchy, and could conceivably be used against ordinary  party members who pulled political strings to get better homes.  </P> <P> What remains unresolved is the responsibility of former owners.  </P> <P> Some West Germans, particularly, worry that in a united Germany they might be  held responsible for costly renovations and repairs to old homes or businesses  they abandoned decades ago when they fled west after the war.  </P> <P> A lack of materials and skilled labor have left hundreds of thousands of  buildings in East Germany virtually crumbling. An estimated one-third of all  dwellings are without indoor plumbing.  </P> <P> Friday's agreement came after weeks of tough negotiations.  </P> <P> The statement said experts from both governments will clarify details in the  near future.  </P> <P> TERRORISTS SHELTERED -- Communists gave refuge to Red Army Faction.

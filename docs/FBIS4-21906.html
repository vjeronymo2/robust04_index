			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, April 5 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot and seriously  wounded a Danish UN guard in an ambush Tuesday in  Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, security officials in the area  said.    The guard was shot in the chest as he was driving from al-  Sulaymaniyah to Irbil, and later underwent an operation, said  the sources contacted by telephone from Cyprus. They did not  give any information about the assailants.    The attack came only two days after an AFP correspondent,  German-born Lissy Schmidt, and her bodyguard were killed by  unidentified gunmen in the al-Sulaymaniyah area close to the  Iranian border.    Since the start of the year the UN has reported 13 attacks  against foreigners in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have left one  person dead and seven wounded.    One of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan (PUK), said earlier in a statement from Damascus that  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of  10,000 dollars to anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan."</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Swedish Government Bonds: Riksbank cautious in spite of market cheer THE Swedish bond market had plenty to cheer about last week and yields ended Friday on a firm downward trend. The cut in German interest rates, a fiscally tight budget package and reduced political uncertainty contributed to the positive mood. Given this and the recent strength of the krona, the decision by the Riksbank, the central bank, to cut its marginal rate by a mere 0.25 of a percentage point to 9.50 per cent after the market closed on Friday seemed a little miserly. Dealers had expected a reduction of at least half a point, the round of European rate-cutting which followed the Bundesbank's announcement on Thursday. The Riksbank is taking a cautious line to enhance the credibility of Swedish monetary policy, indicating that further adjustments will be in 0.25 per stages. 'We are keen to show the market that we do not intend to pursue a policy of aggressively lowering interest rates,' said Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor The bank's policy is based on the over-riding importance it attaches to a strong currency and the fight against inflation. However, Mr Bengt Svelander, senior bond deal at Consensus Fondkommission in Stockholm, points to a difference of perception between the bank and the market. 'The market believes the krona will get stronger as the economy gets stronger with lower interest rates. The bank is still concerned that it is only interest rate differentials which are preventing the currency from weakening,' he said. Nevertheless, most bond dealers expect the marginal rate to fall to 8.75 per cent to 9 per cent in the next few weeks, giving a much needed stimulus to the recession-hit economy. One prediction suggested the rate would be as low as 6.5 per cent early next year. Bond prices are discounting further interest rate cuts, with the yield on the benchmark 1020 bond, due 1997, closing at 8.38 per cent on Friday, down 6 basis points on the day and 33 basis points on the week. Yields on longer-dated bonds were falling, with the 1033 bond due 2003 ending the week at 9.19 per cent, a drop of 30 basis points since the previous Friday. The budget figures produced last week caused few surprises, as large savings had been signalled in the main January budget. The market appeared to have discounted the government's gloomier short-term economic predictions, which suggested gross national product would fall by 1.7 per cent in 1993. Even a prediction of a SKr190bn budget deficit for the 1993-94 year, equivalent to 12.9 per cent of GNP, and a SKr255.3bn borrowing requirement failed to disturb sentiment. What the market liked about the budget was its emphasis on heavy spending cuts in the next five years to eliminate the structural budget deficit. By disclosing a further SKr81bn in savings for the 1994-98 period, the centre-right minority government has announced cuts of about SKr160bn since it took office in September 1991, equivalent to 10 per cent of GNP. Equally positive was the backing given to the budget package by New Democracy, the political party that holds the balance of power in the Swedish parliament. This suggests an end to the political uncertainty which has unsettled sentiment in recent weeks. Yet the market reaction could hardly be described as ecstatic for two reasons. First, there are doubts about implementation, given that most of what is being proposed is scheduled to take effect after the next election in September 1994, which may bring the opposition Social Democrats back to power. Second, there is a feeling that government forecasts on inflation and economic growth over the next few years might prove over-optimistic, and hence upset its calculations. The aim is to limit annual inflation to 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent while achieving GNP growth of about 3 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998. The inflation forecast seems optimistic. Sweden is a country which is associated with the problem. Since the krona was floated last November it has weakened by nearly 20 per cent. Hence a large influence on bond market sentiment is likely to be the progress of the current round of wage talks. Evidence of low settlements will probably push yields down further.</p>

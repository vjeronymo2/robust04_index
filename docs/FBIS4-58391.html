			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Al-Qadhdhafi: We Are Seeking </F> to Close Lockerbie File Politically Without Abandoning Libya's  Sovereignty and Laws"]    [Text] Tripoli -- Libyan Leader Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi has sent a message to Mrs. Baha' al-Kikhya, wife of  former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, in which he  stressed that those behind her husband's disappearance "will not  get away with their crime." He pointed out that security  cooperation between Egypt and Libya "will succeed in revealing  details of this case." Al-Qadhdhafi accused the CIA and its  agents among the "stray dogs" of kidnapping al-Kihkya "with a  view to driving a wedge between Egypt and Libya." He expressed  willingness to look after al-Kikhya's wife and children.  Al-Qadhdhafi uses the phrase "stray dogs" to refer to those  opposed to his regime.    Al-Qadhdhafi met a delegation of Egyptian journalists the  day  before yesterday evening in a bedouin tent among olive and  almond trees in al-Khadra' area, some 56 km southwest the  capital, Tripoli.    Al-Qadhdhafi criticized during the meeting the current peace  process in the Middle East. He also stressed that the country  does not intend to hand over the two Libyan nationals suspected  of involvement in the blowing up of the PanAm plane over  Lockerbie. He spoke about the reasons that prompted Libya to  announce its wish to withdraw from the Arab League.    On the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement in Cairo tomorrow, Wednesday, he said  that "Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is chasing a mirage,  and the Palestinian people are not just one individual."    He said that "the Palestinians negotiating with Israel are  not the custodians of the cause. The real custodians of the  cause are Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the stone-throwing children,  the Palestinian people scattered throughout the world, and the  10 Palestinian factions rejecting the so-called  Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles agreement. He  expressed his belief that 'Arafat's agreement to continue to  negotiate with Israel is attributable to "Arab positions that  have annoyed him."    He said that recovering Jericho and Gaza "does not mean the  Palestinian issue has been resolved or that the Palestinian  people have accepted this agreement." Addressing 'Arafat, he  wondered: "How can you agree to befriend and embrace the Jews,  when Palestinian martyrs, including members from Fatah itself,  are falling in the occupied territories?"    He added that "the slogan being raised for the so-called  peace talks means the Arabs' unconditional surrender to their  enemy. It means their humiliation, abandonment of their future,  and harming posterity."    He said: "We are not warmongers; we are advocates of peace.  But what is happening at present is a deception for both the  Jews and the Arabs. The Jews are deceived in order to get rid  of them from world states, namely by deporting them to the  occupied Palestinian territories under the Promised Land slogan.  As for the Arabs, they are deceived so that they waste time and  squander their cause (...) The land of promise will become the  land of death."    He urged the Jews to "return to their homelands." He  welcomed "the return of the Libyan Jews living in Israel to  their country." He said: "If there is a real desire for peace,  those in charge of the peace process in the Middle East must  take South Africa as a model to grant the Palestinian people  their rights and hold free elections in the occupied Palestinian  territories under UN supervision. He stressed that such a  measure would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state.    On Libya's continuation in the Arab League, al-Qadhdhafi  said: "The decision to withdraw [from the Arab League] in  February was taken to make room for Israel to join the league  after Libya's withdrawal from it. The decision was taken in  protest at the positions of some Arab states which have turned  the league's task into a process of talking about ending the  economic boycott of Israel and entering into projects with the  Hebrew state, instead of talking about Arab unity."    He added that he and Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary  general of the Arab League, had agreed over the telephone to  delay a decision on Libya's decision to withdraw from the  league. He stressed that Libya has for the time being abandoned  the idea of withdrawing from the league. He said: "Libya is  currently experiencing a period of truce with the Arab states."    Al-Qadhdhafi supported the league's proposal concerning  trying the two Lockerbie case suspects at the International  Court of Justice in The Hague before Scottish judges and in  accordance with the rules of Scottish law.    Al-Qadhdhafi renewed his country's nonobjection to handing  over suspects al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah and 'Abd-al-Basit  al-Miqrahi if the United States and Britain agree to this  proposal, which has "embarrassed the Western states concerned  with the crisis with Libya." He pointed out that his country  will continue its endeavors to close this file through political  means. "But it does not mean abandoning Libya's sovereignty or  laws."    He stressed that "any western escalation of the crisis will  be confronted by Libyan steadfastness, no matter how long it  takes." He praised "Egyptian President Husni Mubarak's efforts  to solve the Libyan-Western crisis."    On his position on the Arab states' compliance with the  international embargo imposed on Libya, al-Qadhdhafi said that  "the Arab League has not spared any efforts to help Libya. But  it has no powers to adopt a resolution to compel the Arab states  to refuse to apply Security Council resolutions." He said that  that "the Libyan people are saddened by the Arab planes' boycott  of Libyan airports."    Al-Qadhdhafi said that President Bill Clinton is "a good man  seeking peace. But his Republican predecessors, Ronald Reagan  and George Bush, set up traps for him in Somalia, Iraq, and  Libya to topple him or force him to pursue their line."  Al-Qadhdhafi warned Clinton of the same fate as that of former  U.S. President John Kennedy, "who was the victim of a plot  hatched by intelligence organs and major monopoly companies."  He described Clinton as "an unaggressive man who opposed the  Vietnam war. And he represents the Democrats, a grouping for  the minorities."    Al-Qadhdhafi, who, the day before yesterday, held a popular  rally in Tarhunah, 70 km from the capital, which was attended by  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, urged Syria "not to negotiate with  Israel over withdrawal from the Golan Heights." He also  stressed that his country "will not recognize Israel, no matter  for how long the blockade imposed on it continues." He called  for "the removal of the Hebrew state from the Arab region."</p>

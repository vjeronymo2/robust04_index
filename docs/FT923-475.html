			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Goodyear sees improvement GOODYEAR, the last surviving large US-owned tyre company, said it expected to achieve third-quarter earnings higher than the Dollars 1.01 per share recorded in the same period last year. The Akron-based Goodyear, which also said its chief financial officer resigned yesterday, forecast another quarterly sales record, with total revenues coming at around the second quarter level of more than Dollars 3bn. In the third quarter of 1991, Goodyear earned Dollars 59.1m on sales of Dollars 2.8bn. Goodyear said its improved third-quarter results had been helped by cost containment, the successful introduction of new products, improved productivity and a strengthened distribution network. On Wall Street, investors seemed unimpressed at the prospect of only slightly better third-quarter revenues from Goodyear. The company's share price closed Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 58 3/8 after dipping to Dollars 57 7/8 . Mr Oren Shaffer, the Goodyear chief financial officer, will meanwhile resign from his position on Thursday 'to pursue other interests'. He will be replaced by Mr Samir Gibara, a vice-president of strategic planning and business development. Goodrich, the aerospace and specialty chemicals company that in 1988 sold off its tyre division, said its third-quarter earnings would be significantly below market expectations. The Ohio company said it was likely to report only a modest profit for the quarter. Analysts had been expecting Goodrich to earn Dollars 10m, or 30 cents a share. But Goodrich said the earnings would be well below the second quarter's Dollars 13.1m, or 43 cents a share. Mr John Ong, chairman, said the specialty chemicals and polyvinyl chloride businesses depended in large measure on the strength of the US economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, 31 Mar -- Estonia is not obliged to follow  the Latvian example in the issue of retired Russian servicemen,  said Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik speaking to local  television on 30 March. "Estonia has no intention of engaging  in any compromise in the issue of granting social protection to  Russian military pensioners residing in the republic," he said,  adding that he had no information about any kind of Western  pressure on Estonia over this issue. He said that the  guarantees to retired Russian servicemen were the price that  Latvia had been forced to pay for the treaty on troops pullout.    As we know, the absence of an agreement on military  pensioners is a major impediment to signing the act on final  withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia.    Assessing the prospects of the upcoming new round of  Russian-Estonian talks on 5-6 April, Luik said he expected that  the agreement on withdrawing foreign troops from the Estonian  territory would be initialled. He said that the Estonian side  had already been prepared for this a month ago. He added he  also hoped that Russia would provide a written "schedule of  troops pull-out promised long ago."</p>

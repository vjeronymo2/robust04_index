			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Output rise fuels hopes of upturn SPECULATION that the UK economy is on the verge of recovery was fuelled yesterday by news that manufacturing output rose in the first quarter of the year. The increase of 0.3 per cent over the preceding quarter in the three months to the end of March was the first three-monthly rise in output since the recession began. It followed six successive quarterly declines. The figures, from the Central Statistical Office, gave rise to optimism among economists, but they said it was still too early to pronounce the recession over. In spite of the quarterly rise, and two successive monthly rises, manufacturing output remained 2 per cent below levels of a year ago and 7.5 per cent below the high point recorded in the second quarter of 1990. On a monthly basis, manufacturing output rose by 0.2 per cent in March after a 1.1 per cent increase in February. Overall industrial output - manufacturing plus energy - fell by 1 per cent in the first three months of the year compared with the previous three-month period. That was mainly due to a big drop in energy output, which fell by 4.3 per cent in the first quarter. The Treasury said economic growth would become firmly established this year. 'Today's economic figures suggest the fall in manufacturing output may have ended and growth will become firmly established during 1992,' it said. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said economic prospects for the summer and autumn remained weak. Four of the seven components in manufacturing showed an upturn in the first quarter. Output of the 'other manufacturing' sector, which covers paper, printing and publishing, rose by 1.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter and output of metals rose by 1.1 per cent. Production of food, drink and tobacco rose by 1 per cent. There was a small decline in engineering output, although on a monthly basis output in the sector has risen for two successive months. Within engineering, car production rose by 4 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Chemicals was the only sector to show a big improvement in output compared with a year ago. Output grew by 5.3 per cent in the three months to the end of March compared with the same period a year ago. The CSO said that was almost entirely attributable to the strong performance of the pharmaceuticals industry. Output of the consumer goods industries rose 1.3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous three months, with the highest rise in the sector coming from cars. Production of investment goods, considered a lagging indicator, fell by 1.5 per cent in the first quarter and intermediate goods by 2 per cent. Economists agreed Friday's first-quarter gross domestic product would still be negative in spite of yesterday's manufacturing output figures, because of the fall in energy and water supply.</p>

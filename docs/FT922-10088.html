			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Interview: The opera diva who moves in mysterious ways - Singer Josephine Barstow explains the importance of theatre in an operatic setting MUCH OF the finest theatre today occurs in opera. True, there are still singers who just stand and deliver, some of whom are big stars. But some opera companies have built their house styles around their sheer theatrical vigour; and some operatic artists belong more truly in a theatre than others. One of these is the soprano Josephine Barstow. Though she makes successful recordings, she is best seen live. John Copley, who has directed her in several of her finest interpretations, has said that she could be a member of the National Theatre. Even 18 years after I first saw her in opera, I cannot forget some of the moves she made onstage then - how musically and psychologically acute they were. So, when we met, I asked her about how she conceives the physical side of a role. 'I like to find a physical shape to a character. Salome is lithe. She's snake-like. And I know how Tosca moves: she's very sensual; she has great consciousness of her body. Especially in Act I, she's sexual, with men. It's in her body. She has a powerful body; singers often do.' Does she work on keeping fit? 'Not really. I have a bicycle which I often ride to work in London. And in the country I ride. I have two careers, you see. I also run a stud farm in the country. 'In Sussex I have dogs, cats, ducks and 25 Arabian horses. And I really do go to the animal world for ideas. Salome is one of my cats. And animals help me with Tosca. She's not very intelligent. She gets very jealous, and I take ideas from a horse or a dog - animals that can be very jealous. Or a new-born foal: that's Natasha in War and Peace. With Natasha, I think of the shoulders. That's the secret. She has these short sleeves, and this dress that falls. The shoulders must be so lovely, and the head moves against them in this lively way. You can have a thick waist in dresses like that. She's a foal, you see. I was so angry with Tolstoy] At the end of the novel, he describes Natasha as a cosily, happily married mum. She's too rare, too special a type for that.' Barstow is today a leading figure in London opera; in one week last summer she sang Odabella in Verdi's Attila at Covent Garden, Katerina in Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk at the Coliseum and Puccini's Tosca at Earl's Court. She has sung many roles abroad. Does she have any fixed business for a role? 'Well, for that Tosca I had to. But ideally, no, I reconceive everything for a different staging when conditions permit.' She has no muscle memory of specific movements, but sums up each role quickly, in physical and psychological terms. Odabella in Attila is 'a warrior. Quite tight.' Minnie in La Fanciulla del West 'belongs in the country. She's loose-legged, loose-armed. There's space. The people in that opera - their bodies are used to working, to effort. A bit of the John Wayne. Minnie's the nearest to me.' The 300-year-old Elina in The Makropoulos Case 'has, like Tosca, a physical power over men. Which she's fined down. She's quite in control of it. The hardest thing is the way she rapidly declines at the end. But she gets intimations of the disintegration before. I used to try to get it by shivering, a quite involuntary shudder. She doesn't recognise it. And, like Ekaterina in Lady Macbeth, she's grown out of all the social graces. She doesn't bother about what she says. That's something I love in her.' Ellen in Peter Grimes? 'She is a still lady. She belongs to the village. To people who can't understand. The opera is about society not understanding Peter - who represents the artist, a homosexual, whatever. Her own tragedy is that she can't break away from that. She does bravely dictate to herself and her own society. But when the chips are down, she fails Peter; she is not equipped to cope. She's an ordinary mortal. And that's quite interesting.' Amelia in Un Ballo in maschera, torn between loyalty to her husband and her guilty love for the king, 'is quite still too. Her stillness comes from struggling to keep control of herself. It comes from pain, and from her struggle to control pain, her own endeavour to control what's happening. I just love Verdi heroines because you know how they think. And yet that gives you great leeway. Amelia is a gentle, honourable woman struggling with a moral problem. She's not on parade.' Unlike Elisabeth in Verdi's Don Carlos. 'You never see Elisabeth happy - except in the first act, at Fontainebleau. She's a French princess who marries the Spanish king. With such a character, you express emotion by details - flickers of fingers. She wouldn't betray herself by a change of physical shape. But in the bedroom, when she faints, then you see her own shape. It's her husband's bedroom, after all, and she's dressed differently, in her night clothes.' Violetta, the consumptive Lady of the Camelias in Verdi's La Traviata, is a role with which she has been associated for many years. 'I first did her long before I had the farm. My Violetta was very Garbo. I was just crazy about Camille. I loved Garbo's posture there. And her laugh]' Barstow demonstrates the lifted head, the revealed throat, the radiant face. 'But I couldn't really do that, so I cut that. Garbo could have played all the first act to perfection. 'Then when I prepared the 1973 Coliseum production, John Copley established a train of thought in me. A lot of the movement came from that. He gave me a wonderful relaxation at the beginning of Act II. It's such a brief moment, and he had the idea of having me enter with a basket of flowers and a hat.' How about Act II, scene 2 - the party scene? 'She's stiffer-backed there. (Garbo again]) She's trying to hold herself together.' And Violetta's consumption? 'We studied it medically speaking. We thought of blood coming up into the mouth. And the feeling of heaviness. She's incredibly tired. Then suddenly you get a spurt of energy.' What about another consumptive role, Mimi in Puccini's La Boheme? "Anyone can make an audience weep in Mimi's death scene. The trick is to make them cry in Act III; and, above all, in Act II of Traviata. And it's a success if I've stopped the audience applauding. Because then they're thinking. That's the triumph.' She has sung one Wagner role, Sieglinde in The Valkyrie. 'What's interesting there is the suspension of time. Being allowed to take time  - to let it happen. There's not just time to move, there's time just to look across the room.' One of the roles she has sung most is Richard Strauss's Salome. What of the long Dance of the Seven Veils? 'My first Salome was here, at English National Opera, and the dance couldn't have worked in any other production . . . There's no way that I can do a real dance. Frankly, that music, at that length, would be hard even for a ballerina. I like it if there's more of a plot to it, with mime. That's what Harry Kupfer, in East Germany, wanted. He has this idea that the dance refers to features of Salome's whole story. But I'm not a dancer. You can tell if people can dance from the look of them. Dancers are neat, and I'm not.' In the same composer's Der Rosenkavalier, she graduated from the youthful male role of Octavian (the Knight of the Rose) to that of his female lover, the Marschallin, a woman who is past her first youth. 'Octavian is simple. He's always there. It's one of the most exhausting roles I've ever played. But I didn't really find him very interesting. I love the role of the Marschallin so much; and I'm glad that doing Octavian gave me a chance to see the Marschallin at first from outside. Both of them share the same upbringing: that class, that eighteenth-century world. None of these characters are inelegant. It's a very particular part of the world, a particular city, a particular decade. And the Marschallin - she's too perfect]' Is there a difference in the way the Marschallin and Octavian carry themselves? 'He's a man; she's a woman. The costumes tell you so much. You see the outlines of his legs. He sits in a chair so as to display his calves. With her, it's the shoulders and the chest. The costume dictates how you should move. I wouldn't have been considered right in that era. I'm more physically close to Natasha.' One of her most remarkable roles has been Katerina in Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. Here she murders to get and keep what she wants. In Act Three of David Pountney's production for English National Opera, she has a long and phenomenal passage when she sits completely still, while singing; then remains totally still, when listening; then, slowly, she rises and moves towards a character who has been taunting her, and fights her until they drown together. 'What I found difficult was why Katerina was so malignant, vindictive. I didn't understand. Finally I decided that she tells you. Her last few words are: 'There's a black lake in the forest, black as oil.' For me, she's talking about something she's decided in herself. I understand, so I just let it happen.' I asked about the difficulty of stillness onstage. 'I'm getting better at that. I'm making more happen within the stillness. In Lady Macbeth the rest of David's production moves; I'm the still centre. I learnt economy there. Not crossing every T, dotting every I. Leaving the audience to make up their own minds. The less you do, the better. The concentration's inside. I tried to keep this black centre going.' I asked about one more Verdi heroine, the poignant Leonora in The Force of Destiny, never free from the conflict between love and her family's opposition even after years in solitude. 'Oh, I don't know what to say about her now. It's been quite a few years since I sang the role, and I'd have to delve down to find her again.' I remarked that she is due to sing the role again this September at the Coliseum, in a new production directed by Nicholas Hytner. She brightened. 'Yes. So it's just as well I've forgotten how I used to do her.'</p>

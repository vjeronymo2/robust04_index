			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOYT EXPECTED TO FULLY RECOVER FROM CRASH  </P> <P> A. J. Foyt, the winningest driver in Indy Car racing history, will fully  recover from multiple fractures suffered in a weekend crash, doctors said  today.  </P> <P> Foyt remained in satisfactory condition after being transferred from a  Milwaukee hospital to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where he was  scheduled to undergo a second operation late Monday.  </P> <P> Foyt, 55, sustained multiple leg and foot fractures in a crash Sunday at the  Texaco Havoline 200 at the Road America raceway in Elkhart Lake, Wis., about 60  miles north of Milwaukee.  </P> <P> "These are not the kind of injuries we feel will end his career," said Dr.  James Stiehl, an orthopedic surgeon at Milwaukee County Medical Complex who  supervised Foyt's initial 4 1/2-hour operation. "Ultimately, we feel he'll gain  a full recovery."  </P> <P> Surgeons planned to reclose some wounds and review some surgical procedures  completed Sunday night, said Dr. Terry Trammell, director of medical services  for Championship Auto Racing Teams.  </P> <P> The accident ended Foyt's 1990 racing season.  </P> <P> Trammell said Foyt would be unable to walk for eight weeks and would require  four to six months to recover fully.  </P> <P> "I'm going to do everything I can to get him back into the car, but in the end  it's a decision he'll have to make," he said.  </P> <P> Past injuries to Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 champion, include a crash during  the 1981 Michigan 500 in which he broke his right arm, and a stock car crash  last year at Charlotte, N.C., in which he sustained a serious concussion.  </P> <P> But the crash Sunday resulted in the worst injuries of his career.  </P> <P> "I feel he'll make it back behind the wheel to compete again if that's what he  wants to do," said Tony George, president of the Indianapolis 500. "He's in  good shape for a man 55 years old.  </P> <P> "He's always been a fast healer," George added. "Whether or not he heals as  fast at 55 as he did at 25, we'll know in a couple of months. But my impression  is that he still heals pretty fast at 55."  </P> <P> Foyt was in 14th place, a lap behind the leaders, when his car went off the  rolling four-mile, 11-turn circuit at Elkhart Lake at the end of the main  straightaway, drove over an embankment and into a grassy depression, crushing  his legs.  </P> <P> CART safety workers struggled for more than 15 minutes to pry the crushed front  end off Foyt, before transporting him to Milwaukee by helicopter.  </P> <P> The rescue interrupted the race for about 90 minutes. Michael Andretti  eventually won.  </P> <P> The operation on Sunday at the Milwaukee County Medical Complex was to repair  Foyt's left foot and dislocated left knee with a plate and screws, Stiehl said.  </P> <P> Foyt also suffered a fractured left heel and a dislocated right ankle. A broken  toe on his right foot was mended with a surgical pin, Stiehl said.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Management (Corporate Strategy): ICI goes native in the land of the long-term - The UK group's investment in Japan Almost every day, it seems, one Japanese company or another announces that it is setting up a factory or development centre in Europe or America. Although the reverse process has had less publicity, western companies are in fact pouring many billions of yen into new manufacturing and research facilities in Japan. One of the most striking examples is ICI, Britain's largest manufacturer. ICI was slower to move into Japan than other international chemicals groups; four years ago its Japanese activities were limited to importing chemicals and participating in joint ventures with local companies. Today, after a Pounds 100m investment spree, ICI is the 100 per cent owner of two new factories (one making polyester film and the other pharmaceuticals) and two research centres (one for specialist chemicals and new materials and the other for agrochemicals). Land, labour and materials are so expensive in Japan that these investments will not pay for themselves for several years. The ICI board accepted that the Pounds 50m plant to produce Melinex polyester film, opened last October, would give a significantly lower rate of return, looked at in isolation, than adding to existing production capacity in Europe or the US. But the strategy being pursued by ICI is not just about selling more goods in Japan. It is also - and perhaps more importantly - about hitching its fortunes firmly to the global expansion of Japan's end-user industries, especially automobiles and electronics. Only by doing research and manufacturing in Japan can ICI effectively develop special chemicals and materials in collaboration with the giant car companies such as Toyota and Honda and electronics companies such as Matsushita and Sony. The idea is that ICI will then be able to sell these products to Japanese-owned car and electronics plants around the world - and at the same time will gain competitive advantage in selling similar products to the remaining European and American car and electronics manufacturers. Japanese companies prefer to collaborate with chemicals suppliers which have scientists and engineers in Japan and a factory to produce material locally. For example, ICI has already lost the strong position it had 10 years ago as a supplier of plastic film to manufacturers of magnetic recording media (tape and discs) because the company was not in Japan then. 'We missed out on the Japanese electronic media revolution of the 1980s,' says Richard Sykes, the ICI Japan director responsible for the Melinex project. The relative weakness and fragmentation of Japan's indigenous chemical industry makes it easier for foreign chemical groups to expand there. The largest Japanese chemical companies, Mitsubishi Kasei and Asahi Chemical, are only one third the size of ICI, and chemicals are one of the few manufacturing sectors in which Japan runs a trade deficit. Although a few important chemical innovations have come out of Japan, the industry's scientific and technological base is generally weak by western standards. One important reason for this is that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which has done so much behind the scenes to help other industries organise their assault on world markets while protecting their home base, does not take such an active interest in chemicals. 'At the end of the day MITI is going to favour the automotive and electronics industries rather than the chemical industry,' says Masinori Kato, ICI's Osaka branch manager. Even so, no foreign company ever finds it easy to establish itself in Japan. In a country of full employment, where social attitudes still favour working for a Japanese employer, staff recruitment can be extremely difficult. A company expanding into Japan from abroad cannot rely solely on the traditional recruitment policy of taking on university graduates who will stay with it for life. ICI has persuaded senior people to move to it in mid-career, by offering a combination of higher salary, more time off work and a more interesting or responsible job. To help recruitment, particularly of new graduates, ICI has successfully trod the path many foreign companies have followed of taking on 'senior advisers' who have retired recently as managers of well-known Japanese companies. 'One of their most important roles is to bring us contacts with university professors who then refer their good students to ICI,' says John Wilson, a New Zealander who runs ICI Japan's agrochemicals division. 'Personal recommendations by good university professors are the best source of the best graduates.' The highest ranking adviser is Shoichi Saba, former chairman of Toshiba, the electronics giant, who served on ICI's main board as a non-executive director from 1985 until February. Saba, now aged 72, is still a powerful voice in Japanese government and business circles as vice-chairman of the Keidanren (Federation of Economic Organisations), and he has done more than any other individual to raise ICI's corporate profile in Japan. On a personal level, Saba persuaded his former colleague Mikio Kurashima, who had been head of Toshiba America, to join ICI Japan as executive director responsible for personnel, planning, business development and public relations. (John Russell, president of ICI Japan, heads a team of six directors: three expatriate Britons and three Japanese.) Kurashima says that, of all the differences between working for Toshiba and ICI, language is the biggest. 'To put it simply: in Toshiba they work in Japanese, in ICI they work in English. Japanese employees of ICI do talk in Japanese when they're by themselves, but if there's a single Englishman present - as there normally will be in a large meeting - the meeting will have to take place in English.' Looking at the language gap from the English side, Jim Armstrong, head of ICI Pharmaceuticals in Japan, says: 'There are two languages you have to learn in Japan: Japanese and Japanese English. It's surprising how often the Japanese staff do not really understand the messages of letters arriving here (from the UK). There's a whole series of English words that have a particular meaning to the Japanese, which is different from the common English usage.' Apart from personnel and recruitment problems, western companies find it more difficult than they would at home to get permission to build a factory or research centre. In a densely populated country where land and labour are very scarce, the prospect of creating jobs is no incentive for allowing industrial development. ICI executives have devoted a lot of time and effort to cultivating local government officials in Ibaraki prefecture, north-east of Tokyo, where the company has built the Melinex film plant, Japan Technical Centre and Agricultural Research Station. The pattern of land ownership in Japan is another complicating factor. Although the Agricultural Research Station covers only eight hectares, ICI had to negotiate with 38 separate landowners to buy the patchwork of paddy fields it needed. To help managers cultivate business contacts, ICI Japan has corporate membership in three golf clubs. 'This pays off in terms of establishing human relationships,' says John Wilson. 'Golf is not seen as competitive in Japan but an enjoyable day out.' Foreign businesses in Japan need to build up a relationship not only with customers but also with suppliers. Given the strength of the Japanese machine tool and electronics industries, it is surprising at first sight that ICI imported two-thirds of the equipment for the new Melinex plant from Germany, including the Siemens computerised control system. 'We originally hoped to use more Japanese equipment but we discovered that to buy from the Japanese we needed a longer-term relationship,' says a British engineer on the Melinex project. As polyester film begins to roll off the Melinex production lines, ICI's Japanese staff are already lobbying hard for the group to allocate substantial new funds to keep up the momentum of investment in Japan during the 1990s. For example Toshiaki Harada, a manager in the Japan Technical Centre, says: 'We think ICI's paints division should come to Japan.' He argues that the future of its automotive paints business depends on building a relationship with the Japanese car manufacturers. But the next large-scale investment is most likely to be in chlorofluoro-carbon substitutes. Japanese refrigerator and air conditioner manufacturers will be extremely important customers for the Klea 134a, a replacement for ozone-destroying CFC refrigerants. Scientists and engineers at the Technical Centre are already working with Japanese customers on this; a Klea factory in Japan would cost at least Pounds 75m and would open in the mid-1990s. With ICI cutting capital expenditure, however, in response to the current downturn in the chemical industry, Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, says the board could not sanction a Klea plant for Japan until the US plant (under construction) and in the UK have proved themselves. Even so, Henderson emphasises that Japan - and the whole Asia Pacific region  -will continue to receive high priority for investment. The medium-term target is to double ICI's sales in Japan from Pounds 500m last year to Pounds 1bn in 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, by Mino Fuccillo; place and date  not given: "`Italians, Beware; Berlusconi Is Deceiving You'"]    [Text] Rome -- [Occhetto] Berlusconi? It can be proved  that he is lying when he says that wealth will ran from the  skies as long as he is handed the keys to the government. It  can be proved, in fact it is already apparent, that if those  keys did ever fall into his hands, he would throw them into a  river so that nobody could ever find them again. But to  document his demagoguery and his questionable vision of  democracy cannot be enough; it is not enough to say that the  Forza Italia "miracle" is a mere illusion, that Berlusconi's  "magic" lies only in his words. Beyond that, beyond the lies,  there is a true fact: If they do win and if they do govern,  millions of Italians will pay the price. All those who need  medical attention will pay. They will pay good money -- forget  about wealth for all. The money that Forza Italia is promising  to the "strong" will be taken from the "weak."    [Fuccillo] You seem worried to me, Mr. Occhetto. Do you too  feel that there is trouble brewing? Berlusconi's popularity  ratings are rising, he is commanding attention, and nurturing  hopes. Did you not forecast this, or did you fail to understand  the situation?    [Occhetto] Indeed, the immediate impression is of a flood, a  sudden downpour of water. What is coming down is the old  system, and it is all collecting together in a single swimming  pool. At present we are under this waterfall. But its force  results from the fact that hitherto there has been no aggressive  and threatening right. Now it is arriving all at once, moving  from zero to 18 or 20 percent, or whatever it may be. We shall  see whether this flow dries up, ebbs, or continues to increase.    [Fuccillo] For the present the water is flowing. The "joyful  war machine" seems to be that of the right rather than of the  progressive forces.    [Occhetto] There is no doubt that it is a war machine;  indeed, they are intent on occupying territory. They have no  common program other than to seize power. They cynically  believe that this is the only important thing, and have allied  only in order to share out slices of Italy among themselves,  openly and shamelessly. The nationalists of the National  Alliance together with the federalists of the League,  notwithstanding [League Secretary] Bossi's blather. The League  which grows furious when it hears the word "solidarity" used in  connection with the south, together with the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] which promises aid to the south. Together, held by  Berlusconi's right and left hands. They have formed a chain,  and for the sake of no political principle other than: Let us  seize Italy, then we will see.    [Fuccillo] Should they compete to lose? Was it not you who  called for the establishment of an Italian right?    [Occhetto] I expressed the hope for the emergence of a right  capable of proposing a government, not a group of enemy gangs  coming together solely to occupy territory, just as, and worse  than, in the past, when the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and  the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] occupied the state.    [Fuccillo] Be that as it may, they are together, and they  are  strong...    [Occhetto] They seem strong, but it cannot be taken for  granted that the League, Forza Italia, the MSI, and the former  Christian Democrats can come together without losing something.  I would ask those voters who have become League supporters out  of a sense of disgust and protest: Do they not realize that  they are being offered an even worse form of Craxism, its  poisoned fruit? That same Berlusconi that every history book  would describe as a monument to the entrepreneurship that  emerged in the shadow of that regime?    [Fuccillo] Perhaps those voters are concerned less with the  past and more with the paradise promised by Berlusconi and  company, the paradise where there are no longer any taxes to pay.    [Occhetto] Taxes will fall if the state is reformed, and  that  is our objective -- to really reduce them for those who are now  paying too much, and not to promise that those who have never  paid their taxes will never have to pay them again. As for the  promised paradise, if Berlusconi were ever to explain who would  have to pay, it would become apparent that it would be like a  hell for millions of Italians. It is no accident that  Berlusconi talks a lot but will not answer any questions.    [Fuccillo] You say he talks a lot. Do you want to reduce his  number of minutes, in fact hours, on television?    [Occhetto] I would grant Berlusconi even more minutes and  hours as long as he agreed to an exchange of views, a debate, to  answer some questions. But he will not and cannot. He can only  exercise his charm at long distance, like a flash of lightning.  To succeed in making him talk about specifics in a specific  manner would be like putting on the light and ending the dream.  I appeal to him to conduct a debate in public with the others,  if he can. He says that he suspects censorship. Let me  reassure him, as far as I can: no limits, no excuses for him to  act the martyr. For him, who is deafening us, to be afraid of  being gagged: That is absurd. That is, unless for Berlusconi  being gagged means not being able to do whatever he wants while  the rest cannot. Or is it no longer the case that the rules  must be the same for everyone? He moves like a tank, and we are  not stupid enough to try to bar the way to him, but we never  want tanks, especially when we are talking about government and  information.    [Fuccillo] It seems likely that there will be some  reckonings  and in fact some acts of revenge after the elections. If the  progressive forces win, will their adversaries have to plead for  mercy?    [Occhetto] Rotation in government does not stop after the  first round; the first election under the new system is not the  key to establishing a new totalitarian regime. If this had been  our intention, we would have tried to remain as before and would  not have exposed ourselves, would not have been the first to  pursue, with conviction, the democratic risk of winning or  losing. But Berlusconi does not reason this way: As far as he  is concerned, there is the pole for freedom, that is, the right,  and the pole of evil, that is, all the rest. I believe that we  are all full members of the pole for freedom, and whoever denies  this is unwittingly admitting that he considers freedom his own  private privilege.    [Fuccillo] Let us come to your own alignment, that of the  progressive forces: When it comes to discussing candidates,  people are kicking each other under the table. Do you know what  I was told by someone from your party in Emilia? "They are  sending us here people to elect with our votes, and telling us  that we must do so because they are moderate candidates. Well,  we have been moderates ever since 1943."    [Occhetto] For one thing, the table has eight legs, and the  political problems seem to have been resolved. Also, I would  tell you that when it comes to choosing candidates there comes a  point when you feel like despairing: You are confronted with  five or six different criteria, all beyond criticism, but  mutually conflicting. The remark that you cited is both  perceptive and true. There are those who are entitled to tell  us how victory can be achieved in their own constituency without  having to be told by Occhetto, [Rete Secretary] Orlando, or  [Democratic Alliance leader] Adornato. But some are rather less  in the right. Be that as it may, after a history of the left  composed of hostility and cannibalism, we have already  established a minor miracle, whereby we are seeking candidates  capable of both winning and persuading. This criterion must  prevail above all others.    [Fuccillo] The candidates issue is not the only problem for  the progressive forces: You seem to be in disagreement over who  should be prime minister and who should comprise the government  team.    [Occhetto] Look, I have here on my desk the remarks in which  centrist leader D'Onofrio, accuses me of having ruined [Prime  Minister] Ciampi's chances, no less, simply by stressing that I  appreciate what he has done in government. I do not want to  attach too much importance to D'Onofrio, but the issue that you  raise is a serious one, and my reply is that I have respected,  and I still respect, Ciampi's desire to stand aloof from the  various alignments. However, nobody can prevent me from  believing that Ciampi is, and will remain, a democratic asset.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FISHER SAYS HE FEARS EX-WIFE TAYLOR CAN'T KICK HER DEMONS  </P> <P> Entertainer Eddie Fisher says ex-wife Elizabeth Taylor has severe problems and  he's "fearful for her."  </P> <P> In a television interview with Geraldo Rivera broadcast Wednesday, Fisher said  Taylor's problem with drugs is just as bad as when they were married in the  early 1960s.  </P> <P> "I was using . . . hardly anything when I was with Elizabeth," he said of his  own 37-year addiction to drugs. "I was her nurse for all those years and her  problem was tremendous. . . . Whatever her problem was in 1960, it was the same  in 1990."  </P> <P> Fisher said his ex-wife's problems are "very, very severe and I feel very  fearful for her today."  </P> <P> Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said: "There's no comment on what the man's  saying. Miss Taylor is doing very well. She's in perfect health."  </P> <P> Fisher said he stopped using drugs after being treated at the Betty Ford clinic  six months ago.  </P> <P> Taylor, who acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain killers  in 1983, has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse.  </P> <P> Taylor and Fisher married in May, 1959. She left him and married Richard Burton  in May, 1964.  </P></p>

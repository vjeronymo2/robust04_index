			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Berliner Bank earnings rise 15.7% BERLINER Bank has reported 15.7 per cent higher earnings of DM43.4m (Dollars 24.6m) for last year and an unchanged dividend of 10 per cent. The bank, which since mid-1990 has expanded strongly in east Germany, expects improved results this year on the basis of performance in the first three months, Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, board spokesman, said recently. A not insignificant part of earnings last year came from 'reserves' built up over the years in a bank subsidiary. Berliner Bank aims to complete its takeover later this year of Berliner Stadtbank in east Berlin which contributed 38,000 of Berliner Bank's 90,000 clients in the east. The merger with Stadtbank was held up by delays in presenting an opening balance sheet. A total of DM3.4bn in new deposits came from east Germany where the bank has 21 outlets, including those of its east Berlin affiliate. For the first time in its 40-year history, Berliner Bank was able to expand in its own immediate surroundings as other banks had done, Mr Steinriede said. The bank's main volume business in the east was financing new ventures. It also planned to invest with partners in prime urban property sites. Last year, Berliner Bank formed a joint subsidiary with Baron Edmond de Rothschild's investment group. Mr Steinriede noted that Berliner Bank was waiting for the green light from the city to merge with Landesbank Berlin, the former Sparkasse of Berlin. The city of Berlin is a majority shareholder in both banks. The merger was desirable if Berlin were to play a greater role as a financial centre, he said.</p>

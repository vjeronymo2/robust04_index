			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Japan's emergency economic package: Dearth of labour belies talk of recession - Drinks on the company might have to go, but only 2% are out of work THESE ARE meant to be tough times in Tokyo. The government yesterday released an emergency economic package, companies have called crisis meetings, executives have taken salary cuts, and workers have received solemn lectures on the need for increased diligence and discipline. But in the streets of Akasaka, the business and nightlife district of Tokyo, the restaurant windows carry hand-written pleas for part-time staff. 'The trend is very serious. We are very worried,' explained an accountant for a Japanese life insurance company, his right hand wrapped around a mizuwari, the standard issue whisky and water. Asked how the 'crisis' had hurt his family, he instead lamented the decline of Japan as an economic power, the laziness of young Japanese, and Japanese politicians' lack of morality. For the average Japanese, the economic 'crisis' is talked about on television, but not seen on the streets. There are an average 1.25 jobs available for each job-seeker, and unemployment fell by from 2.1 per cent to 2.0 per cent in February. Fast-food restaurants are starved of staff, while owners of small factories are lobbying the government to allow more foreign 'trainees' to work their lathes and drive their trucks. Land prices are reckoned to have fallen by 30 per cent over the past two years, but there is no mortgage repayment crisis for middle class Japanese. Some apartment developers are in pain, but first-time home buyers are still daunted by the Y55m (Pounds 240,100) needed to buy a reasonable two-bedroom apartment within 90 minutes of the central business district. Household savings are 6.5 per cent higher than a year earlier at an average Y11.28m, so there is money in the bank, though consumer electronics and car makers are concerned by a new-found fondness for second-hand products. Used car sales have risen as new car sales have fallen over the past year, and a secondary market appears to be emerging for the video cassette recorders and television sets traditionally tossed out on the regular 'big rubbish' night. Japanese may not be living the 'crisis', but corporate Japan is certainly worried about about it. Business magazines, always keen to spot trends, have identified three cost-cutting Ks - kokoku, kosai and kokusai: advertising, entertainment and international business. The love of numbered lists has deep roots in Japan, and until now the most recent talking point was a separate set of three Ks describing the type of work avoided by picky, younger Japanese: kitanai, kiken and kitsui - dirty, dangerous and difficult. Advertising is down, with a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) showing an 8.6 per cent decline on last year. Dentsu, the largest agency, said the cutbacks correspond with industries' fortunes, with slower demand from the finance, electronics and real estate sectors, and stronger orders for personal items such as cosmetics and clothes. At Daikyo, the leading builder of apartments in Tokyo and a prominent victim of the property market slump, an internal review of costs has begun. But the company's vice-president, Mr Katsuhiko Muramoto, said advertising 'remains important for us', although the company is buying less space simply because it is building fewer apartments. 'It is a tool for developing our business, but we have to use it in an efficient manner,' Mr Muramoto said. 'We are reducing all kinds of waste. We don't have a set plan to cut entertainment expenses by, say, 10 per cent, but we are looking for ways to save money.' Several groups have chosen to save money by cutting executives' salaries. At Minolta, the camera company which will report its first loss in 27 years, directors have taken a 10 per cent pay cut and executive directors 20 per cent. The chairman and president of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company, are taking a 50 per cent reduction for three months from today. Down in Akasaka, there is genuine concern about the fate of the furious, company-subsidised drinking that lubricates the Japanese economy. A leading business magazine asked whether the downturn will mark 'the end of entertainment heaven' for executives and bar owners. Most of the evidence is anecdotal but luxury club owners say their business is down 20 per cent this year, and golf club membership dealers report a sluggish secondary market. However, the National Tax Agency reports that in the year to end January, entertainment costs rose 13 per cent to a record Y5,620bn, just above the Y5,610bn budgeted for education this year. As for the third K, kokusai, or international expenses, financial institutions have delayed opening new foreign branches, while Japanese investment capital has come home after the massive outflows of the late 1980s. But companies are reluctant to admit to a lower international profile, though it is generally agreed that corporate sponsorship of foreign art galleries, car racing, and the like, is declining. The common person's 'international' expense, tourism, is apparently untouched by recession, as the number of travellers has climbed above the record levels of pre-Gulf War days. And for those yet to book a holiday during the Golden Week rush later this month, it's too late, the planes are full. Package that fails to please; Editorial comment; Page 22</p>

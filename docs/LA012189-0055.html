			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BUSH SPEECH: TIME TO 'TALK AS NEIGHBORS'  </P> <P> "A President is neither prince nor Pope," George Bush told his fellow citizens  Friday in his first public utterance as President.  </P> <P> Indeed, discarding traditional high-flown rhetoric along with his topcoat, Bush  made clear on this bright and blustery day that his view of his new job was far  from grandiose or imperious. Instead, with the sun on his face and the wind in  his hair, Bush presented himself as your basic plain-spoken, good-intentioned,  friendly neighborhood chief executive. One with a patrician sense of duty and  bent toward good works.  </P> <P> Every inaugural address has its own objectives, shaped by the man and the  times. In Bush's case, his main goal was to begin defining himself as a  political personality and leader. In the process, he sought to accomplish  another significant purpose: to create a national mood of reconciliation after  the polarizing controversies of the Reagan era.  </P> <P> "We meet on democracy's front porch," said Bush, putting a homey perspective on  the marbled splendor of the Capitol's historic west front. With tens of  millions watching him across around the land, Bush referred to his inauguration  as "a good place to talk as neighbors, and as friends."  </P> <P> And in what was probably the most visually striking passage of his address he  turned to Democratic congressional leaders seated at the platform and promised  them "the offered hand" of bipartisan cooperation.  </P> <P> "The American people await action," he asserted. "They didn't send us here to  bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan."  </P> <P> In presenting himself as a generous-spirited leader willing to meet his  opponents at least halfway, Bush sought to focus a political image that has  remained remarkably hazy for most Americans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Own Attitudes Were Blurred  </P> <P> Though he has had a long public career -- including active involvement in three  presidential campaigns -- Bush has been the instrument of other men's  convictions in most of his previous jobs, including the vice presidency. The  outlines of his own instincts and attitudes have remained blurred.  </P> <P> Bush made an earlier effort to explain himself and his innermost beliefs to his  countrymen, in his widely praised "I am that man" address accepting the  Republican presidential nomination last summer. But the favorable impression he  created was soon blurred and marred by the sound and fury of a notably negative  presidential campaign.  </P> <P> On Friday he sought to regain the pre-campaign focus by returning to what  Temple University rhetorician Herbert Simons called "the lofty tone" of his  convention acceptance speech. "He was trying to say, 'I'm not the guy who ran  those nasty campaign commercials,' " Simons said.  </P> <P> Bush also leaned heavily on what Bryn Mawr's Marc Ross, a specialist in the  political uses of television, called the "moral stuff about generosity, a kind  of old-line noblesse oblige."  </P> <P> "America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral  principle," Bush declared. Then, in an echo of the hope stated in his  acceptance speech for "a kinder and gentler nation" he added: "We as a people  have such a purpose today."  </P> <P> "It is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the  world."  </P> <P> In one particularly self-revealing passage that both typified Bush and helped  bolster the harmonious mood he was trying to create, the new President offered  the country a lofty version of family values.  </P> <P> "My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions," he said. "We cannot hope  only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to  give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a  citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found  it."  </P> <P> "George Bush remembers his family," said Temple's Simons. "And he is trying to  incarnate America in the likeness of his own family."  </P> <P> Bush added a touch of steel to the gentle image he sought to convey, much as he  had in the acceptance speech when he made his "read my lips" not to raise  taxes. This time, mindful of the sensitivity of the defict issue among  Democrats who control both houses of Congress, he found another target for his  determination besides fiscal policy.  </P> <P> "There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and  express our intolerance," said Bush in one of his few unsmiling moments. "And  the most obvious now is drugs. . . . Take my word for it: This scourge will  stop."  </P> <P> "He wanted to show he can be a tough guy," said Kathleen Jamieson of the  University of Texas, author of "Eloquence in an Electronic Age." "He translated  that into the pledge to crush the drug traffic."  </P> <P> And Bush reinforced his uncharismatic view of the presidential role with a  relatively comfortable assessment of the nation's domestic condition and a  sanguine view of international affairs.  </P> <P> "We live in a peaceful, prosperous time," he said, " . . . a proud, free  nation, decent and civil."  </P> <P> Abroad, Bush also found reason to be optimistic. "For a new breeze is blowing,  and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn," he said. "For in man's heart,  if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is  passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree."  </P> <P> By emphasizing the relative tranquility of the times, Bush made it easier and  more natural for himself to fulfill the other major function of the speech --  reconciliation.  </P> <P> In broader terms, he tried once and for all to put an end to the divisive  anguish of the Vietnam War. " . . . Friends, that war began in earnest a  quarter of a century ago; and, surely, the statute of limitations has been  reached . . . the final lesson of Vietnam," he added "is that no great nation  can long afford to be sundered by a memory."  </P> <P> Clearly, Bush's effort to establish his own personal and political identity  required him to separate himself from his predecessor in terms of style and  emphasis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offered No Anecdotes  </P> <P> And some critics missed the "Great Communicator's" skill. Bryn Mawr's Ross  found Bush's effort to raise the nation's moral consciousness unconvincing  because, unlike Reagan, he offered no concrete examples or anecdotes to explain  what he meant. "There was almost no personalization, no link to real people,"  Ross complained.  </P> <P> And Stephen Hess, now a Brookings Institution senior fellow and a former speech  writer to Republican Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon,  said: "He pushed all the right buttons, but it was not a memorable speech," a  result that Hess attributed to Bush's studiously low-keyed tone.  </P> <P> But Bush may not care whether his words go down in history books. In his first  day on the job, he seemed more concerned with trying to convince voters who  last November entrusted him with the nation's destiny that they made the right  choice.  </P></p>

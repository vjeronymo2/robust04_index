			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) proposed Sunday [26 June] holding a summit meeting  among leaders of the LDP, the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  [SDPJ -- of Japan] and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] to form a  new government to replace the minority cabinet of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made the proposal at a  meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo.    Mori and Kubo agreed a new government should be established  as soon as possible, they said.    Hata and his cabinet resigned Saturday prior to impending  defeat in a no-confidence vote against his two-month old cabinet  tabled by the LDP.    Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan to have resigned  in  five years.    Kubo told reporters after the meeting with Mori that the  country's two largest parties in parliament, the LDP and the  SDP, will discuss how to break the current political deadlock.    The two parties however will not proceed to consultations on  forming a new coalition government, Kubo said.</p>

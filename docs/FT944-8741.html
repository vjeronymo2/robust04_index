			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a convincing argument on nuclear power Sir, David Lascelles's article 'Particle of hope' (November 11) speculates unconvincingly on the privatisation of Britain's nuclear industry; it simply lacks the backing of logic and current trends to support it. For nearly five years the order to privatise electricity production has been viewed as the coup de grace for British nuclear ambitions. But in fact nuclear power from its origin has never really been economically competitive, democratically supported or environmentally acceptable. Its toxic waste problems, after half a century, remain unmanageable; its market share is being overtaken by sustainable energy technologies, while its deeply damaging effects are beginning to unfold. Hope for the people of Britain lies not in the conjecture that anachronistic nuclear power will survive but in developing affordable, benign, renewable energy.

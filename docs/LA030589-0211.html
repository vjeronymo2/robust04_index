			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE TRACK;  </P> <P> CSUN DOMINATES 5-TEAM MEET  </P> <P> There are two ways to analyze Cal State Northridge's victory in a five-team  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. track and field meet at CSUN on Saturday.  </P> <P> The first theory is based on the hypothesis that the Matadors are much better  than Coach Don Strametz has let on.  </P> <P> After all, Northridge lost its best sprinter (Kevin Hendrix) to academic  ineligibility, and its best hurdler (Tyrone Jeffries) and best middle-distance  runner (Will James) were sidelined with a back and leg injury, respectively.  </P> <P> Yet the Matadors won 11 of 19 events in the men's meet -- including six of nine  individual races -- and defeated Cal State Los Angeles, 136-78. Cal Poly Pomona  finished third with 54 points, followed by UC Riverside (22) and Chapman (one).  Scoring was conducted on a six-four-three-two-one basis.  </P> <P> The second theory -- one that is probably closer to reality -- is that Cal  State L. A. Coach John Tansley did not run all of his top athletes,  particularly in the sprints and hurdles, where the defending CCAA champion is  traditionally strong.  </P> <P> That does not mean, however, that Northridge was unimpressive. The Matador  men's team added another individual to its list of NCAA Division II  championship qualifiers (three) and produced numerous personal bests.  </P> <P> In the women's meet, Darcy Arreola and Lolita Pile led the Lady Matadors to  victory. Northridge totaled 129 points, followed by Cal State L. A. (60),  Pomona (50), Riverside (10) and Chapman (one).  </P> <P> Walt Stewart, a junior from Notre Dame High, won the high jump with a personal  best of 7 feet, 1/2 inch to qualify for the Division II championships and move  into a tie for third on the all-time Northridge list.  </P> <P> Paul Albers, a junior transfer from Sierra College who qualified for the  Division II meet two weeks ago, moved to eighth on the all-time Northridge list  in the hammer throw with a 185-7 effort and Sasha Vujic won the 1,500 meters in  a personal best of 3:56.09.  </P> <P> "We had a super meet," Strametz said. "If I had known that neither Tyrone or  Will would run in this meet, I never would have expected us to win by this  much.  </P> <P> "It just shows you what can happen when you get kids to believe in themselves."  </P> <P> Vujic, a freshman from Burroughs High, is an example of that.  </P> <P> At the start of the year, distance coach Bob Augello described Vujic as a  "classic complainer," a talented runner but one who viewed everything in a  negative way. Then six weeks ago, things began to change, according to Augello,  as Vujic began to think positively and started to bear down in workouts.  </P> <P> "He didn't really say anything," Augello said. "His attitude just changed. He  kind of said, 'OK. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.' "  </P> <P> The change in attitude is starting to pay off with a drop in times.  </P> <P> A week and a half ago, he lowered his personal best in the 800 to 1:56 in a  time trial and Saturday he passed leader Rich Hirschman of Pomona with 130  meters to go, then blew him away in the homestretch.  </P> <P> Vujic ran the last 440 yards in 59.3 seconds and the last 330 yards in 43  seconds after running the first 440 in a pedestrian 66.9 and the first 880 in a  sluggish 2:11.2.  </P> <P> "I felt really strong," Vujic said. "When the early pace was slow, I was happy  because I felt like they were playing into my hands.  </P> <P> "I was very confident with a lap to go."  </P> <P> In contrast to Vujic's victory, there was little suspense in either of  Arreola's wins.  </P> <P> Running in her first track races since the Olympic Trials last July, Arreola  ran 4:25.17 in the 1,500 and 9:40.35 in the 3,000.  </P> <P> Both times meet NCAA Division II qualifying standards. Arreola is the defending  national champion in both events.  </P> <P> "She's going to run under nine minutes (in the 3,000) this year," Strametz said  of Arreola, who has a best of 9:13.34. "The times she ran today were very  easy."  </P> <P> Pile was one of the meet's busiest competitors, winning the long jump (18-5  1/2) and triple jump (39-0 1/4) and placing third in the 200 (25.38).  </P> <P> She also ran the second leg for the victorious 400 relay team (48.2).  </P></p>

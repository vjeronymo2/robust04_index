			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / EU budget plans pose threat to unity says Bundesbank A SCATHING attack on European Union spending plans is launched today by the Bundesbank, which says they threaten progress towards monetary and political union and will worsen Germany's budget difficulties. In its monthly report for November, published as members of the central bank's decision-making council meet today in Frankfurt to consider further interest rate cuts, the Bundesbank cautions that the financial disciplines embraced by member states under Maastricht could be undermined by EU spending. 'The effectiveness of individual countries' monetary policy may be restricted through the increased granting of direct credits and subsidised lending at the community level,' the Bundesbank says. This would 'scarcely be helpful' on the path to economic and monetary union. Adopting the tone normally reserved for its critique of domestic spending, it says the EU's budgetary behaviour must be in harmony with broader macro-economic and monetary objectives. The Bundesbank stops short of urging the government to curb its contribution to the EU budget, but says Germany's transfers to the union are set to increase in the context of a projected steep rise in total EU spending. Total EU spending on structural measures is set to be Ecu176bn (Pounds 134bn) in 1993-99, compared with Ecu67bn in 1988-92. It predicts that Germany's gross transfer of funds to the union will grow from DM38bn (Pounds 15bn) currently to DM52bn in the next five years, an average annual growth of 8 per cent - far higher than the intended increase in total government spending. Net transfers - with the inflow of funds to eastern Germany - will climb from DM22.4bn in 1992 to DM30bn in 1997. Germany's role as largest contributor to EU finances may have been justified before reunification but, the Bundesbank argues, it is questionable now, following reunification. Germany is now, in purchasing power terms only the sixth most prosperous country in the union, having been the second after Luxembourg. The Bundesbank also says that economic fundamentals are more important in determining the stability of a currency than institutional arrangements such as the European Monetary System. Thus the increased flexibility in the exchange rate mechanism since the move to wider bands did not reduce the chances for stable relations between currencies - so long as countries pursue the objective of medium-term economic stability.

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREYHOUND TALKS BREAK DOWN AMID VIOLENCE CHARGES  </P> <P> Talks between Greyhound and its striking drivers abruptly broke down Sunday  when company officials accused union leaders of failing to negotiate and  committing new violence.  </P> <P> "The union is stonewalling on the contract," Greyhound Executive Vice President  Anthony Lannie said in a statement.  </P> <P> "They had nothing new for us while stepping up the violence."  </P> <P> Lannie charged that violence continued Saturday even while the two sides were  meeting for the first time since 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other  Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and grievance  procedures.  </P> <P> In Washington, Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of  Greyhound Local Unions, called Lannie's statement "the desperate words from a  desperate man. We clearly condemn violence and anything we can do to discourage  our members we are doing so."  </P> <P> The union presented a new proposal Saturday, but the company said it was  unacceptable, and the talks broke off Sunday after only about an hour.  </P> <P> Greyhound operates the only nationwide inter-city bus service, and the strike  has stranded many smaller communities for which buses are the only public  transportation.  </P> <P> During the walkout, Greyhound says, there have been at least 14 shooting  attacks on Greyhound buses.  </P></p>

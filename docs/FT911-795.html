			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): A severe brain drain - Emigrant total may reach 60,000 this year HONG KONG is suffering from a severe 'brain drain' as wealthy and well-educated people leave the colony in search of a foreign passport. The problem first appeared in 1987 and the numbers of emigrants has risen ever since. This year 60,000 people are expected to leave, or more than 1,000 a week. They are concerned about Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and what it will mean for individual freedoms, prospects for their children and living standards. Among many other reasons, some people also say they are worried about Daya Bay, a nearby Chinese nuclear power station due to begin operations next year. The number of students leaving Hong Kong to study overseas has also risen rapidly, reflecting a shortage of places in the colony as well as political worries. Last year nearly 25,000 left for the main destinations of Canada, the US, Australia and the UK, compared to 19,169 in 1989 and 15,026 in 1988. Although the vast majority of these students return after completing their studies, there are worries that once they have gone abroad they are more likely, and more qualified, to leave Hong Kong again. The brain drain is a major headache for companies who face high staff turnover, dwindling employee loyalty and competitors poaching staff. In order to cope, companies are offering higher salaries and improved training. Larger companies are trying to organise postings overseas. Some companies are even offering special bonuses of up to HKDollars 1m to staff staying until after 1997. As talented people continue to leave, there are worries overall management standards are slipping as less experienced people are promoted to fill senior vacancies too quickly. Higher bonuses and salaries to attract and keep staff continue to raise operating costs and contribute to Hong Kong's high inflation rate. The government hopes the number of people leaving has now plateaued after a record 62,000 people left last year. About one-in-four were professionals or managers. The most popular destinations are Canada, Australia and the US. The government also hopes 'insurance schemes' like a British Nationality package, designed to give passports to 50,000 key heads of families, will persuade people wanting to emigrate to stay in the colony longer. The package was less well received than expected. Just over 55,000 people applied for 32,700 passports in the largest 'general occupational' class. Within this class, some categories - such as lawyers and translators - were over-subscribed in the first tranche. But the important category of managers and administrators was 10 per cent under-subscribed. The first passports under the package are due to be handed out in June. The US now has a similar scheme. This offers about 10,000 employees of US companies in Hong Kong, and their families, visas which can be delayed until 2002. About 6,000 applications have been filed so far. The US has also doubled its quota for Hong Kong migrants to 10,000 a year and this will almost double again in 1994. Australia, which this year expects to take 17,000 Hong Kong emigrants, does not offer a specific package for Hong Kong employees of Australian companies. But under existing emigration rules some emigrants can delay taking up permanent residency in Australia for up to five years. France and Belgium also offer smaller packages to employees of their companies in Hong Kong. Singapore has a scheme to attract 25,000 technicians and skilled workers and their families. These people can delay taking up residence for five years. So far, 17,500 families have been approved while a further 12,500 professionals have been cleared under a separate package, according to Gordon Seow, Singapore consul in Hong Kong. If these schemes succeed by keeping businessmen and professionals in the 30 to 40 age group, the profile of emigrants in the next few years is likely to shift towards both younger and older people, who are less economically active. Even so, the government does not expect the overall number of emigrants will decline from around 60,000 a year for the next few years.</p>

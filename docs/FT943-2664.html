			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: The bile of Berkoff - Alastair Macaulay on a double bill of decadance There are many awful things about the world in which we live, and the actor/author/director Steven Berkoff is right to hate them. But you know what? The way he hates them only makes the world worse. In his current double bill at the Riverside Studios, Berkoff unleashes his usual vein of satiric hatred on the following: misogyny, lust without love, greed, narcissism, over-emotionalism, sensationalism, homophobia, fattism, brutality, and more. And, as usual, his method is to depict these things in sustained satire. He wants to lampoon the decadence of the society we know. The trouble, alas, is that his method is itself decadent. The first, and shorter, of his two new offerings, Sturm und Drang, is about three upper-middle-class sophisticates. The starting-point is two men airing in private their contrasting views of women. Plainly modelled on the sustained dialogues to be found in Moliere's plays, and on the rhyming iambic pentameters into which Moliere is usually translated into English, it also means to show us the awful shallowness and selfishness with which polished modern men discuss women. ('My friend, it's really quite obscene./ To get your rocks off needn't cost a bean.') Then a woman joins them, and her talk introduces us to other kinds of awful shallowness and selfishness. Everything is shaped by Berkoff's relish for flashy but hollow dialogue. You are encouraged to laugh at what his characters say and to despise them at the same time. He should be scripting the 'Great Bores of Today' cartoon in Private Eye. Here, however, he is, clutching at any rhyme and any metre that will help him out. The pentameters turn into heptameters and hexameters, the iambs sometimes turn into anapaests, the rhymes become desperate ('horrid' with 'vomit') or just vanish entirely. 'Also I'm a bit pre-menstrual and my fax has broken down' is one of the better verse lines here: no kidding. I would be less bothered if Berkoff and his co-actors performed in a less facile and flashy method. He likes his pieces to be performed with maximum show-off. Technical bravura abounds. Thus Berkoff, Timothy Walker and Katy Carmichael zoom from fortissimo to pianissimo, run two or more sentences together in a single breath, demonstrate florid gestures (the wrist-to-forehead classic is recurrent), and so forth; and yet they also frequently chop up verse lines into separate staccati. Were it anyone else but Berkoff who spoke the line 'Her. Satin. Legs. Uncross. Like. Sighs.', I would speak of unstylish delivery; but this pause-laden technique is widespread here. There follows Brighton Beach Scumbags, in which Berkoff applies his scathing satire to four sunbathers from Chingford. The play later includes two gay men; Berkoff is sufficiently pc not to satirise them, and so we have the weird experience of seeing one of Berkoff's typically overblown cartoon sketches suddenly deflate, after an hour or so, into flat, mimsy, but uncaricatured conversation for gays. Berkoff's big point here - he wields it like a cosh - is that all these people suffer from unnecessary paranoia. The fat lady thinks that the gays are laughing at her; the gays think she is objecting to them. As a pathologist of our social ills, Berkoff is of sophomoric level; but those of you who like theatre to preach important messages should rush along. Unfortunately, you will have to put up with Berkoff's stale parody of Essex Person. There is the endless which-motorway-did-you-take conversation, something Berkoff handles with none of Alan Ayckbourn's skill; there is the poofs-are-just-women-in-male-bodies line (uttered more wittily in Jonathan Harvey's current Babies at the Royal Court). The terrible unoriginality of Berkoff's mind is made worse by his cartoon method. Derek, Dave, Dinah, and Doreen are all mere types, and there is only one fleeting moment when Berkoff has the humanity to turn one of them into a real individual with specific peculiarities. This moment occurs late on, when Derek mends a quarrel with Dinah by suddenly lying face-down on her lap so that she can scratch his back: a moment so particular, and surprising, that it has a freshness like nothing else I have ever seen in Berkoff's work. (It doesn't lead anywhere here, but never mind; it gives me hope.) This moment apart, there is no transparency to Berkoff's art. It is designed not to draw attention to its subject matter but to the way in which that subject matter is scripted and delivered. This constant display of technique and method, this refusal ever to submerge the ego into another character and into the larger world beyond Berkoff, is the prime reason I call Berkoff a decadent artist. If a thing is worth doing, Berkoff seems to be saying, it is worth doing noisily, strenuously and frequently. Sturm und Drang and Brighton Beach Scumbags are at the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, W6.</p>

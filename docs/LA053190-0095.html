			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CONTRAS AGREE TO SPEED UP DISARMAMENT  </P> <P> Contra leaders agreed Wednesday to speed up the stalled process of disarming  their forces in return for a government-aided relocation plan allowing former  guerrillas to police their new communities.  </P> <P> It was the third accord in six weeks committing the Nicaraguan rebels, who are  gathered in seven cease-fire zones, to hand their weapons to U.N. peacekeeping  troops by June 10. After each previous pact, the rebels have slowed their  demobilization and won new concessions, leaving about 13,000 rebels still to be  disarmed.  </P> <P> "Today our friends in the Resistance have promised to comply with all the  agreements they have made earlier for June 10," President Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro told reporters after all-night talks with Contra military leader  Israel Galeano and Gen. Humberto Ortega, commander of the Sandinista-led army  that fought the U.S.-backed rebels for eight years.  </P> <P> Asked why she believed the rebels' promise this time, the president said: "One  must have enormous faith."  </P> <P> Chamorro's latest concessions will give a degree of autonomy to the rural  resettlement colonies that the rebels had won in a previous agreement. The  first colonies are to be built in the sparsely-settled southeastern corner of  Nicaragua, with the government providing roads, housing materials, schools,  health clinics and farm tools for former rebels and their families.  </P> <P> At the rebels' insistence, the new colonies will be self-governing and policed  by former rebel combatants. The new policemen are to be trained by U.N. troops  and accountable to the Ministry of Government in Managua, which oversees the  national police force.  </P> <P> The policing arrangement was crucial to Contra leaders, who claimed that  disarmed rebels faced the threat of reprisals by members of the army and  national police. Both are still led by officers of the Sandinista revolutionary  movement that lost the Feb. 25 election to Chamorro's center-right coalition.  </P> <P> Since the disarmament process began May 8, just 1,984 rebels have returned as  civilians to their home towns and villages, U.N. officials said.  </P> <P> The talks that produced Wednesday's agreement started last week but were broken  off Friday in a bizarre sequence of events. Rebel negotiators charged that 14  disarmed rebels on their way home in northern Nicaragua had died in a  Sandinista ambush.  </P> <P> But when a team of investigators from the government, the Roman Catholic  Church, the United Nations and Organization of American States flew to the  site, they found no evidence of the alleged massacre.  </P> <P> Before the investigators returned to Managua, the Contra negotiators tried to  leave town but were sequestered in their hotel by the police and staged a brief  hunger strike. The talks resumed Tuesday.  </P> <P> The rebel leaders' behavior appears to reflect concern over the prospect of  losing their power. While many rebels say they want to go home, Galeano has  pressed for the new colonies as a way of keeping his men together as a civilian  organization. Until the U.S. Congress approved a $300 million aid package for  Nicaragua last week, the government was unable to go beyond its vague promises  to set up such colonies.  </P></p>

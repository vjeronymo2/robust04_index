			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates edge up HOPES of a base rate cut were put aside yesterday and rates firmed in the face of a big shortage of credit on the final trading day of the month. The Bank of England's opening forecast of Pounds 1.7bn was slightly lower than market expectations which had ranged as high as Pounds 2bn. The shortfall was due mainly to more than Pounds 2bn of treasury bills and maturing assistance. But the day proved as difficult as expected, largely because only half the bills due were reckoned to have been renewed. This may have been because corporates did not need the funds, or because they saw a chance of cheaper money in the near future. The effect was that much of the shortage failed to be transferred to the most accessible places. In the early round the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 590m for resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent on March 20. At midday, it purchased outright Pounds 36m of band 1 treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 37m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, together with a further Pounds 41m of bills for resale. The shortfall forecast was raised to Pounds 1.95bn in the afternoon, however, and the Bank purchased Pounds 736m of band 1 treasury bills and band 1 and 2 bank bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent, plus Pounds 69m for resale. This still left the system Pounds 441m short, for which late assistance accounted for only Pounds 220m. Overnight rates went as high as 16 per cent in the afternoon, having earlier hovered at 11 3/4 -11 1/2 per cent, closing at 13-12 1/2 per cent. Short rates remained firm, with the one-week rate up to 10 7/8 -10 5/8 , very expensive compared with a 10 1/2 per cent base rate. The key three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent. The March short sterling contract dropped as far as 89.76 from a 89.86 start, before coming back slightly to 89.80. German call money rates were also firmer as liquidity levels fell sharply. Overnight rates were quoted at 9.55/65 per cent, up from 9.45/55 per cent on Thursday, but below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Bundesbank reserves plunged to DM60.0bn on Wednesday from DM75.3bn on Tuesday, due to the outflow of pension payments. Traders said uncertainty about when funds would flow back into the system, and when it would be hit by February employee wage payments, had pushed overnight rates up.</p>

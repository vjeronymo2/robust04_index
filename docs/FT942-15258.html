			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Asea Brown Boveri wins Dollars 1bn Malaysia power deal Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, has won a Dollars 1bn contract to build a turnkey 1300MW combined-cycle power plant at Lumut in the Malaysian province of Perak. The contract is believed to be the largest awarded to power suppliers worldwide in recent months, and underlines the importance of the fast-growing Malaysian market for power equipment, due to the country's strong economic performance. It comes six weeks after Malaysia imposed a ban on UK companies bidding for public contracts in protest at reports in the UK media of corruption. The ban was a blow to UK power equipment suppliers and contractors such as Rolls-Royce and John Brown, although contractors have been hoping they could still win orders from private customers. The Lumut order was placed by Sikap Energy Ventures, a Malaysian independent power producer. There were no rival UK bidders to ABB. The gas-fired plant will be Malaysia's largest combined-cycle power station, and ABB said it would supply about 11 per cent of the country's electricity needs. Construction will begin immediately and the first stage of the project is due to be operating by July 1996, with the rest ready by July 1997. The station will be equipped with six ABB gas turbines, two steam turbines and eight associated electrical generators. It will incorporate ABB's low-NOx burners to produce high fuel efficiency with low emissions. Earlier this week, Westinghouse Electric of the US announced a contract worth more than Dollars 100m from Korea Electric Power for power generation equipment at a 300MW power plant to be built at Ilsan, South Korea.</p>

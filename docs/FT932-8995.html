			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Glimmerings of a golden future - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson takes a modest plunge THE LEAFLET fluttered out of the free newspaper. A 'long-established family jeweller' would be visiting an hotel near my home. It offered an 'expert and discreet service' and was keen to buy gold, silver and antiques - including 'large or small quantities of scrap gold or silver.' The leaflet added: 'Foreign and un-hallmarked gold and silver tested immediately.' So, I went to the hotel. I expected to find a small queue of people, drawn by the offer of confidentiality and the recent rise in the price of gold. After all, many retired people in the area, with modest fixed pensions, have been used to living off the interest from their bank and building society deposits. With comparatively low interest rates, would some now be forced to sell some of their heirlooms, including gold and silver items? The hotel was quiet and there was no queue; indeed, I was the only visitor although, admittedly, I had arrived at 3.30 pm and the jeweller was due to depart at 4. I found him wrapping one of his antique purchases. He did not appear to have been very busy. I produced a small gold bar: one tael (1.203 ounces) of fine gold, stamped with the seal of the Hang Seng bank, which had been given to me some years before. Since the gold price for the previous day had been Pounds 224.47 an ounce, I thought my bar would be worth around Pounds 270. The jeweller took it, produced a pair of electronic scales and weighed it. Then he scrutinised it through an eye glass. 'Just one moment,' he said. 'I'll have to check the price.' He left the room. On his return, he told me: 'I can give you Pounds 230 for it. The price of gold will go down tomorrow.' Looking at my disappointed face, he added: 'Well, maybe you would like to think about it. I'm back here again next week.' I thanked him, took my bar and departed. The next day, I checked the paper for the gold price. It turned out that the morning 'fix' before I saw the jeweller had been Pounds 224.823 but the afternoon price was up, at Pounds 226.343. I thought a dealer spread of more than 14 per cent was a bit much, although I appreciated that he probably would had had to sell the bar to another dealer who would have taken a profit as well. Compared with 'mark-ups' on ordinary goods sold in shops, I suppose it ought to have been considered a good deal. But I then 'phoned Spink and Son in London. One of its dealers offered me 95 per cent of the spot gold price if I brought in the bar for examination. The dealer said that because Spink had a high turnover in gold bullion and coins, it could afford to work on smaller margins. I asked if I could get an even better deal if I had a number of gold bars instead of just one. The dealer replied: 'If you walked in with a couple of kilo bars, we would try to get closer to the spot price.' In fact, I do have a number of gold bars although, unfortunately, each of them weighs one tael rather than a kilo. I bought most of them in Hong Kong in 1985 and they have been in a bank vault ever since. With all the recent publicity about gold purchases by George Soros, the influential financial speculator, and the subsequent jump in its price, one might imagine that my bars have proved a very profitable investment. In fact, the reverse is true. In spite of the recent price rise, gold has still not quite reached the price I paid in 1985. And, of course, this investment pays no interest and no dividends. Compared with what I could have earned from cash on deposit or from shares, my gold has been a very poor performer. 'But,' say the pundits, 'if George Soros buys gold, it must be a good investment. Look how much he made last September by correctly judging the currency markets and seeing that the pound would, effectively, be devalued.' But Soros is also the first to admit that he did not escape the effects of the 1987 stock market crash. No one can be right all the time. Also, it appears to me that Soros is more of a 'dealer' than a long-term holder. There is nothing wrong with that, but it does concentrate one's mind on a rapid exit route should Soros decide suddenly to sell. So, I am keeping my gold for the time being. Not because of Soros, but because of what appears to be an increasingly unsettled world. I also tend to share some of the views of Sir James Goldsmith about certain western economies and their approaches to monetary problems. Most of all, though, what makes me at least a short-term holder of gold is the increasing demand for this precious metal in the Far East. For one thing, Japan is likely to issue numerous gold coins to commemorate the wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito. And the Chinese have long had a respect for gold; demand from them is likely to rise substantially as the numbers of entrepreneurs increase. There are also rumours that the former Soviet Union countries no longer have stockpiles of gold and that their mines are working at reduced capacity. With corruption rife, almost anything could happen. Gold remains a rare commodity. Because it is so dense, its weight is surprising: it has been claimed that all the gold ever mined (around 110,000 tonnes) could still fit into a five-bedroom detached house. As well as being used in jewellery and dentistry and as a useful, easily-portable international 'store of value,' gold also has uses in electronics. So, I expect demand for it in the short term to remain high. While this does not mean I am rushing out to buy more of it, I have increased my personal pension fund's holding in Lonrho. As I mentioned in my article on May 1, I decided to take another look at that company in the light of its sale of the Observer newspaper, and its 45 per cent stake in Ghana's huge Ashanti gold mine. On May 4, I took the plunge and bought more Lonrho shares, paying Pounds 1 each. According to Lonrho's annual report, the Ashanti mine 'remains on target to produce 1m ozs' of gold by 1995-96 - up from 654,000 ozs in 1992. The company also has important gold production interests in Zimbabwe. I hope, therefore, that my investment in Lonrho will also have a golden future.</p>

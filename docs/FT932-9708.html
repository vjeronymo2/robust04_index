			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar holds on to gains THE DOLLAR held on to recent gains against European currencies yesterday, while the pound staged a respectable recovery from its post - local election lows, writes Emma Tucker. In a generally quiet day's trading, the dollar was firm against the D-Mark at around DM1.61, traders still heartened by the currency's valiant performance last week in the face of poor employment data. It finished New York trading at DM1.6085. None the less, the market remains wary of the dollar, with a number of analysts saying they expect the latest rally to peter out at about DM1.62 unless there is some very positive US economic data soon. A modest 2-pfennig recovery for the pound was fuelled by overseas buyers, suggesting that foreign investors were not too bothered by the Conservative party's spectacular defeat in the county council elections and Newbury by - election. Sterling slipped to around DM2.46 on Monday as domestic investors took fright, but climbed back by the London close to DM2.48 yesterday, still below last month's high but not by much. News that UK housing starts rose strongly in the first quarter made little impact on the currency. The pound closed against the dollar just under a cent firmer at Dollars 1.5420. The Bank of Spain dipped in and out of the market, buying pesetas for D-Marks as the Spanish currency continued to come under selling pressure. Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets said: 'The fundamental problem with the peseta is that the Spanish economy is very weak and the currency is perceived as being overvalued.' He added that the Spanish authorities were aiming to avoid a devaluation of the currency before the general election next month. Before then, however, the government will have to defend what is expected to be a very poor set of first-quarter employment statistics - showing an unemployment rate of above 20 per cent - while maintaining interest rates of 15 3/4 per cent. The Danish krone was under some pressure ahead of Tuesday's referendum on Maastricht. Although the opinion polls are pointing to a majority 'yes' vote, dealers said investors were not heavily exposed on the krone. 'The most likely thing is that there will be a yes vote, but people are not taking any risks,' said one. The French franc showed little reaction to the 1993 mini-budget. Nor did details of a bill making the Bank of France independent have any effect on the currency. Dealers said the budget confirmed rumours of tax and spending increases and contained no real surprises. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said French interest rates could fall below Germany's given economic fundamentals: 'As our fundamentals appear better than Germany's, nothing - and the Bundesbank chairman has said this - prevents French rates falling under theirs.'</p>

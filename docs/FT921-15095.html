			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (4): A tale of two different companies - The profits performance of European industry THE profits performance of two very different companies tell part of a revealing story of how European industry has performed in the past year. One of the worst profit falls came at Philips, the Dutch electronics group now undergoing an overhaul of its business. Its profits fell from Dollars 663m the year before to a Dollars 2.148bn loss. Philips was not alone; most of Europe's electronics groups were in trouble. Profits at Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, were down 16 per cent, while at Olivetti, the Italian computer group, they fell from Dollars 280m to zero. Nokia of Finland bucked the trend with a 17.7 per cent increase to Dollars 172m. The electronics industry is being buffeted by fierce competition led by Far Eastern producers. The performance of the Europeans is inseparable from the international competition they face. One of the steepest profits increases came from a company which is protected from competition, working in a purely domestic market. North West Water, one of the recently privatised British water companies, pushed its profits up to Dollars 370m from Dollars 130m the year before. Its performance was indicative of the entire British water industry which turned in some of the strongest profit increases in Europe: profits were 92 per cent up at Severn Trent and 97.7 per cent up at Yorkshire Water. Indeed, privatised UK companies make up a significant minority of the groups which have recorded the biggest profits improvements in the past two years. BT, the telecommunications group, British Gas, and the electricity companies Powergen, Midlands Electricity, Eastern Electricity and Yorkshire Electricity all figure among a select band of companies which increased profits by more than 25 per cent. Partly helped by accounting conventions, British companies are overwhelmingly predominant among industrial and commercial companies, excluding banks, building societies and insurance companies, which make a return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent. British companies account for seven of the 10 largest European companies with a return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent: Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome in pharmaceuticals, Unilever and Guinness, the food, drink and consumer goods groups, BTR, the conglomerate, and J Sainsbury, the retailer. No fewer than 56 British industrial and commercial companies reported a return on capital employed of more than 25 per cent, stretching from retailers such as Body Shop to conglomerates such as Williams Holdings, food groups such as Northern Foods and Cadbury Schweppes to well-established industrial groups such as Smiths Industries. Only a handful of German groups make a similar return on capital, for example Hoechst, the pharmaceuticals group, 10 French companies and six Swedish companies led by Astra, the drugs group, and telecommunications maker Ericsson. They are joined by three Dutch groupings and one company from each of Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. The extent of the disparity in performance measured by return on capital is highlighted by the contrast between Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group, and its German counterparts. Hawker Siddeley was taken over last year by BTR, the industrial conglomerate, in spite of making a rate of return of 24.3 per cent. This contrasts with a rate of return of 7.5 per cent at Man, the trucks group, 14 per cent at Mannesmann, and 10.5 per cent at Thyssen. Apart from the British predominance of companies with a high rate of return on capital, the other trend is the strong performance of pharmaceuticals groups across Europe - Astra of Sweden, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham in Britain - no matter what their country of origin. Among the companies which made a rate of return of less than 10 per cent were some of the best known names of European industry, Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti in Italy, Michelin and Valeo in France, British Aerospace, Hoesch, the German steel group, and Nokia in Finland. National factors have exerted some influence over profitability. British companies, particularly those linked to construction and consumer markets, such as British Steel and Forte, the hotels group, figure prominently among those which saw profits fall by more than 20 per cent. The benefits of German unification do not seem to have led to enormous increases in German corporate profits. Daimler Benz, the automotive, electronics and aerospace group, saw its profits fall by 62 per cent while Siemens, the electronics and engineering combine, enjoyed a 1.3 per cent rise. At Mannesmann profits rose by just 4 per cent. The other clear regional trend is the plight of Scandinavian companies - and Swedish companies in particular - such as Electrolux, profits down 61 per cent, Volvo down 105 per cent, Skanska a 16 per cent decline, and SKF, a 29 per cent fall.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  EUROPEAN SECTOR PROFITABILITY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             No of      % Sector                                       Cos.   chge Heavy Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering               1    44.4 Natural Gas Utilities                          3    40.4 Electric &amp; Water Utilities                    41    24.7 Telephone Companies                            5    24.3 Oil-Internationls/Crude Producer               9    16.2 Advertising                                    1    15.5 Broadcasting Media                             3    13.4 Drugs                                         12    13 Beverages &amp; Tobacco                           15    12.3 Retail - Grocery chains                       11    10.9 Oil-Petroleum Products                         4    10.9 Financial Services                             5     7.8 Fabricated Metal Prods &amp; Container             5     5.2 Health Care/Cosmetics                          5     4.7 Communications &amp; Office Equip                  5     4.6 Investment Companies                           3     4.3 Retail - Dept Store/Gen Merch                 14     3.7 Financial Institutions                         7     1.9 Food Processors                               22     1.8 Electronics/Instrumentation                    6     1.1 Commercial Banks                              61     0.3 Machinery (Composite)                         14    -0.8 Property                                      14    -1.6 B'ness Servs &amp; Computer S'ware                 5    -2.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             No of      % Sector                                       Cos.   chge  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aerospace/Defence/Aircraft Manu                2    -3.2 Entertainment &amp; Leisure                        6    -3.4 Retail - Speciality                            8    -4.8 Restaurants &amp; Hotels                           4    -7.3 Wholesale - Nondurables                        2    -7.7 Diversified Industrial Manu                   10    -8.5 Chemicals                                      4    -9 Paper &amp; Paper Products                         5   -12.4 Publishers incl Newspapers                    10   -14.9 Construction &amp; Building Material              22   -15.1 Forestry Products                              6   -16 Diversified Holding Companies                 28   -16.9 Apparel/Textile Producers                      1   -23.2 Chemicals - Diversified                       14   -24.5 Mining &amp; Extractive Industries                 9   -25.2 Insurance/Life/Agents &amp; Brokers                6   -28.2 Construction                                  10   -29.9 Electrical Equipment                          10   -34.6 Transport/Storage &amp; Warehousing               17   -35.1 H'hold Durables &amp; Consumer Good                5   -35.3 Insurance/Multiline/Property                  38   -38.8 Automobiles                                    6   -43.4 Auto Parts Tyre &amp; Rubber                       6   -91.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNIFICANCE OF CINCO DE MAYO  </P> <P> As a graduate student of Chicano history, I felt compelled to write in response  to Ray Chavira's comment regarding Cinco de Mayo ("Trouble at Cinco de Mayo  Events Could Doom Future Festivals," by Michael J. Ybarra and George Ramos,  Metro, May 9). Though I agree with his belief that the holiday has been  commercialized and thus is a money-making opportunity for many businesses, I do  not think he understands the true significance of the date. The following is an  answer to Chavira's question: "What about the real reason for celebrating it?"  </P> <P> Perhaps the holiday is not celebrated in Mexico with the enthusiasm it is here  in the United States; however, the date has been held in high regard in the  Southwest since 1863, a year after the Battle of Puebla. The reason for this is  that the Mexican community north of the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) looked upon the  victory of the small Mexican Army against the huge French forces as inspiration  for their own fight against the injustices inflicted upon them by their recent  American conquerors.  </P> <P> The years from 1848 to 1900 were perhaps the harshest for Chicanos in the  Southwest. It marked a period when the once-dominant Mexican community lost its  economic, social and political power.  </P> <P> Though much time has passed and many things have changed, the Mexican community  in the United States still feels the effects of being a conquered people. This  is not to say that many have not struggled and continue to labor for social  equality. With this in mind, the events of May 5th should hold a special place  in our history and continue to be a cause for celebration.  </P> <P> ERNESTO CHAVEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Supercollider rushes to its doom: Hope ends for Higgs boson THE US Congress yesterday finally pronounced the death sentence on the superconducting supercollider, an Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) particle physics project being built in Texas. The supercollider ' gigantic boondoggle or cutting edge science, depending on your perspective ' often came close to losing its government funding, but time and again it was pulled back from the edge of the grave by a handful of powerful senators. At last, however, it fell victim to a House-Senate conference committee's desire for a closer match between deeds and budget-cutting rhetoric. For two years, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to kill the supercollider, while the Senate voted to preserve it. For two years, the conference to reconcile the two versions of the bill bowed to the Senate. This time-honoured technique had the advantage of enabling members to tell their constituents that they voted to cut spending, safe in the knowledge that the project would be restored behind the conference's closed doors. This year, however, House members revolted and sent back the reconciled bill by an overwhelming vote of 282 to 143. Supercollider supporters, led by Texas, where the project is sited, and Louisiana, where its giant magnets are being built, yesterday acknowledged the inevitable. As a consolation prize, under an agreement reached yesterday by House and Senate negotiators, they won Dollars 640m to close the project down and pay off its scientists ' as much as they had asked for this year to keep it alive. The supercollider was intended to take physics a step into the future by accelerating proton beams around a 54 mile oval tunnel lined with magnets, smashing them together at close to the speed of light in the hope of producing the Higgs boson, a small particle one stage beyond the quark whose existence is theorised. Around Dollars 2bn has already been spent and 14 miles of tunnel have been dug, but the supercollider's estimated completion cost had climbed rapidly from Dollars 4.4bn in 1987 to Dollars 11bn this year. Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas waged a long battle against the supercollider, made more piquant by the fact that his foes included many of the Senate's loudest proponents of budget austerity. 'I do not see how anybody can keep a straight face and talk about spending cuts, then  ..vote for the supercollider. I've got a dog with a longer memory than the US Senate,' Mr Bumpers complained. This year, however, the Congress showed more determination to come to grips with the US budget deficit. Some congressional traditions are safe, nevertheless: the House-Senate reconciliation conference on the energy and water spending bill which contained the supercollider restored to life every other project which one chamber or the other had voted to kill.</p>

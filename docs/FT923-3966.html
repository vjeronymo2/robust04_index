			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe abandons plan for second gilt future THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has abandoned plans to launch a second gilt future, following a survey of market participants which revealed a lack of confidence in the market's ability to sustain two liquid gilt contracts. Instead, Liffe has decided to amend the contract terms of its existing gilt future, in order to meet growing international demand for a contract which mirrors other European government bond futures. From the June 1993 delivery month, gilts will qualify as deliverable only if they have a maturity of 10 to 15 years and a single redemption date. The existing contract, known as the long gilt contract, is based on gilt issues which mature between 2003 and 2009. 'On balance, the market felt we should stick with what we have, but modify the structure,' said Mr Philip Bruce, head of non-equity product development at the exchange. Other European government contracts are based on 10-year bonds, which facilitates spread-trading between different European markets. Although the new contract terms specify a 10 to 15 year maturity range, in practice the future will be priced off the 10-year gilt, because the shortest maturity will be the cheapest to deliver, unless the shape of the yield curve changes. Liffe had considered introducing a second gilt futures contract - based on gilts maturing in 15 years or more - in order to meet growing demand for a means of hedging longer-dated gilts, following the launch earlier this year of new gilts maturing in 20 and 25 years. Ironically, Liffe's medium gilt contract introduced in 1987 - which was based on 10-year gilts - failed to take off and was suspended in 1990. The exchange will review the potential for the introduction of a longer-dated contract once the amended contract has established itself, but a significant boost in confidence among market participants will be needed before plans for a second contract are revived, Liffe said. The existing long gilt future has an average daily turnover of 50,000 contracts.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS HEARING ON CITYHOOD UNTIL JAN.  31  </P> <P> A judge has postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed by Malibu  cityhood supporters, who want to force the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors to set a date for an incorporation election in Malibu.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, who was to have heard final arguments in  the case today, postponed the hearing at the request of lawyers for a cityhood  opponent who said they needed more time to prepare their arguments.  </P> <P> Incorporation backers have accused the supervisors of violating a state law  that allows them 60 days from when they begin hearing the cityhood matter to  conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election. The  supervisors began the hearing Oct. 19, but later voted to postpone indefinitely  a decision on incorporation until construction permits are issued for a sewer  system the county wants built in Malibu.  </P></p>

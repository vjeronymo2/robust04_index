			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The New Patriotic Party [NPP] has appealed to the  government to keep the strictest vigilance on refugees and  exiles currently within the country's borders to ensure that  they do not violate Ghana's hospitality to the detriment of her  relationship with other countries in the West African subregion.    In a statement signed by the secretary general, Mr. J.  Agyenim Boateng, the NPP expressed concern at the ever-worsening  relations between Ghana and Togo. It said the Aflao-Lome border  bombing incident is only one of the lingering and mutually  suspicious lines of hostilities that have characterized the  relations between the two sides since the 1960's. The party  therefore urged the government to take immediate steps to arrest  this unfortunate trend and restore peace, normalcy, mutual  respect, and trust between Ghana and Togo.</p>

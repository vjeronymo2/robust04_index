			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Escobar on US murder charge THE Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar was charged with murder yesterday, in a US federal court, over the bombing of an Avianca airliner in 1989, our Foreign Staff reports. The flight was over Colombia but two US citizens were among the 110 killed. Also named in the indictments, and alleged to be the man who put a bomb on the aeroplane, was Dandeny Munoz Mosquera, reputed to be a top Escobar hitman and already held in the US after his conviction in March over illegal entry of the country. Without political change in Colombia, Escobar is unlikely to face trial in the US, although most of the 14 new charges are not directly drug-related. Last year, Colombia enacted a ban on extradition of its citizens for trial abroad, the price exacted from the government through a bombing rampage by drug cartels. Escobar remains on the run after his escape last month from jail in Colombia.</p>

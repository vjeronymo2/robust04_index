			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Russia begins trying to enforce ban on use of hard currency cash Russia today begins trying to enforce an ambitious ban on the use of hard currency cash for transactions in shops, hotels and restaurants and in other commercial transactions, writes Leyla Boulton. The ban, part of an attempt to bolster the rouble, will mean hundreds of hard-currency establishments in Moscow and elsewhere can accept only roubles, or credit cards.</p>

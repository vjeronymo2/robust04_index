			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waivers, Reductions, and Deferments of Regulatory Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory costs. Timely submission of the appropriate regulatory fee must accompany requests for waivers or reductions. This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied. The regulatory fee would be refunded later if the request is granted. Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver or reduction request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For information on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> application <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fees for common carrier services, or for information on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> application <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> regulatory <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fees for mass media, cable television, engineering and technology, field operations or private radio services, the Commission has prepared a number of informative Fee Filing Guides.

He noted  that Kuwait previously announced lifting the second- and  third-degree boycott against companies dealing with Israel.    In a statement on the sidelines of the Arab League  Ministerial Council meeting in Cairo this evening, the Kuwaiti  official said his country cannot lift the first-degree boycott  before an Arab League decision is issued in light of the  developments in the peace process.    On Kuwait's position on the Libyan-Western crisis, al-Sabah  said: We support Libya provided that the UN Security Council  resolutions are implemented. He pointed out that the embargo  against Libya was a Security Council resolution and that Kuwait  had nothing to do with its issuance.    He said he does not know what difference it will make if the  Libyan suspects are tried in Scotland or any other place.</p>

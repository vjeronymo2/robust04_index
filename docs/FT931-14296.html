			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese connection helps locals to win Russian copper contract THE RUSSIAN-dominated Udokan Mining Company has won a tender to develop the country's biggest copper deposit but Australia's BHP, the only other contender in the race, has expressed a desire to co-operate with the winner. UMC is 45 per cent owned by a Hong Kong businessman, Mr Eddie Wong, with the remaining shares held by Russia's Arter group and local geological and privatisation authorities of eastern Siberia's Chita region. Mr Wong's Chinese connections are said to have helped secure in advance a 25-year contract for UMC to sell 200,000 tonnes of concentrate a year to China, out of expected annual production of 360,000 tonnes. His stake is held through a Cyprus-registered vehicle called Chita Minerals Company. Despite a valiant effort by BHP to put together a proposal with far less time than its Russian competitor, UMC had been been expected to win for some time. This was not just because of its promise to start mining in 1997 but more importantly because it was backed by a group of Russian plants which proposed to supply most of the equipment for building the mine and accompanying infrastructure. A BHP representative was yesterday quoted in a Russian newspaper as saying his company was interested in playing a role in the project. An adviser to UMC said it was too early to comment on what this might involve. Fluor Daniel, the US firm which put together Chile's giant La Escondida copper mining project, will be the project manager. Allen &amp; Co, the private New York investment bank, will be raising finance for the Dollars 1bn-plus project. Despite the fact that six leading western mining companies dropped out of the race since it was launched last summer, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which has been advising the government on attracting foreign investment, argues its organisation of a world-class tender gave Russian authorities a better deal than had there been no competition at all. It appears at least to have succeeded in avoiding the shambles of a pioneering Russian tender for Sakhalin oil reserves, which was badly hit by political squabbling a year ago but ended with some of the losers joining the original victors. Since then, a deal with an Australian mining company for the development of the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, awarded without a tender, has become the subject of a fierce dispute over whether and on what terms it should be allowed to go ahead.</p>

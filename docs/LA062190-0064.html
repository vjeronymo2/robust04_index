			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATORS ROLL OUT PORK BARREL DESPITE BUDGET PINCH  </P> <P> Even though the state is having trouble paying its bills, it was business as  usual Wednesday when a two-house budget negotiating committee waded into the  budget problem by listening to a parade of lawmakers plead for millions in pork  barrel projects.  </P> <P> Nearly 30 Republican and Democratic lawmakers lined up to plead with the six  members of the budget conference committee for extra money for school buses,  child-care programs, new parks, museums, a wading pool, senior centers and an  assortment of other projects in their districts.  </P> <P> Just where the money would come from to pay for the projects is not clear,  although hours before the committee began its deliberations, Gov. George  Deukmejian and legislative leaders released reconciled budget figures showing  that the revenue gap is now in the range of $2.9 billion, rather than $3.6  billion.  </P> <P> Budget officials said the lower figure represents a hard number that includes  some of the budget cuts requested in January by Deukmejian. Among those are  savings in methods of purchasing drugs for state programs and delaying payment  of Medi-Cal bills next year as well as this year. Several weeks ago, state  officials revealed that the Medi-Cal program had run out of money and could not  make scheduled payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.  </P> <P> But even the $2.9-billion figure represents a huge gap, since neither  Republicans nor Democrats are giving much ground -- at least publicly.  Democrats went into the final round of budget negotiations Wednesday still  insisting on tax increases to help close the gap while Republicans were holding  fast that the problem could be solved with reduced spending.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) emerged from a private meeting with Deukmejian  and Republican leaders Wednesday morning talking about a one-year freeze on  inflation adjustments in income tax rates that would require Californians to  pay an additional $1 billion in 1990. As it is now, tax rates are adjusted for  inflation, in a procedure known as indexing, so that cost-of-living pay raises  do not result in higher tax bills.  </P> <P> During the conference committee session, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters of Los  Angeles, one of the Democratic negotiators, used the pork barrel requests as  leverage to build support for a tax increase.  </P> <P> Pointing to the shortfall, Waters asked Republican lawmakers if they would  support a tax increase to help finance the proposed $56-billion budget the  committee is working on.  </P> <P> "I am dealing with the budget with an open mind," replied Assemblyman William  J. Filante (R-Greenbrae), giving a typical answer.  </P> <P> One of Filante's requests was for $50,000 to help finance a museum to show  "preserved animals" at Petaluma High School.  </P> <P> One Republican lawmaker, Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) outlined  a list of $2.2 billion in cuts in a letter to other GOP legislators. He started  off by proposing to save $1.6 million by eliminating free cars provided to  legislators.  </P> <P> Noting that lawmaker paychecks are expected to increase because of voter  approval in the June 5 primary election of Proposition 112, which will set up a  special commission to study legislators' salaries, McClintock said: "Surely  they can pay for their own cars."  </P></p>

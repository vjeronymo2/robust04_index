			<p>BFN     [Text] There were a few surprises and many confirmations in  the new cabinet. Let us quickly run through the new members of  Silvio Berlusconi's government. Mauro Lozzi reports:    [Lozzi] Among the 25 ministers sworn in this morning before  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, there are six faces which are  completely unknown to the public at large.    The new foreign trade minister is a technocrat and his name  is Giorgio Bernini. Bernini, 66, is a commercial law professor  at the University of Bologna. An expert in arbitration, he  gained his seat in the Umbria region running on the Forza Italia  ticket.    The man in charge of the Universities and Research Ministry  is also from Forza Italia. His name is Stefano Podesta and he  is 45. He is a professor at Bocconi University in Milan, where  he teaches commercial economics. Until 30 April, he sat on the  board of the Rizzoli Publishing Company.    Altero Matteoli will be in charge at the Environment  Ministry. He is 53 and was a company director until he took  charge of the Italian Social Movement's organizational sector.  He has been a parliamentarian for a long time.    For the first time there is a woman in charge at the  Agriculture Ministry. Her name is Adriana Poli-Bortone and she  is an associated professor of Latin literature at the University  of Lecce. She had already been elected on an Italian Social  Movement ticket, and in past legislation has espoused the causes  of pension rights, the education system, and women's issues.    Roberto Radice was elected on a Forza Italia ticket and will  be in charge of the Public Works Ministry. He is a businessman  and a member of the executive board of the National  Confederation of Small Manufacturers [Confapi]. He is new to  parliament.    Finally we have Antonio Guidi. He is 49, and a surgeon.  Guidi will leave a trade union background to take charge of the  Family Ministry. Guidi himself is handicapped, and while he was  at the Italian General Confederation of Labor he was  particularly concerned with the issue of employment for the  disabled.</p>

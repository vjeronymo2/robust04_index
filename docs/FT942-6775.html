			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Red Star searches again for a buyer Red Star, British Rail's express parcels company, was put up for sale for a second time yesterday after a reorganisation intended to make it more attractive to bidders, Charles Batchelor writes. The company was first offered for sale almost a year ago, but no satisfactory buyer was found. It has since shed 350 staff and is dropping two of its slower services. Red Star failed to find a buyer because of its large losses - Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 43m in 1993. The streamlining of its operations will not entirely eliminate the loss, it said yesterday. It is the only UK parcels carrier to use the rail network and has more than 200 outlets, mostly in or near stations. Final bids must be made by July 31, with the aim of completing a sale by the end of September. Red Star is to focus on its same-day service and its 9am and 10.30am next-day services. It will drop from today its noon and 5.30pm next-day services.</p>

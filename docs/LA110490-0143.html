Michael Jackson  swigged it during his "Thriller" tour. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has it  imported to his palace.  </P> <P> And the trainer of racehorse great Secretariat used it to water the legendary  beast. So it was only a matter of time before L.A.'s glitterati began demanding  the elite Mountain Valley Spring Water, which can now be delivered to your  door.  </P> <P> Carbon-dating has revealed that the ancient artesian spring in Arkansas began  producing water 3,500 years ago, and that the water now reaching the surface  fell as rain in 1500 BC.

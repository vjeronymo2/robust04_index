			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani by </F> journalists Mauricio Funes, Ricardo Chavarria, Aida Farrar,  Norma Jimenez, Salvador Castellanos, and an unidentified  moderator at the Canal Cuatro Television studios in San Salvador  -- live]    [Excerpts] [Moderator] The first question will be asked by  Mr. Funes.    [Funes] Good evening, Mr. President. I have been given one  minute to ask a question on a complex subject. From a political  viewpoint, crime -- in particular, organized crime -- has been  regarded as one of the problems with the greatest impact in the  country. Why does one get the impression that your government  and the new National Civilian Police [PNC] are powerless to  check and break up organized crime? Do you and your government  know what forces lie behind organized crime, which make it  possible for crime to operate in blatant impunity? So far, no  investigations have made any significant progress. Also, the  people are concerned. My specific questions are these: What has  the government done and what is it doing to check organized  crime, although the government appears to be powerless? What  forces are at work in this problem to the extent that the  opposition could be right in saying there must be a relationship  between organized crime and the government, considering the  impunity of criminals?    [Cristiani] Good evening to all. Mauricio, I think we should  first define the nature of the problem, crime, and our situation  as a country. There are a number of causes to this problem. In  our country, several factors come to mind: 1) we are in a  postwar period; 2) the country's economic and social situation;  3) the world situation, which has much to do with communications  and the situation to which children, young people, and adults  are exposed. We will have to tackle the problem at its roots.    Organized crime, as you described it, is made up of  individuals who are used to and know how to operate in a climate  of violence. This is to say, they are used to handling arms.  They live in a world of their own. This could play a  significant role in making criminals. In addition, the peace  agreements led to the disbanding of three public security  organizations and the creation of the PNC. I must say that, if  an agreement is not achieved in this area, we could hardly have  peace.    There also has been much to say about the government's  inability to effectively confront rising criminal activity. We  believe that as result of the armed conflict, the country's  security apparatus was more prepared to deal with a military  type situation -- in other words, military strategy as opposed  to criminal strategy. In this respect, there was a need to  create a new body that would adapt to the country's new public  security reality -- a new security body with modern specialized  training, not only capable of repressing criminal activity but  also with programs to prevent it, as well as having the ability  to confront other forms of criminal activity. So far, the PNC  has not yet reached its full potential. Logically, we cannot  yet expect this organization to perform at its full potential.    Currently, the PNC is being deployed throughout the country.  I would even dare say that the PNC deployment has brought about  some positive changes. In effect, we have been able to see some  improvement mainly because of the training the agents must go  through at the National Public Security Academy, and also  because the PNC is better equipped than the current National  Guard [GN].    In this respect, I believe the fight against criminal  activity is in the process of being solved. Also, improvement  in investigation techniques into every aspect of organized crime  is already showing results. I would not agree with those  criticis who say that no cases have yet been solved.    Lately there have been cases in which Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front [FMLN] members have been murdered.  These cases have been followed by a campaign in which death  squads are mentioned, or it is reported illegal armed groups are  committing murder for political reasons. Aside from receiving  information from the PNC Criminal Investigation Division,  formerly the Criminal Investigation Commission, I should note  that the Heleno Castro murder case, as well as the one involving  the FMLN representative in San Jorge, has practically been  solved. In short, special treatment was given to these cases.  We have also implemented the so-called joint working group to  find if politically motivated illegal armed groups do exist.    Also, there are other matters related to organized crime,  such as vehicle thefts. Lately we have been able to see  increased efficiency in recovering stolen vehicles.  Investigations into vehicle thefts are showing other links that  we must also investigate if we are to destroy the entire vehicle  theft network. With respect to drugs, I cannot recall any other  period in which we have been able to disrupt such large drug  shipments such as those disrupted over the past year. I believe  this is another type of dangerous organized crime-related  activity operating in the country.    I believe the PNC is not yet operating at its full  potential. This is something which is going to take some time  until we can really witness a complete and competent PNC. To  expedite the presence of the PNC, officers are trained six  months versus one year, which is the normal training period of  other public security academies. This is because of the urgent  need to deploy those forces. In addition, costs are high and  pose limitations. Some people have asked why 10,000 policemen  cannot be deployed. The reason is that it costs 60,000 colones  to train and equip each PNC member. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Ricardo Chavarria from TPS news is next.    [Chavarria] [passage omitted] In your 1 January 1989  inaugural address, you talked about four guiding principles:  liberty, honesty, reality, and security. I would like to refer  to the honesty principle. At that time you said this: To  eradicate the scourge of corruption, which angers Salvadorans so  much, and for public property to be managed with utmost honesty,  our commitment is clear and unalterable. We invite the people  to support us by being vigilant, as well as with their  constructive and patriotic criticism.    Nevertheless, it is now being noted that corruption has not  been eradicated. On the contrary, the Salvadoran people are  asking how many members of the past two administrations are in  jail. Also, they are asking where are your party members who  are, according to the public, involved in corruption.  Specifically, I am member of a Chamber of Commerce committee,  and there is much talk about Social Security as well as the  public construction projects.    [Cristiani] First of all, I believe government corruption  must be evaluated from two viewpoints -- not only two  viewpoints, but two types of corruption. The first type  involves the corruption of an official -- in other words,  corruption by high government officials. Then we have another  type of corruption which is a more institutional.    The people have mentioned specific cases, such as the  Customs  Department, traffic police, immigration, and so on. In terms of  corruption of public officials, as relates to the question of  the whereabouts of the members of the past administration, I can  say there were three or four cases of corruption. There is even  the case of one official where an arrest warrant has been  issued; he, however, is not in the country. This is an example  of a trial which has lasted a long time. In our opinion it has  taken too long to be resolved. In addition, this same trial has  blocked any possibility of rebuilding the well-known Carretera  de Oro.    In terms of this administration's high government officials,  we have already filed charges against two people. In this  respect, we have tried to be very straightforward. Every  government official was summoned to a meeting at the Presidency,  and we appointed a commission tasked with undertaking audits to  every state organization.    It is quite easy to criticize corruption from outside the  government, and yet it is another thing to understand what is  actually taking place. One cannot simply send someone to jail  just to please someone who likes to make a lot of noise and stir  things up. The bottom line is that charges must first be proven  if we expect to send someone to jail. In this respect, the  audits undertaken did not find sufficient merit to file suit  against any high-level official, except in one case which was  sent to court. I understand that, unfortunately, the person in  question is no longer under arrest. I am referring to the case  of (Lamba).    Nevertheless, we have been able to ascertain that what is  required at this level is, first of all, to try to  professionalize, or at least give more leeway to, the Accounts  Court to carry out its duties. Most of all, it is the Supreme  Court of Justice's Ethics Office which is responsible for  ensuring that corruption does not take place.    In all the auditing that has been performed, some problems  have been detected in Social Security in terms of the bids that  are granted. There is a case involving a ghost company, which  is in the hands of the judicial authorities. It is under  investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division at the  judicial level. There has been a lot of talk about bids in  other cases. Some problems have occurred in the bidding,  because perhaps that is where we have zealously guarded against  irregularities.    In none of the accusations regarding the bid allocations has  there been proof or evidence of corruption on the part of high-  ranking officials. I personally know almost all the  high-ranking officials, I mean from before the political  campaign, and I can say there were proved to be honest even  before they came into the government.    In this sense, we have tried to act very firmly, but also  trying not to make mistakes. Obviously it is easy to blame a  person, but it is something else to prove charges. The other  part, which is the institutional part, perhaps is a bit more  delicate, because there is never evidence. For instance, when  someone gives a kickback to a policeman, how can you prove it,  unless you go and make the charge. If someone charges a traveler  $100 to put a seal on a passport, who can denounce it?    There was one peculiar case in which somebody did say  something to a policeman at the airport. The person was  dismissed from his post, and his fellow companions who were  opposed to his removal almost went on strike. We believe the  institutional problem should be resolved. That was perhaps the  fundamental recommendation made by the commission that we  created.    The state must be modernized, especially state controls.  Public officials should not be allowed to act arbitrarily,  because that is where citizens take advantage of the situation  to get a kickback, commission, or whatever. Steps are being  taken. Immigration entry points are free. Land immigration is  implementing a virtually free entrance at Comalapa Airport,  where customs regulations are being modified so that there will  be a sworn statement and so that this sort of corruption will  not exist. The PNC is trying to train good policemen who are  incorruptible.    Moreover, there is another thing for which we cannot blame  the state. I always hear about corruption and the corruptor.  Unfortunately, we have reached a stage in our country where  moral values have greatly deteriorated. The thinking that  prevails is this: If I do not do it, I will not be able to  compete because my competitors do it. In turn, a serious  problem has been created. There could be drastic solutions, as  they are called. We could remove all immigration personnel and  all treasury policemen, but we do not think this is the way to  do it. Soon there will be not only changes in regulations, but  also laws to strengthen them, reducing chances for corruption.    [Chavarria] You said three kinds of arrests have been  carried out by the government, and two or three people have been  fired on this occasion. To satisfy many Salvadorans who insist  corruption still prevails, what will happen concerning the cases  presented by the commission? Will this be a problem for the  next government, or will this come out in the open and the  culprits sent to trial before you leave?    [Cristiani] We have sent certain cases to the National Audit  Office; other cases have been sent directly to the Attorney  General's Office, and still others have been sent to the PNC  Criminal Investigations Division. The social security case was  perhaps the most obvious. Cases like these are directly sent  for a judicial investigation. The case sent to the National  Audit Office.... [pauses] The National Audit Office is able to  conduct what you might call an investigation.    You must remember that the commission members did not  conduct  a criminal investigation, though. They conducted an audit,  searching for evidence, because the truth is that a corrupt  person never leaves evidence, unless he is truly inept or unless  his brain does not function very well. In cases of corruption  you seldom find the evidence; for example, no receipts are  issued when commissions are paid, or anything like that. The  idea is to conduct an audit and find something that will allow  you to send someone to court. People have been sent to court in  cases where we have found evidence, both involving officials  from the previous administration and--I repeat-- two in our  administration.    [Cardenal] Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you, Mr. President.  The third question goes to Mrs. Aida Farrar of Channel 6  Television's "The Newscast."    [Farrar] Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. I have a  more specific question, but it is nevertheless of great interest  to the Salvadoran people, always dealing with crime issues. It  is said production groups in the country's eastern sector have  publicly requested deployment of the Armed Forces as a measure  to fight crime. What is your position on this issue?    [Cristiani] First of all, the Constitution of the Republic  authorizes the use of the Armed Forces in special situations,  let us say in times of crisis when it is necessary to settle  something during a short term; then they return to their normal  functions.    First of all, to deploy the Armed Forces and authorize them  to investigate, prosecute, capture, and send criminals to court  would cause two problems: One, we would be somehow  contradicting constitutional norms; two, soldiers are not  exactly trained to play a role in public security. They are  trained in a completely different area. They do not know how to  handle certain cases; for example, they do not know what to do  in case of a traffic accident. Consequently, we would be  involving personnel who are not trained to perform a complex  task.    We think the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role;  meaning, they can perform their military exercises in broad  daylight, using roads where most of these incidents occur. In  our opinion, the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role, and  this does not violate the Constitution, because--even if they  find someone involved in a criminal action at a given moment--we  must remember that the Constitution also authorizes a citizen's  arrest. This can be done by anyone who finds a person en  flagrante delicto. We do not believe it is beneficial to  authorize personnel who are not adequately trained in public  security techniques to carry out these tasks, not to mention the  doubts regarding the constitutional provisions.    [Farrar] Thank you very much.    [Cardenal] Thank you. The fourth question is asked by Miss  Norma Jimenez of Channel 4.    [Jimenez] Mr. President, I will be brief. What was the most  difficult decision you had to adopt during your term, meaning, a  political decision that was extremely difficult to adopt, and  why?    [Cristiani] I believe the most difficult decision was  adopted  late in 1989 concerning the advisability of continuing a  negotiation process. I think--speaking for myself and the  government level--we felt betrayed by the FMLN's [Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front] attitude, because it had signed  an agreement and then planned an offensive that caused so much  bloodshed and destruction; nevertheless, the decision we have  adopted was to continue the negotiation process, because we were  convinced it was the only way to achieve a long-term solution,  while the opposite meant we would have to face a conflict for a  much longer time, with the consequences this would entail for  the country and the people. We now believe the correct decision  was adopted even though you may recall the feedback we received  from an extremely large number of groups was that we could not  talk with people who even betrayed a process that had recently  started. [passage omitted]    [Farrar] Do you believe the FMLN is prepared to govern our  country?    [Cristiani] The truth is, regarding economic matters, I do  not know their programs, but what does cause concern is that the  FMLN was a group that had a Marxist-Leninist ideology. After  the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, and the  Soviet Union itself breaks up and accepts the failure of that  statist ideology, the FMLN is logically going through an  adaptation process. It is leaving that ideology and saying it no  longer believes that ideology and that it now believes in other  types of economic policies.    We have already heard someone who is a social democrat; we  have heard of much support for private enterprise, whereas we  know that its basic ideology was essentially anti-private  enterprise.    Now the question is whether there is a tendency to  improvise,  because I am no longer sure of what they really believe. I  believed in something, and now the circumstances have made me  change; the question is, how much flexibility will they have  regarding economic matters? [passage omitted]    Exports have doubled over the past five years, despite the  low price of coffee, sugar, cotton, and other products. It is  not true that there is no development policy or that it has  failed. I would not say that doubling exports in five years, in  four and one-half years of government, is a failure. [passage  omitted]    We had the largest harvests in history concerning cereals.  In coffee, we had the largest harvest in 1992 since 1979; in  sugar, last year's harvest was the largest in history. There  are approximately 150,000 new manzanas that are already being  used for agricultural production.    The Agricultural Development Bank [BFA] has doubled the  amounts of granted credit over these five years, despite the  fact that its finances have been reorganized. BFA credit is for  small producers, and if it has been doubled, we cannot speak of  a lack of attention to the small- and medium-size producers of  the agricultural sector.    Certain problems have arisen regarding the credit problems  that some producers--particularly the producers of the eastern  area, which was the most devastated--still had once the conflict  ended. We have tried to solve the problem. We have issued a  specific decree to provide them with a line of credit; we have  eliminated all of the accrued interests, and the interests to  pay were recalculated at a lower rate, thus eliminating the  capitalization of banks as their loans became overdue. We have  stopped all the embargoes and so on. We have tried to help all  of them; there may be some that perhaps do not even have the  monetary capability to solve their economic problems. It is  regrettable, and one understands and sympathizes with them.    The government cannot help a company that has gone bankrupt,  however; in other words, the government cannot go bankrupt.  There are things that can be done and others that we cannot do.    I believe the main problem is prices, particularly of our  export products. In that regard, the government can only do  with coffee exports as we have been doing. On the other hand,  the problem of profitability in the agricultural sector is not  due to the lack of facilities; it is because the international  price of products is low. A government cannot subsidize low  prices in the agricultural sector. The agriculture sector in  our country will have to be updated. We cannot separate the  agricultural and livestock sector from globalization or economic  openings. We cannot lend a specific sector a hand by  subsidizing it. Someone has to pay for these subsidies. If the  other sectors are not subsidized, we cannot make an exception  with this sector.    I admire Ulises Gonzalez very much, because he is probably  one of the few who has carried out this struggle without owing a  cent. I question the attitude of others who have come forward  shouting things, but I regard Gonzalez as an honest person, a  man of principles. As I said, he has been fighting for a more  flexible decree. He has discussed the matter with the Central  Bank president many times. What we must realize, however, is  that the government cannot subsidize any sector. When prices  are low, farmers must create their own mechanisms to face the  situation. This applies to all economic sectors.    I believe we have done much in the agricultural sector, from  privatizing commercial activities--particularly with coffee and  sugar--to offering more credits to the small and medium  producers. As for investments, according to statistics from the  Central Bank two out of every three credits are given to small  or medium enterprises; in other words, we cannot say that small  and medium enterprises are not receiving help. [passage omitted]    [Passage omitted] [Cardenal] The fourth question is by  Mauricio Funes of Channel 2.    [Funes] Thank you. I am going back to a response you gave to  my colleague. You said the increase in imports stimulates  exports in the long run. The problem is that we have had an  increase in imports based on foreign currency that was not  generated by the country's own capability, no matter how many  times one hears that Salvadorans living abroad are still  Salvadorans and that this is a domestic effort.    Analysts concur that the 5-percent growth the government  announced at the end of 1993 was based on the number of  remittances sent from relatives and foreign aid. This aid is  decreasing, as the U.S. Government announced recently. Can the  country keep on supporting itself on what economists refer to as  fragile bases for economic growth?    Given that we have been unable to stimulate exports as a  source of foreign currency, we continue to depend on remittances  sent from relatives abroad and foreign aid. Although you said  dependence on other countries has been reduced, we continue to  depend on the remittances of relatives and foreign aid to  sustain economic growth. Wouldn't we have to redesign the model  implemented so far?    As Anep [National Association of Private Enterprise] has  constantly suggested, the state must become modern and create an  adequate policy to promote exports so that growth can take place  on solid bases, not on what is called fragile bases.    [Cristiani] I think this is an axiom one reads in economic  texts, or at least I did when I went to university. One  ingredient in promoting exports is to eliminate all import  problems and barriers. You said the dollars coming in from  abroad are contributing to the trade deficit. That is true, but  the contribution is decreasing all the time.    I am going to repeat my answer to the previous question.  Would you consider it a failure to have tripled exports in the  country in a period of four and one-half years? This happened,  despite the price of coffee. The price of coffee.... [pauses]  When we know the bases that will help us determine whether  exports have doubled.... [pauses] We are talking about a rather  considerable export, namely, coffee. There has been growth in  nontraditional products. I am asking if this is truly a  failure or if we are headed on the right course. Granted, we  have not closed the gap yet, but nothing happens overnight. If  the model is mistaken or the program to boost exports is wrong,  how are we to account for the fact that exports based on  nontraditional products doubled in four and one-half years,  considering we had a war going in three of those years, and we  did not have the economic drive we now have, given the  insecurity aspect is out of the picture. [passage omitted]    [Castellanos] Our economy is growing, but I wonder when  will this growth reach me personally. At the beginning of this  government, much was said about the economy overflowing and  cascading down onto the people. People are saying, however, the  benefits stay at the upper layers of society and never reach the  lower ones. The following question has been asked a thousand  times: If the economic and macroeconomic indexes are so  encouraging and promising, why does a large segment of the  population still live in extreme poverty?    [Cristiani] I wonder what the moderator would say. I could  answer your question, although by doing so we would go fully  into the social aspect of the situation. We could speak about  social development, which works for the good of the Salvadoran  people.    [Cardenal] Mr. President, we will have to leave this answer  for the social portion of the conference, because we are  somewhat behind schedule; nevertheless, we appreciate these  questions. We will now move on to the third and last block,  which deals with social aspects, and we will broach health,  education, housing, poverty, employment, and the family. Again,  we would like to remind our distinguished guest journalists  about the need to keep their remarks as brief as possible due to  time; this request is also extended to the president, although  we know it is difficult to sum up certain types of subject  matter. Ricardo Chavarria will ask the first question in this  block.    [Chavarria] It will be easy for me, because I will only  expand on Castellanos' question. The Christian Democratic Party  did us a favor by faxing nearly everything for us. The planning  minister has told us extreme poverty has been reduced by just  one percent. Castellanos spoke about an appeal to reduce poverty  even further. Laborers, secretaries, and plant workers share a  common trait. They are no longer taking lunch. They are content  with a snack. At the most, this can be regarded as a double  breakfast. This is a serious sign that people at present cannot  afford to pay seven, eight, or 15 colones for lunch plus a bus  ride. My specific question is whether you have been working for  the poor among the poor. A 1-percent reduction has been the  result [words indistinct].    [Cristiani] I would like first to say that someone lives in  extreme poverty when he receives no income whatsoever. The most  important thing is to begin by helping those who possess the  least. Those who have a job are better off than those who have  nothing and, in addition, have no income.    Approximately 150,000 new jobs have been created. These jobs  are determined by observing both the number of people who pay  quotas to the Social Security Fund and statistics. This figure  is the number of jobs for which have been accounted. This means  150,000 people can no longer be regarded as extremely poor.  Regardless of the accuracy of your figures, it would be  necessary to determine how many people are jobless and how many  of them are now employed. In this regard, I quote John Paul II,  who says the problem of extreme poverty will not be solved if  production is not established and if jobs are not created. It  is also necessary to talk about the standard of living; that is,  the care of the people. We can mention several indexes. The  United Nations has certain parameters to measure a society's  standard of living. One is life expectancy, which statistically  has improved from 57 to 65 years. [passage omitted]    In the health sector, the budget has increased from  approximately 300 million to a little more than 700 million  colones. More and more, we have been using our own resources,  not foreign resources. This refutes the person out there who  says we still depend on foreign resources. The fact that we  succeeded in lowering our imports from 24 to 9 percent indicates  foreign assistance is becoming less and less.    Figures taken out of context, without analyzing the state  budget or state investment situation as a whole, may not  suitably mirror the general situation. [passage omitted]    Since the beginning of the administration, the trend has  been  a reduction of budget investments in the nonsocial sector and an  increase in the budget percentage apportioned to the social  sector; that is, the percentage of investments in the social  sector is growing, and this trend should continue. [passage  omitted]    Adjustment policies are required only when there are  distortions. I am sure the next government will not need  adjustment policies. It will simply have to be responsible in  handling economic activities and public finances. We have  resolved the problem for the next government. We are the ones  who had to shock treat economic distortions due to the economic  mess to which the country had been led. Had we not implemented  that policy at that moment, we could have had inflationary  levels similar to those in certain South American countries.    Nicaragua [words indistinct] has had inflation levels of  three digits. I think surgery is performed when there is an  illness. Once there is health, why perform surgery?    All that has to be done now is to continue acting in a  responsible fashion and to manage government finances free of  demagoguery.    Our economic policy is not a simple structural adjustments  program. No. The fact that at a given moment we had to make  structural changes due to distortions does not mean this is our  economic policy. Our economic policy is based on a social  market economy, the honest handling of public finances, and the  development of exports. These are not adjustments but efforts  to develop the country.

Deputy Foreign Minister  Carlos Cordero expressed surprise over the statement by Senator  Helms, who accused the Panamanian Government of seizing assets  of U.S. citizens. Cordero said the Panamanian Government will  ask Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador to the United States,  to send information regarding the Republican senator's  statements in an effort to clarify the situation.    [Begin recording] [Cordero] The Foreign Ministry has heard  nothing about any seizures whatsoever. Nevertheless, we have  asked Jaime Ford, our ambassador to the United States, to send  us the transcripts of the statements made by Senator Helms in  order that we can examine them.    [Unidentified reporter] Have you asked the U.S. Embassy in  Panama for additional information to clarify this situation?    [Cordero] If deemed appropriate, and if the U.S. Embassy has  any information which might shed some light on this situation,  we will consider making such a request. [end recording]    According to the diplomat, Panama is interested in knowing  the source of Helms' information.    [Begin Cordero recording] We want to examine his statement  carefully and determine the source of the information he has  disclosed before the U.S. Senate. [end recording]</p>

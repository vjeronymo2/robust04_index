			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson The 5 per cent rise in Kleinwort Benson's shares yesterday is an obvious mark of relief at its lower provisions. The rest of the story, though, is not particularly reassuring, least of all the Pounds 13.6m exceptional prior year tax charge. Kleinwort rightly asserts that this is a one-off accounting item. It is simply moving a tax loss off its balance sheet. The credit will now be carried forward as a contingent asset, making no difference to the amount of tax it actually pays or to cash flow. But the change in treatment suggests the credit should never have been on the balance sheet at all, something that has taken Kleinwort's management years to correct. Given the bank's strategic problems, one might have hoped for more precision. Return on capital is not inspiring. Even without the exceptional tax charge, net return on shareholders' funds is less than 9 per cent. It is difficult to see where growth will come from, especially since Kleinwort has been losing market share in mergers and acquisitions. Kleinwort may be lucky with the markets. It had a good year both in gilts and treasury business. But growth needs a more secure foundation than privatising Argentine utilities. Some surplus capital could be put towards acquiring additional fund management business, though that would mean a hefty goodwill charge. A better idea might be for Kleinwort to give shareholders back some money by again buying its shares in the market.</p>

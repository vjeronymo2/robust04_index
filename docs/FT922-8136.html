			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Companies act to exploit upturn MANY MANUFACTURING companies have acted during the recession to take advantage of an economic upturn which is already under way, according to a survey published yesterday by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm. The Gallup survey of 450 of Britain's biggest manufacturers shows that most have implemented cost-reduction programmes and have speeded up the introduction of new products. They have also invested more in new production processes, increased export business and improved delivery times. In spite of figures suggesting manufacturing investment has fallen during the recession, the survey shows that more than two thirds of manufacturers have maintained or increased the cash value of capital-investment programmes. More than a third of companies expect to have more employees in training within three years, and a quarter report that they are training more people than in 1989. Only 12 per cent of companies surveyed suggest that poor relationships with their workforces are affecting performance. Coopers says the survey provides evidence that many of the factors which contributed to the decline of manufacturing in the past decade are being reversed. It says manufacturing is making significant advances across all sectors. The survey also highlights some of the continuing problems which have weakened performance. It shows short-term attitudes on the development of businesses still prevail, with only one in 15 companies making any business plans for more than five years ahead, in contrast to Japanese competitors, which plan up to 25 years ahead. Nearly half of the companies surveyed cited Britain's 'roller-coaster' economy as an obstacle, while three quarters blamed high interest rates. Made in the UK.

THE GOVERNMENT must change its attitude to manufacturing if British industry is to prosper, according to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pump manufacturer, James Buxton writes. Its policies of the 1980s aimed at making Britain a post-industrial economy by fostering the growth of services were misguided, Mr Garrick said in his 1992 Engineering Manufacturing Forum lecture in Glasgow yesterday. He added: 'The most successful economies in terms of growth of gross domestic product also have the strongest manufacturing industries.' He wanted better policies for export credits, overseas aid and the Pounds 5bn the government spends on research. He said he was not seeking interventionist policies. British manufacturing had improved its performance substantially in the 1980s and now needed to regain ground lost to imported equipment.</p>

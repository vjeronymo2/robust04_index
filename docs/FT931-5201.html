			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Sport: Lion rampant v Lion passant - Rugby THERE IS much more at stake at Twickenham this afternoon than whether Scotland can beat England in the 100th Calcutta Cup match between them and win the Triple Crown of the Five Nations championship. The sub-text is this: which of the two captains, Gavin Hastings of Scotland and Will Carling of England, has the better game? The one who comes out on top is likely to be named captain of the British Lions when the party to tour New Zealand is announced later this month. When the championship started in January, Carling was clear favourite. He had led England to victory in 24 of 31 matches. Under him, England had won two successive grand slams, were favourites to win a third, and had reached the final of the 1991 World Cup. Carling, just 27, seemed to have it all going for him. Hastings, on the other hand, was the newly-appointed leader of Scotland following the retirement of David Sole. After 41 appearances for his country, during which he had scored 10 tries and nearly 400 points, his abilities as a player were not in doubt. But he was untested as an international captain. How things change. England scraped home against France and then blew their grand slam chance by losing to Wales at Cardiff. Suddenly, doubts were raised about both the England team and Carling's suitability to lead the Lions. While this was going on, Scotland and Hastings thumped Ireland, lost narrowly in Paris and then trounced Wales. Hastings, who missed five kicks out of six against France, landed five penalties against Wales. Carling and Hastings are bachelors, dashing and fearsome men who play rugby as if to a script by John Buchan. Hastings thunders in from full back as often as he can, relishing the opportunity to throw his 15-stone frame at the opposition. Carling is lighter on his feet (he weighs just over 14 stone), very fast over 20 metres and has the upper body strength of a wrestler. Hastings, who is three years older and was first capped in 1986, one year before Carling, has captained almost every team he has played in - Watson's College, Cambridge University, London Scottish, the Barbarians. But, then, so has Carling - Sedbergh school, England Schools, Durham University. When it comes to deciding the captaincy of the Lions, two voices will carry special weight. The first is that of Ian McGeechan, the Scottish coach who also will coach the tourists. 'Gavin is very confident and very secure and positive in what he is trying to do,' says McGeechan. 'Temperamentally, he is very sound. Because of his size, he is someone we can work off. He can join the line well but, most of all, he is good under the high ball. He has an outstanding reputation world-wide; and if there is one thing he has done well this season, it is to draw the new players in with the old players. 'I was pleased about that. I thought he was the right sort of person for the role of captain, but there were those who said that he was not very impressive as a club captain and, therefore, wondered why he should be made captain of his country. 'To my mind, captaining one's club and one's country are two very different jobs and I did not think you would know how he would respond until he was given the job. His performances this year have got progressively better.' Carling was first appointed captain when he was 22 and the youngest member of the England team. It is easy to imagine the shafts of scorn that were directed his way by some of the experienced forwards. Carling, after all, was a fresh-faced squirt: public school, middle-class, officer material and, to cap it all, a back, someone who did not get his knees dirty or soil his hands. He had to win his spurs with some of the hard-nosed members of his team and Paul Ackford, the former England second-row forward, suggested as much when he said not so long ago: 'Will is a good captain now.' The implication was that, once, he was not. Carling's good looks, his success and his ability to generate money have unleashed the green-eyed monster in many. You could say that Carling is too smooth by three-quarters. He has, however, a remarkable record. 'He is the most successful captain in international rugby,' says Geoff Cooke, the England team chief who will manage the Lions. Cooke was responsible for making Carling skipper in 1988, and has said it was one of the best decisions he ever made. But he admitted: 'Eyebrows were raised at the time. He was a newcomer to the team but we were looking for continuity. We had lost several captains in quick succession and we wanted someone who would hold his place. 'Rob Andrew was one candidate. Dean Richards was another and perhaps Brian Moore as well. We looked at them all and came up with Will. He has to be able to handle the off-the-field stuff as well.' McGeechan and Cooke agree that a captain 'must have credibility among the players' (to use McGeechan's phrase) - something which has not always been the case on Lions' tours. 'You cannot earn respect as a captain unless you first of all have it as a captain,' says Cooke. So, will it be Carling or Hastings for the Lions? The choice is unenviable. The sole blessing is that, for once, British rugby has two such good players and captains from which to choose.</p>

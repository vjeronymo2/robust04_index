			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, March 6, IRNA -- Secretary General of the  Revolutionary Fatah Movement, Abu-Musa [Colonel Sa'id Musa  Muragha] said here that the international Qods [Jerusalem] day  is the manifestation of the Muslim ummah's true power in  confronting the Israeli hegemony.    Abu-Musa told IRNA in an interview that Palestinian  combatants who always confront compromising plans, follow the  path of Imam Khomeyni and will continue their struggle until the  freedom of the Holy Qods. The role the Islamic revolution of  Iran plays in countering the Zionist conspiracies has caused the  world arrogance to adopt anti-Iran stands, he noted.    Muslim nations today, under the auspices of Imam Khomeyni's  teachings, have realised that the U.S. and Israel are their  major enemies, Abu-Musa remarked. He urged Islamic and national  forces to resist against the U.S. and Israeli conspiracies and  not let the Zionists rule the region.    Abu-Musa said the last Friday's massacre by the Zionist  forces of Muslim worshippers in al-Khalil [Hebron] was the  natural consequence of 'Arafat-Rabin agreement.</p>

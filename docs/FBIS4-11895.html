			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 2 April (SUNA) -- Foreign Minister  Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih made a press statement today regarding  the statement by Madeleine Albright, a U.S. envoy, on Sudan.  The U.S. statement was issued in Addis Ababa on 1 April.    The foreign minister said that Sudan, on the basis of its  overall national strategy, had striven to establish some kind of  normal and warm relations with the United States through  dialogue, a system adopted by the revolution. Dr. Abu-Salih  said that the Sudanese Government had sent numerous letters  concerning dialogue between Sudan and the United States, and had  addressed correspondence to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher. There were talks in November 1992, and in August  1993. He said that the U.S. Government had, without any  preliminaries, placed Sudan on the list of states which fostered  terrorism -- without any evidence.    His excellency made it clear that Sudan had earlier, four  months before the declaration, received notification that it had  been placed on the list of states under supervision, but not as  a state fostering terrorism.    The foreign minister stated that Sudan had welcomed  Madeleine  Albright's visit to confirm the revolution's intention to attain  good relations. He pointed out that the president of the  Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, held a 70-minute  meeting with Mrs. Albright, the U.S. envoy. It was a  responsible and frank dialogue and a start to serious dialogue.  Dr. Abu-Salih added: We do not know the reasons for Albright's  statement in Addis Ababa, or why it was not made in Khartoum.    His excellency denied what was said in Albright's statement  in Addis Ababa. He said that what she said about the issue of  peace in Sudan confirmed what was known by the government and  people of Sudan: That the war had been imposed on them, as well  as the fact that Sudan was striving in all seriousness with the  goal of reaching peace to stop everything that fanned the war.  He said that Sudan wanted peace. Moreover, Sudan had  communicated to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development [IGADD] states its adherence to their initiative,  and to making it a successful initiative.    Dr. Abu-Salih said that the IGADD states should know that  there were obstructions to the peace process from certain  quarters, which back the rebels with weapons, ammunition, and  money, and which want the fragmentation of Sudan and the  promotion of war.    With regard to Albright's comment that Sudan was obstructing  relief operations, Dr. Abu-Salih said that her comment in this  regard was strange, pointing out that Sudan had concluded many  agreements with many quarters, including the Operation Lifeline,  which was considered a model for providing relief supplies. He  said that Sudan was satisfied with the commendation it received  from the third committee three months ago. That committee had  praised Sudan's role in conveying food to the famine victims and  the needy.    As to Albright's remarks about terrorism, Dr. Abu-Salih  said:  We ask the U.S. Administration to provide evidence for these  accusations and to remove the name of Sudan from the list of  countries fostering terrorism. [passage omitted]    As to what Albright said about Sudan's violation of human  rights, Abu-Salih said: We in Sudan believe in human rights on  the basis of the tenets of our religion, and we do not need  directions from anyone on good conduct. The U.S. Administration  should present its authority on this. He said that Sudan had  records of human rights violations in a number of states,  including Israel and the United States, and was ready to provide  evidence concerning this.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPER LOSING STREAK TIES CLUB RECORD AT 19; DAILEY GETS SUSPENSION  </P> <P> There were more losses Monday for the Clippers, first one of their best players  and then the game, the latter coming because of another awful second half. All  in all, an average night at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> More vanishing acts might happen as soon as Wednesday, when the Clippers will  be in danger of breaking the franchise record of 19 consecutive defeats. The  Clippers tied that record, not to mention the fourth-worst losing streak in  National Basketball Assn. history, Monday by losing to the Dallas Mavericks,  129-111, before a crowd of 9,377.  </P> <P> Next up on the Clippers' hit (and miss) parade is the Houston Rockets, a team  the Clippers lost to Jan. 26. If they lose the Wednesday game, they will have  equaled the all-time league record for consecutive losses in the same season.  Philadelphia holds that one at 20, set in 1972-73.  </P> <P> After that, there is plenty of room to sink still lower. The all-time  consecutive losers, in order:  </P> <P>  -- Cleveland's 24 straight defeats, 19 games to end the 1981-82 season and  five to start 1982-83.  </P> <P>  -- Detroit's 21 straight defeats, 14 to end the 1979-80 season and seven to  start 1980-81.  </P> <P> "We don't talk about it, but you know it's there," Coach Don Casey said. "It's  like a disease you have and you don't want to talk about it. But you have to  find a cure."  </P> <P> Any such revelations will have to come without Quintin Dailey, the Clippers'  leading scorer, who before the game was suspended indefinitely because of  excessive weight. Needless to say, his timing in falling badly out of shape  could have been better.  </P> <P> The Clippers lost the game in the third quarter, when they converted a 63-62  deficit with 9 minutes left into a 95-77 burial. Dallas outscored them, 41-18,  and hit 14 of 18 shots from the field compared with the Clippers' 7 of 23.  </P> <P> It was never close again.  </P> <P> But the night had gone bad for the Clippers (10-36) before he game even  started. Dailey's suspension, with pay, was the fitting opener.  </P> <P> Dailey, averaging 17 points a game and shooting 48.6% from the field, topping  his previous career best of 45.6%, came into training camp at 193 pounds.  Casey, an assistant when Dailey played with the Chicago Bulls in 1982-83, said  it was the best shape he had ever seen Dailey in.  </P> <P> But since then, as Dailey's scoring average ballooned with his playing time, so  did his weight. Saying he was getting bumped out of position too often, the  weight increased to about 205.  </P> <P> Monday, Dailey was weighed at 229 pounds -- 36 above what he began camp with  and between 29 and 24 more what the Clippers would like him to be. And Dailey,  the only team member to have a weight clause in his contract, had had violated  that clause before.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised and disappointed it went this far," Casey said before the game.  </P> <P> Dailey would have started against the Mavericks after being cleared by a doctor  for the mild concussion he suffered Saturday at Golden State. Instead, he met  with Casey and General Manager Elgin Baylor about 45 minutes before tipoff,  changed out of his uniform and, saying he had no comment, went home.  </P> <P> "Q, in his heart and mind, was more than willing to stay and play," Casey said.  "But his body was not able to do as such.  </P> <P> "I was concerned that his shot was falling short and that he was fatigued. I  was disappointed that is occured, mainly because we need him."  </P> <P> Moreover, they don't figure to get him back soon. Casey did not set a definite  weight for Dailey's return, except to say that it should be back in the  neighborhood of 205. In that case, the Clippers could be without their most  consistent outside shooter for 3 weeks.  </P> <P> Corey Gaines will take a physical today and, if he passes, is expected to sign  a 10-day contract.  </P> <P> Gaines, who spent 3 years at UCLA, played last season at Loyola Marymount after  transferring. He led the West Coast Athletic Conference in assists, was the  Lions' fourth-leading scorer at 17.4 points a game and was drafted by Seattle.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> The Clippers set their consecutive losing streak late in the 1981-82 season  when the club was in San Diego. . . . Dallas' Mark Aguirre, on the subject of  the continual trade talks involving him, including a possible deal that had him  going to the Clippers: "I'm really kind of done with that situation. If it  happens, it happens. But it's a situation for the front office to deal with." .  . . Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said he has not talked with Maverick  management in several days. . . . Clipper guard Gary Grant, who missed the last  three games to be with his sick mother in Ohio, rejoined the team. . . .  Forward Rob Lock missed the game with the flu.  </P></p>

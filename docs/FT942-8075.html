			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Talks in Moscow toend Crimean crisis The prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine hold urgent talks in Moscow today in an attempt to defuse mounting tension in Crimea, amid predictions that confrontation between the two Slav states over the fate of the disputed peninsula could lead to bloodshed. Tension was fuelled on Friday when the Crimean parliament voted to unfreeze a decision taken two years ago to adopt a separate constitution, - an act viewed by Ukraine as tantamount to a declaration of independence. A delegation of Crimean deputies led by Mr Sergei Tsekov, the speaker of parliament, will meet leading Ukrainian deputies in Kiev tomorrow. The rhetoric - if not so far the actions - has been threatening on both sides. Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, the domestic policy adviser to Ukraine's president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, said at the weekend that 'it is time to remind world opinion that Ukraine is a nuclear power'. General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said that if Ukrainian troops were sent in to Crimea to enforce Ukrainian rule, 'conflict is inevitable'. Reports of Ukrainian special forces moving in to the peninsula have been denied in Kiev - as have Ukrainian reports of a tank and a missile batallion being moved in by the pro-Russian Black Sea Fleet command. However, security at the Crimean parliament has been stepped up, with armed guards and snipers deployed on the roof. Mr Tsekov, speaking in the Crimean capital of Simferopol on Saturday, said that a majority in the parliament wanted union with Russia - although other Crimean deputies insist that Friday's decision remains within Ukrainian law. Tensions have flared between Kiev and Crimea since Ukraine became an independent state in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Though Crimeans, nearly 70 per cent of whom are ethnic Russian, voted for an independent Ukraine in 1991, the country's appalling economic decline has driven the Russian majority to seek integration with Russia. Mr Yuri Meshkov, the Crimean president, was elected earlier this year by the large Russian majority in the region on a ticket of union with Russia. The animosity between Simferopol and Kiev has been exacerbated by the growing links between Crimea and the Russian authorities. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, repeated Russia's desire for a peaceful settlement in a letter to Mr Anatoly Zlenko, his Ukrainian counterpart. However, Mr Kozyrev also said that it was essential to 'respect the sovereign will of the people' - a formula which could imply support for the Crimean parliament's decision. Ukraine's present disputes with Russia centre on the status of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet, the supply of Russian gas and the payment of Ukraine's vast debt to Russia. The fleet, based in Sevastopol, is nominally under the joint command of Mr Kravchuk and the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, but is Russian-controlled. The meeting of the two prime ministers today will address the fleet issue - though some half a dozen meetings and agreements over the past two years have not resulted in a treaty to which the two sides have felt able to adhere.</p>

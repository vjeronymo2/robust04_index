			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Tamara Zamyatina, </F> Vladimir Smelov, and Viktor Khrekov]    [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry  is ready and can help exports of Russian goods to the world  market, however, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations does  not help the Foreign Ministry in this respect, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev told a meeting of editors-in-chief of  Russian mass media bodies here today.    That is why, the Foreign Ministry does not even know what  state is the most efficient economic partner for Russia, he  added.    In the words of Andrey Kozyrev, a single state strategy for  Russian entrance to the world market has not been elaborated  since the time of Eduard Shevardnadze was Soviet foreign  minister. "If we receive a corresponding concept from the  minister of foreign economic relations, we could act in the  Russian economic interests. Politics always influences the  economy," said Kozyrev.</p>

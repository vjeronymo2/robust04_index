			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Woodside shares jump as oilfields given go-ahead SHARES in Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas producer, jumped 7 cents to a two-year high of ADollars 4.07 yesterday, after the company announced the go-ahead for development of the Cossack and Wanaea oilfields on the North West Shelf, off the west coast of Australia. Six equal partners are involved in the project - BHP Petroleum, BP Developments, Chevron Asiatic, Japan Australia LNG (MIMI), Shell Development and Woodside. The six groups are committed to spending more than ADollars 1bn (USDollars 647m) to bring the oilfields into production and construct a liquefied petroleum gas extraction scheme around a site at the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. The Wanaea oilfield was discovered in 1989, and has estimated recoverable reserves of about 200m barrels of crude oil. The neighbouring Cossack field, which was discovered a year later, has a further 33m barrels. The first contracts for the LPG plants are due to be awarded in November, and the plant is expected to be finished early in 1996. The Wanaea and Cossack oil projects are due to be completed by the end of 1995, when initial production will start. Planned peak production is 115,000 barrels a day.</p>

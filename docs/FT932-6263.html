			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / EC urged to meet on Bosnia EUROPEAN Community leaders should meet urgently to discuss concrete steps, including military action, to implement the peace plan for Bosnia agreed in Washington at the weekend, according to Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner for external political relations. Speaking on an official visit to Ankara, Mr Van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister who chaired the EC council of ministers during the early part of the Yugoslav crisis, said the Washington joint action programme 'raises questions which deserve clear answers.' An aide to the commissioner said 'if the 12 are not prepared to provide means to enforce the safe havens and the blockade (of Serbia's border with Bosnia), they should say so. Then you have to look at other ideas, including the possibility of lifting the arms embargo' for the Moslem-led Bosnian government. The US was rebuffed by its European allies when Washington argued in favour of arming the Bosnian Moslems earlier this month. Mr Van den Broek said 'military options could not be excluded' in implementing the Washington plan, agreed between the US, Russia, UK, France and Spain. He said the EC had to make clear that Serbian 'aggression does not pay', and 'what our reply will be if military operations are extended to Kosovo.' Mr Van den Broek has become increasingly frustrated at the drift of EC policy towards the former Yugoslavia, even though his influence is limited, and will still be so after the common foreign and security policy laid down in the Maastricht treaty comes into effect.</p>

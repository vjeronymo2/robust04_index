Erik Pozhdishev, speaking during a conference on nuclear  security here, said leaks of cooling liquid and vapour at the  Kola nuclear plant in northwestern Russia in the past week were  "not serious," and both were rated zero, or insignificant, on  the international seven-point scale of nuclear incidents. His  statement contradicted an earlier higher rating given to the  first incident on March 3. He also denied that anything had  happened Sunday, when Swedish experts said there had been a  small incident at the Kola plant in northwestern Russia, which  is close to the Swedish border.

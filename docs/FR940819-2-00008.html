			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Exhibit A will be used as the source document to process the set-aside through ADPS. Until automation capabilities are implemented, Exhibit A should be placed in a pending file and the borrower's account flagged ``51&hyph;S.'' The Finance Office borrower account status reports will reflect the amount(s) set-aside for each loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The National Automated Tracking System (AGCREDIT) will be utilized to document the notification and servicing scheme associated with this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The loan(s) will be considered current after the installment(s) is set-aside and, therefore, debt writedown or net recovery buyout may not be subsequently approved under subpart S of this part, and loans may not be made under &sect;1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter, unless the set-aside is reversed as set forth in &sect;1951.958(b)(2) of this subpart or the borrower becomes delinquent on the non-set-aside portion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adverse determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Borrowers who do not meet the requirements for the DSA program will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower becomes more than 1 installment behind on any FP loan while processing the DSA request, or while an appeal is being considered, the DSA request will be denied and/or any associated appeal request withdrawn. Being denied set-aside based on the failure to meet the not-more-than-1-installment-behind requirement is not an appealable issue, but is reviewable. The letter to the borrower will describe in full detail all the reasons for the adverse decision. Borrowers denied set-aside will continue to be serviced in accordance with subpart S of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1951.958  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Supervision and servicing of borrowers with DSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Supervision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Borrower supervision will continue as set forth in subpart B of part 1924 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Servicing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FP loans will continue to be serviced in accordance with the appropriate servicing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Payments applied to the amount set-aside will be processed as a miscellaneous payment on Form FmHA 451&hyph;2, ``Schedule of Remittance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The set-aside will be reversed and the addendum cancelled if, prior to the first scheduled installment due date after set-aside, the current borrower needs a writedown in order to develop a feasible plan or a net recovery buyout in accordance with subpart S of this part, or loan assistance set forth in &sect;1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter. The Finance Office must be notified by memorandum of the set-aside reversal prior to the time assistance is granted. A copy of the memorandum will be attached to the addendum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In cases not covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the set-aside will be considered automatically cancelled whenever a program loan receives primary loan servicing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

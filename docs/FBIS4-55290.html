			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by </F> an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [O GLOBO] How is the Romanian program of economic  reforms getting along?    [Vacaroiu] The revolution in December 1989 marked not only a  break with the totalitarian regime; it also launched a process  of radical transformations in political relations. It thus  established the basis for a democratic state of rights and for  an economic reconstruction based on market mechanisms.    In November 1992 we began to implement a social economic  strategy that will be in force until 1996. In 1993 the  government adopted measures to speed up the reforms by  deregulating prices, eliminating subsidies on some goods and  services, and introducing the goods movement tax. In industry,  privatization provoked new steps and stimulated the activities  of medium and small enterprises.    [O GLOBO] How can bilateral economic relations be developed?    [Vacaroiu] Bilateral trade last year totaled $54 million and  this does not satisfy us. Our two countries recently signed the  Economic Cooperation and Trade Accord, which eliminates the old  compensation system and allows economic agents to sign import  and export contracts within the context of the free market  economy. Romania is interested in balancing its trade with  Brazil. We hope to resume exporting Romanian-made railroad cars  and tractors. We will continue to export fertilizers and plan  to sell cars manufactured in Romania on the Brazilian market.  We will import Brazilian iron and manganese ore, soybeans, and  other products.    Romania has an increasing interest in investing in Brazilian  companies; the number of Romanian-Brazilian mixed capital  companies has increased to 15, and their capital totals nearly  $50,000.    [O GLOBO] What has the Romanian Government been doing to  improve the people's standard of living?    [Vacaroiu] The economic reform has had a high social cost  and  made an already precarious situation even worse. The end of the  economic decline in 1993 and the recovery expected for 1994 will  allow the people to improve their standard of living in the  second half of this year. The government is adopting social  protection measures for all strata of the population, especially  the most destitute. Salaries and pensions will be protected  from inflation by deindexation and we will reduce the imbalance  between them.    [O GLOBO] What are the main objectives of the Romanian  privatization program?    [Vacaroiu] For us, 1994 is the privatization year. By the  end of 1993, the State Asset Fund had privatized 270 commercial  corporations; 142 were privatized during the first months of  1994, and 100 more still have yet to be privatized. Another  2,000 commercial enterprises may be transferred to the private  sector. The people will be able to buy shares of these companies  or exchange certificates they already have for shares.    [O GLOBO] How are representative democracy and political  participation getting along?    [Vacaroiu] The Constitution grants all citizens full  democratic rights. We have a multiparty system. Romanians are  interested in politics -- as a result of our Latin temperament,  sometimes too interested. Compared to countries like the former  Yugoslavia and the USSR, Romania is an island of stability in  East Europe.    [O GLOBO] What about bilateral cultural exchanges?    [Vacaroiu] We signed a five-year accord for cultural  cooperation in 1991, which must be extended. For example, two  works of Brazilian literature were translated into Romanian in  1993 (Antonio Olinto's "Copacabana," and Erico Verissimo's "The  Time and the Wind"), and an exhibition of Romanian rugs in  several regions of Brazil. In 1994, the National Theater of the  city of Craiova will tour Brazil.    [O GLOBO] What advantages does Romania offer foreign  investors? Are Brazilians investing in Romania?    [Vacaroiu] Our laws allow the establishment of commercial  enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital, ensure there is no  discrimination against foreign participation, and offer  guarantees against expropriation. All regions and sectors of  the country are open to foreigners, except the materiel  industry, the manufacture of explosives, and the manufacture of  psychotropic substances.    The Romanian Government stimulates investments through tax  exemption for two to five years. We are, therefore, awaiting  Brazilian investors.    [O GLOBO] Romania may be needing know-how [preceding word in  English] in fields like managerial training, marketing  [preceding word in English], quality control, market research,  industrial modernization, administrative decentralization, and  management of public works. Brazil has universities,  organizations, and professionals specialized in these fields.  Brazil can thus help the Romanian Government and the Romanian  state-owned and private enterprises. Will you seek this sort of  assistance?    [Vacaroiu] My objective is to visit these sectors and seek  this sort of cooperation. The evolution of the bilateral trade  relations is marked by integration processes that are currently  under way in the South American continent as well as in the  European continent. Romania wants to benefit from the valuable  experience of other countries, including Brazil.</p>

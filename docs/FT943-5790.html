			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Seeking a glass breakthrough - A look at a US-Japanese trade dispute The warehouse of Matsumoto Avante, a Japanese glass wholesaler based in Tokyo, is not the kind of place normally to be associated with trade friction between the US and Japan. Matsumoto is typical of small Japanese wholesale businesses, employing about 150 people and trying to make best of modest floor space in a country where property is expensive. Matsumoto, like other glass wholesalers, is the intermediary between manufacturer and user. The future of such small wholesalers depends in part on the outcome of a US-Japan trade dispute over the flat glass market, which threatens to trigger sanctions against Japan and could change the way companies such as Matsumoto have done business for generations. Flat glass is used mainly in the construction and automobile industries. Negotiators from the US and Japan faced each other this week in an effort to resolve the row. It is one of the more thorny disputes among several which the two sides hope to resolve shortly. The US has to decide whether or not to start procedures under its Super 301 trade legislation against Japan. Prospects for an agreement, however, remain slim. The dispute over flat glass has all the ingredients of a classic US-Japan trade row. The US accuses Japan of having a an anti-competitive market dominated by a handful of large domestic makers. It says that there is a convoluted distribution system that relies on close relationships between businessmen with stakes in the industry and others, and that this system makes the market inaccessible to foreign players. The Japanese government has responded with a promise to take action to make life easier for outside pro-ducers. At stake is a market worth nearly Y3bn (Dollars 30m) in domestic sales a year, according to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The Japanese flat glass market, which has come under pressure in the past few years during the prolonged recession, is dominated by three manufacturers - Asahi Glass, Central Glass and Nippon Sheet Glass. Asahi, which belongs to the Mitsubishi group, is 4.9 per cent owned by Mitsubishi Bank and 4.7 per cent by Mitsubishi Trust. Nippon Sheet Glass, a member of the Sumitomo group of companies, is 6.8 per cent owned by Sumitomo Trust, 5.4 per cent by Sumitomo Life Insurance and 4.9 per cent by Sumitomo Bank. Central Glass, meanwhile, has close relations with the Mitsui group, with more than 11 per cent of its shares owned by Mitsui-related companies. The US claims that a close-knit group controlling a significant market breeds anti-competitive practices and creates a barrier to free market forces. It frustrates the ambitions of foreign makers looking to expand their business in Japan. The Japanese trade ministry counters, saying the market is not as closed as it might seem. In fact, Japan has a small trade deficit with the US in flat glass products. Manfucturers in Japan, the US and the European Union produce primarily for their domestic markets. Last year, Japan imported Y5bn worth of flat glass from the US while it exported only Y1.6bn in return. The amount of flat glass per capita that is imported into Japan is 1.5 times higher in Japan than in the US. Foreign glass accounted for 12.8 per cent of Japan's overall glass consumption in 1991, compared with 4.9 per cent in the US market, and 17.4 per cent in the EU. The trade ministry also objects to claims of anti-competitive activity, citing an investigation by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission in June last year which, it says, found no evidence of breach of anti-monopoly laws. A more recent Japanese government survey of flat glass wholesalers, conducted last December, found that the industry distribution system was dominated by small wholesalers which have limited warehouse and glass-cutting capacity, and little interest in handling foreign-made glass. The wholesalers said they found foreign imports uncompetitive in quality, delivery times and product reliability. 'We buy foreign product,' said a representative of Matsumoto Avante, 'but we do so to keep it in stock. We can't use it for specific contracts because delivery times are too long.' Foreign companies have to make an effort if they want to increase penetration of the Japanese market, Miti says. The US companies looking to increase their share of the market have only a handful of representatives in Japan, says one Miti official. If they can get the kind of market share they already have with so little marketing effort, they must consider themselves to be doing very well. But if they want to compete with Japanese sales forces numbered in the thousands, they have to try harder, he says.</p>

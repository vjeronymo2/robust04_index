			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson jumps 28% LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 14.4m in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30, a result heavily against the trend for the sector. The final dividend is 3.95p increasing the total by 24 per cent from 4.5p to 5.6p, helping to stimulate a strong rise in the company's share price, which closed up 15p at 222p. Fully diluted earnings per share were 12.36p (9.95p). Turnover also increased, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 36.6m, although this figure was diminished by the weakness of the dollar, the currency in which 80 per cent of the group's brokerage income is earned. However, the group used currency hedging to attain an average exchange rate of 1.75, and Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said he was confident that the recent heavy foreign exchange fluctuations would not impact on next year's results. Mr Carter attributed the company's success, compared to a sector which has been battered by bad news in recent weeks, to cost control and high retention of clients. He also pointed out that Lloyd Thompson is a wholesale and reinsurance brokerage, without the heavy exposure other UK brokers have to the US retail business.</p>

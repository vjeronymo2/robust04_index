			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION IS BISHOP'S PAWN;  </P> <P> ABORTION: IF LEO MAHER, WHO IS BARRING A PRO-CHOICE POLITICIAN FROM COMMUNION,  HAD THROWN HIS WEIGHT AROUND IN 1960, J.F.K. WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUNCED.  </P> <P> Meet Leo T. Maher. He's the fellow who could have succeeded where Hubert  Humphrey and Richard Nixon failed. If he had spoken out 30 years ago as he did  just the other day, he would have single-handedly caused the defeat of John  Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1960.  </P> <P> Or, to put it another way:  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego would have single-handedly  ended Kennedy's quest to become America's first Catholic President.  </P> <P> The bishop would have defeated Kennedy on the "Catholic issue" -- would have  exposed Kennedy's eloquent statements on the separation of church and state for  the sham that the Roman Catholic Church now seems to be telling us, by  implication, that it thinks they were.  </P> <P> Humphrey, in the spring of 1960, was too decent and principled to raise the  issue of religion in a race for the presidency. So was Nixon that fall. But  Maher would have gladly borne the cross that would have become the favorite  bludgeon of the anti-Catholic, anti-Kennedy forces.  </P> <P> Remember those times: None other than the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale convened a  gathering of Protestant leaders during the 1960 campaign to "question the  loyalty of any Catholic candidate for the presidency and the wisdom of choosing  any man of that faith for the high office," wrote Theodore H. White in his epic  "The Making of the President 1960."  </P> <P> Three decades later, a Roman Catholic bishop is making Peale's point. Due to  circumstances beyond Maher's control, the fate of the nation is not up for  grabs this year, but California's may be.  </P> <P> In the campaign to fill a seat in the state Senate, Maher has made the private  religious views of one candidate a dominant issue. Perhaps emboldened by a  tough statement just adopted by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,  Maher declared that he is barring from the sacrament of communion Assemblywoman  Lucy Killea, a soft-spoken 67-year-old Democrat who looks a lot like Sandra Day  O'Connor, because of her campaign statements supporting a woman's right to  decide whether or not to have an abortion.  </P> <P> Killea's opponent in the traditionally Republican Senate district is an  assemblywoman who is anti-abortion. Killea's position is that in public office,  she should not impose her personal views as a Catholic upon those who are not  Catholics and have different views and preferences. Polls show that her  district favors choice on abortion, which she supports.  </P> <P> Enter Bishop Maher. He turned his letter to Killea into a public debate, saying  that her position on abortion puts her "in complete contradiction to the moral  teaching of the Catholic Church. I have no other choice but to deny you the  right to receive the Eucharist in the Catholic Church."  </P> <P> Picture now a new, pivotal Great Debate of 1960. Forget the Nixon-Kennedy  debates. This is the crucial Maher-Kennedy debate.  </P> <P> Hear Maher (who actually said this to reporters on Nov. 16, 1989): "We're doing  this because the politicians have failed to recognize their obligation to bring  their Catholic faith and morality into the public arena. We are trying to teach  them, direct them, that that is their obligation."  </P> <P> Now hear John F. Kennedy (who said this in a speech to Protestant ministers in  Houston, on Sept. 12, 1960): "I believe in an America where the separation of  church and state is absolute -- where no Catholic prelate would tell the  President (should he be a Catholic) how to act. . . . I believe in an America  that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public  official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the  Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source;  where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon  the general populace or the public acts of its officials. . . . "  </P> <P> Maher: "We don't need Catholic politicians who are not truly Catholic."  </P> <P> Kennedy: "I do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does  not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President, if I should  be elected -- on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other  subject -- I will make my decision in accordance . . . with what my conscience  tells me to be in the national interest, and without regard to outside  religious pressure or dictate. And no power or threat of punishment could cause  me to decide otherwise."  </P> <P> In the 1960 election, where there was no Maher-Kennedy debate to reinforce  popular prejudices and fears, Kennedy received 49.7% of the votes to Nixon's  49.6%.  </P> <P> The bishops were carefully pro-choice on the separation of church and state  back then -- which is just what our Founding Fathers intended.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the OTC LEV program would be reasonable and practicable in the OTR. EPA granted California a waiver for its LEV program on January 8, 1993 based on the finding required under section 209(b) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>  In addition, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB or the Board) initially approved its LEV regulations in 1990, it directed CARB to report biennially to the Board on the status of implementation of the regulations. The staff provided the Board with the first such report at a June 11, 1992 public meeting. At the time the Board found that the low-emission vehicle standards continued to be technologically feasible within the required time frames, and accordingly no changes to the standards or phase-in schedule were needed. <FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In EPA's waiver decision regarding California's LEV program, the EPA Administrator stated, ``Based on EPA's review of this record, I find reasonable and so adopt California's finding that there is adequate leadtime to permit the development of technology necessary to meet those standards giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within the required time frame.'' Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-Emission Vehicle Standards at 69 (Jan. 8, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Executive Officer James Boyd to EPA Administrator Carol Browner (July 21, 1994). The Board and staff did recognize that a variety of amendments would be appropriate to augment the LEV regulations, make them clearer, and facilitate their implementation. This recognition led to the adoption of several LEV ``follow-up'' amendments, which were formally adopted by the Board. On September 22, 1993, CARB sent a letter requesting that EPA confirm the Board's determination that these amendments fall within the scope of the January 8, 1993 waiver for the California LEV Program. EPA has not yet acted on this request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CARB held its second LEV ``status'' hearing May 12 and 13, 1994, at which the Chairwoman stated in her closing statement that CARB had ``had a successful launch of the Low Emission Vehicle program.'' <FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>  The CARB Staff Report that preceded the May meeting stated that many of the technologies that will be required for LEV ``are already in production in some vehicle models, and the remaining technologies are now developed to near commercial levels of readiness.'' <FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>  In fact, CARB has to date certified several categories of LEVs, including TLEVs (produced and sold), light-duty and medium-duty ULEVs (natural gas), and ZEVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Closing Statement by CARB Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer at Public Meeting to Review Low-Emission Vehicle Standards at 1 (May 13, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See CARB Staff Report: 1994 Low-Emission Vehicle and Zero-Emission Vehicle Program Review, at 17 (April 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, two states, New York and Massachusetts, believed the California LEV program to be reasonable and practicable enough to adopt the LEV program in legislation and regulations without contingencies. Both states are set to implement their programs. Other states have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on regional program adoption, and the remaining states are at various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the legislative history of section 177 reinforces the idea that states which adopt California standards do not create any undue burden for the auto manufacturers. The House Report noted:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This new state authority [to promulgate standards under section 177] should not place an undue burden on vehicle manufacturers who will be required in any event, to produce vehicles meeting the California standards for sale in California.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> H.R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. at 31.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requests comment on whether it should require the OTR states to achieve the additional emissions reductions associated with the ZEV sales requirement from new motor vehicles if the Agency does not require that the OTR states adopt the ZEV sales requirement. In an August 4, 1994 letter, Arthur A. Davis, Chair of the OTC, <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  stated that, in the OTC's February 10 recommendation it indicated that one of the criteria for OTC LEV alternatives that EPA might consider was emission reduction equivalency. The letter went on to explain the principle of equivalency for purposes of discussing different options with the auto manufacturers:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Author A. Davis, OTC Chair, to Mary D. Nichols, Assistant Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, U.S. EPA (Aug. 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine emission reduction equivalency, alternatives must be compared to the emission reduction potential of the OTC LEV recommendation with respect to the primary ozone precursors. This means that the OTC will assess non-methane organic gases (NMOG) exhaust emissions, NMOG evaporative emissions, and exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of significant alternatives with the emissions of the same pollutants under the OTC LEV recommendation with the full benefits available from the ZEV component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This statement might be understood to indicate that the OTC expects its recommended program to achieve the full benefits of the ZEV sales requirement even if EPA does not mandate the ZEV sales requirement. <FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated, the OTC plainly recommended that vehicle manufacturers comply with the NMOG tailpipe limit regardless of EPA's determination regarding the ZEV sales mandate. The issue raised here pertains solely to the additional evaporative NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  benefits provided by ZEV's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, several commenters believe that the OTC's petition included a recommendation that EPA require states to adopt programs requiring that the automobile manufacturers obtain the full emissions benefits of the ZEV sales requirement. One commenter suggested that EPA require that states' programs compel the automobile manufacturers either to sell ZEV's or achieve equivalent reductions from the new vehicle sector, including tailpipe and evaporative NMOG, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, toxics, and carbon dioxide. EPA believes that consideration of CO, toxics and carbon dioxide benefits are beyond the scope of the Agency's authority under Section 184 which pertains solely to ozone pollution and its precursors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for auto manufacturers to achieve the additional evaporative NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions benefits of the ZEV sales requirement without selling ZEV's, they would have to provide a mix of vehicles subject to requirements in addition to the NMOG fleet average achievement. Under the ZEV equivalency approach, states could provide the auto manufacturers the option of either complying with the ZEV sales requirement or selling a mix of other vehicles, which could include some ZEVs, that satisfies both the NMOG requirements and also achieves the additional benefits equivalent to those that would result from meeting the full ZEV sales requirement. This approach raises a number of questions on which EPA is soliciting comment: (1) What emission reductions are attributable to the ZEV sales mandate that would not be realized if only the NMOG fleet average part of the program were adopted? (2) How would auto manufacturers demonstrate that their mix of vehicles achieved the same total emissions reductions as the NMOG average plus the ZEV sales mandate? (3) Would such a demonstration require EPA or the states to set a new emission standard or a sales mandate for non-ZEV vehicles? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

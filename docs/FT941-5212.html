			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Extending the price of dignity - Case study: St. Bruno home / Growing old in Cologne is a genteel affair. But can it last? For the occupants of the St Bruno home for the elderly in the German Rhineside metropolis of Cologne, growing old is a relatively genteel affair. Electronic doors whir open to ease wheelchair access. When the annual carnival show took place in the packed dining room at the end of January, the spectacle was transmitted to 70 bedridden residents by in-house closed-circuit television. The 180 elderly people receive exemplary attention from a roughly equal number of well-qualified staff, including 59 nurses and five with a diploma in sports education. The centre, run by the Catholic charity organisation Caritas, boasts its own pottery kiln, a cafe called Oasis and a spacious chapel where Mr Fritz Einck, the 87-year-old resident priest, holds daily mass. Mr Einck helped set up the home 10 years ago and is its most eminent resident. 'We don't want to be either a hospital or a ghetto,' he says. 'We offer a real culture of growing old.' It is a culture with which Germany as a whole is becoming distressingly familiar. The country with Europe's most serious 'greying' problem is ageing faster than it is developing the means to pay for the consequences. Fees at the home range from DM2,700 a month for basic residential care to DM4,600 for the 130 occupants needing intensive nursing. The most acute cases pay DM860 on top of this. For most, payments are made directly from social security. St. Bruno has no financing difficulties at present. In 10 years, that may be different. The inmates are shielded from the pressures of financial arithmetic. Some have no idea of the degree of care lavished on them. More than 60 are registered as mentally 'confused'. The home was built for people aged between 65 and 75. In the last decade, according to Mr Siegfried Apolinarski, the director, the average age has risen to 84. The oldest is 102. Ten years ago, most occupants came to St Bruno as part of a transition from life at home. Now, most occupants make their entry from hospital. Originally, 80 patients were acute nursing cases; now the figure is 60 per cent higher. Each year between 40 and 45 die. The centre, one of seven Caritas homes in Cologne, lays on an ambitious programme of lectures and entertainment. 'We have to offer a wide range of activities,' Mr Apolinarski says. 'We've got some people here with doctorates.' However, over afternoon coffee in the dining room, Mr Robert Kaulbarch, a fit- and irritable-looking 85-year-old, laments the lack of intellectual stimulus: 'Many people here are round the bend.' Mrs Katharine Buschwald, a 93-year-old ex-bookkeeper, takes a more charitable view: 'I never thought about getting old . . . Now I am content.' St Bruno's residents are living out their last years, at best, in dignity, at worst, without being aware of the decay of their bodies and minds. Maintaining this service depends on increasing resources flowing from the active sectors of the population. The pain of growing old will soon be shared by those for whom a move to St Bruno's is decades away.</p>

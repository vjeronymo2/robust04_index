			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: No need to pay I AM A SINGLE British subject, born in 1947, resident in Italy since 1969 and working at the United Nations in Rome. As a UN staff member, I am not liable for British tax. Medical problems mean I will have to return to the UK eventually, so I am contemplating buying a small flat/house there. How will my tax status change once I become a house-owner in the UK while still resident in Rome? I have National Savings and a building society account which earn gross interest, and I also pay Class 3 contributions to the National Pension Fund. For as long as you are working full-time in Italy, your status will not change and you will continue to escape UK tax on your National Savings and building society interest by virtue of extra-statutory concession B13: 'Where for any year of assessment, for the whole of which she is regarded as being not resident in the UK, a person receives interest (eg bank or building society interest) without deduction of income tax . . . no action is taken to pursue her liability to income tax except so far as it can be recovered by set-off in a claim for relief . . . in respect of . . . income from UK sources . . .' Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, United Kingdom, WC2R 1LB, for copies of the free booklets IR1 (Extra-statutory concessions) and IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

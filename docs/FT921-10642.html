			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee may go unpicked THE IVORY Coast's coffee bushes have produced a big crop this year, but low prices and a delayed buying season mean much of it will probably go unpicked, trade and government sources say, reports Reuter from Abidjan. 'It's a big harvest. . . from what was on the bushes we know there was 20 per cent more than last year,' one trader said. 'But a lot of it might just stay there'. Several observers put the potential maximum 1991-92 crop at 300,000 tonnes of robusta compared with trade and government estimates of between 250,000 and 270,000 tonnes in 1990-91. Government officials said they expected an actual harvest of about 250,000 tonnes or less.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Industrial park for Bristol Work is set to begin on the first phase of a Pounds 7.5m 200,000 sq ft industrial park in Bristol, close to the city's Parkway station. The development work will be undertaken by JT DESIGN BUILD for CIN Properties, who recently purchased the site on behalf of British Coal Pension Funds. Work will begin immediately on constructing the infrastructure. It is planned to build six speculative units and offer design build packages that will suit occupiers' precise requirements. CIN acquired the site from Trencherwood Commercial. JP Sturge acted on behalf of CIN Properties and Chesterton acted for Trencherwood Commercial.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 1 Feb -- The result of the afternoon session  of the parliament session was the adoption of the state budget  of Ukraine for 1994, with 255 deputies voting for its adoption  and 36 against. According to the new budget, income and  expenditure are equal, at 335.067343 trillion karbovantsi.    In the opinion of people's deputy Leopold Taburyanskyy, head  of the People's Party of Ukraine, the new budget will lead to  the further impoverishment of the population. In his opinion,  expenditure on defense -- 16.82 trillion karbovantsi -- and on  holding the March parliamentary elections -- 1.15 trillion -- is  excessive.</p>

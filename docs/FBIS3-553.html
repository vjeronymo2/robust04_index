			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Disarmament in Liberia has begun. Many people will  say that the real peace process is finally under way. Yesterday  we heard the commander of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia,  General Opande, saying he had been on a tour and had seen former  fighters handing over their weapons. However, in this report  from Monrovia, the BBC's West Africa correspondent, Ofeibea  Quist-Arcton, shows that not all the fighters are disarming.    [Begin recording] [Quist-Arcton] Two truckloads move in the  Schieffelin Camp, outside Monrovia, packed full of soldiers from  the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL], the nominally national army  which in the minds of many Liberians will always remain  associated with the horror and killings of the civil war. But  at Schieffelin they seemed ready and even eager to give up their  weapons to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and shake off that damning legacy.    Under the watchful eye of the ECOMOG chief of staff,  Brigadier Samuel Victor Malu and UN military observers, the  Nigerian camp commandant at Schieffelin gave orders to the  Liberian soldiers as disarmament began.    [Unidentified camp commandant] Attention! Do you understand  me? I want you to face me, this way. That's how I want it.    [Quist-Arcton] In turn, the Liberian colonel told his men  what to do -- a slight confusion between Nigerian English and  Liberian English. Guns were neutralized and bullets discharged  from magazines before the AFL chief lined up a large stock for  registration and cleaning. They were a ragtag collection of  men, many young; some in proper military uniform, others  inadequately dressed in threadbare clothes and rubber slippers  after years at war. How does it make you feel?    [Unidentified soldier] I feel happy.    [Quist-Arcton] Why?    [Soldier] Because we have been fighting since 1991 and the  war is coming to an end, and that is why I am happy when they  say we are disarming.    [Quist-Arcton] Do you think that peace will be lasting in  Liberia?    [Soldier] Yes, peace will be lasting in Liberia    [Quist-Arcton] Nobody in Liberia had any illusion that  disarmament would be (?smooth) or easy, and they were right, and  camping and disarming the Armed Forces of Liberia is just the  first step and probably the simplest. ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and Charles Taylor's National  Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] are still officially under  arms.    [Unidentified military officer] About-turn! About-turn! Turn  about, turn about!    [Quist-Arcton] Visiting the NPFL encampment site of Kolela  near Kolela yesterday, about 50 miles north of Monrovia on the  road to Taylor's Gbarnga headquarters, we got the impression at  the Tanzanian ECOMOG troops in charge that everything was set to  receive Taylor's fighters and their weapons. The mainly young  troops milling around the camp seemed ready too waiting for the  word from their boss but I am told that Charles Taylor is not  taking any chances, indicative of the continuing mistrust among  Liberians. Taylor is waiting before he gives the order for his  boys to disarm. Of course, he is waiting for ULIMO, or so I am  told. The very public split and the power struggle in the ULIMO  leadership is causing the latest delay in the Liberia peace  process.    Nigerian ECOMOG military commander, General Henry Odopu, is  responsible for the areas that include Toby, one of the  encampment sites allocated to ULIMO.    [Odopu] Now there is a problem with leadership. Everything  has been put into place. The camp has been set up and the  ECOMOG soldiers have taken their positions, and we have....  [pauses] The boys, in fact are ready to move in there. There  are some minor problem within ULIMO, and it is that minor  problem that ECOMOG headquarters is trying to resolve, and the  moment it is resolved, they will move in. I can be very sure of  that.    [Quist-Arcton] Gen. Odopu added that he wanted to be sure  that ULIMO troops with different loyalties would not clash in  camp once they have been disarmed, and he said he wanted that  matter sorted out before hand.

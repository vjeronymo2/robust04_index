			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Observer: Publish and be praised Andre Schiffrin is a worried man. He fears for the future of publishing, writing, and literary culture in general. 'This is guerrilla warfare,' is how 59-year old Schiffrin refers to the function he sees for his US publishing house, The New Press. Fed up with what he sees as the onward march of selling books like soapsuds, he thinks it time for a riposte. His father Jacques - a French emigre - co-founded the US publisher Pantheon in 1942. Pantheon built itself a great name by publishing everything from Jean-Paul Sartre to Monty Python. In 1990, when Andre Schiffrin was Pantheon's managing director, its owner, Random House, put the squeeze on, demanding Schiffrin publish fewer books with fatter profits. He walked out, taking a sprinkling of well-known writers - including Studs Terkel - with him. Schiffrin wasn't against profits; just profit-making as the only criterion of publishing success. 'Big US publishers now won't touch a book unless they have guaranteed sales of 20,000 copies, even though they can break-even at 5,000. On that basis Chomsky or Foucault wouldn't ever have been published,' says Schiffrin. The New Press, a non-profit organisation backed by several US foundations, is now four years old. Ironically, some of its titles have proved unexpected best-sellers, including 50,000 copies sold of May It Please The Court, live recordings and transcripts of the US Supreme Court. The Court got very cross about the publication, thereby giving it a market stimulus. Having now just signed a big distribution deal with UK publisher I B Tauris, Schiffrin thinks his guerrilla campaign is making headway. 'We might even break-even this year,' he says with a smile.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURT WON'T HEAR CASE OF DISPLACED ART  </P> <P> The U. S. Supreme Court has refused to hear a case filed on behalf of artist  David Avalos over a judge's 1986 removal of a temporary sculpture from the  Federal Courthouse plaza here.  </P> <P> "It just shows how much more work has to be done to get at a climate in which  free expression is encouraged," Avalos said Tuesday, a day after the court's  decision. "Technically, the law has been carried out, but justice has not been  served."  </P> <P> Avalos, an artist of national repute, spoke as he was about to leave for New  York, where he has a solo art exhibit opening next week. He said the Supreme  Court's refusal means he has more work to do.  </P> <P> "All the way up and down the line, federal court judges made it their business  that another federal judge, Gordon Thompson Jr., escaped the scrutiny of the  legal system," said Avalos, who lives in National City. "It's hard for justice  to get up on her own scales and weigh the system. At what point do those people  who make decisions . . . cease to be accountable?"  </P> <P> Avalos was represented by Gregory Marshall, who filed the suit in Thompson's  court in 1986 as an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Thompson  was the primary defendant.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed because we did not get a hearing on the case," Marshall  said. "The essential issues of the case were never heard. David really was  deprived of a true day in court."  </P> <P> Avalos' wooden construction, titled "San Diego Donkey Cart," depicted an  immigration official arresting an undocumented worker.  </P> <P> Although the General Services Administration had issued a permit for the  display, Thompson, a chief U. S. District Court judge, ordered it removed,  saying it was a security risk and "an invitation for a kook to do some harm to  it or the building." Avalos claimed censorship, saying his First Amendment  rights to free speech were violated.  </P> <P> The trial court ruled that the GSA had erred in revoking the permit, but the  key issue was whether Thompson had a right to order the GSA to revoke the  permit, and that has never been heard, Marshall said.  </P> <P> The U. S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, saying the case  was moot, "that we got all the relief we were entitled to," Marshall said.  "They never stated a legitimate reason, which is highly irregular."  </P> <P> Marshall called Monday's denial "the same as the court holding that Judge  Thompson is free to do that at any time."  </P> <P> Avalos took his case to the Supreme Court for "real solid reasons."  </P> <P> "It's not something I came up with overnight," Avalos said. "It's something  I've been doing as a Chicano for two decades. It connects me to the history of  the United States. It has to do with the exercise of rights.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to say I have First Amendment rights. It's another thing to  wear a T-shirt that says 'Ed Meese is a pig.' One is the profession of rights,  and one is the exercise of rights.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it may appear frivolous. A donkey cart may look frivolous, but I  think the principles aren't frivolous."  </P> <P> Avalos is an outspoken artist with substantial credentials as an advocate for  Chicano causes. In January, 1988, he was one of three artists who produced a  controversial poster critical of the way San Diego's tourist industry employs  undocumented workers.  </P> <P> Titled "Welcome to America's Finest Tourist Plantation," the piece was funded  in part through hotel and motel bed taxes and affixed to the backs of 100 San  Diego Transit buses. The triptych showed the hands of hotel and restaurant  workers and a law officer handcuffing workers.  </P> <P> The posters were up during the week of Super Bowl XXII, and city officials  sought, unsuccessfully, to remove them.  </P> <P> Last April, Avalos and his poster collaborators struck again. Installation  Gallery commissioned Deborah Small, Avalos and bus poster artists Elizabeth  Sisco and Louis Hock to paint a billboard as part of the city's annual downtown  Artwalk festival.  </P> <P> The billboard raised the issue of racism in San Diego by focusing on the city's  unwillingness to name the new convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr.  </P> <P> Next to a black-and-white portrait of the Nobel Peace Prize winner were the  words "Welcome to America's Finest a) city b) tourist plantation c) Convention  Center."  </P> <P> Until late 1988, Avalos served as an artist in residence at the Centro Cultural  de la Raza. Last year he resigned to begin graduate studies in art at UC San  Diego.  </P> <P> Avalos' solo exhibition of sculptural pieces and tables, "Cafe Mestizo," will  be on view at the Intar Latin American Gallery in New York City from Tuesday  through July 23.  </P></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Bush looks to South Carolina for crucial lift to his campaign: Even in one of the president's best states, his advisers warn they may be unable to cut Buchanan's share of the vote to below 30 per cent FOUR years ago South Carolina gave a crucial lift to Mr George Bush on his road to the presidency. The southern Atlantic state, home of the late Mr Lee Atwater, Republican party chairman and Bush campaign manager, produced for Mr Bush a primary victory over his main challengers, Senator Robert Dole and Mr Pat Robertson, the revivalist preacher. Later, in his general election battle against Governor Michael Dukakis, Mr Bush won 62 per cent of South Carolina's vote, one of his highest scores anywhere. Today, Mr Bush needs an even more emphatic victory as he seeks an early coup de grace over his outspoken right-wing challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan. The Bush campaign no longer has Mr Atwater to guide it, but it still has the vigorous support of Governor Carroll Campbell, South Carolina's dominant politician. Mr Campbell also spearheaded Mr Bush's campaign in the neighbouring state of Georgia, where Mr Buchanan won 30 per cent of the vote in last week's primary. Even with the behind them, Mr Bush's advisers are warning they may still be unable to cut Mr Buchanan's share of the vote below 30 per cent. But Bush campaign officials also acknowledge that, with Governor Campbell's strong backing, South Carolina ought to be one of the president's best states. Campaigning this week in Columbia, South Carolina's state capital, Mr Bush declined to attack his rival by name. But he cautiously criticised the protectionist theme Mr Buchanan has emphasised in his campaign. Closing the US's borders to trade could put 125,000 export-oriented jobs in South Carolina at risk, Mr Bush warned. In the textile mills around Greenville and Spartanburg, however, protectionism may win Mr Buchanan some votes. Senator Ernest Hollings, South Carolina's Democratic senator since 1966, has long advocated textile import quotas. Senator Hollings has recently taken to Japan-bashing in a remarkably tasteless fashion: responding to Japanese politicians who called American workers lazy and illiterate, he noted that these same American workers had produced a bomb and tested their handiwork at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. President Bush has refused repeated invitations to condemn Mr Buchanan's overt appeals to racial politics. This reluctance may have little effect in today's primary, but in the November general election it could cost him the support of black voters, who make up 30 per cent of South Carolina's population and who helped re-elect Governor Campbell in 1990. Mr Buchanan, however, will have to share the racist vote with Mr David Duke. South Carolina is the first state in which the former Ku Klux Klan leader's name is on the ballot. Mr Duke's campaigning has been lackadaisical, however, and he is not expected to win a big share of today's vote. Mr Bush is competing with Mr Buchanan for South Carolina's large Christian fundamentalist population. In 1988, one Republican primary voter in three identified himself or herself as a born-again Christian. Both Mr Buchanan and vice-president Dan Quayle have campaigned at Bob Jones University, the Protestant university at Greenville, and Mr Buchanan has made hay with a Treasury move to make churches submit lists of large donors to the Internal Revenue Service. Among the Democratic candidates, Governor Bill Clinton is expected to repeat the formula with which he won Georgia's primary last week: strong endorsements from local politicians, an overwhelming majority of black voters, and a strong appeal to lower and middle-income whites. Senator Tom Harkin, however, has sought votes in South Carolina's industrial areas, and campaigned in the state last week with Mr Jesse Jackson, who swept the Democratic caucus here in 1988 with 55 per cent of the votes.</p>

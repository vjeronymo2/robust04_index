			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): The Proms The youthful Esa-Pekka Salonen brings his Los Angeles Philharmonic to London this week with concerts at the Royal Albert Hall tomorrow and Thursday. Since taking over the orchestra in 1992 Salonen has raised its profile and toured it extensively. Lutoslawski's last symphony, commissioned by the Philharmonic, features tomorrow along with Emanuel Ax playing a Mozart piano concerto, and, to remind Salonen of his Finnish home, Sibelius's Second Symphony.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Ali Bin-Khalifah al-Hatm, the speaker of Qatar's  parliament, met and conferred with Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri this afternoon.    At this meeting, Mr. al-Hatm referred to the longstanding  ties between the two countries and said that the basis for  fraternal relations between Iran and Qatar is their common  religious and historical heritage. He added that one of the  fundamental policies of his country is to observe the principle  of mutual respect and to refrain from interference in the  internal affairs of other countries.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri then stressed the need to establish cordial  ties between regional countries, in particular among the Islamic  states. Furthermore, he said that the spread of Islam and the  desire for Islam are the main cause of global arrogance's enmity  toward world Muslims. He added that the ruthless massacre of  the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina serves to prove such a  claim.    The Majles speaker, moreover, criticized the double  standards  adopted by the world's so-called human rights organizations and  forums. He referred to the horrific crime of the Zionists in  the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque, and stressed: The al-Khalil  atrocity will certainly not be the Zionists' last crime. The  only way to confront the enemies of Islam is by displaying unity  among world Muslims.    He continued his remarks by alluding to the existing  problems  in the sensitive and strategic Persian Gulf region. He  emphasized that the region's security should be safeguarded by  the region's people. He asserted: In its attempt to create  discord among the countries of the region, the enemy has entered  the arena under the pretext of bringing about security, whereas  in fact it is disrupting the region's security.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri also referred to relations between the two  friendly and fraternal countries of Qatar and the Islamic  Republic of Iran. He alluded to the religious, historical, and  geographical traits that the two countries have in common, and  said: Because of these common traits, and also because of the  fair stances adopted by the Government of Qatar during the  course of the war imposed by Iraq on Iran, the Islamic Republic  of Iran reserves a special regard for Qatar.    The Majles speaker then expressed the hope that cordial and  fraternal ties between Tehran and Doha will serve as an  exemplary model for all the Persian Gulf littoral states.</p>

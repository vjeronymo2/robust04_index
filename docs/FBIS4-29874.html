			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and key cabinet ministers on Wednesday reaffirmed Japan will  keep in close contact with other Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrialized nations to hold the yen's spurt in check.    They also reconfirmed the need to institute domestic  economic  reform, steadily implement measures outlined in the government's  February pump-priming package and flesh out a market-opening  package unveiled in March, a government spokesman said.    Hata and his top aides agreed that the yen's movement has a  strong impact on the just-emerging recovery of Japan's economy,  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura told reporters.    Hata convened the emergency cabinet meeting following the  yen's overnight surge in New York to a new global postwar record  high of 99.85-95 yen against the dollar.    At the gathering, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii voiced  concern about the yen's violent fluctuations and spoke of the  need for Japan to keep in close touch with other G-7 nations to  stabilize the currency markets, Kitamura said.    The dollar ended Wednesday morning in Tokyo at 101.15 yen,  down 1.00 yen from Tuesday, after opening at a postwar record  low in Tokyo of 100.35 yen.    Attending Wednesday's meeting were Hata, Fujii,  International  Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio  Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai.</p>

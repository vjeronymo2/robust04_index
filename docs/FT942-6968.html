			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Through a market, darkly: Is the fear that derivatives are a multi-billion accident waiting to happen justified? Earlier this year Kashima Oil, a Japanese company, found that it had lost Dollars 1.5bn in foreign exchange derivative trading. Germany's Metallgesellschaft lost Dollars 1.4bn in oil derivatives, while US consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble lost a more modest Dollars 102m on interest rate contracts. Hardly a week goes by without another expensive mishap in the use of derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets. Such stories explain the bad press received by derivatives traders. They appear to strengthen the case of the US General Accounting Office, which last week called for tougher regulation to address gaps in the system. Nor do the counter-arguments of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday seem likely to damp the fear in Congress that derivatives are a multi-billion accident waiting to overwhelm the financial system. Are the fears justified? And how precisely does the trade in derivatives change the way the monetary and financial systems operate? Where monetary policy is concerned, the chief question is whether widespread hedging deprives interest rate changes of the impact they used to have in a derivative-free system. Since derivatives trading is, from a macro-economic perspective, a zero-sum game, the issue would not arise if the trade were purely domestic. For every trader who hedged, there would be a counterparty with an equal and opposite exposure. But the market is global, making it possible that an increase in US interest rates might, for example, produce a weak response in the US, while tightening policy in Japan. This would happen if Japanese institutions proved to be net insurers of their US counterparties against such a rise. Yet generalisations on this score are fraught with difficulty, not least because so many other factors affect an economy's sensitivity to interest rate changes. And in practice no one did predict the global market shake-out wrought by a mere quarter-point increase in US rates in February. The speed and extent of the bond market plunge may have been compounded by the use of derivative instruments, which can be used to assume risk, as well as to reduce risk. Their unique characteristic is the ability to create exposure to a market cheaply, for either purpose, in terms of the investor's cash outlay - leverage, in a word. But the market crunch in February primarily reflected a misplaced unanimity of view about market trends, magnified by old-fashioned leverage in the shape of bank borrowing. Investors experienced what John Heimann, a former US comptroller of the currency now resident at Merrill Lynch, describes as a worldwide margin call. At the micro-economic level the most striking feature of derivatives is that they have grown like topsy (see charts) because they satisfy a need. Following the break-up of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s and the deregulation of banking, the task of stabilising markets has, in effect, been privatised. Banks, corporations, investors and governments have to insure against volatility. Yet the task of providing insurance to end-users - those who seek to hedge the risks that volatility poses for their business - has increasingly been complemented by the explosive growth of proprietary trading, dominated by a handful of giant commercial and investment banks, a phenomenon explored in an earlier article*. The joy, from the banks' point of view, is the sheer extent of the potential for hedging, especially in the over-the-counter markets where banks offer customised (and thus high-margin) products to end-users. Scope for growth outside formal exchanges, says Leo Melamed, a founding father of the Chicago financial futures markets, 'is limited only by the imagination'. Derivatives trading thus provides an answer to two of the banks' biggest problems: the loss of large corporate clients after the third-world debt crisis and the blow to the profitability of their conventional business arising from the globalisation of markets, rapid technological change and financial deregulation. The margins in orthodox financial intermediation - deposit-taking and lending - are now woefully thin and companies are increasingly reluctant to pay large fees for investment banking services. 'I invite anyone,' says Salomon Brothers' chairman and chief executive officer, Deryck Maughan, 'to point to a fee that's gone up in the past 10 years. Fees only decline. If adequate returns to capital are to be maintained, it will be a trading world.' In this competitive maelstrom where frenetically mobile capital seeks out the highest global returns, off-balance sheet derivatives trading is the equivalent of alchemists' gold. Institutions can offer a pure broking service. Or, more profitably, they may put the deal on their own books and look for a counterparty with offsetting risk management needs. At one end of the proprietary spectrum are those who do low-risk, high-volume arbitrage business, taking a small margin from balancing the odds like the bank in a casino. At the other are those who take large speculative positions, hedged in varying degrees. The risks are little different from those traditionally run by banks and insurance companies. They include market risk (vulnerability to fluctuating prices); counterparty credit risk (the threat of default by the other party to the contract); liquidity risk (where the financial instrument cannot quickly be replaced at close to its fundamental value); and operational risk (failures of internal control, including computer systems or fraud). Yet many of the larger losses incurred to date, such as those on local authority swaps in the UK, have stemmed from legal risk, where one party was not authorised to conduct such business. The worry about derivatives lies less in the nature of the risks being run, than the wider market context, which is dangerously opaque. The report of an internal working group of the Bank of England concluded last year that the unsupervised status of some of the large players in the system 'does represent a supervisory hole at the very heart of the derivatives markets'. That looks prescient in the light of the scale of derivatives dealing by unsupervised hedge funds that has become apparent this year. Note, too, that much of the US investment banks' derivatives dealing is conducted through unsupervised, special-purpose subsidiaries, to which the credit rating agencies have granted higher ratings than those of the parent bank. Some central bankers question whether this artificial structure, despite numerous inbuilt safety devices, would stand up in a financial fire-storm. Still more striking is the absence of adequate information about counterparties. Disclosure practice has lagged behind market developments, with the result that balance sheets have been drained of meaning. The creditors of Kashima Oil, for example, might have thought that they were dealing with a company that was exposed to fluctuations in oil prices. Yet it turned out to be a foreign exchange dealer, running currency risks on a scale that wiped out its capital. Nor can published bank balance sheets convey an adequate picture of the risks being run, since derivative positions change minute by minute in the markets. Meantime, corporate giants like Procter &amp; Gamble that run derivative-intensive treasury operations as a profit centre have, in effect, taken a conglomerate move into marketmaking. Yet it is rarely made apparent to shareholders or creditors whether derivatives are being used to hedge or to speculate. All that is clear, says one leading US derivatives trader, is that the profit-centre mentality always leads to trouble. An accountancy profession that is increasingly preoccupied with making money out of consultancy has been slow to respond to the biggest challenge to historic cost accounting since inflation accelerated in the 1960s. The problem is that derivatives incorporate big assumptions about the future. Options, in particular, are difficult to value since, as their name implies, they are options that may or may not be exercised, not firm commitments to deal at a fixed future price. The discipline that the big banks have invented to deal with such problems is 'marking to market' - writing commitments up or down in line with market prices. Yet with over-the-counter derivatives, there is no real market. Instead there are complex computer valuations based on assumptions about probability, volatility and future costs. William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, worries that market prices may not fully reflect the illiquidity of the more complex derivatives. Certainly experience has shown that liquidity in over-the-counter markets can evaporate in a panic. In this twilight world everyone depends heavily on the rating agencies. Yet Moody's, for one, admits that a large proportion of outstanding contracts are too new for it to feel sure that the risks are low. Balance sheets full of derivatives appear more liquid than ones full of conventional bank loans. The credit risk is only a fraction of the notional amount of the derivatives (see table). But there has to be a question mark over the derivatives traders' capital adequacy until the business has been tested over a longer period - and a worry that traders are relying on the presence of a central bank lender of last resort as they take otherwise excessive risks. The system of checks and balances within individual organisations is crucial. The big players, most of whom follow the risk management recommendations of the Group of 30 banking think-tank, have spent heavily on systems and skills. The investment appears to have paid off in the upheaval of the past three months when arithmetical assumptions about correlations between markets broke down. At Bankers Trust, a derivatives market leader, more was lost in the cash markets than in derivatives, says vice-chairman George Vojta. Most central bankers claim that the probability that the mispricing of risks in derivatives could lead to a systemic shock is low, but cannot be ignored. They also worry that lack of information about exposures could exacerbate a financial crisis; and that complex derivative linkages across global markets could then make the contagion hard to contain. The General Accounting Office, meantime, questions whether it is appropriate for heavy proprietary trading in derivatives to be supported by insured deposits, which may encourage participants in excessive risk-taking. The more obvious threat is simply to individual firms, especially those at one remove from the mainstream. The failure of Kidder Peabody's senior management, auditors and traders to detect the phoney profits declared by top trader Joseph Jett was an astonishing collapse of corporate governance. Such problems are acute where traders' performance is assessed for bonus purposes over shorter periods than the life of the outstanding derivative contracts which they have put on their firm's books. As Martin Mayer at the Brookings Institution think-tank points out, risk-shifting instruments also have a way of pushing risks on to those least able to absorb them. This is born out by Douglas Morris, senior policy adviser to the comptroller of the currency. He points to a US bank with only Dollars 200m of assets which acquired a structured note carrying an exposure to the swings of the peseta and D-Mark against the dollar. After adverse swings, the note yields no income and has lost a fifth of its value. That is symptomatic of the enormous conflicts of interest built into a system in which own-account trading is pervasive. As a leading banker in the Euromarkets puts it, with only mild exaggeration, 90 per cent of the work of big investment banks is now unprofitable and serves only as a loss-leader for highly profitable proprietary trading. Caveat emptor is thus a categorical imperative for end-users. It would make no sense to protect Procter &amp; Gamble. Handling the banks is a more difficult matter. Derivatives are a valuable addition to the financial armoury. The real problems, both for individual banks and the system, are about opacity, leverage and lack of managerial competence. Central bankers will have to be on their mettle if that potentially lethal combination is not to lead to trouble. *Financial Times, May 18  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    TOP US OTC DERIVATIVES DEALERS*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks                                              Dollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Chemical Banking                                      1,620.8 Citicorp                                              1,521.4 JP Morgan                                           1,251.7 Bankers Trust                                         1,165.9 Chase Manhattan                                         836.3 BankAmerica                                             787.9 First Chicago                                           391.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Securities companies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs                                           752.0 Salomon                                                 729.0 Merrill Lynch                                           724.0 Morgan Stanley                                          424.9 Shearson Lehman Brothers**                              337.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Insurance Companies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group                            198.2 Prudential Insurance Co of America                      121.5 General Re Corporation                                   82.7  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                                10,994.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                              *From annual reports 1992                         **The company no longer exists under this name  ---------------------------------------------------------------------           CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Largest 50 bank holding companies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Percent of     Replacement                                          notional           costs                                            amount    (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total notional value                                       6,250 Gross credit exposure                       2.30             144 Net credit exposure                         1.46              91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

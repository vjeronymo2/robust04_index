			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Cannon St in Pounds 46m cash call CANNON Street Investments, the debt-laden industrial holding company, is raising Pounds 46.7m net via a one for three rights issue, and a placing and offer of 25.7m convertible preference shares, in a move to slash its borrowings by more than 40 per cent. The rights issue of 25.69m new ordinary shares at 90p was at a discount to the closing price on Monday of about 10 per cent gross. The shares closed up 18p at 124p yesterday. The convertible preference shares, which are subject to clawback, have been conditionally placed at Pounds 1 per share with the Bank of Scotland. The fixed cumulative annual dividend on the convertibles is 9.75p (net) and the conversion price is 120p. Cannon Street's strategy is to buy smaller companies and develop them into larger groups for eventual flotation on the market. Mr Bill Hislop, chairman, said of the decision to launch a rights issue, placing and offering: 'A major consideration was that we will be able to float our businesses totally unhampered by gearing considerations.' The group announced its cash call on the market as it reported a 35 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 17.3m for the year to December 31. Turnover rose from Pounds 228.86m to Pounds 281.42m. Interest charges for the year jumped from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 8.47m while operating profits fell 6.8 per cent to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 28.45m). The group increased its bank borrowings to fund investments in its leisure businesses. Since 1989, it has invested about Pounds 30m to expand its hotels and leisure division. The contribution to operating profits from this area rose from Pounds 2.6m to to Pounds 3.1m last year. Only the hotels and leisure and electronics distribution divisions increased operating profits. The business services division was stable but building and building services, food and drink, and home improvements saw operating profits fall. Cannon Street's results include a Pounds 700,000 loss representing its share of the losses of Betacom, the telecommunications company, in which it has a 29 per cent stake. Further extraordinary losses of Pounds 3.3m were related to bad debts and closure and rationalisation costs. Total borrowings were Pounds 106.5m at the year-end against net assets of Pounds 26.4m. Earnings per share fell to 17.21p (24.15p) and an unchanged final dividend of 5.5p was recommended, maintaining the total at 8.80p. Lex, Page 20</p>

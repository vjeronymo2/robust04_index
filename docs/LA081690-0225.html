			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1.5-MILLION ART DONATION TO SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> PHILANTHROPY: FREDERICK R. WEISMAN PROMISES TO GIVE MUSEUM 33 WORKS BY  CALIFORNIA ARTISTS.  </P> <P> A collection of 33 works by California artists worth about $1.5 million has  been promised to the San Diego Museum of Art by Frederick R. Weisman, a  prominent Los Angeles collector.  </P> <P> Final agreements are expected to be signed in the next few days, according to  Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation.  </P> <P> "While the agreement is not signed yet, it certainly looks very favorable. It  appears as though it will happen," Hopkins said, adding that no money is  attached to the gift.  </P> <P> The museum's board of directors accepted the terms of the gift at a meeting  late Tuesday, museum director Steven Brezzo said. Conditions of the gift  include a promise that the works will be on view at all times in a special  gallery in the Balboa Park museum to be designated as the Frederick R. Weisman  Gallery for California Art.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the agreement, the museum would be permitted to occasionally  sell works of art from the collection, but any funds derived from sales would  be designated for additional purchases of works by contemporary California  artists, Brezzo said. Any new acquisitions would become a part of the Weisman  collection.  </P> <P> Hopkins expressed cautious optimism about the gift.  </P> <P> "If it transpires, it would be wonderful from my perspective because we feel  that San Diego, along with San Francisco and Los Angeles, are the major art  centers in California, and the one that doesn't have a strong representation of  California artists is San Diego" Hopkins said. "We hope that this will mean  that now all the cities will have strong collections of California art on view  at all times."  </P> <P> All that remains to complete the arrangements is for museum officials and  Weisman to sign the contracts, Brezzo said.  </P> <P> Weisman, who was unavailable for comment, is widely regarded as one of  California's most prominent collectors of contemporary and modern works of art.  His personal and corporate art collections include more than 1,500 artworks,  valued at up to $60 million.  </P> <P> The proposed gift to the San Diego Museum of Art includes paintings, sculptures  and mixed-media works by 33 artists, according to Weisman's curator, Nora  Halpern Brougher. "They are all major works. It's really a wonderful  collection," Brougher said. Pieces in the proposed donation were assembled by  Weisman and not selected by the San Diego museum, she said.  </P> <P> Among prime works to be donated are one of Robert Irwin's untitled acrylic  discs, a highly regarded example of California "Light/Space" art; John  Baldessari's conceptual work, "Horizontal Men"; and a "Suitcase" assemblage by  Bruce Connor. Works by Sam Francis, David Hockney, Joe Goode, Edward Ruscha,  Chuck Arnoldi, Lita Albuquerque, Billy Al Bengston, Alexis Smith and Tim Ebner  are also in the gift.  </P> <P> Negotiations on the San Diego gift have been in progress since early spring  according to Brezzo. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art and the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento were also  considered for the gift, according to a source close to the deal.  </P> <P> "I had congenial discussions with Henry Hopkins three or four months ago. We  would have been pleased to get those works and integrate them into our  collection even though we already have fine examples by most of the artists,"  said Earl A. Powell, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> But Weisman wanted the collection to be kept intact in a separate gallery and  to be on view at all times. "We don't do that," Powell said. "We integrate our  collections, so we encouraged the foundation to give the works to a museum that  could really benefit from the collection. I think it's great for San Diego."  </P> <P> Crocker curator Janice Driesbach said that she knew nothing of a proposed  Weisman gift, but she said that Weisman had toured the museum with director  Barbara Gibbs, who was out of town and couldn't be reached for comment.  </P> <P> According to Hopkins, Weisman has also said he will donate individual works and  small portions of the collection to other museums throughout the United States,  including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Other gifts would be  smaller than that promised to the San Diego Museum, Hopkins said. Weisman, a  car importer and real-estate magnate, began collecting art in 1952 with his  former wife, Marcia, also a prominent Los Angeles collector. Marcia Weisman's  brother, Norton Simon, is an internationally acclaimed collector whose  collection of Old Masters, Impressionist and Asian art is housed at the Norton  Simon Museum in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Working with Hopkins, former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern  Art, Weisman continues to collect art for the foundation. He also buys for  himself, although the two collections are kept separate.  </P> <P> Weisman, who is 78, has been looking for a home for his collection since the  mid-1980s. He first tried to form a museum in his name that would keep the full  collection intact and considered several locations. The most promising  possibility was the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, but Weisman abandoned  that plan in 1986 when the Beverly Hills City Council began discussing the  possibility of selling the mansion to raise money for schools.  </P> <P> Since the collapse of the Greystone deal, the foundation has focused on  programs in the visual arts rather than searching for a home. One project was a  symposium on international art fairs, held last December in conjunction with  Los Angeles' fourth annual art fair. In July, Weisman brought a group of Soviet  artists and critics to New York and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Weisman is currently fighting a buyout of Mid-Atlantic Toyota by Toyota Motor  Sales U.S.A., the Torrance-based subsidiary of Japan's largest auto maker.  Weisman established Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors Inc. in 1970, when  Japanese importers began to sell cars through independent distributors, but the  Japanese have subsequently bought out most of those distributors to cut costs.  Mid-Atlantic is one of only three independent Toyota distributorships remaining  in the United States. The company had sales of $1.2 billion in 1989 and sold  82,462 Toyotas, more than 9% of Toyota's total U.S. sales.  </P></p>

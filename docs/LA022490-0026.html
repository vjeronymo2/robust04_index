			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACKIE ROBINSON INSPIRED EVERYONE  </P> <P> Let me correct Dick Balos (Feb. 12) on something. Jackie Robinson did not show  the way for "his race."  </P> <P> He showed the way for the human race. To limit Jackie Robinson's  accomplishments to blacks denigrates the stature of one of the nation's  all-time great athletes.  </P> <P> EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON, Inglewood  </P></p>

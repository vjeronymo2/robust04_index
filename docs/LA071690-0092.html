			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL TO FOCUS ON ISSUE OF SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES IN ROCK;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: PARENTS CHARGE A JUDAS PRIEST RECORDING WITH AN ALLEGED MESSAGE SAYING  'DO IT' LED TO SONS' DEATHS. CBS RECORDS DENIES ANY SUCH MESSAGES EXISTED.  </P> <P> We were mesmerized. There was no doubt, no second thought in my mind that I was  going to pull that trigger, even though I didn't want to die.  </P> <P>  -- James Vance  </P> <P> That's how Sparks, Nev., teen-ager James Vance claimed he felt after listening  to an album by British heavy-metal band Judas Priest the day he and a friend  turned a gun on themselves and pulled the trigger.  </P> <P> Vance's best friend, Raymond Belknap, 17, was killed by the self-inflicted  gunshot on that Dec. 23, 1985, afternoon. Vance, 19, survived his suicide  attempt, but was horribly disfigured and died three years later of  complications possibly associated with the incident.  </P> <P> Parents of both young men believe the rock group was responsible for the deaths  of their sons -- and are attempting to prove it in a court trial that begins  today in the Washoe District Court here.  </P> <P> In the unprecedented case, attorneys for the parents will try to persuade the  judge that auditory subliminal messages caused the teen-agers to shoot  themselves. The parents are seeking unspecified money damages to compensate for  the deaths, and to support a child fathered by Vance after the shooting.  </P> <P> They are also seeking to recover money for medical bills plus punitive damages  from CBS Records, which distributed "Stained Class," the 1978 Judas Priest  album that the youths listened to that afternoon.  </P> <P> Kenneth McKenna, co-counsel for the parents, said last week that he believes  many rock bands presently use subliminal messages in their music and he hopes  the Reno case will send a warning to the industry.  </P> <P> "Whether we win or lose this case," McKenna said, "I hope rock bands start to  get the message that they need to be more socially responsible."  </P> <P> Suellen Fulstone, the attorney for CBS Records and Judas Priest, said the  lawsuit may be motivated by reasons that have nothing to do with Judas Priest.  </P> <P> "Although I would not presume to speak for the plaintiffs," Fulstone said,  "this suit, like other product-liability suits, may simply be motivated by the  possibility of recovering money."  </P> <P> If the case against Judas Priest is successful it could have an impact on the  way record companies view artistic expression, say industry observers. They  believe it also could serve as an impetus for other families to file similar  lawsuits.  </P> <P> But Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead, in a legal opinion last August,  suggested that rock 'n' roll is not what is on trial in Reno but that the  employment of auditory subliminal messages is.  </P> <P> In the opinion, Whitehead, who will hear the trial, said that the court  respected the First Amendment right of artists to express themselves, but that  subliminal messages don't enjoy such privileges because they are aimed at the  subconscious.  </P> <P> He based his conclusion on three grounds:  </P> <P> * Subliminal communication does not advance any of the purposes of free speech.  </P> <P> * An individual has a First Amendment right to be free from unwanted speech.  </P> <P> * The listener's right of privacy outweighs the speaker's right of free speech  when subliminal speech is used.  </P> <P> "We must . . . decide whether, under the factual circumstances of this case,  there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the subliminal communications  were a legal cause of the Dec. 23, 1985, shootings."  </P> <P> There is general agreement among all parties regarding the events in the hours  preceding the shootings.  </P> <P> Vance and Belknap spent the afternoon in Belknap's bedroom in his parents'  house, drinking beer, smoking pot and listening to Judas Priest music. In a  sudden fit of violence, they started to punch and kick holes in the walls,  destroying everything in the room but the stereo.  </P> <P> The youths then picked up a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun, jumped out the window  and ran to the playground of a local church. Sitting on a merry-go-round,  Belknap wedged the stock of the gun under his chin and pulled the trigger.  Vance followed suit.  </P> <P> Belknap died immediately. Vance blew the bottom of his face off, but survived,  only to endure three years of painful reconstructive surgery before he died on  Nov. 24, 1988.  </P> <P> Initially, the product-liability suit alleged that violent and suicidal themes  present in Judas Priest's music were the causal factor in the deaths. Attorneys  for the mothers of both teen-agers -- Aunetta Roberson and Phyllis Vance --  filed law suits against Judas Priest and CBS Records, the band's record  company, in 1986. During the next year and a half, Vance cited specific lyrics  from the song "Beyond the Realms of Death" as a motivating factor in the  shootings.  </P> <P> But by October, 1988, the parents' attorneys amended their original complaint,  alleging that specific subliminal messages -- saying "Do it. Do it. . . . " --  had been implanted in a different Judas Priest song, "Better by You, Better  Than Me," and that those messages, in tandem with the record's overt violent  and suicidal imagery, precipitated the suicide attempt. (See related article on  Page 11.)  </P> <P> They also allege that the album contains at least two lines of lyrics that when  played backward reveal satanic messages.  </P> <P> Judas Priest vocalist Robert Halford denies that the band's music has ever  sought to glorify suicide or satanism.  </P> <P> "I've always believed that everything that Judas Priest has done will have a  positive effect because of what we give to people through our music," Halford  said in a 1988 court deposition. "My personal belief and opinion about this  band from 1971 onwards is that everything we have done has been for the good."  </P> <P> Subliminal messages are comparable to post-hypnotic suggestions, experts say,  and have reportedly been used in advertising campaigns since the mid-'50s.  </P> <P> The theory behind visual subliminal imagery, experts also maintain, is that  while subliminal images may flash before the viewer at a very rapid speed, they  can be detected by the human eye and registered in the brain.  </P> <P> But according to Anthony Pellicano, a forensic audio specialist who will  testify for CBS Records, the volume at which alleged auditory subliminal sounds  are produced is not loud enough to cause the eardrum to vibrate. If the eardrum  does not vibrate, he says, then the message cannot be sent to the brain.  </P> <P> Fulstone, the Reno attorney representing CBS and the band, denies the existence  of any subliminal content or backward sounds on the Judas Priest album.  </P> <P> "The subliminal argument is all invention. It has absolutely no basis in fact,"  Fulstone said. "It is simply a vehicle for the plaintiffs to pursue a case that  is otherwise marred by the First Amendment."  </P> <P> Fulstone suggested that the suicide attempts had nothing to do with Judas  Priest's music, but were prompted by a variety of social and psychological  problems that had haunted the youths from childhood.  </P> <P> She pointed to a history of crime, domestic violence and substance abuse in  both of the youths' backgrounds, detailed in Whitehead's legal opinion.  </P> <P> In the opinion, Whitehead said that Vance and Belknap were both violent  individuals who had experienced academic and disciplinary problems. Among the  drugs they used were LSD, speed, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol.  </P> <P> Court records also reveal that both youths were physically abused by their  parents as children, dropped out of school after the 10th grade and drifted  from job to job.  </P> <P> "I do believe that it is a natural response for families who are experiencing  genuine grief over the loss of a loved one to deal with those feelings by  looking for someone to blame," Fulstone said.  </P> <P> Responded McKenna, "Let me answer with a story. If you have a pretty young  daughter and you tell her 20 times, 'Don't walk down the alley behind your  house, it's dangerous.' You warn her, 'Don't wear a short dress.' And you say,  'Don't talk to or take candy from strangers.'  </P> <P> "Then one day she walks down that alley in a short dress and she takes candy  from a freak who violates her, cuts her throat and kills her. She is obviously  at fault. She disobeyed everything you told her to do. But who would you be  angry at?  </P> <P> "Is the freak a factor in the homicide? You bet he is. In this case, CBS is the  freak."  </P> <P> To persuade the court that subliminal messages could have led the two Reno  teen-agers to shoot themselves, attorneys for the parents must first  demonstrate that such messages actually exist on the Judas Priest album.  </P> <P> McKenna and his co-counsel Timothy Post said they are prepared to do so through  the use of a computer program that can detect such messages.  </P> <P> In addition, the attorneys will present testimony by Wilson Bryan Key, an  author and lecturer who maintains that CBS employed subliminals in Judas  Priest's music to increase the marketability of their albums.  </P> <P> "The deaths of James Vance and Ray Belknap provide us with a textbook example  of how subliminal messages surface in human behavior," said Key, who has  consulted on nearly two dozen cases involving homicide, suicide and acts of  violence. "As far as I'm concerned, this is just another example of corporate  willingness to do anything they can to make a buck."  </P> <P> Pellicano, the Los Angeles forensic audio specialist who will testify for CBS  Records, maintained that there is no subliminal content or backward sounds  anywhere on the recording.  </P> <P> "The theory of subliminal messages advanced by the parents' attorneys borders  on deceit and voodooism," Pellicano said.  </P> <P> "For the plaintiffs to suggest that some auditory subliminal scheme is at work  here, it implies that there was a conspiracy of evil in 1978 between Judas  Priest, the engineers, the executives and everyone at CBS involved in the  production to create an album that would cause young people to kill themselves.  Does that sound credible to you?"  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last from three to six weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF JUDAS PRIEST CASEThese are the steps that led to the Judas Priest  trial:  </P> <P> Dec. 23, 1985: Raymond Belknap, 17, and James Vance, 19, each attempted to  commit suicide with a shotgun. Belknap died immediately, but Vance survived the  shooting.  </P> <P> Dec. 24: Vance indicated to police that he attempted suicide because "life  sucks." He did not blame Judas Priest.  </P> <P> Jan. 12, 1986: The father of John McCollum, a 19-year-old California youth who  killed himself in 1984 after listening to a recording by Ozzy Osbourne,  announced his intent to sue Osbourne and CBS Records over his son's death.  Vance's mother read media accounts of the Osbourne suit, according to court  records.  </P> <P> February: Aunetta Roberson (Belknap's mother) contacted attorney Kenneth  McKenna and asked him to file a lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records,  McKenna said. McKenna then contacted the Vance family to see if they would be  interested in joining the suit, but Phyllis Vance declined, according to court  records. In the same month, McKenna called the attorney that filed the Osbourne  suit and received copies of legal papers relating to the McCollum case.  </P> <P> March: Vance told police in that the suicidal themes in Judas Priest's music  might have caused the shootings.  </P> <P> April: Vance wrote a letter to Belknap's mother saying that the Judas Priest  album "mesmerized" both youths into believing the "answer to life was death."  </P> <P> May 8: McKenna filed a lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records on behalf  of Roberson.  </P> <P> July 10: A separate suit was filed on behalf of the Vance family. The cases  were consolidated Dec. 3, 1986.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the parents asked CBS to turn over the 24-track master recording  of Judas Priest's "Stained Class" album for analysis. McKenna said that CBS  told him that the master recordings were lost. The company did deliver a master  copy of one song on the album entitled "Better by You, Better Than Me."  </P> <P> July 12, 1988: The California District Court of Appeals ruled that Osbourne's  music is protected by the First Amendment and dismissed the McCollum suit.  </P> <P> October, 1988: A Sacramento audio engineer allegedly detected "subliminal"  messages on the Judas Priest song. The families then alleged that these  subliminal messages precipitated the suicide attempt.  </P> <P> Nov. 15: James Vance was admitted to the psychiatric unit of the Washoe Medical  Center; he died Nov. 24 of heart failure.  </P> <P> Aug. 23, 1989: Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehood ruled that subliminal  messages are not protected by the First Amendment and recommended the case be  tried before a jury.  </P> <P> July 9, 1990: Whitehead accepted an agreement between both sides in the case to  waive a jury trial.CHUCK PHILIPS  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge tumbles 59.7% FLETCHER Challenge, New Zealand's largest industrial company, has announced a 59.7 per cent fall in net profits, to NZDollars 151.6m (USDollars 82.4m), for the six months to December. It said difficult trading conditions had forced it to cut NZDollars 100m from its forecast profits of NZDollars 400m for the full year. The company also said it was cutting its dividend from 11.5 cents a share to 7 cents, a move that was foreshadowed at the December annual meeting. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said prices in a number of areas appeared to have bottomed out. He said he could more confidently forecast substantial cyclical earnings recoveries over the next few years. Pulp and paper operations lost NZDollars 79.4m, compared with a profit of NZDollars 75.8m for the same period of last year. Earnings from energy and gas remained strong. Oil and gas earned NZDollars 149.7m against NZ143.6m, and petrochemicals rose to NZDollars 46m from Dollars NZ37.4m. The primary sector earned NZDollars 50.8m compared with NZDollars 36.2m, including Dollars NZ47.4m from the Rural Bank. Harsh conditions in the international building sector saw earnings fall to NZDollars 17m from NZDollars 62.5m. Mr Fletcher said the company achieved operating records at its plants, helped by recent upgrades and lower costs due to restructuring. Extraordinary losses totalled NZDollars 31.8m compared with gains of NZDollars 51.8m. The group sold NZDollars 500m worth of assets in the period and is on target to sell NZDollars 750m in the full year. Sales of NZDollars 352m were included in the latest results, including forestry-related assets in British Colombia and Quebec. The sale of its Petrochem ammonia urea plant, for NZDollars 45.5m, will be completed in the second half. Turnover was NZDollars 6.28bn, down from NZDollars 6.78m. Operating earnings fell to NZDollars 433.4m from NZDollars 654m and investment earnings advanced to NZDollars 14.8m from NZDollars 8.9m, while funding costs were cut to NZDollars 330.8m from NZDollars 335.6m. Tax took NZDollars 56.2m compared with NZDollars 900,000. Ordinary shareholders' funds advanced to NZDollars 5.84bn from NZ5bn. Earnings per share fell to 8.6 cents from 27.9 cents, while net asset per share rose to NZDollars 3.80 from NZDollars 3.64. Hugh Fletcher, some prices seemed to have hit bottom</p>

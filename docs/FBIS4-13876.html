			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Labor Party Criticizes Emergency Law Extension    2. AL-AHRAM Bans Publication of Fahmi Huwaydi's Column    3. Conference on Minorities in the Arab World    4.

Corruption in Egypt  <H5>  LABOR PARTY CRITICIZES EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION </H5>   On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B carries a 350-word report on a  statement issued by the Labor Party Political Bureau commenting  on the People's Assembly's extension of the Emergency Law for  another three years effective 1 June 1994. The statement says  that "the only justification which the government has made for  extending the emergency law is fighting terrorism." The  statement notes, however, that acts of terrorism have actually  increased and escalated under the emergency law, which goes to  prove "that this law is one of the reasons for the growth of the  phenomenon of terrorism in Egypt." The statement adds that one  of the aims of the Emergency Law is to "weaken the opposition  forces" in the coming People's Assembly and local councils  elections. The statement further notes that this law  "conflicts" with the government's call for a national dialogue.  <H5>  AL-AHRAM BANS PUBLICATION OF FAHMI HUWAYDI'S COLUMN </H5>   AL-SHA'B carries a front-page 50-word report that "a column  by Fahmi Huwaydi that the newspaper AL-AHRAM publishes regularly  every Tuesday has been banned." The reports adds that the  banning of the column "Dialogue on the Application of the  Shar'iah" comes in the wake of the recent campaign against this  writer, a campaign that has culminated in the publication of two  articles in Al-ARAM by two of Huwaydi's colleages.  <H5>  CONFERENCE ON MINORITIES IN THE ARAB WORLD </H5>   A 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 says Sudan has officially  asked Egypt to prevent the holding of a conference on  "Minorities in the Arab World" due to be held in Cairo in May.  The conference has been called at the urging of the rebel  leaders in Southern Sudan. A letter reportedly sent by Sudanese  Foreign Minister Husayn Abu Salih to Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa expresses concern over the aims of the conference "in  light of the foreign plots and designs aimed partitioning Sudan."  <H5>  WRITER BLAMES GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLENCE </H5>   A 2,000-word article on page 3 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im says  the Egyptian government has resorted to "crude repression" of  its political opponents while opting for peace in dealing with  the "criminal Jews." The writer says "Egypt is living through  the most critical phase of its history," and adds that "for the  first time we see Egyptians fighting each other and blood being  spilled everywhere." The writer notes that like all the states  of the region, Egypt is witnessing "an overwhelming Islamic  awakening" affecting all aspects of life and that "society is  gradually turning toward Islam." The writer says the Islamic  movement in Egypt is the strongest in the region in view of its  history and long experience. The Islamic movement "aims to  establish an Islamic state." The writer adds that "despite the  propaganda campaign against it, the Islamic Group [al-jama'ah  al-islamiyah] enjoys widespread support in the quarters where it  is active."  <H5>  'ADIL HUSAYN ARTICLE COMMENTS ON EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION </H5>   A 2,000-word article on page 7 by Labor Party Secretary  General 'Adil Husayn deals mainly with the People's Assembly's  extension of the Emergency Law for another three years. Husayn  wonders why the People's Assembly hurriedly approved this  extension, given that the current law expires in two months.  Acknowledging that the extension is a reality and that nothing  can be done about it, he asks the Government to adhere to the  provisions of this "black law which, despite its ugliness, does  not permit the torture of detainees." After noting that torture  has become widespread and systematic in Egyptian prisons, he  says "this fascistic torture is not allowed by the Emergency  Law" and "this continuing detention of the thousands--despite  court release orders--is a blatant violation of the emergency  law." Rebutting as "misleading" the government's argument that  the emergency law is solely intended for use against terrorists  and does not target ordinary citizens or political opponents,  Husayn cites the "indiscriminate" arrest of citizens and the  months-long siege of entire cities. He also cites the arrest  and intimidation of citizens who attend opposition party  congresses and rallies. Husayn concludes that the continuation  of the emergency law since 1981 is not intended to confront  "armed violence" but to spread "general fear" and "muzzle" the  opposition.   <H5>    CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE </H5>   A 500-word report by Khalid Yunis on AL-SHA'B's page 4 says  "The Egyptian Committee in Support of the Palestinian People's  Struggle" held its second conference at the Lawyers Association  on 12 April. Addressing the conference, Labor Party's Ibrahim  Shukri said "Israel was planted in the region" to break the Arab  and Islamic ranks. He reviewed Israel's "belligerent" practices  from its destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor to its attacks  on southern Lebanon, noting that Israel enjoys the "absolute  support" of the United States, which supplies it with the most  sophisticated weapons. Shukri denounced the Arab governments'  harassment of the Palestinians regarding their movement and work.    Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called "for  the need to adopt practical steps to support the struggling  Palestinian people." He noted that the PLO-Israeli Government  agreement aims at "ending the intifadah at the hands of the  Palestinian force which will replace the occupation forces."  Al-Hudaybi noted that Egyptian television played down the  Hebron massacre while it highlighted the interview with former  al-Shawqiyun terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whom he describes as  an "intelligence agent."  <H5>  RISE OF ISLAMIC INFLUENCE IN TURKEY </H5>   A 250-word report on page 8 says the Islamic Welfare Party  in  Turkey has organized a huge demonstration in Istanbul to protest  the "massacre" of Muslims in Bosnia. The 5,000 demonstrators  called on the Turkish Government and the Islamic states to sever  relations with the Yugoslav Federation. They also marched to  the U.S. Consulate and pelted it with stones. The report notes  the Welfare Party's victory in the recent municipal elections in  Ankara, Istanbul, and other Turkish towns.  <H5>  IRAN SUPPORTS PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR EFFORTS </H5>   A 500-word report on page 8 by Ayman 'Ali cites a speech  that  Iranian Consultative Assembly Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri  delivered to the Pakistani Parliament recently. Nateq-Nuri  said that "the West is trying to put pressure on the Islamic  states so that they will remain at its mercy." He affirmed  "Iran's support for Pakistan's nuclear efforts," denounced the  pressure on Islamabad to abandon its nuclear program, and asked  "why is Israel not coming under the same pressure?"  <H5>  CORRUPTION IN EGYPT </H5>   AL-SHA'B carries a 1250-word report on page 9 which says  that on 12 April the Youth Committee of the Lawyers Association  discussed a paper submitted to it by AL-SHA'B Chief Editor Majdi  Ahmad Husayn on corruption in Egypt. In his paper, Husayn says  "political corruption" is the most serious because it directly  affects society and becomes an example to others and a way of  life. He adds that "when the higher leadership entrusted with  fighting corruption itself becomes corrupt, society enters a  vicious circle." As for social corruption, it is manifested by  the spread of financial and administrative corruption in  society, which makes it difficult for citizens to earn an honest  living. Hence, breaking the law becomes a rule of survival. As  for moral corruption, it is similar to political corruption.  The state-owned media encourage this corruption, which is  apparent in the legalizing of alcohol, gambling, houses of  prostitution, and pornographic films. Husayn attributes the  spread of political corruption to several factors, the most  important of which is the absence of real democracy since 1981.  Consequently, a ruling class has emerged that has no clear  message and whose only concern is to remain in power. On the  ways of stopping the wheel of corruption, Husayn calls for the  passing of a law on prosecuting ministers and strengthening the  independence of the courts.    Muslim Brotherhood Representative Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud then  spoke about the importance of education as a way to reform.  This includes training the "soul to fight vice through hand,  mouth, and heart." However, he added, it seems that "fighting  vice by word of mouth" has become every difficult now that the  press has been muzzled and in view of the restrictions on the  printing of magazines and publications.    Husayn Jabir Muhammad and Muntasir al-Zayyat spoke on behalf  of the Islamic Group. Muhammad noted that the root cause of  corruption is the "separation between state and religion and the  non-application of the Islamic shari'ah." Al-Zayyat referred to  the importance of upholding morals in addition to legal measures  to prevent the spread of corruption.    Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called on the  various parties and trends to put aside their differences and  concentrate on fighting corruption.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> The Industrial Areas Foundation organizations in Southern California (UNO,  SCOC, EVO and VOICE) have been created with a vision of people with various  racial and ethnic backgrounds working together to solve common problems facing  urban America. In 1984, United Neighborhoods Organization, based in East Los  Angeles, and the Southern California Organizing Committee, based in South  Central, signed a Covenant of Unity in the presence of 7,000 African-American  and Latino leaders.  </P> <P> Joel Kotkin's "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting Pot" (Nov. 5)  contained an unfortunate misquote and misinterpretation of a remark by SCOC  leader Fritizer Hopkins. ("The jobs that used to go to blacks are now going to  Latinos.")  </P> <P> The new service economy -- so visible in Southern California -- has created a  great many new jobs. Most of these jobs are low-paying; many are filled by  recent immigrants. Our organizations have demonstrated a commitment to the  workers filling these new jobs. A pluralistic society, which respects the  dignity of all individuals, is at the heart of our value system.  </P> <P> REV. WILLIAM R. JOHNSON JR., SCOC  </P> <P> REV. CURTIS M. PAGE, VOICE  </P> <P> FRITIZER HOPKINS, SCOC  </P> <P> DR. LOUIS R. NEGRETE, UNO  </P> <P> MARGARITA VARGAS, EVO  </P> <P> Monrovia  </P></p>

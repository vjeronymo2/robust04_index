			<p>Japan's      prolonged economic slump may be playing a role in  changing archetypical Japanese business practices such as  maintaining long-term supplier-buyer relationships between  materials producers and manufacturers.  Recent Japanese press  reports suggest that a number of Japanese automakers have decided  to emphasize economic rationality over stable business  relationships with Japanese steelmakers.  Reflecting this trend,  the 21 April Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun quoted Mitsubishi Motors  executives as stating that from now on they would buy steel from  "any domestic or foreign supplier that can supply appropriate  quality steel at a lower price."  A day earlier, Nihon Keizai  Shimbun reported that Mitsubishi Motors estimated that it could  cut total car production costs by at least 10 percent if it used  South Korean steel.  The paper also reported that Mitsubishi  Motors has for the first time begun testing the quality of cold  rolled steel sheet made by South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel  Company for use in its cars.  The paper also noted that all  Japanese automakers except Toyota are discreetly considering the  use of South Korean steel to cut costs.     (AUTHOR:  INNES.

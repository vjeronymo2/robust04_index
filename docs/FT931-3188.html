			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Postponing of tax rises welcomed by economists MR LAMONT'S strategy of postponing tax increases to steer the economy out of recession was given a general welcome by academic and business economists. Professor Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University and one of the government's seven independent economic advisers, called the delay in tax rises 'absolutely excellent'. Prof David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, another of the 'seven wise men', called the Budget 'reasonably favourable.' He added, however: 'It was a bit light on medium-term financial strategy. It didn't really address concern that the low exchange rate could feed through to prices.' Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, another of the 'wise men' said: 'The Budget contained some unnecessarily depressing arithmetic. The tax rises from 1994-95 on are not needed since the fiscal deficit will come down as recovery takes place.' Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director of the Confederation of British Industry said: 'I would give Mr Lamont seven marks out of 10. In spelling out a programme of tax increases, he is responding to financial markets' concerns but is running the risk of damaging confidence in the short term.' Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and a member of the government panel, said he was pleased the Budget was 'broadly neutral'. Mr Britton added, however, that the chancellor should have greatly increased funds targeted to help for the unemployed while aid for industry appeared ill-targeted. 'The funds for the unemployed are much too small. We're going to have an output recovery, but not an employment recovery.' By contrast, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said: 'I would have liked Mr Lamont to have been much tougher on tax es in the coming financial year and to have eased monetary policy at the same time.' Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at the capital markets division in of National Westminster Bank, said: 'On balance the Budget was as good as anyone could have expected. I was worried by the projection of a Pounds 50bn government deficit next year.' Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, described the speech as a 'reforming budget' which the market would take some time to absorb. Professor Tim Congdon, economic adviser at the Gerrard &amp; National, discount house, and another of the seven wise men, said: 'I welcome the tax increases but the reaction from financial markets would have been much better had they come in straight away. The chancellor has not got the right balance between fiscal and monetary policy.'</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The gas-man cometh: Robert Corzine on Qatar's efforts to shift its fortunes The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday in Geneva amid continuing signs that its members lack the political will to make the deep production cuts needed to drive up oil prices, now lingering near five-year lows. There are fears in Opec that its influence on prices might weaken further in a world where oil supplies from independent producers remain abundant. The expectation that production quotas may stay at low levels for the next three years or so has prompted some members to look beyond oil for new sources of income. For Qatar, the quintessential small Gulf emirate, oil revenues have allowed the 150,000-200,000 Qataris to live free from material want and taxes. But a combination of declining reserves and weak prices has prompted the ruling al-Thani family to base its international commercial ambitions on the one resource in which Qatar is a giant - natural gas. The world's largest single concentration of natural gas, likely to become the fastest growing and most environmentally acceptable fuel, lies off the coast of Qatar in the North field. Qatar is already a privileged society, where petrol costs the equivalent of just 50p a gallon, less than bottled water, and housing is heavily subsidised. An army of expatriate workers from India, Pakistan and the Philippines fill blue-collar and lower-level clerical jobs, leaving most local males free to fill management positions in the public sector. Women mainly remain at home. But this state of affairs is based on dwindling reserves of 3.7bn barrels of oil, modest by Middle East standards and likely to last for only another 25-30 years. Hence the attempt to shift Qatar's fortunes from oil to gas. In January these ambitions surfaced in a way which sent shock waves through the Arab world. Officials confirmed direct talks with Israel about supplying natural gas in spite of the Arab economic boycott. Syria in particular was furious that Qatar might undermine the embargo before a comprehensive settlement was in place. But Qatar has shrugged off the criticism. Mr Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister, now concedes gas sales to Israel would depend on a peace settlement between Tel Aviv and its neighbours. But a feasibility study will go ahead and 'Qatar is ready to supply gas to anyone' if commercial terms are right, he says. 'We consider Israel as we would any other potential customer.' Qatar's commercial drive is fuelled by the North field's 227,000bn cubic feet of proven reserves, a pool of gas which dwarfs UK reserves of 19,100bn cubic feet. Experts say Qatar's reserves could last 200 years. The challenge for the country is to ensure that its two multi-billion-dollar gas export projects based on North field reserves - known as Qatar Gas and Ras Laffan Gas - come onstream in the late 1990s. Success in these inaugural schemes might open the way for further, more lucrative gas projects. But expanding gas infrastructure established for domestic purposes into one of the world's biggest exporters is proving difficult. All large gas export projects are tricky to put together. The capital costs for liquefied natural gas or pipeline projects run into billions of dollars, while it can take 25 years or more to recoup the investment and make a profit. Oil can be sold on well-established markets in London and New York, but gas producers must first line up buyers willing to enter long-term contracts and agree a complex pricing formula linked in part to unknown, future oil prices. Qatar's task has been complicated by inexperience on international capital markets. Its location is also problematic - far from the world's main gas markets but at the heart of potential conflict, sandwiched between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has a small portion of the North Field in its territorial waters. Yet Qatar is managing to bring its gas export plans to fruition where similar projects suggested in many countries' in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, Africa and Asia remain mere paper planning. The infrastructure for both Qatar's gas export projects is being built at the port of Ras Laffan. A visit reveals the scale of the task. Camels graze on scrub vegetation just yards from the fence enclosing the largest port construction project under way worldwide. Offshore, the world's second-largest dredger works alongside the 6km-long main breakwater that juts into the Gulf to shelter the harbour for liquefied natural gas carriers. By the time the port is completed next year, Dollars 750m will have been spent and Qatar will have established its credibility as a prospective gas exporter. But that is only the beginning of a stream of financial commitments and construction milestones which Qatar must meet in coming years. The first hurdle is the financing of Qatar Gas, the first of the two projects. Costing Dollars 4bn, it will supply 4m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year to Japan from 1997. Financing of the deal was been split into chunks to ensure that 'it didn't scare off international markets', according to one western banker. Japanese banks and government agencies dominate the financing of the 'downstream' processing and transport portion of Qatar Gas. This includes Dollars 1.6bn for a liquefaction plant and Dollars 1.8bn for seven liquefied natural gas carriers. Within weeks Qatar will choose from among three competing consortia of banks from the US, Europe and the Gulf to arrange the final tranche of the Dollars 4bn total, amounting to Dollars 650m-Dollars 700m. This will pay for the offshore platforms and pipelines to produce and bring the gas ashore. 'Qatar's future access to international financial markets is largely conditional on the success of this financing,' says a western banker. The financing of a second, larger and more expensive project, Ras Laffan Gas led by Mobil Oil of the US, will need to follow shortly afterwards if it is to meet its 1998 start-up date to export up to 9m tonnes of liquefied gas a year to South Korea and Taiwan. A third project, Eurogas, to supply gas to Italy has collapsed. Europe remains a coveted market for Qatar gas, but there are doubts that such a project will pay until well into the next century. Not every Opec member has the gas reserves to emulate Qatar. Those states that do, such as Iran and Nigeria, are keen to initiate projects, while existing exporters, such as Algeria and Indonesia, are expanding their activities. But all will remain dependent on oil revenues until well into the next century.</p>

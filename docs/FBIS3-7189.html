			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today granted an  interview to reporters at the Bangkok International Airport  before making an official trip to the southern province of  Pattani on the fighting situation in Cambodia.    He said that according to the latest information received,  25,000 Cambodians have fled into Thai territory. Thailand  therefore has to provide them with shelter and safety in line  with humanitarian practice. No time period has been set for  repatriation. They will be sent home once the fighting in  Cambodia ends. In case the problem becomes a prolonged one, the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will be requested  to take care of them again. At the time being, he was not sure  whether coordination has been made with the UN.    On the question of Cambodian armed forces encroaching on  Thai  territory, the prime minister said that if that happens,  Thailand will have to take action in accordance with the rules.  Any Cambodian faction would have to be disarmed in order to  avoid any international conflict.    On the fear that the Thai border will be used as a base for  a  Cambodian faction, Chuan said that issue should not be a  concern, as he has instructed the officials involved to prevent  such problems from occurring. Therefore, the Thai people should  feel relaxed on this matter.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Arafat's homecoming plan takes Israel by surprise Mr Yassir Arafat, who took the Palestinian cause from an armed guerrilla struggle to a negotiated peace with Israel, is to make a historic return to his homeland on Saturday. Mr Arafat's planned visit to the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip at the weekend will be an emotional moment for the 2m Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and the 4m in exile as refugees - symbolising the right of Palestinians to return home and affirming the Palestinian aspiration to an independent state. In a surprise move characteristic of the veteran PLO leader's theatrical style, Mr Arafat decided yesterday morning that he wanted to visit the Gaza Strip for three days. The decision came after weeks of hesitation. The hasty decision, made by Mr Arafat alone, left Israeli and PLO officials in a state of shock. Israel had long maintained that Mr Arafat should give two weeks' notice to allow the Jewish state to take the necessary security precautions in the face of possible violent disturbances from both Palestinian and Israeli opponents. But late last night Israel decided to waive this requirement and Mr Oded Ben-Ami, a spokesman for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said: 'I can confirm the fact that the chairman will be coming on Saturday.' Mr Ben-Ami said after a high-level government meeting that Mr Arafat had wanted to begin his visit tomorrow but that Israel had insisted Saturday would be the earliest feasible date to allow the Jewish state to take the necessary security measures. He said Mr Arafat had agreed to the Saturday date. The PLO was also caught by surprise by Mr Arafat's decision. Several senior PLO officials from Gaza and the West Bank were out of the country and were reported to be scrambling to find flights home in time for Mr Arafat's arrival. In a PLO office in Tunis no more than 100 yards from Mr Arafat's residence, the first one official knew of the trip was a telephone call from a local journalist seeking confirmation. The official responded that he knew nothing. PLO officials said they believed the key to Mr Arafat's decision was a message on Tuesday night from Mr Ahmed Qurei, economic minister in the Palestinian self-rule authority, that agreement had been reached in Washington on releasing more aid. Mr Qurei had apparently managed to increase monthly dispersals from a special fund from Dollars 10m to Dollars 13m (Pounds 8.5m). More than Dollars 720m has been pledged to the Palestinians for the first year of self-rule, but the bulk of the aid is for specific development projects and many donors have sought to prevent their contributions going directly to the PLO. Other PLO officials said Mr Arafat was confronted yesterday with an international media review which made him look foolish for his indecision over the visit. In Israel news of Mr Arafat's impending arrival was greeted by virulent criticism from the right-wing opposition. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, said the visit was the height of national humiliation and marked the capitulation of the government of Israel to the idea of a Palestinian state. Thousands of Israeli settlers were expected to demonstrate their opposition to the visit. Leaders of Jewish settlers in the occupied Arab lands called for mass demonstrations to oppose the visit and said they would seek to bring Jerusalem to a standstill by civil disobedience.</p>

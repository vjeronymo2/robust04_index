			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Broker Scandals Must Be </F> Avoided"]    [Text] "The utilization of the surplus of financial  institutions must be regulated, and this has been made  especially timely by the case of the Lupis Brokerage," Lajos  Kosa, parliamentary representative for Fidesz [Federation of  Young Democrats] said. In this case, the state, and indirectly  the citizens, suffered a loss. But this was not the first such  scandal, because when the Ybl Bank went bankrupt, almost 2  million forints from budgetary institutions were lost.    In the opinion of Fidesz, the financing of the institutions  cannot be regulated in such a way that they would have no  surplus at all from time to time. But if they do have a surplus,  it is expedient to invest it, and in such a way that the money  would be in the safest possible place. In the opinion of Fidesz  it would be desirable for budgetary institutions to invest only  in treasury bonds and other government bonds.</p>

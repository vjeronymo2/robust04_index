			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / A model to smash the mould: Ford's fortunes are riding on the success of its new family car, launched today In the biggest roll of the dice in its history Ford today unveils a range of large family cars, the Mondeo, which is destined to determine its fortunes in Europe and north America during the 1990s. The gamble comes with a price tag of about Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn), as Ford seeks to demonstrate that, for the first time, it is capable of developing a range which can be both manufactured and sold in the two continents. The six-year Mondeo programme, code-named CDW27 since its conception in the mid-1980s, is the most ambitious and costly programme undertaken by the US vehicle maker. It marks a radical break with Ford tradition. The Fiestas, Escorts, Sierras and Granada/Scorpios sold in Europe have little, if anything, in common with the Ford Escorts, Tempos, Taurus and Crown Victorias sold in north America. Traditionally, the north American and European operations of the world's second-largest vehicle maker have operated as independent fiefdoms, guarding the right to design, develop and manufacture for their markets. Below the top management level there has been an ingrained scepticism and mistrust towards product ideas emanating from the other continent. The Mondeo is supposed to break the mould. For Ford of Europe the launch comes as the company battles against two years of heavy losses and declining market share. It is cutting more than 10,000 jobs or 11 per cent of its workforce across its European operations. Largely developed at Ford's European R&amp;D centres in Germany and in the UK, the Mondeo is set to replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in March, and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in north America, where it will be launched in 1994. Sales of the 11-year-old Sierra have been falling in the past two years. Ford urgently needs a new product in the large family car market, which accounts for about 20 per cent of the total west European new car market. Competition in the segment is becoming intense, however. The Sierra has been sidelined by more powerful rivals, General Motors' Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier and Volkswagen's Passat. This is the market targeted by Japanese carmakers for their first European-built cars, the Nissan Primera, Honda Accord and Toyota Carina, now in production in the UK. For Ford, the significance of the Mondeo project goes well beyond Europe. It has reformed its engineering and manufacturing infrastructure in America and Europe to break down entrenched barriers between the two, as it has set out to develop a mainstream car acceptable in both markets. The Mondeo will be assembled at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium - volume production started this week - and at Kansas City in the US. The same family of four-cylinder engines will be made at plants in Bridgend in the UK and at Cologne in Germany for Europe, and at Chihuahua in Mexico for north America. A top-of-the-range aluminium V6 engine will be made at Cleveland, Ohio, for both the US and European-produced cars. Manual transmissions will be made in Europe at Halewood, Merseyside, in the UK and at Cologne, while an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic gearbox will be made in the US. After a global search, common component producers have been chosen to supply both the European and north American assembly plants. Ford's top management has long been tantalised by the holy grail of the so-called world car, and by the savings that should be achieved by developing a product once for both manufacture and sale in different continents. It has tried before to develop a world car, but the Ford Escorts launched at the beginning of the 1980s in Europe and north America ended up with little more in common than the name and the blue Ford oval badge on the bonnet. Mr Philip Benton, Ford president until he retired at the end of December, was one of the company's most outspoken champions of 'global car' development. He claims that the Mondeo is 'writing a new chapter' in Ford's world-car story, incorporating many lessons from the troubled Escort programme, where the company set up two distinct product development teams, one on each side of the Atlantic. 'When there were opportunities to deviate from the shared engineering plan, both teams made the most of them, protecting their own turf and defending their own ideas about what constituted the 'right' product,' says Mr Benton. For Mondeo, Ford has developed a global technical communications system to gather critical engineering information and to distribute it to the group's design and manufacturing engineers in a common language. Eventually the network is supposed to unite 20,000 engineers in north and south America, Europe, Australia and the Far East. Ford claims that the most immediate advantage from a global programme like Mondeo is in direct development and investment costs. 'A global company can concentrate its resources where they will be used most efficiently,' says Mr Benton. He says there is also an 'enormous' potential for improvement in quality, and product options such as engine size can be simplified. A global car programme also offers greater cost-effectiveness through the worldwide sourcing of components, both from inside Ford and from outside suppliers, Mr Benton adds. For the Mondeo programme alone Ford will be spending Dollars 2.5bn a year on components bought from outside suppliers. According to Mr Albert Caspers, Ford of Europe's director of manufacturing, the share taken by north American suppliers of the European-built Mondeo has jumped to 15 per cent from only 1 per cent to 2 per cent in Ford of Europe's traditional programmes. 'We have also brought many European suppliers to north America and some have made joint ventures in the US,' he says. 'The philosophy was to develop a part only once from one supplier for the world. This is the first project where we have done this. And we began to source parts up to four years before the first car was due to be produced. That is a radical departure.' Ford estimates that about Dollars 140m worth of components will be exported annually to north America from Europe with about Dollars 260m worth of components coming from north America to Europe as part of the Mondeo programme. Mr Caspers claims that the company has more than halved its traditional number of suppliers to only 200 component makers, supplying about 80 per cent by value of Mondeo parts and systems. 'We are also going more than ever before to just-in-time delivery,' says Mr Caspers. About 14 suppliers have set up production within a 30km radius of the Genk plant to ensure simultaneous delivery of parts to the assembly line with no stock held in the car plant. As Ford of Europe seeks to regain profitability, the Mondeo programme also offers significant productivity gains in the assembly process. For the first time at any of its European assembly plants Ford is moving to three-shift, round-the-clock working at Genk, enabling it to catch up with the precedent set by General Motors at the end of the 1980s. Production capacity for the Mondeo at Genk has been increased to 1,970 a day or 400,000 a year, compared with a maximum of 1,500 a day for the Sierra. The Kansas City plant will initially have a capacity to produce 250,000 a year. If the Mondeo gamble pays off, Ford will have taken a big step towards closing the gap in cost and efficiency on its Japanese rivals. At six years, the development programme was still too long by the best world standards, but few vehicle projects have been so complex, and Ford has since lowered its target for current projects to four years. The programme has pioneered significant changes in Ford's engineering organisation. It has introduced new methods of design for easier manufacture, adopted more rigorously simultaneous engineering techniques and formed new long-term R&amp;D relationships with Ford's leading suppliers. After the Escort fiasco, the company appears to have crossed big hurdles towards building an organisation capable of achieving a world car. The question is whether world markets and consumer tastes will converge to allow Ford to reap future cost benefits based on lessons learnt with Mondeo. Ford will need to repeat this trick in other segments of the global car market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party deputy leader Abdullah Gul has said  that even if it has to act alone, Turkey must violate the arms  embargo imposed on the Bosnian Muslims.    At a news conference in parliament, Abdullah Gul said that  the weapons of the former Yugoslavia are now in the hands of  Serbs and that many countries are openly giving arms to the  Serbs. The Bosnians are still under an arms embargo, he said,  and are left defenseless before the Serbs.    Gul stressed that Turkey must urgently violate the embargo  and withdraw the Turkish ship serving with the United Nations in  the Adriatic Sea. Turkey is the first country that must help  Bosnia, he said, and within this framework, the defense weapons  requested by the Bosnians must be sent there without delay.</p>

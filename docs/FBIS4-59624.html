			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, Palestinian negotiator in </F> the peace talks, by Brigitte Voykowitsch; place and date not  given: "`Jerusalem is a Time Bomb, Because the Israelis Are  Lacking in Sensitivity'"]    [Text] [Voykowitsch] Even moderate Palestinians are  skeptical about the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Is the treaty that  bad?    [Abu-Zayyad] The texts of the treaty themselves are not bad.  There are too many restrictions of Palestinian authority. But  those supporting the agreement have stressed that this is the  first time that representatives of the Zionist ideology have  accepted a withdrawal. Palestinians have always considered  Zionist ideology as being expansionist. And this is the first  time that Palestinians have part of the authority.    [Voykowitsch] What danger comes from the opponents of the  agreement, the radicals, such as Hamas, and the groups in  Damascus?    [Abu-Zayyad] A number of unfair conditions have been imposed  on the Palestinians in the peace process, starting with  regulations determining which Palestinians shall be allowed to  negotiate. This has resulted in many Palestinians feeling that  the process as such is unfair, and thus any outcome is unfair.    These critics will have a control function in the process.  They will make sure that the negotiators do not make too many  concessions and keep the interests and requirements of their  people in mind.    [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that even the role of the Hamas  and the radical Palestinian groups in Damascus is a constructive  one?    [Abu-Zayyad] These groups are not opposed to peace, they  have a supervisory role. They will not seek confrontation with  the Palestinian police or the self-rule authorities.    [Voykowitsch] The refugee problem is still unsolved.    [Abu-Zayyad] We have to distinguish three groups of  refugees: those of 1948, those of 1967, and those who left the  territories with Israeli permission and were not allowed to  return. The latter two -- that is nearly 800,000 people -- must  be allowed to return immediately. Israel has no excuse for  preventing this.    The refugees of 1948 (who left regions that are Israeli  territory today) have a basic right to return. We do, however,  understand that Israel wants to remain a Jewish state and will,  therefore, not allow these refugees to come back as this would  mean losing the Jewish majority. We must base our negotiations  on UN Resolution 194, which speaks of return or compensation.    [Voykowitsch] Jerusalem is not on the official agenda before  the second part of the peace process starts. But there are  unofficial forums. What is the state of talks?    [Abu-Zayyad] The Israelis annexed East Jerusalem in 1967.  But for years they have been establishing new Jewish  neighborhoods there and have built settlement belts around the  city. This means they are changing their status, although UN  resolutions demand that the status quo be maintained.    The Israelis must be aware of this: No Palestinian, no Arab,  no Islamic leader will conclude a comprehensive peace with  Israel unless the Jerusalem question has been settled.    [Voykowitsch] How are talks proceeding at the moment?    [Abu-Zayyad] At the first meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin  we brought up the East Jerusalem topic. On Rabin's suggestion a  committee was formed, with each side delegating two  representatives. I was one of them. But two months ago, the  Israelis broke everything off.    This means that the old regulations that were introduced by  the Israelis last year apply. Under these, every Arab wanting  to got to East Jerusalem from the territories needs a kind of  visa. This way they are killing off our institutions in the  city.    Jerusalem is a time bomb, because the Israelis are lacking  in  sensitivity. They never think about the importance that the  city has for Christians and Muslims. I can only hope that they  will remember this in time. Otherwise there will be an  explosion. For, whatever agreements we conclude, unless we can  protect the rights of the Arabs in East Jerusalem, everything  will collapse.</p>

"We followed the four points I put on the (locker room) board: Be sound, be  patient, be positive and stick together."  </P> <P> Studer started the drive with pass plays of 29 yards to Foster and 16 to Jeff  Exum. On fourth and nine on the Boise 34-yard line, Studer hit Keith Fitzgerald  at the 17. After a penalty, Studer, who had been limping with a sore knee, ran  12 yards to the 10 to set up the final pass to Foster.  </P> <P> Studer completed 20 of 38 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns. Exum caught  seven passes for 188 yards.  </P> <P> Long Beach took a 7-0 lead on the third play of the game when Freddie Leslie  ran 73 yards for a touchdown, but did nothing further for almost three quarters  against the Division I-AA Broncos (3-2).  </P></p>

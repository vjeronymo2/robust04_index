			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and French President Francois Mitterrand agreed  Wednesday [4 May] that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  program threatens the global move toward preventing the spread  of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers.    The two leaders shared the understanding during a two-hour  meeting at the French Presidential Palace, Japanese officials  said.    The meeting took place after Hata arrived in Paris from Rome  as part of his European tour, which will also take him to  Germany and Belgium.    They said Hata told Mitterrand that the North Korean nuclear  issue "is a serious problem that threatens the nuclear  nonproliferation regime, as well as undermines the security of  the Asia-Pacific region."    Hata also said, "we must counter the threat in solidarity,  while keeping the channels for (diplomatic) dialogue open."    Mitterrand agreed with Hata's view, the Japanese officials  said.    On China, Hata told Mitterrand, "it is important for China  to  provide greater transparency in its activities in the military  field...and it is crucial for us to urge China to demonstrate a  positive response in the field of human rights."    Hata also told Mitterrand, "Japan wants to step up its  cooperation with France in various fields from now on" to build  a new international order to secure global peace in addition to  strengthening the capabilities of the United Nations, the  officials said.    Mitterrand replied, "I agree with your view. The two nations  can build up a stronger relationship of cooperation."    The French president expressed his interest in enhancing  cooperation, particularly in extending economic assistance to  such areas as Indochina and Africa.    Hata expressed gratitude for France's endorsement for  Japan's  bid to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, of  which France is one of the five permanent members.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his support  for  Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN decision-making  body during his visit to Tokyo in March.    Mitterrand, however, stopped short of addressing the issue,  according to the Japanese officials.    The French leader expressed his nation's readiness to  welcome  Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko, who are slated to  visit France in October.    "We are looking forward to meeting the emperor and empress,"  the president was quoted as saying.    Hata replied, "the emperor is also looking forward to the  visit." The royal couple is slated to visit France and Spain on  a two-week trip that will begin in late September.</p>

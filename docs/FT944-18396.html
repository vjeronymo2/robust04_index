			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): One step ahead of the accountant - Small companies can control the cost of their annual audit if they prepare the books in advance For four years, John Hudson turned up for the annual audit of a family-controlled chain of garages to discover that its books were not ready. Faced with the same lack of preparation in the fifth year, Hudson turned on his heel and walked out, threatening to return after three months when he next had staff available. Hudson, who has moved on and is now a partner at Accountants Baker Tilly, says the client quickly got the message. Two days later the books were ready and the audit was able to progress. But he says all too often medium-sized companies only focus on their annual audit when the auditors are on the doorstep. A surprising number of businesses do not keep accurate books, recognising that they only need up-to-date cash books and debtor books to survive, he says. 'The real incentive to get moving is when the auditors are sitting there,' says Hudson. The smallest companies have now fallen out of the annual audit net. Since last November's budget, those with sales of less than Pounds 90,000 are no longer required to produce external verification of accounts and most companies with sales between this figure and Pounds 350,000 only need an independent accountant's report. But larger small companies with March year-ends should by now have agreed with their auditors the exact timing and scope of this year's exercise. Since accountants are selling time, the best way to control costs is for clients to become involved in planning at an early stage. Lis Stalker, senior manager at Arram Berlyn Gardner, a medium-sized accounting firm, agrees that preparation ahead of the auditors' arrival is a crucial cost-saver. Her firm has compiled a list of ways to control audit costs. Before starting an audit, agree a timetable. By agreeing this early, there is more chance that the auditors familiar with your business will be available. Clients who demand an 'express job' because the bank manager is expecting draft accounts the following week will tend to settle for over-qualified - and therefore expensive - auditing staff. Ensure the books are ready. By planning with the auditor, you can discuss which schedules, books and records will be required. It is also worth establishing which non-financial papers will be needed. Capitalise on the knowledge that your auditor has of your business. A good auditor may well have ideas to improve and update management systems and ways to make the next audit easier. Hudson goes further. By adopting an analytical review approach to the audit, as opposed to a 'tick and bash' vouching audit approach, the auditor is forced to become conversant with the way the business works. This knowledge becomes a valuable resource if auditors are properly debriefed. Keep the auditor informed. 'It is always disconcerting to visit a client and find that no one has thought to tell you that branches have been opened during the year, the company has set up an employee profit-sharing scheme or a new stock-pricing system has been put in place,' says Stalker. Surprises can drastically affect the scope and level of work required for an audit opinion and the level of fees. Having agreed the timetable, it is important to stick to it. Too often the auditors get involved in preparatory work before they start the audit. The extra charges which appear on the fee can cause bad blood when the client questions the bill. Given that the auditors probably understand the business more than anyone else outside the company, including the bank manager and the lawyer, unnecessary conflict over the audit fee should be avoided.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Clinton puts US Haiti mission on hold PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night put on hold the US technical assistance mission to Haiti and said he wanted to renew UN sanctions against the military regime in Port-au-Prince. 'I have no intention of sending our people there until the agreement is honoured,' he said, referring to last July's UN-sponsored pact designed to pave the way for the return at the end of this month of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president ousted by the military in 1991. 'I will not have our forces deposited on Haiti when they cannot serve as advisers,' Mr Clinton said. 'We were not asked to come in and make the peace or keep the peace.' Earlier the troopship carrying about one-third of the detachment of 600 US and Canadian military engineers and trainers left Port-au-Prince harbour for Guantanamo, the US base in Cuba, while the Defence Department announced that a second ship, due to leave today, would not depart. The Harlan County had been prevented from docking on Monday and US and UN officials were harassed in what appeared to be a demonstration orchestrated by the Haitian military command under General Raoul Cedras. In his brief remarks Mr Clinton said: 'I want the Haitians to know that I am dead serious about honouring the agreement they made. Now the time has come for the people clinging to their last gaps of power to honour the agreement.' Fr Aristide, still in Washington, immediately endorsed Mr Clinton's action, including the reimposition of economic sanctions. He described Gen Cedras and Mr Joseph Michel Francois, the police chief, as leaders of 'a gang of thugs involved in drug trafficking' and demanded that they step down by Friday. Over the last week the pending Haitian intervention, which would have left exposed lightly armed US troops, had come to appear almost like another Somali quagmire for the administration. The Pentagon's distaste for the mission became public last week and the public's, as manifested in several polls, this week.</p>

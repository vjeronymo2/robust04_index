			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Arms and the dam The full story behind Britain's decision to give Pounds 234m in aid to help build a controversial Malaysian dam has not been divulged. But there have been sufficient revelations to raise concerns over the government's enthusiastic promotion of the arms trade, the use of its aid budget and the apparent willingness of ministers to override their own guidelines. Ministers continue to deny a formal link between aid for the Pergau hydro-electric dam and a contemporaneous Pounds 1bn arms deal with Malaysia in the late 1980s. But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has been forced to admit that the original protocol for the arms deal referred to 'aid in support of non-military aspects'. Though the Malaysians were later told that aid could not be formally linked to military sales, the fact that parallel talks continued on arms and the dam makes it hard to believe that there was not an informal connection. Linking aid to military sales might not be against British law. But it would contravene government aid guidelines which ban such quid pro quos and similar international guidelines drawn up by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Moreover, quite apart from the apparent link between the Pergau project and the arms deal, it is already clear that the aid guidelines have been breached. This is because grants under the UK's Aid and Trade Provision are supposed to be used only for economically sound projects. Ministers were warned by Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, that the Pergau dam was uneconomic and would lead to Malaysian consumers paying more for their electricity. Ministers have justified their behaviour on the grounds that they were promoting Britain's interests. Mr Hurd has said he pressed ahead with Pergau because a commitment had been given by Lady Thatcher, who negotiated the arms deal when prime minister. To renege on the contract would have been 'very damaging to trade'. Similarly, Lord Younger, defence secretary at the time, has said: 'Great Britain plc has come out of all this very well.' Not only has Britain's defence industry profited out of the Pounds 1bn arms deal. Other industries have won contracts with Malaysia, following the country's reversal of its decade-long 'Buy British Last' policy. Two Commons committees are now investigating this affair. Part of their goal will obviously be to dig out the facts. Was there a formal link between the arms deal and aid for Pergau? Have ministers misled parliament? Is there any connection between the Pergau affair and allegations that the government suppressed evidence in a criminal case against a Malaysian banker to prevent embarrassment to the Malaysian government? Why was the Malaysian government so keen to press ahead with the Pergau project given that it was uneconomic? Yet MPs should not stop here. They must also debate the issues of public policy. How enthusiastically should Britain be promoting arms exports? Should the aid budget be used to boost even non-military exports? Would it be better to have a separate 'slush fund' explicitly devoted to promoting exports or would even that be a waste of taxpayers' money? What, in fact, is the purpose of the aid budget? If the Pergau dam affair leads to honest debate of these questions, it will have served a useful purpose.</p>

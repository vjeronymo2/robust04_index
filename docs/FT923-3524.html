			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Troubles fail to deter Greens MEMBERS of the Green party were in resilient mood as they gathered for their annual conference in the Wolverhampton Civic Centre at a turbulent point in the party's history. Mr Guy Woodford from Malvern Hills said: 'No, we're not finished. Our policies are right. I am an eternal optimist.' Two weeks ago Ms Sara Parkin, the party's chair, announced that she would not stand for re-election. Referring to the resistance of local activists to central organisation, she said: 'I didn't want to be responsible for something I couldn't control.' Another five of the 11-strong executive are also standing down. Membership has been falling - green pressure groups have a combined following of several million but the Green party has only 8,000 members, the same as in 1987 and a long way below its June 1990 peak of 19,000, which followed its winning 15 per cent of the vote in the 1989 European elections. Many members feel betrayed by Ms Parkin's comments. The Malvern Hills branch said yesterday: 'The goings-on at the national level are not just embarrassing, they are a very damaging insult.' Others were more dismissive. Mr Frank Nickels from Warwick said yesterday: 'We never wanted a leader in the sense of a figurehead.' He found the disruption at the top irrelevant. 'I am green, I want to be greener, and if I can grow my own tobacco next year that will be perfect.' Undeterred by its troubles, the conference plunged into a four-day agenda on land distribution, the Kurds, elections in Guyana and 25 motions on the party's internal organisation. It remains a conference like no other. Sessions start with a minute's silence for 'attunement'. Workshops end with an invitation to those who have stayed silent to share their thoughts. Babies' nappies are changed on the conference office floor, mothers breastfeed while delivering views on the economy, and there are no plastic cups. Then there was the imminent arrival of Mr David Icke. The former BBC sports presenter and former Green party co-chair, who caused consternation by announcing that he was 'an aspect of the Godhead' will address a meeting of the Pagan Greens tomorrow. Ms Jo Graham from Loughborough, one of those who invited him, said: 'David will be talking economics this time. He doesn't talk on that level - of channelling energies - any more.' In her view, shared by many, the recent fall in membership was inevitable. Mr Peter Barnett from the party's head office said: 'Many people joined around 1989 thinking that we would save their local forest and then found out we're out to ban the bomb, leave Nato and legalise cannabis.'</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Commercial aircraft cause group deficit BRITISH AEROSPACE'S commercial aircraft activities were responsible for dragging the company into the red in the first half of this year. These operations, whose sales fell from Pounds 839m to Pounds 659m in the first six months, saw their overall losses surge from Pounds 32m to Pounds 286m at midway. The bulk of the losses came in the BAe 146 regional jet business and the company's turbopropeller activities. These are now at the centre of a sweeping restructuring programme involving the closure of Hatfield, the regrouping of all turbopropeller aircraft manufacturing activities at Prestwick in Scotland, and a planned joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace to take over production and marketing of BAe's new RJ family of regional jets. The regional jet business lost Pounds 167m in the first half, while the turboprops, which include the ATP and Jetstream aircraft, lost Pounds 111m. The regional jet and commuter turbopropeller aircraft business has been severely hit by the recession in the airline industry and the financial problems of smaller airlines. It is also suffering from over capacity and is in the throes of growing concentration, as manufacturers scramble to forge alliances and partnerships. Production of BAe 146 regional jets has fallen from more than 30 a year to about 24 this year. Since the 146 programme was first launched in the early 1970s, a total of just over 200 aircraft have been sold. One of the handicaps of the BAe regional jet has been its four engines at a time when the market has tended to prefer twin-engine jet aircraft. But BAe claims it has enhanced its four-engine regional jet with its new family of revamped 146s and is considering developing a twin-engine version of the aircraft. BAe is also attempting to forge an international partnership with its preliminary agreement with Taiwan Aerospace to form a Dollars 500m joint venture which would aim to produce about 35 regional jets a year. BAe's traditionally profitable corporate jet business, including the BAe 125-800 and the BAe 1000, also showed a small Pounds 4m loss in the first half. BAe had sought to sell a majority stake in this business. But after failing to secure a sufficiently attractive offer decided this week to retain this activity. The company now regards its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus programme as one of its most promising assets. BAe produces all the wings for Airbus airliners. Although its participation in Airbus resulted in a Pounds 4m loss in the first half, the company said Airbus continued to have a strong order book with firm orders covering almost the entire production for the next two years. BAe said yesterday it anticipated Airbus to become a cash generating business by the mid-1990s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  once again urged the Yemeni president to stop the fighting and  pull back troops to allow dialogue to take its course.    President Mubarak said: On our part, we are fully prepared  to mediate to bring viewpoints closer to each other.    He warned that the end will be bad, saying: I have warned  that if fighting breaks out in Yemen, it will continue for years  and the potentials and resources of the state will be consumed.  The resources of the country will be squandered on procuring  weapons for war and destruction, instead of being devoted to  providing the basic minimum for a decent life for the Yemeni  people.    This speech came in a meeting President Husni Mubarak held  at  noon today with university youths attending the annual Hulwan  summer camp. Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that  President Mubarak was keen on starting a dialogue with his sons,  the university youths. He was also eager to inform the youths  of the various dimensions and aspects of issues of national  interest to Egypt, be they internal or external matters.    Mubarak was asked about the crisis in Yemen, which is  ongoing  despite the advice given to the Yemeni brothers to stop the  bloodshed and fighting and to learn about the dimensions of the  crisis, particularly since Yemen seems to be following in the  footsteps of Iraq. Mubarak answered: During the Gulf crisis, I  advised Iraqi President Saddam Husayn through scores of letters.  I did so separate from any personal feelings and with great  honesty so that we can avert any results from dangerous  problems, as well as avoid inter-Arab differences.    President Mubarak added: In the Yemeni crisis, I have  repeatedly advised from the outset to stop the fighting. But  there was no commitment. He noted that there is a difference  between what happened in the Gulf and what is happening in the  Yemeni crisis.    President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt is not opposed to  Yemen's unity. But, as a general principle, we do not believe  that unity can be imposed through military force, because it  then becomes occupation. We also believe that unity has to be  established through agreement and consent and has to be  requested by the people. The president clarified that if this  process of unity is not accurately worked out, it will backfire  and the effects will be extremely negative.    The information minister said in his statement that  President  Mubarak explained the various viewpoints of the brothers in  Yemen, both in the north and the south. He clarified the  differences that caused the crisis. President Mubarak also  explained that he cautioned against the crisis before it even  started through meetings with the Yemeni leaders and during  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to Egypt. He  affirmed to the Yemeni leaders the importance of containing the  situation and not turning to weapons. But the crisis worsened  and the fighting continued. He said it is an accursed war;  blood is being shed and the infrastructure is collapsing.    President Mubarak renewed his call to the Yemeni president  on  the need to stop the fighting and pull back forces in order to  let dialogue take its course. President Mubarak said: I have  begged the Yemeni parties to stop the fighting--and I hope they  listen to me because I have no objective but to establish  stability in Yemen, which is a fraternal Arab Islamic country.  I tell all the parties: Enough of the collapse that has taken  place.    He added that the Yemeni people are in the custody of their  leaders and the leaders have to look after this charge. We will  continue, together with all our brethren, to exert every effort  for the sake of the Yemeni people and their stability.    Answering a question on his views on the national dialogue,  its effects, and the extent of its continuation, President  Mubarak said: The objective of the national dialogue is for all  sections of the society and the legal forces to participate in  it. The dialogue should not be restricted to the political  parties alone.    He added: Therefore, the National Dialogue Preparatory  Committee, as well as the General Congress, consists of  representatives from over 20 institutions including  associations, unions, and universities; intellectuals, artists,  literates, journalists, and experts in various fields are also  taking part. They represent the cream of society participating  in this Congress, particularly since the world around us is  changing and challenges are imposing themselves on various  local, regional, and international levels.    President Mubarak pointed out that there are radical  economic  changes taking place. He said: This prompted me to call for a  dialogue so that all the Egyptians can participate in discussing  their issues, setting priorities regarding national action, and  polishing their ideas on how to develop the Egyptian march  economically, politically, socially, and culturally.    President Mubarak said that the participants in this  dialogue will discuss various issues since they are specialists  and experts and the parties most concerned with this issue.  They will propose ways to address our problems, because we have  major issues to address, such as unemployment, increasing  production and exports, dealing with international economic  agreements, creating jobs for workers, and enhancing overall and  continuous development. He stated that all these issues  comprise Egypt's economic and social stability, which is the  basis for achieving political progress.    President Mubarak said: I wanted to make sure the dialogue  would not be confined to political parties alone, but open to  all the society's institutions. He noted that the  recommendations would receive proper attention and all new ideas  would be welcomed as long as they were in line with the people's  interests. He underlined that the dialogue would not be  confined to a certain issue but would address all issues that  concern the public. He stated that he has given the Dialogue  Preparatory Committee complete freedom to define priorities. He  said that despite our efforts, certain parties are not going to  participate in the dialogue. They declined to take part and  wanted to put preconditions or impose priorities.    Regarding calls from certain parties for setting priorities  for discussion during the National Dialogue General Congress,  President Mubarak said: Since the president of the republic,  who called for the dialogue, did not set any priorities or  impose views regarding certain priorities, I expected everyone  to let the discussions come up with priorities for the agenda of  the dialogue. He stressed that we would hold on to any benefit  gained through the national dialogue, because all our efforts  are aimed at serving the interests of Egypt and its  people--whether through the national dialogue or in all work  sectors. He stated that the committees that will stem from the  National Dialogue General Congress are expected to complete  their work within two weeks and that the National Dialogue  General Congress will complete the discussions of the  recommendations after these committees end their work.    Responding to a question on the security situation and the  extent the security forces control the real roots of terrorism,  President Mubarak said that all the people have denounced the  acts of terror that occurred in Egypt; that Egyptians did not  expect any Egyptian to emerge from among them to kill his  brothers. He said: Our people cherish their noble feelings,  values, and adherence to principles. He said that an  intellectual dialogue began with these extremists in 1982. He  expressed his regret that these extremists thought the dialogue  was a sign of weakness by the state and raised their arms in the  face of the people. He said: I maintained my patience for a  long time but I shoulder a responsibility toward the people; I  have to safeguard their lives, property, security, and  stability. He added: When my patience ran out because all  peaceful overtures since 1982 were to no avail--I have always  respected the law--I decided that the defendants should be  referred to investigations and the judiciary.    President Mubarak said that those who violate Egypt's  security exploit the lengthy legal procedures and commit more  acts of violence. They threaten the lives of people, destroy  the national economy, and affect the livelihood and job  opportunities in the field of tourism and investment, and  distort Egypt's image. He said: For this reason it was  inevitable that a firm stand must be taken to confront them, and  to refer the defendants to the military judiciary so that the  trials may be more expeditious within the framework of fully  respecting the law and constitution. He stated that the  military judiciary is part of the Egyptian judiciary according  to the constitution and it fully complies with the law. Trial  before the military judiciary does not mean denying any rights  of citizens.    Mubarak expressed astonishment at the reports that some  people in a certain country are discussing conditions in Egypt  and debating its stability. He said: I say to those people  that Egypt is stable and secure with a civilization going back  5,000 years.    He remarked that the world's first administration and  government were established in Egypt on the banks of the Nile  and that the country is stable now and will remain stable  forever.    He announced: The sons of Egypt who at first fell victim to  terrorism have begun to wake up and return to the right path.    He declared that the haters' attempts to undermine Egypt's  role will fail.    President Mubarak asserted that he is shouldering the  responsibility entrusted to him by the nation and that when  certain matters reach a certain point and threaten to harm the  people, then one cannot remain silent about them.    In response to questions about publications spreading rumors  or encouraging terrorism, the president advised the young  people: Do not listen to rumors. You must learn to distinguish  between true and false reports. We have nothing to hide because  truth always prevails. Rumors and lies eventually collapse.    Concerning Egyptian-Sudanese relations and the recent series  of measures adopted by the Sudanese regime, including the  closure of [Egyptian] universities and most recently the seizure  of Egyptian-owned irrigation installations in Sudan, President  Mubarak explained that the relationship with Sudan has a special  delicate status and for this reason, he avoids going into the  details of any disputes with it.    He noted Egyptian support for the Sudanese regime since it  came to power despite the subsequent attempts to undermine  Egypt's stability--a reference to the Hala'ib dispute. He said  that the two countries' ties are historical and more than three  million Sudanese citizens live in Egypt as the Egyptians'  honored brothers.    Recalling what he said during his meeting with the Sudanese  leader, he declared that Egypt has not fired a single bullet at  a Sudanese citizen and that the reports about Egyptian military  concentrations on the border with Sudan are not true.    He asked: Why should we mass troops when we know we will not  fight our brothers?    President Mubarak explained that the Egyptian forces  stationed in the Hala'ib area do not exceed 2,000 officers and  soldiers and that they do not have heavy weapons as the Sudanese  regime used to believe. He said that Egyptian and Sudanese  officers and troops on the border between the two countries are  friendly with each other and understand each other.    Commenting on the Sudanese regime's recent claim that Egypt  incited Sudanese al-Ummah Party leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi,  President Mubarak said Egypt is governed by principle and will  not conspire against the existing Sudanese regime or any other  regime. He pointed out that Egypt will not incite any Sudanese  national against his own country and it has no connection with  any claims about al- Ummah leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi.    President Mubarak affirmed: We do not fight Sudan. We wish  to safeguard the Sudanese people. We will not fire a bullet  against any Sudanese person. We welcome the Sudanese among us  and on our territory. We wish to help Sudan but at the same  time we cannot let anyone impose his view on us in matters  connected with our sovereignty and stability.    Regarding the Middle East peace process, the information  minister reported that President Mubarak said that [former]  President al-Sadat had a lot of foresight and had it not been  for his peace initiative, this region would not have witnessed  the current major peace developments.    President Mubarak said that the Palestinian issue is the  core  of the Middle East conflict and pointed out that after Egypt  regained its lost territory, it continued and is continuing now  to do its utmost for the sake of peace and the restoration of  Arab territories and legitimate Arab rights.    The president noted that the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement  was the first and most difficult step. He said it gave the  Palestinians the opportunity to return to their own land for the  first time.    He stressed that Egypt assists the Palestinians but does not  dictate any options to them. He remarked that Egypt utilizes  its international relations for the good of the Palestinian  cause and other Arab causes to enable the concerned parties to  reach a just and comprehensive solution that will preserve their  legitimate rights.    He declared that Egypt, as the largest Arab country, is  seeking a real, not illusory, peace and that peace strategy must  have its own credible components.    President Mubarak said the progress on the Palestinian-  Israeli track is still difficult and that the forthcoming phases  are the most difficult because they will deal with the  settlements and with Jerusalem. He added that the Jerusalem  question is viewed in a Christian and Islamic framework and that  it is not only an Arab or an Islamic issue but has several  dimensions.    Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak also discussed the  developments on the Syrian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks.    Replying to a question on the talk about establishing a  Middle Eastern market, the president explained that the issue is  still in the stage of proposals, interpretations, and analysis  and that we should put things in context without oneupmanship.  He noted that there are centers for research, analysis, and  discussion all of which are good signs but that the issue is  still in the form of mere proposals and interpretations.    Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak answered a question on  the Social Development Fund and its role. The president said  that the Fund has played its role according to the resources  available and that any obstacles to its performance, such as the  interest rate and so forth are being removed.    Replying to another question on developments in Rwanda,  President Mubarak said it is an African issue and some proposals  were discussed at the recent African summit but (?implementing)  these proposals would require a huge expense. He added that  France has begun to play a role to help achieve peace and that  Egypt is helping with observers in the United Nations.  President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt does not help one party  at the expense of another and is not biased to any side and  said: We have suspended an arms accord that was signed before  the conflict broke out between the two sides.    The president commented on the UN secretary general's role  in  the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and in handling various issues.  He said we should not burden the secretary general beyond his  capabilities and jurisdictions for he does not issue resolutions  but implements the Security Council and UN resolutions and he  has no funds or troops at his disposal.    Answering a question on economic reform, President Mubarak  explained the inevitable situation that required the initiation  of the economic reform process and said that a complete collapse  would have occurred had there been no economic reform. He added  that had economic reform not been initiated, Egypt would have  been in a hard situation in which the provision of bread or  minimal level of services would have been difficult.    He noted that the economy had neared a collapse because of  problems that accumulated over successive years and that the  international community had stopped dealing with Egypt because  its economy could not meet any commitments or repay debts. He  added: We needed loans to procure basic commodities to secure  living provisions and we also had to establish an infrastructure  to attract investment.    Replying to another question on wage increases, President  Mubarak pointed out that economic issues are interlinked and  that revenues are linked with expenditure and wages. He added  that any wage increase is linked with a genuine increased  production and that printing (?bank notes) means more inflation  and more price hikes. Therefore, he said, economic performance  must be controlled to maintain an acceptable and reasonable  balance between wages and prices.    He added: We must bear in mind that Egypt's population has  increased by approximately 15 million people during the period  of the economic reform plan and that salaries and pensions also  increased by various rates over the past five years.    He noted that despite all the burdens on the citizen,  economic reform made a great progress and that no matter how  hard the burden is, it is still better than the collapse that we  would have encountered.    Asked about the amount of Egypt's debts, President Mubarak  pointed out that these debts had reached 45 billion dollars as  borrowing had been necessary to rebuild the infrastructure. He  added that 50 percent of the debts, an amount equivalent to what  has been spent on the infrastructure, has been forgiven. He  added: Now that the debts have come within the normal and  reasonable limits, we are in a better position and Egypt can  fulfill its debt obligations. He noted that the availability of  reserves at the Egyptian banks does not mean that this money  belongs to the government. These reserves, he adds, belong to  the people and are held as deposits with the banks. They  provide the Egyptian economy with the necessary liquidity to  fulfill its obligations in meeting the basic requirements, he  added. He noted that the whole world is facing a wave of  similar problems, such as debts, unemployment, rise in commodity  prices, and the lack of balance between wages and prices. He  added: We must never forget that in the sixties Egypt's  population was 16 million and now we are close to 60 million.  This means extra burdens to the economy and to the development  and service sectors, he noted, adding that we always need the  money to be able to carry out development plans and provide a  reasonable minimum standard of living.    Minister al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak had  begun his meeting with the university students with a speech in  which he stressed that they represent the hope of the future,  adding that the work of the present generation is for the sake  of the coming generations. Mubarak was asked about the future  of development in Upper Egypt following the establishment of the  Southern Valley University, which represents a qualitative  cultural leap for Upper Egypt. Mubarak emphasized that the  development plan makes no difference between Upper and Lower  Egypt. We must encourage the wealthy and the investors from  Upper Egypt to establish small or large industrial or  agricultural projects there, he added. He noted that if the  experiment proves to be successful and if investments increase,  we hope there will be no need to obtain an approval from the  Investment Authority to establish any project, regardless of its  magnitude. He noted that small investors have been encouraged  to establish projects in the governorates where they live,  adding that attention is given to Upper Egyptian governorates to  raise the standards of living there and create jobs in  productive projects. This is because the government no longer  can hire new employees now that the salaries of the civil  servants cost the treasury approximately 16 billion Egyptian  pounds per year and the government's resources are limited, he  added.    Before meeting with the university students, Mubarak met  with  university presidents and students to listen to a number of  suggestions on developing university education and research  centers and on the university's role in serving the society.  Education Minister Dr. Husayn Kamil Baha'-al-Din spoke during  the meeting and noted that President Mubarak, who opened the  National Dialogue Congress today, wanted to meet with the  university youth to involve them in this dialogue. He noted  that the university students are proud of President Mubarak's  efforts to develop Egypt and its universities. During the  two-hour meeting, the students cheered and applauded President  Mubarak several times during his speech.    Dr. Baha'-al-Din pointed out that the group of students who  met with President Mubarak today comprised approximately 650  students from various Egyptian universities. He added that each  group stays at the camp for one week during which the students  play sports, receive cultural and religious orientation courses,  and meet with a number of officials. He noted that similar  camps free of charge exist for university students in  Alexandria, the Suez Canal area, Asyut, and al-Minya.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: At home in the office - How telecommunications companies have used technology to transform their workplaces Telecommunications and information technology companies have long argued that technology is an important tool in workplace design. What is less well known is that many of them practise what they preach. Companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment, British Telecommunications and Mercury understand the full potential of modern technology, and apply it in their workplaces in a way that offers lessons for others. IBM has a tradition of excellent offices, but its Smart (space, morale and remote technology) programme takes an innovative leap forward. At Bedfont Lakes on the outskirts of London, IBM has divided individual workspaces into four types: managers' offices, permanent workstations for administrative staff, grouped and shared 'hot desks' for mobile consultants, and 'touchdown desks' for other staff visiting the office for brief periods. Consultants are encouraged to be where the work is: at the clients' premises. When back at base (conventionally less than 40 per cent of the working year), their 'hot desking' more than doubles the utilisation of desk space. This cuts the amount of space needed, even when offset by an increase in meeting rooms and rooms set aside for customers to work in. The other main space saver is IBM's policy of grouping all filing, both team and personal. Files are taken to desks in portable trays, personal filing is minimised and desks are kept clear. The results of these and other measures, says project manager Harvey Young, are more effective operations and a 25 per cent saving in space. At Mercury Telecommunications the challenge is growth and change with 'awesome velocity', in the words of Chris Ridgewell of its Flexible Working Applications Group, which advises customers on IT packages for workplaces. When architects Austin-Smith Lord designed the interior of Mercury's London headquarters, stress was put on flexibility; in particular, the IT installation has a floor outlet point every 4 sq m, more than twice the usual density. Yet with an organisation growing at 100 people a month, technological flexibility and the acquisition of space are not enough. The answer is 'virtual teams': people collaborating closely, but in a range of locations. They may work from home, in the car, at a customer's office, at 'third-party sites', in a branch office of Mercury, or at head office - yet they work as a unified team. They are united by a strong sense of 'mission', highly sophisticated IT, skilled team co-ordinators - and a base office that provides the right environment for anything from a 'touch-down' visit to a full team brainstorming. What sort of a physical environment makes a base office attractive, welcoming and stimulating? At Digital Equipment's Stockholm office, a virtual team was asked to decide this for itself. The result is a flexibly planned area with consultants sitting in lounge chairs under an artificial tree, their mobile filing trolleys beside them. At the press of a button their computer terminals descend from the branches to a convenient height. In the corner a raised cafe area is also used for informal meetings. The general decor has hints of the golf course, the beach and the garden: all places where the team said they felt at their most creative. The team co-ordinators (executive secretaries) also work on a dais, giving them eye-level contact with standing colleagues, a view in-the-round of what is going on, and emphasising the importance of their role. Idealistic? Lavish? Not if you take into account a 50 per cent saving in space and a 20 per cent increase in productivity. The pilot area for 14 people has now been expanded to cater for 200. BT's carefully monitored experiment with its directory inquiries staff in Scotland is another approach to the virtual team: the static relocation of some members of an in-house work group. In BT's case 11 staff were detached from the Inverness office and set up to work in their own homes. As well as telecommunications and information technology, or 'telematics' (which included video links with each other and with Inverness), BT developed special furniture, which was robust enough for work use yet domestic in scale. It also considered the broader implications of home-working - such as interruptions, security and child-proof equipment. With the psychology department of Aberdeen University, BT is now evaluating the year-long experiment. The initial reaction of the workers and their families was very positive. The findings - some already published - are not only for BT to use in its staff deployment, but to help its customers contemplating home-working. What does all this mean for the design of tomorrow's offices? Creative change is essential if businesses are to survive pressures from new technology, from globalisation, from demographic and educational changes in the workforce, from concerns about the costs of commuting and its environmental impact - and changing lifestyles. The workplaces of these four companies show the way. For all their technological sophistication, what is evident is the humanity; a concern with the quality of working life. They show that offices are increasingly becoming: Meeting places as much as workplaces, places for group interaction rather than solitary concentration; Pleasant places, which attract and retain the shrinking number of new graduates joining the ranks of skilled knowledge workers; Flexible places, far more space-efficient and adaptable, reducing both capital and running costs; Humane places, often smaller and nearer home (or even at it) but still part of a global communications network.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], said in Maputo yesterday that his  organization will use its trust fund [preceding two words in  English] to pay a portion of the demobilization allowances to  its soldiers should the government insist on allocating 35,000  meticals for each of them. Speaking at a news conference,  Afonso Dhlakama said 82,000 meticals had been initially  earmarked for the soldiers. He said 35,000 meticals for each  demobilized soldier is a contemptible amount. Dhlakama added:  I regret that Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldiers to  be demobilized could be at a disadvantage, but that is due to a  lack of morals by the government for which they fought.    Dhlakama said Renamo soldiers could begin to be demobilized  at Inhambane Province's Neves assembly point as of 16 March.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK and China join ban on dumping nuclear waste at sea The UK and China surprised environment groups yesterday by joining an international ban on the dumping of nuclear waste at sea. Their decision leaves Russia as the only country to continue dumping among the 72 signatories to the London Convention, a worldwide treaty on sea pollution. Britain, China and Russia were among countries that abstained when a majority of the signatories voted for the dumping ban last November. The decision by the UK and China to join comes just two days before the deadline for registering opposition to the ban. Ms Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, told parliament that the UK 'recognises that the weight of international opinion on this matter means that dumping is not . . . a practical proposition'. However, she added: 'Scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea under controlled conditions causes no harm to the marine environment and poses no threat to human health.' The ban covers low and intermediate level radioactive waste, but the convention also gradually phases out industrial dumping and incineration at sea. There has been little dumping in recent years. The main target of the ban is the waste likely to arise when nuclear submarines and reactors are decommissioned in coming decades. Ms Mary Morrison of Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said: 'The UK's action was a great surprise - but it now has a big problem dealing with this bulky waste on land.' Plans by Nirex, the UK nuclear industry's waste disposal company, to build an underground nuclear waste store, have been repeatedly delayed. Mr Bruce Alderman of Nirex said yesterday his company's proposals remained flexible. 'We have always planned to take Ministry of Defence waste. But we have not reckoned on large submarines - the MoD would have to cut them up into small pieces for them to be acceptable to us.' Mr Yang Wenhe, deputy director of the Chinese State Bureau of Oceanography, said in Beijing that China would stop dumping from this weekend. He told the official Xinhua news agency: 'Disposing of wastes without licence or dumping irresponsibly at sea will be punished severely according to the law.' The ban will be reviewed in 25 years, although scientists will continue to re-examine the safety of dumping. The UK said it would reopen negotiations if opinion changed in favour of dumping. Britain, which has not dumped radioactive waste at sea since 1983, has already accepted a ban on dumping until 2008 under a separate treaty covering the north east Atlantic. Belgium and France, which also abstained from voting on the ban in November, have accepted it in recent weeks. Mr Manfred Nauke, the London Convention's secretary, said Russia had announced yesterday that it would not accept the ban. Russia said it needed to continue sea dumping until at least 1996.</p>

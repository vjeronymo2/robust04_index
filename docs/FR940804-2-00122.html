			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Count I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27. By its conduct Defendants have violated 15 U.S.C. &sect;1 in that KBL has, by contracting directly with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department to produce and distribute sports events covered by the Agreement with Gianotti, restrained trade and commerce by interfering with Gianotti's opportunity to do business with the University of Pittsburgh. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. One of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to monopolize sports television production of collegiate athletics for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania in violation of 15 U.S.C. &sect;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. Another of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to tie the distribution of men's basketball to the distribution of other sports events in order to deprive others from an opportunity to telecast or distribute by cable men's basketball programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. Defendants' conduct had a substantially adverse affect on competition in that it eliminated a major cable television programming source and left Defendants in the position to exercise market power over the origination of sports programming for cable television in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. KBL is capable of monopolizing this market because of its relationship with TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., which has more than half the cable subscribers in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32. In this instance and in the past, defendants and their affiliated corporations have used refusals to deal with program sources as a means to exercise their market power to control programming sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33. The various actions taken by defendants and their affiliated corporations have decreased competition by eliminating Gianotti and possibly others such as TCS and possibly discouraging them and others from entering this expanding market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34. Although broadcast television stations also show some local sports events, they are restrained by two factors: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Because of their necessity to maintain certain minimum numbers of viewers and correspondingly certain minimum advertising rates, they cannot show minor collegiate athletic events or other sports and non-sports programming not designed to appeal to significant segments of the Viewing population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Defendants through their acquisition of exclusive rights to University of Pittsburgh Basketball, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Pittsburgh Pirates now control which of these events can be shown on regular broadcast stations. For example, WPXI Channel 11 had to contract with KBL to be able to show certain University of Pittsburgh Basketball games. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he was building which in 1990 generated gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36. Gianotti was the largest source of independent local video programming in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan area between 1988 and 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to earn far more than $50,000.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 38. The fair market value of Gianotti business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess of $100,000.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 15 plaintiffs are entitled to recover threefold the damages sustained plus prejudgment interest plus attorneys fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wherefore, Plaintiffs request judgment against Defendant for $300,000.00 plus interest from October 21, 1991, at the federal judgment rate plus reasonable attorneys fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Count II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40. In violation of 15 U.S.C. 18, KBL acquired an asset of Gianotti in the form of his exclusive right to negotiate a renewal of his contract with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department, where the effect of such acquisition substantially lessened competition by driving Gianotti out of business chilling interest in entry into this market by others, depriving advertisers and sports teams of alternatives and tended to create a monopoly in the production of sports television programming for cable distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to earn far more than $50,000.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

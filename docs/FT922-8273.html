			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Italian utility in Pounds 4.5bn gas import deal ENEL, Italy's state-owned electricity generating utility, has signed one of the world's biggest long-term energy supply contracts with Nigeria in a liquefied natural gas deal worth around L10,000bn (Pounds 4.5bn) over 20 years. The transaction, starting in 1997, marks a further diversification of supplies for the energy-dependent Italians. It is the first direct liquefied natural gas deal between a big European electricity utility and an energy producing country. ENEL will buy 3.7bn cubic metres of gas a year from a new plant being built by Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas, a Nigerian government-owned company in which Shell, Agip and Elf are also shareholders. Smaller quantities of gas will also be supplied to utilities in Spain, France and the US. The price ENEL will pay will be indexed to that of crude and refined oil, as well as coal, but the value of the contract is expected to amount to L500bn a year. Once the liquefied gas arrives in Italy, it will be processed at a new facility at Montalto di Castro in the central Lazio region. The plant will supply a 3,300 MW power station to be built nearby. ENEL currently uses 6-7bn cu m of natural gas a year, but expects consumption to rise to 20-25bn cu m by the year 2000 after a number of deals are completed. Around 6bn cu m of Algerian gas will be supplied via an undersea pipeline being built by the Italian state-owned SNAM group, while a further 1.5bn cu m will be imported in liquid form. Meanwhile, talks are under way with Norway to supply 3-4bn cu m, while further supplies may come from Qatar. The new contracts should help to overcome the uncertainty surrounding plans to import 4bn cu m of gas from Russia. Italy uses around 50bn cu m of natural gas to generate electricity and for domestic purposes, 60 per cent of which comes from Algeria and Russia. Future consumption is expected to rise to 80bn cu m, three-quarters of it imported.</p>

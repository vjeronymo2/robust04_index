			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Why the Dow does not like Fridays - Wall Street The first Friday of the month is not proving the best of times to invest in US stocks. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 15 points down - though later in the morning it managed a lacklustre return into positive territory. Stock investors, however, did not see the sort of gains last week enjoyed by bond investors. It was at least better than recent first Fridays. In May, the Dow lost 27 points on the fateful day, and then a further 40 points the following Monday. A month before, it shed 43 points (the market was closed on the Friday, so the losses came on the Monday instead.) This is not some statistical oddity. The reason, each time, has been the same: the publication of monthly employment figures from the Department of Labour showing that the US is creating jobs at a faster rate than anyone had expected. It may seem perverse for the stock market to drop on positive news for the economy. But strong employment growth points to strong growth in consumer spending and, possibly, bigger wage rises as companies compete for workers - both of which in turn raise the spectre of accelerating inflation. In recent months, that has tended to give the bond market a fright (since inflation erodes the value of fixed income investments). Also, it adds to pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates, which would both eat into corporate profits and dampen economic growth. Administration officials are still maintaining the sanguine tone that has come to sound like a stuck record in recent months. Just minutes before the latest employment figures came out yesterday, Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, was telling members of the Confederation of British Industry that the US economy was 'in great shape - I haven't seen it like this in 20 years.' But the markets have their own ideas: the US authorities waited too long to raise interest rates (why else would they have put up rates four times since February 4?) and could be forced into further rate rises to put a belated brake on the economy. The latest employment figures provided ammunition for both sides. The number of new jobs created in May, at 191,000, was around 100,000 fewer than the markets had been expecting. But the April job numbers were revised up by 91,000, and the overall unemployment rate dropped to 6 per cent from 6.4 per cent the month before. While bonds rallied a point out of relief that the picture was not worse, equities managed only a half-hearted end to a half-hearted week. The stock market had spent the previous days waiting aimlessly for the jobs figures. One stock that managed to defy this torpor was Microsoft, the software group. Its shares continued a climb begun in mid-May, when it was first announced that the company would be included in the S &amp; P 500 index of leading stocks. Breaking into a widely-followed index such as the S &amp; P 500 can do wonders for a company's investment credentials, even when the company is as well-known as Microsoft. Around a third of the shares owned by US pension and endowment funds (equivalent to Dollars 400bn worth of equities) are held 'passively' - the institutions holding them are trying simply to track the performance of a stock market index, not to beat it. To do this, they simply buy all the stocks in proportion to their weightings in the index. So making it into an index creates an instant new market for a company's shares. The people who run indexed funds 'aren't employed to be overweight or underweight (in a particular stock),' says John Webster, a consultant at Greenwich Associates, a leading US investment consultancy. 'If they're underinvested, they're taking a bet.' It may seem surprising that Microsoft - worth Dollars 30bn - has not been in the S &amp; P 500 before. The problem for Standard &amp; Poor's, which runs the index, has been that only a small proportion of the company's shares have been available to outside investors. Now, it says, there are enough shares available to make it a candidate for the index. Apparently, though, there still are not enough available for everyone who wants them to buy without driving up the price. By yesterday lunchtime, Microsoft's shares had climbed to Dollars 53 3/8 - a gain of 14 per cent per cent since 11 May. The company joins the index at the close of business on Monday.  ---------------------------------- Monday         Closed Tuesday       3758.37  +  1.23 Wednesday     3760.83  +  2.46 Thursday      3758.99  -  1.84 Friday        3772.22  + 13.23  ----------------------------------</p>

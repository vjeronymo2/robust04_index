			<p>BFN     [Text] Evans Francois, brother of the Port-au-Prince police  chief, has asked General Cedras to resign to avoid a military  intervention against Haiti. The brother of Lieutenant Colonel  Michel Francois addressed a letter to that effect to the Army  chief. Let us listen to Evans Francois:    [Begin Francois recording] At this watershed where my  country's sovereignty is threatened by the most powerful nation  in the world, General, the threats of military intervention are  serious. This is not the time to be shilly-shallying. The  courageous Evans, one of the authors of the 30 September coup  d'etat, could have continued to give you his support. He was  convinced you would have changed in a positive direction one  day. If tomorrow, I were sure to find even a minimum of  seriousness in your behavior... [pauses] What I am sure of, Mr.  General, is that the 34 months of crisis have never been managed  in the interest of the nation. There was not one government that  came from the 30 September coup which, once installed, was not  handicapped by your shrewd behavior, which always made you  appear in the eyes of the world as a moderate, until appointment  of the Jonassaint government, the disguised triumvirate.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuleba, NEZAVISIMOST editor in chief, </F> under the rubric "Political Diary": "Who Pushed Ukraine Into the  Abyss?"]    [Text] Had any person with integrity been in Leonid  Kravchuk's place, he would have resigned long ago and would have  quit political life for retirement without much ado--after all,  he is at the suitable age, too. During the more than two years  of his presidential rule, Ukraine has achieved impressive  results--meaning that the paralysis of the economy and the  financial and credit system, the hyperinflation which has now  become superhyperinflation, the plundering of the wealth of the  people, and the association of nomenklatura officials of all  hues with the criminal underworld--from law enforcement organs  to the staff of the president and the leadership of the Cabinet  of Ministers--have reached unheard-of proportions.    I have already had occasion to conjecture that the generally  not-so-poor country could have been brought to its present  condition either by an absolutely unprepared, incompetent, and  incapable person, a typical creature of the Communist Party  system who has leached off the people all his life, or on the  contrary, by a very skillful and flexible tactician pursuing the  goal set for him by his own party comrades: to pervert the idea  of acquiring independence and statehood as thoroughly as  possible, to extinguish the enthusiasm of the people, and to  dispel illusions of an independent path for Ukraine.    They say that a blind person leading the blind will  unavoidably lead them into an abyss. We had not even managed to  grasp this and catch on to it before we found ourselves in a  state of "free fall." Enterprises are closing down; people are  being thrown out onto the street; wages and scholarships are not  paid for several months in a row; the threat of the destruction  of the Donbass and other large industrial regions is real; the  Crimea has virtually been surrendered without a fight--but they  continue to do an ideological "snow" job on us with a crooked  half-smile: Nothing horrible is happening, they say. If the  statement that the retinue makes the king is true, then Leonid  Kravchuk's circle, all those  Slepichevs-Simonenkos-Ternopolskiys-Mikhalchenkos--have worked  hard to create the image that now accompanies our president. One  could ascertain this easily by entering just any store (where,  incidentally, neither L. Kravchuk nor his retinue have ever set  foot). They have long been barricaded in the "golden cage" of  the former Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine  as they "resolve their issues."    The "acting prime minister," Yefim Zvyahilskyy, who is  operating deep in the underground, carried on even more  clandestinely. He is the one whom nobody has ever seen anywhere  in person: Yefim Leonidovich prefers to give leading  instructions from the chambers of his personal office,  studiously avoiding meetings not only with "commoners" but even  with leaders of all ranks. Meanwhile, his appearance in the  position of prime minister (even if "acting") is far from  random. As Ivan Plyushch observed once, Ye. Zvyahilskyy is one  of the richest people in Ukraine. Please note that he was not  confirmed as a candidate by the parliament; he ended up in his  present position thanks to an edict of the president. Aware of  what many edicts of L. Kravchuk stand for, the most odious of  which have been "retracted" under pressure from public opinion,  one may only guess which influential forces and how many  powerful people were behind this appointment!    Last week RUKH-PRESS voiced, among others, yet another  version of the disappearance of Mikhail Boychishin: He was in  possession of documents concerning the involvement of major  government figures with mafia circles. Let us note that xeroxed  copies of these documents are in the possession of the  NEZAVISIMOST editorial office. (It is just that they should not  be in any hurry to "hack" the documents out of me or other  members of the staff because, as far as is known, a few copies  of the documents are being held by the editorial offices of  Moscow and foreign publications which are prepared to publish  them at any time). Their authenticity is beyond doubt. Judging  by their content and peculiar details found in the documents,  they were drawn up with assistance from the special services, if  not with their direct participation. We are prepared to furnish  them to competent organs, but only on one condition: If they  unravel the "mystery" of Boychishin's disappearance, after all.  If this case is going to be "swept under the rug" just as the  investigation of the murder of Vadim Boyko was, the editorial  office will have to release the materials in its possession,  after all.    To be sure, last week our law enforcement organs  distinguished themselves, after all. On 12 February (do you  remember the horrible cold?), a group of UNSO [Ukrainian  People's Self-Defense Forces] riflemen was arrested during a  "drill session" at Lysaya Gora in Kiev. There were candidates  for people's deputy among the riflemen (therefore, a violation  of the Law on Elections, according to which the electoral  commission should sanction the arrest of a registered candidate,  is obvious). In general this entire episode seemed strange from  the very outset. "Exercises" of UNSO commandos have been  underway for several years now, frequently with real weapons  rather than, like this time, with the use of "models." However,  this is what is noteworthy: The searches conducted produced no  results, although a lot of "froth" arose. Is it a surprising  coincidence that the persecution of UNSO combatants coincided  precisely with the beginning of the election campaign? The  arrests at Lysaya Gora came close to frustrating the second  regional conference of the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] in  Lvov. While commenting on the events, the leader of the assembly  from Lvov, Andrey Shkil, promised at the conference: Even if  they arrest everyone, we will come to power anyway. As far as  the situation in the Crimea is concerned, he noted: We are men  of action, and for this reason the Crimea will either be  Ukrainian or it will be uninhabited. It is hard to say what the  actions of law enforcement organs exhibit more of--awkward and  helpless attempts to prevent the existence of an unregistered  paramilitary organization which holds its "exercises" virtually  in downtown Kiev or the aspiration to promote the UNSO before  the elections. To be sure, there is someone whose example they  follow. Can one look more helpless than our president in the  context of the latest Crimean events?    And yet, the results of elections in the Crimea are truly  impressive. For the first time since 1917, the people have  elected as their leader a man "in the street" who is not  burdened by the communist past and who has never belonged to the  nomenklatura merry-go-round. We happened to hear about Yuriy  Meshkov for the first time in August 1991, when having tried in  vain to persuade the Communists in the parliament to move on  Foros to "rescue their general secretary," he made a desperate  single-handed attempt and...was apprehended by the already  mentioned law enforcement organs, perhaps so that he would not  "get in the way" and disrupt the "putsch" scenario. Even then it  became obvious that Yu. Meshkov has a quite nonstandard,  original personality. This was confirmed by his unconventional  visits to Kiev and Moscow and the selection of the "foreigner"  Yevgeniy Saburov as prime minister, to say nothing about the  tenor of his presentations on TV and the sacramental phrase at  the latest press conference: "I do not report to the president  of Ukraine on work performed"--an elegant flick on the nose.    In the Crimea presidential elections have already been held,  whereas here it is still unclear whether such will indeed occur  or whether Leonid Kravchuk with "the comrades" will try to "nix"  them. There is much indirect evidence in favor of this  supposition, for example, the colossal activity of  representatives of the party of power, their altogether sickly  interest in districts being "jammed" with candidates--you go and  figure out who to vote for. In this case, elections to the  Supreme Council may not be validly held, or Ukraine will get  bogged down in permanent elections. A lot of energy and funds  will be needed! This is when the president will come on stage in  order to announce magnanimously: Given that the Cabinet of  Ministers in essence does not exist, and the parliament has not  been elected, I have resolved to stay on as president a little  longer. As far as the parliament is concerned, it will be  federal: There will be 10 people from each oblast (on the  personal responsibility of the representative of the  president--note by Vladimir Kuleba).    A different turn of events is not ruled out. Leonid Kravchuk  will announce his firm intention to not run for president a  second time even before the parliamentary elections. There will  be no need to look far for explanations: For Kravchuk to become  a candidate in the catastrophic situation which Ukraine is now  facing would be pouring oil on the flaming fire of discontent.  In this case, he has one last hope: The parliament of the new  term will cancel the previously announced presidential elections.    At present, when the election campaign is merely beginning  to  "get in gear," the editorial office is receiving a multitude of  letters and calls from the localities concerning all kinds of  violations and contrivances on the part of the nomenklatura:  undisguised sabotage, obstruction of meetings between candidates  and the people, delays in processing documents, and so on. The  method of "neutralizing" particular democratic candidates by  nominating "doubles" is widespread. For example, if a doctor of  sciences who is a democrat registers in a district, it is  countered with another doctor. If you are a colonel, we will  nominate a general. Let the people wrack their brains later. Or  else, a complete joke: Rukh is fielding a candidate, a metal  worker named Nikolay Nikolayevich Levchenko, and the local  bureaucracy hustled and found a worthy rival for him, likewise  Nikolay Nikolayevich, and likewise Levchenko, except that he is  a milling machine operator. On the ballot, their last names will  appear next to each other.    If we were to try projecting the overall picture, I think  that left-wing forces, the Communists and the Socialists, will  dominate the parliament. This is logical in a way. Within a  comparatively short period of time our society has travelled the  path from euphoria to disappointment and pessimism.  Impoverished, undernourished, poorly clad people who have lost  faith and are tired of instability are instinctively backing up  in order to return to life as it was, though "the boat has  already been missed." Since the Communists-Socialists are not up  to offering any alternative creative idea, they are doomed to a  crushing defeat, just like the national-radicals at present.  Paradoxical as it is, it might be better for them to win the  election after all, and to form their own government. Two or  three years from now it will be possible to ask: "Well, our  Communist friends, what has been accomplished?" This will be  when they will be forced to retire forever from the political  arena. I believe that such a scenario is still better than the  current one, whereby anything and everything is being exported  from Ukraine, the country is on the brink of disaster, but those  responsible are nowhere to be found because one is sick, another  stupid, and yet another is just an "acting" official.</p>

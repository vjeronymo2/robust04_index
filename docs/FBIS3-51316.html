			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Venezuelan Central Bank] </F>   [Text] The Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV], as part of its  duties as a clearinghouse bank, has excluded Banco Latino, C.A.  from the clearinghouse system.    The decision was made when Banco Latino's debit balance  could  not be paid on 12 January at the Chamber of Compensation's close  of business due to a shortage of funds in its BCV account. As a  result, the procedures established in Article 12 of the Chamber  of Compensation's regulations had to be enforced.    Consequently, Banco Latino will cease to participate in the  Chamber of Compensation System. The BCV has notified the  Superintendency of Banks, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund], the  finance minister, and the president of the National Banking  Council of its decision so each of them can do their duty in  accordance with the law.    This case will be handled by the competent institutions,  which will apply the new banking legislation, so the normal  functioning of the financial system should not be affected. The  BCV hopes this situation will be resolved in the most  constructive manner by the appropriate bodies to guarantee the  enforcement of the savings, payments, and financial intervention  systems.</p>

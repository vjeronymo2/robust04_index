The companies are asking their unions to accept a benchmark  monthly wage increase of 10,800 yen, but the unions are pushing  for a 4 percent increase of 11,600 yen.    Late Thursday evening it was still unclear whether  last-minute talks would avert a strike.    Bus services by nine companies and train services by 12  companies could affect some 22,100,000 people. In the Kanto  region centered on Tokyo they include the Tobu, Tokyu, Keisei  railway lines and lines operated by Teito Rapid Transit  Authority, Keio Teito, and Sagami Railway, and in the Chubu  region centered on Nagoya, the Nagoya Railroad Union.    In the Kansai region centered on Osaka and Kyoto they  include  the Hankyu, Hanshin, Keihan, and Nankai railway lines, and in  Kyushu the Nishi Nippon Railroad lines.</p>

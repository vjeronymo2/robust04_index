			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Call for longer university years LONGER academic years and a move away from the honours degree system were urged by the Royal Society yesterday as part of a package of reforms for higher education. But the society ruled out making graduates pay for their tuition, a measure which has been proposed by several university vice-chancellors in the last few months. Instead, it suggested the state should also pay tuition fees in full for part-time students but that student maintenance costs should be funded by a graduate tax. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals welcomed the proposals. Among the society's other proposals were: Some universities should concentrate on teaching and move towards a longer academic year. Honours classification should be replaced with a detailed account of assessment throughout the course. Qualifications such as certificates and diplomas of higher education should be introduced, to be finished in less than three years. New modular courses, allowing students to move from university, or to shift between work and education.

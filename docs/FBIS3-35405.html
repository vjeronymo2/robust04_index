A spokesman for the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP)  accused troops from the north of having "extended their  deployment beyond the Abyan region" about 100 kilometres (62  miles) east of Aden.    Southern forces were preparing to "resist the armed  aggression," the spokesman said, adding that northern forces,  including the Republican Guard, had also been redeployed along  the former north- south border, facing southern troops.    Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, a southern member of  Yemen's  presidential council, told the official UAE news agency WAM that  Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid would "not go to Sanaa in the  current security situation, before troops have been withdrawn  from Yemeni towns." al-Bid was due back in Yemen later Wednesday.    The YSP said Tuesday the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade  ambushed and killed 15 southern soldiers in Abyan, endangering a  reconciliation agreement between north and south signed in Amman  on Sunday. In Sanaa, officials of President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) said two soldiers were  killed and 20 wounded on both sides.    On Monday seven were reported killed in clashes between  troops from north and south. The two armies have not been  merged since the country was unified in May 1990.    Salih and al-Bid signed a deal in Amman on Sunday to end a  political crisis which has paralysed Yemen since al-Bid refused  to take up his duties as vice-president in Sanaa in August,  demanding major economic, political and military reforms.    Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah denounced  southern  leaders on Wednesday for visiting neighbouring Gulf states,  saying they were trying to gain support in the crisis.    "The moves by southern leaders are a continuation of the  undeclared secessionist policies practised since last August,"  Basindwah told the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Siyasah.    Southerner Salim Salih Muhammad rejected Basindwah's  comments  as "baseless" and said the officials were touring Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to explain the Amman accord  and patch up relations which were soured by Yemen's perceived  support for Iraq in the 1991 Gulf war.    Basindwah also said Yemen was keen to have good relations  with Gulf countries "and hopes those countries will realise the  importance of not allowing any party to drag them over to its  side."    He was commenting on al-Bid's visits to Saudi Arabia and  Oman, just after he signed the reconciliation agreement with  Salih.    al-Bid, who heads the YSP, met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for  the first time since the end of the Gulf war. The two leaders  appeared on television in the region shaking hands and smiling.    Salim Salih Muhammad travelled to Kuwait and the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), where he briefed leaders on the Amman accord,  brokered by King Husayn of Jordan.    The reconciliation accord called for constitutional reforms,  an improvement of security and the withdrawal of military  checkpoints from cities.</p>

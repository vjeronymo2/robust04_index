			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Woolf calls for cheaper justice CHEAPER access to justice and a bill of rights to prevent governments nibbling away at individual freedoms were called for yesterday by Lord Woolf. Speaking for the first time since he stirred controversy by attacking government policies to get tough on crime as short-sighted and irresponsible, the law lord said he believed British justice was basically sound. Lord Woolf, who carried out the official inquiry into prison riots in the early 1980s, warned that there were dangers that justice was too expensive. A system of justice was fatally flawed if private citizens and the corporate sector could not afford to invoke it. Lord Woolf quoted a friend whose legal bills were now greater than the cost of repairing a faulty roof over which he had gone to court in the first place. Pointing out that this year's bill for legal aid would approach Pounds 1.3bn, he said efforts should be made to make justice available at an affordable price within existing resources. Given the choice between a luxury service which only a few could afford and a 'rough-and-ready model that does not produce such a refined product', he argued that the latter was preferable. The existing small claims courts were along the right lines, he said. Describing his ideal as 'fast-track' justice, he suggested a court would be presided over by a judge who would act as inquisitor and who would have total control of the proceedings, including whether or not legal representation would be allowed. He accepted that a 'director of civil proceedings' would have to be appointed to monitor the system. Lord Woolf, who was giving the George Bean Memorial Lecture to the Association of Jewish Ex-Service Men and Women, said he was concerned about the number of cases being referred to the European Court of Human Rights. It did nothing to build confidence in British justice if people believed their last hope lay with a European court.</p>

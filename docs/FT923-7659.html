			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Time to do or die on the economy: America Forget family values, education, healthcare and crime. The principal challenge facing the Republican party in Houston this week is economic. If President George Bush leaves the Astrodome on Thursday night having convinced the American people that he can restore economic prosperity in a second term, he may win in November. If he fails to sound credible on the economy, he may as well head straight for retirement in Kennebunkport. The task of reinventing Mr Bush as an economic statesman falls to his old friend, Mr James Baker, who is moving back to the White House as chief of staff. Mr Baker has the credentials for the job. He brings a strong personal staff from the State Department, including Mr Robert Zoellick, his widely respected economic aide. A natural pragmatist, Mr Baker gained worldwide respect as treasury secretary in the mid-1980s when he boldly reversed the Reagan administration's 'hands off' approach to the dollar, advocating instead a policy of collective intervention by the leading industrial powers backed by global co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy. That volte face indicates that Mr Baker would not hesitate to recommend a radical change of economic course if he felt it would help electorally. Mr Baker's return to domestic affairs is a reminder that the sense of drift during Mr Bush's first term owed much to the weakness of his economic team. Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, has been invisible much of the time while more junior figures, such as Mr Michael Boskin, the chief White House economist, lack clout with the president. Mr Bush's domestic advisers repeatedly projected rosy economic upturns, creating the impression that the White House was badly out of touch. They have also mishandled Congress. Mr Bush, for example, set a date this spring (a domestic line in the sand) by which Congress had to pass his 'growth package'; but when Congress did not, he meekly accepted the rebuff. Mr Baker's first task is to rewrite history so as to give the impression that Mr Bush has made economic progress. Frankly, this looks horribly difficult. I can think of only two obvious achievements - a reduction in the rate of inflation from about 5 per cent to perhaps 3 per cent, and the just concluded North American Free Trade Agreement. Neither is an automatic turn-on for voters. Few people regarded the 5 per cent inflation of the 1980s as problematic and hardly any would choose to pay even a temporary price in lost jobs to get it down. Nafta mainly has appeal as a way of countering 'Fortress Europe' and neutralising Japanese economic power, which frightens Americans. But many voters will have mixed feelings, recognising that blue-collar jobs may be exported to Mexico. The negative side of Mr Bush's ledger is daunting. Living standards have barely risen since he was campaigning in 1988 - an awfully long time in this land of short attention spans - while the unemployment rate is sharply higher. Mr Bush has presided over the slowest economic growth of any president since Herbert Hoover and the fastest growth of federal spending since the early 1960s. He has broken his pledge not to raise taxes, but not decisively enough to prevent budget deficits exploding to their highest level since the second world war. The middle classes, struggling to service mortgages on houses that are often losing value, have been hit by soaring costs of healthcare and college tuition. Polls indicate a general loss of confidence in the American dream of steadily rising prosperity. To be fair, Mr Bush's record is poor partly because he had to clear up the mess left by two Reagan presidencies. Mr Reagan pulled every lever to gain temporary advantage: he revved up defence, slashed income and corporate taxes, lowered interest rates and gave huge tax incentives for real estate development. The ensuing boom eventually drowned in a sea of debt. Mr Baker, however, can hardly defend Mr Bush's record by blaming Mr Reagan, whom he served for eight years and who remains a hero to grassroots Republicans. If the past is a minefield, the future is also fraught with danger. Conservative Republicans are strongly pressing a free-market strategy for economic renewal, consisting mainly of sharp cuts in income and capital taxes and vague promises to restrain federal spending. As he left Foggy Bottom last week, Mr Baker signalled support for some of this platform. But he and Mr Zoellick will have to ponder carefully the merits of offering the American people another walk on the supply side. The federal deficit is at record levels, the federal debt has quadrupled to Dollars 4,000bn under three Republican administrations. Mr Bush has shown no capacity to control spending and has already proposed healthcare reforms that will cost an extra Dollars 100bn. Are voters really going to believe in the wisdom of further tax cuts? So what else could the pragmatic team of Baker and Zoellick offer? How about an investment programme to repair the nation's crumbling infrastructure and upgrade workforce skills to make American business more competitive in world markets? Sounds great: too bad that Governor Bill Clinton's policy wonks had the idea first.</p>

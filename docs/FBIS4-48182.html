			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports from inside Tanzania tell us that Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND]  youth-wingers have been separated from the rest of the refugees  and given a separate refugee camp, and some who have been  directly accused of committing atrocities have been arrested and  are now waiting for trial. This is a necessary step that has  been taken by Tanzanian Government, because the youth-wingers  have been committing atrocities against humanity, and should be  arrested anywhere in the world. Apart from this, the  youth-wingers are murderers who pose security risks to other  Rwandese refugees in Tanzania, and security risks to the entire  nation of Tanzania.</p>

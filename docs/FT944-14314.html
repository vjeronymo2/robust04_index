			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (7): Painful adjustments required - The agricultural sector Following the deregulation of agriculture, Zambia was flooded with imports of cheap eggs from Zimbabwe. Zambian consumers were delighted, but farmers were aghast. Had the farmers got their way, egg imports would have been banned. But in Zambia's newly liberalised economy, a ban was out of the question. So Zambian farmers decided to investigate the reasons for the price difference. They discovered that in Zimbabwe, chicken feed was 30 per cent cheaper than in Zambi - and was of better quality, too. In Zimbabwe, 100 hens lay on average 75 eggs a day, whereas their sisters in Zambia produce only 50. Zambian farmers began importing stockfeed from Zimbabwe, which in turn compelled Zambian millers to lower their prices and improve quality. As a result, Zambian farmers are selling more eggs today than in the bad old days of state controls. The example may sound insignificant, but it goes to the heart of the painful adjustments which have been required of Zambia's agricultural sector since President Frederick Chiluba did away with import controls, protected markets and subsidised credit. There is no doubt that Zambia's 400-odd commercial farmers are hurting. Financial deregulation caught them unawares. Most borrowed heavily when interest rates were capped, and are now crippled by the escalating cost of servicing their debts. 'Liberalisation has come at a fast and furious pace,' says a leading commercial farmer in Zambia. 'Borrowing is now punitive, but few farmers are willing to adjust.' Farmers, he says, had grown accustomed to cheap credit, holiday cottages and expensive cars. Under the previous regime, there was little incentive to invest one's own capital, or shed unproductive assets. The deregulation of agriculture has, however, not proceeded as smoothly as the government would have wished. Agriculture officials admit they overestimated the ability of Zambia's small private sector to fill the vacuum when state marketing monopolies were abolished overnight. Most potential traders say they have been discouraged from entering the market by the prohibitive cost of credit. As a result, vast regions of Zambia are now bereft of marketing channels through which small farmers can sell their surplus produce. And in the rich farmland of eastern Zambia, one private trading company operates as a de facto monopoly, dictating the price it is prepared to pay for maize, wheat and oilseeds, in much the same way as the state marketing boards did in the past. Ms Lucy Muyoyeta, Oxfam's resident representative in Lusaka, believes the handover of agricultural credit and marketing to the private sector has been a disaster. Commercial banks are unwilling to extend credit to small farmers because the vast majority of the population has no legal title to land. Oxfam runs two projects which extend soft credits and agricultural inputs to some 3,000 families in eastern Zambia. Farmers repay the loans when the harvest is in. But erratic weather last year led to a high number of loan defaults. And by Ms Muyoyeta's own admission, the help that aid charities such as Oxfam can give is but a drop in the ocean compared with the needs of Zambia's 4m rural dwellers. 'We need far greater investment in rural areas,' Ms Muyoyeta says. 'Roads must be improved, credit must be targeted to low-income farmers and storage facilities built. Farmers must also be encouraged to diversify into cash crops.' With 9m hectares of good arable land, only one-fifth of which is utilised, Zambia's agricultural potential has barely been tapped. Ms Muyoyeta believes the maize monoculture, promoted during the Kaunda years, has left small farmers vulnerable to competition from cheaper imports, European Union 'food aid', as well as the vagaries of the weather. During the last season, which ended in June, maize buying agents appointed by the government bought farm produce with promissory notes. The redemption of these notes came too late into the new planting season for farmers to buy seeds and fertiliser, while some farmers were not paid at all. To avoid a repetition of 1993's maize marketing fiasco, the government has relieved the principal buying agents of their duties and made clear that the country now relies upon private buyers to fill the maize supply gap. This year, however, the government is extending credit to maize buyers through a revolving fund which will be operated by commercial banks.</p>

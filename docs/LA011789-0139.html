			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA TAKES AIM AT PROSTITUTION  </P> <P> In an effort to curb prostitution along Harbor Boulevard, Santa Ana city  officials said today that they will file a lawsuit in Orange County Superior  Court to bar 300 convicted prostitutes and their customers from the  thoroughfare.  </P> <P> The city is seeking injunctions against the prostitutes and their customers,  charging that they create a public nuisance. Those who have been convicted of  prostitution or soliciting prostitutes would be summoned to court and told that  if they are arrested, they will be charged with contempt of court.  </P> <P> Civil libertarians immediately challenged the injunction.  </P> <P> "It's a violation of constitutional rights to try and get people off the street  merely for their criminal record and not for any present illegal conduct," said  Rebecca Jurado, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.  </P></p>

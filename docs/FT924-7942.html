			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: 2.5% rise in NHS patient capacity - Health THE NHS in England will be able to increase the number of patients it treats next year by over 2.5 per cent, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of State for Health, said yesterday. 'That means an extra 190,000 acute in and day patients and one million extra patient contacts by community nurses, taking the total number of patients treated to its highest ever level,' she said in a statement. 'This increase in services is the result of the extra funds which have been announced today for the NHS next year and of the efficiency improvements which we expect the service to make. 'The Government is providing more than Pounds 1bn extra for health services in England next year - a real terms increase of 3 per cent over our original plans for 1992-93, or of one per cent over forecast outturn, equivalent to about 1.8 per cent after taking account of the effects of the measures on pay restraint which the Chancellor has announced today. That means the total increase in Government spending on the NHS in England since we embarked on our NHS reforms in 1989-90 will be over Pounds 9bn, or 17.7 per cent in real terms. Between 1979 and now, Government spending on the NHS has grown by 57.6 per cent in real terms; we have increased nurses' pay by 51.6 per cent after inflation, and doctors' pay by 33.6 per cent. This Government has treated the NHS well: providing more resources and the means for them to be put to best use. The announcement today shows the high priority we continue to attach to the NHS. 'Pounds 800 million of the new money for next year which has been announced today will go to the services provided by trusts and other hospitals and community units. The extra money will be used for the benefit of both patients and health service staff, by: Maintaining the momentum of the health reforms and ensuring that money continues to be used to the maximum benefit of patients; Reducing waiting times by building on our successful Patients' Charter targets; Providing extra support for community health services so that the NHS can play its part in implementing Caring for People; Continuing to give emphasis to health promotion as well as treatment of disease; Making further progress on reducing junior doctors' working hours and providing more Project 2000 training for nurses. 'These sums are in addition to the Pounds 539m which I have already announced will be provided to local authorities next year to implement Caring for People.'</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / ITN chief seeks speedy reshaping of ownership MR BOB PHILLIS, chief exec-utive of Independent Television News, has begun the restructuring of his organisation and hopes to sign up the first new shareholder before the end of this year. The government decided that in future 51 per cent of ITN, at present a wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies, should be held by non-ITV companies. The end of 1994 has been set as the deadline for completing that process. Mr Phillis is keen to move much more quickly to remove uncertainty and also because several ITV companies are interested in selling their stakes. Thames Television, which lost its franchise, is expected to reduce its 22 per cent stake in ITN to 20 per cent, but two other losers - TVS with 8 per cent and Television South West with 2 per cent  - are expected to sell. Some of the smaller ITV companies may also decide to follow. The tiny Channel TV, for example, owns only 0.2 per cent of ITN. London Weekend Television, in spite of retaining its franchise, is believed to be interested in selling its ITN stake. Mr Phillis has been talking to US television companies such as ABC, CBS and Mr Ted Turner's CNN, and the first outside buyer might come from the US industry. The purchase of a 20 per cent stake by a US broadcaster would also help to put a value on an organisation that has been making the painful transition from cost centre to profit centre. Mr Michael Green's Carlton Television, which ousted Thames for the London weekday franchise, has also written to ITN expressing interest in acquiring a stake. The restructuring is likely to involve a mixture of putting together willing buyers and sellers, and raising capital. If a workable structure emerges in which ITV companies still have a majority, only then is Mr Phillis likely to ask Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, to consider removing the 51 per cent outside shareholder rule.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU]  Chairman Theo Waigel has advocated tough action against the  Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo. "If the Serbs do not withdraw  their artillery pieces, bombs will have to fall. Then the  Germans must not stand aside," Waigel said during the CSU's  traditional fish dinner in Schwabing in Munich on Friday evening  [18 February].    One cannot sit forever in front of the television screens  and  express one's dismay, Waigel said. "Action must finally be  taken now." The threat, with well-aimed air strikes against the  Serbian artillery positions and lines, is the only promising  means "to stop the murderers, rapists, and looters."</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURY AUCTION IS OFF TO A GOOD START  </P> <P> Investors gave a hearty reception to the $10 billion of three-year notes the  U.S. Treasury auctioned Tuesday, starting the first-quarter refunding on firm  footing, analysts and dealers said.  </P> <P> But most stopped short of predicting a strong outcome for the rest of the  government bond sale, meant to raise $30 billion in new money to cover the  government's borrowing needs.  </P> <P> Dealers said the $10 billion each of 10- and 30-year issues that will be sold  today and Thursday may not find such eager buyers.  </P> <P> The average yield was 8.43%, up from 7.77% at the last auction on Nov. 9, 1989.  It was the highest rate since three-year notes averaged 9.12% on May 9, 1989.  </P> <P> "The easy part of the refunding is over. We still have the tough part to bid  on," one trader said.  </P> <P> Japanese dealers and investors bought 30% to 35% of the $10 billion of  three-year notes auctioned Tuesday, slightly more than the usual 25% to 30%,  Japanese dealers said.  </P> <P> But the same Japanese dealers said they took the less risky three-year notes  instead of 10-year notes simply because of their responsibility as primary  dealers.  </P></p>

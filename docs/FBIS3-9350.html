Showing that he was not the supporter of the idea "to copy  automatically all that is there (in other democratic  countries)," he considers that "we should apply only what is  best of their experience, but adjusting it to our own needs."    A diplomat of career, Gheorghe Tinca explains why the  appointment of a ministry of civil defence was necessary and  goes on to say: "My experience as a diplomat is, in my opinion,  appropriate for the current stage of reform in the Army. It is,  in fact, a stress laid on contacts, on interactions between our  Army and the armies of other countries. This, first of all, as  regards `the Partnership for Peace' plan, but not exclusively.  We aim to foster ties not only with armies of the countries in  the partnership, but also with that in the European countries  that are not members of that partnership. I would like the  Romanian Army to build a network of relations that will include  other countries of the world, starting with major countries such  as China, Japan, and then with armies in the Latin American  states and in other countries of the world. This does not  affect our main target, that is our integration within  Euro-Atlantic political, economic, and military structures."    Referring to the modernisation of the Romanian Army, the  Romanian defence minister is of the opinion that "due to the  current situation in our country, that is, a period of  transition, I think that a priority is that of keeping the Army  structured to perform a discouraging function, taking into  consideration the fact that we are in an area of instability  that threatens to become more unstable. Under these  circumstances, I think that it would be extremely good for the  Romanian Army to perform a deterrence function, which means that  it will be always operational, but maintained as a  well-determined mechanism to be used whenever needed," the  Romanian defence minister said.    The state of proper training would mean for us and also for  the area we are living in a function favourable for stability,"  Gheorghe Tinca said.</p>

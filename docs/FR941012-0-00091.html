			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Domino felling'' is defined in the final rule as the partial cutting of several trees that are left standing and then pushed over with a pusher tree. Domino felling is a dangerous practice that is prohibited by the final standard. When one tree falls into or against another tree, the direction of fall of each tree may be altered to the point that either tree may fall in an unexpected, and oftentimes, dangerous location. Whenever one tree is being felled and it strikes another tree, the base of the tree being felled can kick back, striking the feller who has not moved away sufficiently from the tree being felled. Additionally, one tree falling into another tree can result in the initial tree becoming lodged in the second tree, thereby making it necessary for an employee to remove the lodged tree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Health care provider'' is defined in this final rule as a health care practitioner operating within the scope of his/her license, certificate, registration or legally authorized practice. As used in this standard, health care providers are practitioners whose authorization qualifies them to approve first-aid kits that are to be used in the logging industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Log'' has been defined in the final rule as a segment sawed or split from a felled tree. This term replaces the terms section, log, bolt and tree length, that were all used in the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard. The usual practice in the harvesting of large and/or tall trees is to cut them into shorter, more manageable lengths before they are yarded so that they may be more easily handled and transported. In some cases, extremely large diameter trees may be split lengthwise so that they can be handled and transported to the mill for further processing. Although the practice of splitting a very large tree is not as common, the Agency has included a log as any section of tree, whether that section has been cut or split from a tree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Logging operations'' is defined in the final standard as operations associated with felling and moving trees and logs from the stump to the point of delivery, such as, but not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, and transporting machines, equipment and personnel from one site to another. The proposed rule did not define logging operations. OSHA has included this definition in the final rule to emphasize that this standard covers those operations involving the felling and moving of felled trees, as opposed to other operations, such as road building that are preparatory to rather than part of logging operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Machine'' is defined in the final standard as a piece of equipment having a self contained powerplant that is operated off-road and is used for the movement of materials. Machines include tractors, skidders, front-end loaders, scrapers, graders, bulldozers, swing yarders, log stackers and mechanical felling devices, such as tree shears and feller-bunchers. In the pulpwood logging and proposed standards, terms such as ``machine'' and ``equipment'' were used interchangeably to describe a piece of equipment that is intended to be operated off-road and is used primarily for the movement of material. Some commenters said they were confused about whether ``vehicles'' were included within the term ``mobile equipment,'' that had been broadly defined as the kind of equipment which includes mobility as part of its work function. Because of the potential for confusion regarding the intention of the Agency in proposing requirements for off-road versus on-road equipment, the Agency has defined both the terms ``machine'' and ``vehicle.'' The intent of the Agency in including these terms is to distinguish between machines, whose primary area of operation is off-road and are primarily material movers, and vehicles that include personnel and material conveyances operated on highways as well as off-road.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operators of many vehicles (primarily trucks, tractor/trailers and buses) require special licenses or endorsements to qualify as an operator of that type vehicle. In contrast, machine operators usually do not have to possess a special license. Therefore, OSHA is defining and imposing different logging-related requirements for the operation of machines and vehicles. The use of the term ``machine'' as used in this standard should not be confused with the use of that term elsewhere in these general industry standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

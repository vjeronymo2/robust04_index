Gorodtsov, Mechanical Problems Institute, </F> Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.466.8]    [Abstract] The integral characteristics of the field of  internal waves generated by rapidly moving bodies in fluids with  different stratifications can be evaluated without full solution  of the problems involved in flow around bodies. The following  aspects of the problem are examined: wave losses for uniformly  horizontally moving bodies; waves at surface of homogeneous  fluid and at interface of two fluids; waves in homogeneously  stratified unbounded fluid; internal waves in stratified  waveguide with horizontal boundaries. The high-velocity  asymptotic form of wave resistance is of the power-law type with  respect to velocity (resistance is inversely proportional to the  square of the Froude number), other than for the case of  movement in the maximum stratification zone and at a great  distance from it in a deep fluid. In the first case (such as  during movement of a fluid along the surface, through the  density jump and in a uniformly stratified unbounded fluid) a  logarithmic dependence on the Froude number is added. In the  latter case it becomes exponential. The method used also is  applicable for other wave types. With respect to the  distribution of radiated energy by different modes, an analysis  indicates a slowness of dropoff of the contributions with an  increase in the mode number in situations close to homogeneous  stratification. With a sufficiently strong localization of  stratification only the lowest modes can be significantly  generated. References 5: 3 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

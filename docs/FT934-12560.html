			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Flextech in talks with TCI: US group to take controlling stake in enlarged Pounds 200m company FLEXTECH, the cable and satellite television group, is in talks to buy the European programming business of Tele-Communications, continuing the current scramble to buy broadcasting assets. TCI, the US broadcasting group, is in turn in merger discussions with Bell Atlantic. The Flextech deal, expected to be tied up by Christmas, will more than double its size, and give TCI a controlling stake in the enlarged company. Flextech's shares jumped 49p to 224p yesterday. The deal is expected to put a value of about Pounds 100m on the assets being acquired and so give Flextech a market value of about Pounds 200m, compared with Pounds 77m at yesterday's close. Talks are still at an early stage, and yesterday's announ-cement was prompted by the rise in Flextech's share price in recent days. Mr Roger Luard, chief executive of Flextech, said the purchase would help it to achieve 'critical mass in programming terms in the UK'. He said the combined company would then develop further, and intended to maintain its quote to enable it to do so. Flextech will issue shares to TCI for the acquisition of United Artists European Holdings, TCI's European programming business. These shares would give TCI a stake in Flextech of probably between 50 and 60 per cent. TCI is expected to take the shares at a premium to the market price reflecting its gaining control. It is planned to get a dispensation from the Takeover Panel so that a full offer for Flextech would not be necessary. Shareholder approval would be required. Flextech has a controlling 50.1 per cent interest in The Children's Channel, through a joint venture with TCI formed last year. It also has a 39 per cent interest in the Family Channel, launched in the UK this summer. The deal will increase Flextech's stake in TCC to 75 per cent, and give it 100 per cent of Bravo, a 'time warp' channel broadcasting cult TV series and old films, plus a 24 per cent stake in UK Gold, which shows old BBC and ITV entertainment programmes and 35 per cent of UK Living, a channel of soaps and quiz shows. Mr Luard said that Flextech, which trades on the USM, was the only quoted company in the UK to focus on cable and satellite broadcasting. It had developed from a small oil services group - the oil activities were sold in 1992 - but still needed a strategic partner to develop rapidly. Flextech is likely to move its shares to the Official List as part of the deal, and may seek a listing in the US as well.</p>

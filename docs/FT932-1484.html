			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market may struggle to digest Peru's mining giant - The problems of scale and complexity surrounding the sale of Centromin CHASE MANHATTAN, in conjunction with Coopers and Lybrand, took on earlier this month probably the most challenging of all Peru's coming privatisations. Together, they are promoting the sale of Centromin, Peru's state-owned mining and refining giant. Given the complexity of the task - Centromin consists of seven separate mines and a huge metallurgical complex with annual sales topping Dollars 400m - the sale strategy is to 'listen to the market'. While the Peruvian government would prefer to dispose of the giant as a single unit, it may prove impossible to find one buyer, or even one consortium, ready to take it on. A detailed information memorandum was available from the co-promoters as from last week. Over a hundred mining companies have been contacted worldwide and requested to fill in a questionnaire detailing their particular interest. Pre-qualification of potential purchasers will commence in late July and it is hoped the sale will be completed by December. All Centromin's properties are in the high central Andes. Six of the mines - Andaychagua, Casapalca, Cerro de Pasco, Morococha, San Cristobal and Yauricocha - are polymetallic, while Cobriza is exclusively a copper deposit. Each mine has its own concentrator plant; Cerro has two. Centromin produces 40 per cent of all Peru's zinc, and more than half of it comes from the Cerro de Pasco mine - the 'jewel in the crown', which mining experts agree is the most attractive single property. Cerro is also responsible for around 25 per cent of Peru's annual lead output and some 8 per cent of its silver. The metallurgical complex of La Oroya, 3,700 metres above sea level, was built by the US-owned Cerro de Pasco Corporation in the second decade of the century. The copper smelter was inaugurated in 1922, followed by a lead smelter and, in 1952, a zinc plant. The smelters process concentrates both from Centromin's own mines and from other privately-owned companies in the northern and central Andes. Close by the smelters are the Huaymanta refineries which produce copper cathodes and wire bars, refined lead and refined zinc. In all, Centromin produces five principal metals and seventeen by-products such as sulphuric acid, arsenic, copper and zinc sulphates and antimony. Although the company could be split into individual production units, the fear is that no buyers will emerge for the less attractive mines. Cobriza, for example, is very isolated and projected output has never been reached. Casapalca is tired and run-down, while Morococha never recovered from a 1989 attack by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas that devastated its infrastructure. Only Andaychagua and Cerro de Pasco have immediately obvious potential. It will be a bold buyer who will take on the entire operation. Aside from the seven mines hundreds of kilometres apart, Centromin operates four hydro-electric plants (with a combined capacity of 183 Mw), 212 km (130 miles) of railroad, eight hospitals and 75 primary and secondary schools. Camps provide housing for a total of 100,000. 'It's too big and complex an animal, and its environmental liabilities are too great to sell as one whole,' says one international mining expert. He puts the value of the company as 'anywhere between Dollars 300m and Dollars 500m', the value of assets and mineral in the ground heavily being discounted in view of the 'necessary clearing-up operations'. Peru's mines ministry appears, however, to recognise the environmental cost element and the government is studying possible use of debt paper to facilitate the sale. A less daunting prospect for the mining investor is state-owned Tintaya, also rapidly being prepared for sale. It is one of Peru's highest-grade copper deposits, located some 250 km south-east of Cuzco, 4,100 metres above sea level on the high Andean plateau. Last year, Tintaya's output of copper concentrates topped 157,000 tonnes, making it Peru's third largest copper mine after Southern Peru's Cuajone and Toquepala. Operations at Tintaya commenced in 1985, with development costs estimated at Dollars 330m. Tintaya's principal drawback is that its sulphide ores reserves, now down to 13m tonnes, will run out in three to four years. So the purchaser will have to start exploitation of as yet untouched nearby deposits - the main three have more than 56m tonnes of proven reserves between them, with a copper content of more than 2 per cent. Studies suggest development costs could be in the region of Dollars 85m. Still to be determined is whether the 'Bambas' deposits - part of the same copper belt as Tintaya but some 150 km away - will be included in the Tintaya privatisation or held over for a later, separate sale. Together they have some 40m tonnes of copper-bearing ore. Mr Francisco Fernandez, head of Tintaya's privatisation committee, believes that the existing Tintaya installations - including a modern, largely Canadian-equipped concentrator plant, which has the benefit of good water and energy supply - could form the nucleus of a future metallurgical complex, perhaps concentrating on ecologically-sound leaching operations. 'In all these sales,' he says, 'the prime consideration is new investment rather than cash down. The state simply doesn't have the resources to develop these promising deposits.'</p>

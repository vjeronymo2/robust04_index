			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): Barely a note of discord from Japan IF Governor Bill Clinton's policies towards Japan are a reflection of his appetite for singing with karaoke machines, relations between the US and Japan should take a sharp turn for the better. Officials from the Arkansas state office in Japan yesterday recalled that during the most recent of his three visits to Japan in 1988 the president-elect and his wife sang in an Osaka karaoke bar until 2am. Mr Satoshi Iue, president of Sanyo Electric, the first Japanese manufacturer to invest in Arkansas, who was the Clintons' guide that night, remarked: 'He enjoyed going in a video arcade, sang very well and fascinated people by playing the saxophone like a pro'. Mr Iue, who has known Governor Clinton for 14 years, added: 'I do not believe the close relationship between Japan and the US will change.' However other Japanese leaders gave Mr Clinton's victory a more cautious welcome. Expressions of gratitude for President George Bush's foreign policy achievements were combined with the uncertainty of losing familiar Republican policymakers and apprehension that Mr Clinton's focus on domestic economic issues may lead the US to withdraw from an active international role. Japanese business and political leaders welcome Mr Clinton's apparent determination to boost US industrial competitiveness on the grounds that a strong US economy is in Japan's best interests. But they worry that a revival might come at the price of a more assertive anti-Japanese trade policy. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa congratulated Mr Clinton and urged the US to continue to play a world leadership role. The premier said that relations with the US would remain the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers Associations, said: 'It appears the Clinton administration will strengthen attention to domestics affairs. 'On this point I am concerned that America will reduce the role it has played in international politics.' Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: 'I am concerned that should he fail to reform the fiscal deficit or bring about economic recovery it would bring about a harder line toward Japan.' One Japanese company already claims to have played a vital role in Mr Clinton's victory. The Arkansas hotel which served as his campaign headquarters is owned by the Tokyo-based Japan Green Stamp company.</p>

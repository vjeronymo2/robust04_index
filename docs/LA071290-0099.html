			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRUSH FIRE CHARS 2 ACRES, INJURES HORSE IN  BARN  </P> <P> A menacing brush fire charred two acres of grassy hillside in the gated  community of Rolling Hills Wednesday morning, causing about $3,000 in damage to  a barn and resulting in a minor injury to a horse.  </P> <P> Firefighters surrounded the three-alarm fire just as it was heading toward a  deep canyon filled with years of dry sagebrush. "If there were wind, God knows  what could have happened," said Rolling Hills Councilwoman Gordana Swanson.  </P> <P> The blaze was the third fire on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in less than a week,  and it raised fears among neighbors, Swanson said. Fire officials warned  homeowners to clear brush up to 200 feet away from their homes.  </P></p>

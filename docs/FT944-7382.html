			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Serbs press into Bihac as Nato squabbles Bosnian Serb forces pressed their military offensive into the embattled town of Bihac late yesterday as squabbling Nato countries tried to put together a plan to save the battered enclave in north-west Bosnia. The United Nations commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, accused the Bosnian Serbs of 'flagrant and blatant' violation of the 'safe area' designated by the UN at Bihac. He said the Bosnian Serbs 'certainly have crossed the line beyond which the safety of the population of Bihac is now threatened' and had refused a ceasefire. 'This is a very grave development which we have to act upon,' he said. Gen Rose unsuccessfully negotiated with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale, near Sarajevo, while ambassadors from Nato's 16 member countries became bogged down in unexpectedly tough talks in Brussels. The ambassadors failed to agree on details of a blueprint to halt the Serb advance on Bihac, referring the matter to the UN for assessment. Mr Robert Hunter, US ambassador to Nato, said the allies were in broad agreement over a proposal to set up a 'stabilisation zone' around Bihac, but some details would have to be worked out by the UN. The US expects the proposal to go to military specialists at the UN rather than the Security Council. The specialists are expected to assess what troops might be needed to make the proposal work. The US initially urged its allies to create, around Bihac, as wide a zone as possible where heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes. But European members of Nato, led by France, suggested a more modest plan for a four-mile extension of the existing 'safe area', within which the UN is committed to protecting civilians and its own peacekeepers. The French also insisted that more ground troops would be needed to implement any ceasefire agreement. The French stance was aimed at driving home to the US, which has declined to send ground troops to Bosnia, the limits of a policy based purely on air power. Gen Rose said that Bosnian Serbs late yesterday advanced from high ground to the very outskirts of Bihac. He did not think the town could hold out against any sustained attack. An amateur radio operator reporting from Bihac said the Bosnian Serbs were only one kilometre from the town centre. In Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, sharply criticised the Bosnian government, accusing it of provoking the fighting around Bihac in the hope of prompting western intervention. There could be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict and outside intervention could result in a 'second Afghanistan or Vietnam'. Mr Kozyrev said next week's meeting of the contact group - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - must send a 'clear signal that the world community . . . favours a return to political methods' in Bosnia. Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night warned that the UN might have to pull out of Bosnia if there were a resumption of all-out war in the region. Mr Major said there could be no prospect of imposing peace on Bosnia through aerial bombardment. He said that he had sent a letter to leaders of contact group countries stressing 'the urgency of progress' at their next meeting. The UN's contingent in Bihac is largely made up of 1,200 poorly armed Bangladeshis, who were resupplied by a UN convoy yesterday under an agreement with the Serbs. The UN's vulnerability to any all-out confrontation with the Serbs was driven home yesterday when over 250 peacekeepers from Canada, France, Russia and Ukraine were detained in the Sarajevo area.

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (12): Financial image gets a shine - Moves to liberalise the securities market are 'too little, too late' TAIWAN'S government has long been criticised for moving too slowly to improve the image of the island's financial markets. But last month the government cracked down on illegal margin lending, licensed 11 new foreign mutual funds, and speeded up approvals for inward remittances by foreign fund managers for investment in equities, although these remittances are still subject to clearance by the island's central bank. The sudden surge of activity constituted an attempt to whip up confidence in Taiwan's sagging stock market, after the discovery of stock defaults worth more than USDollars 320m, and the detention of two of the market's 'big hands', or stock speculators, last month. The market fell more than 10 per cent at one stage, although it has since recovered slightly. Foreign fund managers say, however, that the government's moves were too little, too late and the conservative central bank remains a barrier to securities market liberalisation. Mr David Yu, research manager at Wardley James Capel, said: '(The recent measures) are better than nothing. But inward remittances should be approved by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) alone. It's unreasonable that the central bank has so much control.' Under the present system, inward-bound funds already approved by Taiwan's SEC can still be delayed for months, or even finally refused, if the central bank thinks they might contribute to Taiwan dollar appreciation. The finance ministry had originally hoped to attract USDollars 2.5bn to Taiwan in foreign institutional investment, to broaden the investor base. Since an application by Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming was first approved in March 1991, however, only USDollars 735m has been remitted to Taiwan, by 14 fund managers. These include Fidelity Investments of the US, and Pierson, Hendring and Pierson of the Netherlands. The problems in the stock market sum up for foreign investors the problems that Taiwan faces in its ambitions to become a regional financial centre. There have been cautious moves towards reform. But financial markets remain poorly structured, for example 70 per cent of investment comes from individuals, rather than institutions, and the government retains significant control over markets which it deems strategic, such as foreign exchange. One area which has been reformed, however, is domestic commercial banking, where 15 new local banks began operations at the beginning of this year, ending 40 years of a near-monopoly by state-run banks, and almost doubling the number of domestic banks within four months. The newcomers have initiated feverish competition within the banking industry, particularly in short-term lending, mortgages and demand deposits, which now make up around 60 per cent of all their deposits. The new banks, which have a minimum paid-in capital of USDollars 400m, have been permitted to increase their number of branches at a faster rate than the established banks. However, they are not likely to be licensed to handle the simplest foreign exchange transactions for at least another year. The suddenness with which the banking sector was opened up has generated fears among industry observers that there will not be enough business to go round. Many predict failures, or at best mergers, within the next few years. The government has said bank failures are not its responsibility, but the shareholders', among whom are some of Taiwan's largest companies. Vice-finance minister Mr Lee Chung-ying said: 'In a free-market system, you can't prevent banks from going under,' but added that his ministry periodically runs checks on the newcomers' books. In an attempt to improve financial facilities for Taiwanese investors in mainland China, the government last month also allowed Taiwan banks to do business with branches of Chinese banks overseas, and Chinese branches of foreign banks, although direct financial links with China are still banned. The sudden expansion of commercial banking has led to complaints from foreign banks, whose margins are being pared away by the new competition. Foreign banks have only recently been permitted to apply for a second branch in Taiwan, and are not allowed to open subsidiaries. Foreign bankers say they would also like to see faster progress in foreign exchange markets. The government has been moving slowly on drafting regulations for new financial products. Taiwan still has no domestic futures market, although a law allowing trading in foreign futures through foreign brokers will come into effect this November. Implementation may take some time. Other reforms, which may also be delayed due to differences within the government on the speed of change, include the completion of a new law abolishing foreign exchange controls except in a state of emergency, to go before the legislature within the next year. The government has begun processing applications for new domestic insurance companies. Among foreign insurers only American insurance companies, or US subsidiaries of non-US companies, are at present allowed to set up branches in Taiwan. However, this situation may change due to pressure on Taiwan to liberalise its financial services markets in order to enter the Gatt.</p>

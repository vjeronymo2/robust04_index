			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Thailand Is Not a Battlefield"] </F>   [Text] Even though the truck bomb belonging to  international terrorists that was discovered recently did not  cause a devastating explosion, we should not let the incident  pass as if nothing happened. At the least, the terrorists  committed a crime by killing a Thai and putting his body in a  water tank that contained explosives. Imagine how serious the  damage would have been if the highly destructive bomb had really  exploded. The damage would not only have affected the target of  the terrorists' revenge, but also Thai people who were not the  target of their vengeance at all.    Therefore, we must not let this savage act pass like a  trivial issue. At least their colleagues in the movement will  realize that committing terrorist acts, killing our people, and  causing damage in our country are unacceptable to us. They will  never gain the Thai people's sympathy or support for their  fight. Therefore, this terrorist act in our country has ruined  any chance for friendship and understanding from the Thai  people. They must keep this fact in mind.    Whatever the target of the terrorist act was -- whether it  involved the Palestinian-Israeli problem, the Arab-Israeli  conflict, or any religious or political dispute -- if they  cannot love each other the way human beings should help and  sympathize with one another, and if they remain vengeful rather  than reaching an understanding with each other, let them carry  out their revenge somewhere else. They must not use Thai  territory as a battlefield for their vengeance and destruction.    Thailand is friendly with all countries. Our country is open  to people of all nations in compliance with our policy of  promoting tourism, which is a way to bring money into the  country and encourage the country's economic growth. We do not  want this open door policy to make our country a battlefield for  people from one country to take out revenge and kill people from  other countries, or for a follower of one ideology to harm  someone who holds different beliefs. We do not want our country  to be a venue for revenge.    We hope they understand the Thai people's desires. They must  know that committing crimes in other countries will cause them  to be hated. At the same time, it will also isolate them from  the world community. An isolated struggle, without sympathy  from the world community, will never bring victory -- only  defeat. Those who commit terrorist acts in other countries will  be denied entry. Thailand is ready to deny entry and not welcome  these kinds of people.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: French homes, who gets what MOST English couples are used to the English way of owning property. If you buy a house with your spouse, it is presumed that you will buy as joint tenants, unless you specify to the contrary. As a joint tenant your share will automatically be left to your spouse on your death tax-free. You can change your mind at any time and 'sever your joint tenancy'. You will then own the property as 'tenants in common' and, on your death, your share will pass according to your will and intestacy. There are no restrictions in English law on who you can leave your share to - for example, there is nothing to make you leave your house to your children, or stop you from leaving it to your secretary. Only if you leave your dependants without making proper financial provision for them can your arrangements be upset, and then only after your death and under the direction of the English courts. However, when an English married couple buys a property in France, the rules are very different. It is possible to buy en indivision. This is similar to the English 'tenants in common'. Unlike the English tenants in common you cannot leave your share in the property to just anyone. Your children (but not your spouse) have 'entrenched rights' to your share which automatically accrues to them on your death, regardless of your will. Suppose that you and your spouse own a chateau jointly and that you have two children. If your spouse dies, you may be entitled to one third of your spouse's share and your children to one third each, if your spouse has written an appropriate will which respects French succession law. At this point, English law muddies the water, since minors cannot own property. If you want to sell the chateau after your spouse's death you will have to make an application to court for an order authorising the sale. In addition, French death duties will be payable, not only on the transfer to your children but also on the transfer to you. There is no exemption from tax on transfers between spouses. Each child and your spouse will be able to receive value of up to Ffr300,000 and Ffr330,000 tax free respectively. At the time of a French marriage, a so-called 'clause d'accroissement' may be included in the marriage contract which will have a similar effect to an English joint tenancy. In addition, assets can then pass into the sole ownership of the survivor free of death duties. If a couple have not married under this regime (called 'La Communaute universelle avec clause d'accroissement), it is possible to adopt it later on. Marriage contracts are void under English law, but an English couple adopting the regime with regard to their French property. One commonly suggested solution to the problem of limited testamentary freedom in France is to buy through a Societe Civile Immobiliere, a hybrid between a company and partnership. You will then own your chateau through your interest in the SCI, which is called a parts de Societe. If neither you nor your children are domiciled in France, French succession laws will not apply to your share in the SCI, so it can be left to whomever you please. There are disadvantages to owning your chateau through an SCI, such as: French death duties will be payable If you are a director of the SCI, you could be liable to tax in the UK under the benefit-in-kind provisions applicable to a company providing accommodation with its directors. There will be costs associated with setting up the SCI An SCI cannot let furnished property, without the risk of losing fiscal transparency An SCI is not immune from French wealth tax. You may be tempted to own your chateau through a tax haven company - but do not. The French tax authorities will try to argue that the company should be in receipt of rent from the property and tax the company accordingly if it is resident in a tax haven; and also charge an annual 3 per cent levy on the deemed value of your property if the company is resident in a country with which France does not have a double tax treaty. One idea to consider with your adviser if you and your family are UK resident is to own your chateau through a UK company on trust, for you for your lifetime, and thereafter, your family. However, it may be important to give money to the UK company to buy the chateau, rather than buy the chateau first and give it to the trust. The transfer tax on gifts is prohibitive in France. If you take this course: It is unlikely that French death duties will be payable on your death if the chateau continues to be held by the UK company on trust. French laws will not automatically vest a share in the children You would be using the chateau as a beneficiary of the trust, rather than as a director of the SCI, so the UK benefit in kind tax provisions need not apply. The UK has a tax treaty with France and is not a tax haven for the purposes of the income charge and arguably the trust will also escape the 3 per cent levy if it is managed in the UK. An alternative way of dealing with these problems is to buy your chateau personally using debt secured on the property. The problems do not vanish but the consequences will be less severe.

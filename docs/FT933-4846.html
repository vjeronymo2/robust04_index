			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: Moving British debut - Edinburgh THE SINGER Thomas Quasthoff, who made his British debut on Friday morning, was one of the Edinburgh Festival's unknown quantities. In the event, his recital of Schubert and Brahms lieder proved a real success. A friend, who had arrived late at the Queen's Hall and had had to wait outside the auditorium until a suitable pause, told me afterwards of his immediate excitement in hearing Quasthoff's eloquence and unaffected communicative ease through the closed doors, though he had known nothing of Quasthoff beforehand. This is an important test, because those who see Quasthoff before he starts to sing may find their reactions coloured by the fact that he is a victim of thalidomide. His publicity makes no mention of this, and he himself draws no attention to it. He enters with his accompanist, mounts some extra steps, and sings from his perch on a stool. His face is calm, his manners simple and sweet, his accord with Peter Langehein, his accompanist, one of affection and good humour. Quasthoff's voice is described as a baritone, though to my ear it is more like a very light bass. In recital it reveals no great volume or glamour, and sometimes it starts to sound slightly reedy. But he is a communicator, one who makes the words he sings speak. The sheer lack of fuss or sentimentality in his way of singing 'An die Musik' was refreshing - and touching, after the several dark Schubert songs he had already delivered. Then, after the interval, he sang the Brahms Four Serious Songs. He gave them without the gravitas or portentousness that has often marked their performance, but rather as a plain creed by which he lived his life. Like others, I was moved to tears by the Brahms. Lest I sound too enthusiastic about Quasthoff, I state that his art is not one of limitless resource. He phrases with a natural sense of legato but without an always firm cantilena line. He shades his singing eloquently, but has a restricted range of vocal character; there is not much contrast (though enough) between the three or more 'roles' he plays in the course of Schubert's Szene aus Faust and Erlkonig. Singing 'Infelice, e tu credevi' from Verdi's Ernani (as a self-indulgent first encore), he did not attempt the advanced years of the character who sings it; heartfelt, but youthful and small-scaled. Yet Quasthoff is so sincere a singer that he never seems held back by such limitations. The personality that he projects is one of dignity and reflectiveness. He seems naturally suited to music of a personal, Romantic tendency; but he handled some of Schubert's longer narratives with assurance. May he return to these shores, and soon.</p>

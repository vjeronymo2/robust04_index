			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Recession forces API into loss SEVERE recessionary conditions across a range of markets pushed API Group, formerly Associated Paper Industries, into loss in the six months ended March 30. Including Pounds 570,000 (Pounds 90,000) of exceptional charges, relating mostly to provisions for re-organisation and redundancy costs, the pre-tax loss totalled Pounds 849,000 on turnover of Pounds 29.55m. On a like-for-like basis, interim profits in 1990 amounted to Pounds 817,000 on turnover of Pounds 31.81m. Despite this, the company is maintaining its interim dividend at 2.75p. The shares dipped 1p to 107p. Mr Peter Armitage, chairman, said that 'the single greatest adverse influence' on the results was Henry &amp; Leigh Slater, the coated and laminated board unit, 'whose customers have been susceptible to the combined effects of the recession and the Gulf war'. 'We are not despondent,' Mr Armitage said. The group, which recently lost its managing director following a disagreement over strategy, now has three divisions, encompassing image enhancement products, converted film and paper products and heating and ventilating systems. API is responding to the economic climate by lowering its cost base, necessitating 50-60 lay-offs, and by accelerating its just-in-time programme. It is also in the process of recruiting a new chief executive and two new non-executive directors. There was a Pounds 131,000 extraordinary item for the costs of improving emission control at the group's Dry Print business in the US. Mr Armitage said that the company was 'opening negotiations' with Dry Print's previous owner for the recovery of some of this money. Losses per share were 2.7p, against earnings of 2.5p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Government  issued a circular here today to strictly ban the sales of  non-iodized salt to the state's vast iodine deficient (IDD)  areas, so as to help prevent the occurrence of iodine deficiency  diseases.    The circular, co-issued by the State Administration of  Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the Ministry of Public Health and  China National Light Industry Council, demands that on no  account should any non-iodized salt or inferior iodized salt be  allowed to enter the salt markets in the iodine deficient areas.  Severe penalties will be assessed to those who transport or  sell the above-mentioned salt to the endemic regions.    To ensure a sound administration of the state's salt  markets,  which have shown some disorder in parts of the country, the  government will issue new permits to the enterprises which are  qualified for salt production or wholesale transaction of salt  products.    The SAIC has set April 30 as the deadline for the salt  enterprises to renew their registrations.    According to Yin Dakui, vice-minister of public health,  China  is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD prevalence.    Yin said that the most effective way to eliminate IDD is the  constant consumption of iodized salt, which is also China's  long-term strategy to prevent such endemic diseases.    According to the vice-minister, the government has set the  goal to make all salt in China iodized by 1996 and to eliminate  IDD nationwide by the year 2000.    Yin noted that marked progress has already been achieved in  the prevention and treatment of IDD since the founding of the  People's Republic of China in 1949.    According to him, a total of 385 institutes for IDD control  have been set up nationwide in the past decades. And with the  preventive measures and treatment over many years, the original  35 million patients with endemic goiter in the country have been  reduced to 7 million and the new occurrence of endemic cretinism  has been controlled.</p>

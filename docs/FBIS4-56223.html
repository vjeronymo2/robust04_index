			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- El Salvador's  Legislative Assembly, elected last 20 March and in which the  former guerrillas are represented as the second largest  political force, opened its session with a solemn ceremony today.    The first point on the agenda was the appointment of the  Debate Commission--which later presided over the first plenary  session--headed by Deputy Walter Rene Araujo, of the  progovernment Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA, rightist).    Former guerrilla Commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, of the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and labor  leader Rosa Melida Villatoro, a deputy of the Christian  Democratic Party (PDC), were appointed commission secretaries.    Ana Guadalupe Martinez, who with 20 other FMLN  representatives form the second largest legislative force, read  the roster of 84 deputies who make up the parliament.    Following this ceremony, Walter Araujo announced a one-hour  recess so that the Debate Commission can receive the credentials  of deputies and vote later to elect the board of directors.</p>

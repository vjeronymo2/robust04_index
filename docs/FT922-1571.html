			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts A curious feature of UK government funding since the election has been the unusually high profile of index-linked gilts. At some Pounds 1.2bn, new index-linked stock accounts for more than 10 per cent of gilts sold so far in 1992-93, bringing the total size of the market to almost Pounds 14bn. The Bank of England has clearly uncovered demand for this paper. Less obvious is why such demand should exist. The prospect of declining inflation should make conventional gilts more attractive, despite the worries on economic convergence unleashed by Denmark's Maastricht referendum. Admittedly, index-linked gilts have a much greater appeal to high-rate UK taxpayers than conventional gilts. But this advantage has always existed. A more important factor appears to be the unusually narrow yield differential between index-linked and equities. The chart shows that, even after the fall in equity prices last week, the differential is still below its long-term trend. Indeed, since the election it has plumbed depths rarely seen since just before the 1987 crash. There is no need to dwell on that ominous parallel, but the behaviour of the differential further undermines the fundamental basis for the post-election rally in equities. Since index-linked stock offers both inflation adjustment and a guaranteed real return, it is the next best thing to a risk-free equity investment. The risk involved in equities - of the chosen company going bankrupt, for example, or simply the ravages of the cycle - means they should normally command a yield premium over index-linked. Arguably that premium should now be more than the 0.5 to 0.6 of a percentage point to which it has tended in recent years. The poor economic outlook has clouded the prospects for real earnings growth, while the abnormally low average level of dividend cover makes equity yields less secure than they at first sight appear. One might thus have expected heavy buying to hit the index-linked market as equity investors became more risk averse. That this did not happen owes something to traditional worries about trading liquidity, as well as the dampening effect of the Bank's habit of issuing new paper to meet demand. It may have plenty of opportunity to do so if doubts over the future of European currency union create resistance in the conventional gilts market to the government's large funding requirement. The extra volume could be to the market's benefit. As its size increases, liquidity will improve. Eventually the index-linked market could offer a viable opportunity for investors who want equity style growth with minimal risk.</p>

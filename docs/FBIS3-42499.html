			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Viktor Shvirov on </F> meeting with journalists by Chief of the General Staff of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine and First Deputy Minister of Defense of  Ukraine Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata: "Building a Strong Army  is Difficult Without Money and Harmony"]    [Text] Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces  of Ukraine and First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine  Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata met with the editors of a number  of the central newspapers of Ukraine, as well as the creative  staffs of radio and television. In the course of a more than  two-hour discussion, Anatoliy Vasylovych related some of the  results in building the armed forces and the problems and  difficulties of this difficult matter, and answered a host of  questions.    NARODNA ARMIYA has already introduced Colonel-General  Anatoliy Lopata to its readers, and there is probably no need to  present his biography again. We will nonetheless emphasize once  again that Anatoliy Vasylovych linked his life with the army  some thirty five years ago. After completing general military  school, he served as commander of a platoon, company and  battalion, chief of staff, regimental commander, deputy division  commander, commander of a division, a corps and first deputy  commander of a group of forces. He has completed two military  academies--imeni M.V. Frunze and the General Staff.    It was not easy for Anatoliy Vasylovych to make the time for  the meeting with journalists on this day. He nevertheless found  an hour or two for the conversation with us. Thanking us for the  attention that the employees of the press, radio and television  have devoted to the armed forces and their problems, he stated  that the main result of the two years of building the army is  the fact that independent Ukraine has its own army. That is  first. Second, we have the opportunity to look back today and  analyze what has been done and what has not, and on that basis  to define more concrete ways of realizing the program of  military organizational development. The level of leadership of  the armed forces today, and first of all the activity of the  General Staff in this area, has become much higher. And it is  there that I see the consequences of the work of my subordinates.    Third, we have finally clarified the status of the armed  forces staff. Today it has the name of the General Staff of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine. And that is no small feat.    Fourth, we are building our army today on a quite solid  legal  foundation. I have in mind here the laws "The Defense of  Ukraine," "The Armed Forces of Ukraine," and the Military  Doctrine, which was recently adopted by our parliament, along  with other legislation.    I would also like to say something about this. Our cadres  today--the officers, warrant officers, NCOs and soldiers--are  people who have clearly answered the question of whom they are  serving and how they are serving. We have been lucky to preserve  the combat readiness of our troops at a level that guarantees  the reliable defense of the peaceful labor of the people of  Ukraine under difficult conditions. And that is convincingly  testified by the results of the recent performance evaluations  for the past training year.    Unfortunately, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata continued,  there are shortcomings and mistakes in our work. In the past  year, for example, we were not fortunate enough to fulfill  entirely the program relating to the training of units and  subunits. Why, you ask? There is one reason--not enough  mat&eacute;riel or funds. We had to cut back the training time of  flight personnel in aviation units, say, owing to the acute  shortage of fuels and lubricants, and we were not able to  conduct regimental tactical exercises in the full amount with  the use of vehicles and other means on which the professional  proficiency of the commanders and their subordinates depends to  a considerable extent.    Consider this: It has been estimated that for an army to  fulfill the tasks entrusted to it successfully requires  somewhere around 3.6 percent of the gross national income for  its maintenance and development. This is the ideal--that is, if  the state already has well-formed statehood and developed armed  forces. Ukraine is still on its way to that. So everything being  supplied to the army today is not sufficient. The armed forces,  for example, were allocated just a third of the amount we needed  last year, and even less if the uncontrolled inflation is taken  into account. The financial inflows, in short, are barely enough  to feed and clothe the people and pay them. There is simply  nothing left for the rest.    There is also no money, most unfortunately, to supplement  the  inventory of combat vehicles, or for the development and  manufacture of more effective models of weaponry. What has and  will the army live on? To a significant extent on the former  reserves of logistical mat&eacute;riel and military property. The  reserves, meanwhile, if they are not replenished, will be  exhausted sooner or later. As for the money, Minfin [Ministry of  Finance] is also seeking out opportunities and passing them on  each month for the needs of the armed forces. But the officers,  warrant officers, workers and employees are nonetheless  receiving their pay late these days. This, in turn, is having a  negative effect on their attitude toward the work and the  well-being of their families. It is especially difficult for  those who reside in remote garrisons where there are not always  kindergartens, schools, stores, or bus lines with the closest  inhabited areas. Whatever one may say, everything is not as  simple as it could seem to some.    The state and the MO [Ministry of Defense] are nonetheless  doing a great deal to ease the lives of servicemen and the  members of their families. The question of issuing food rations  to officers and warrant officers was positively resolved  recently in particular, as well as cigarettes for soldiers and  NCOs. There is no doubt that the issues that have acutely faced  the people in uniform will also find understanding in the  government.    We return, however, to the problems connected with the  renewal of hardware and weaponry. I would not be surprised if  some of you were to ask me how it could have happened that we  have such a mighty defense industry as ours, but the army today  is still using what it got from the once-mighty and  "indivisible"? We really did get a mighty scientific and  industrial potential after the collapse of the Union. It must be  said that the armed forces themselves have a solid production  base--there are several dozen repair plants alone. But they,  like the enterprises of the military-industrial complex, are in  a difficult situation today. Quite a few of them, owing to the  absence of funds in the Ministry of Defense for the procurement  of hardware and weaponry and their repairs, as well as the  ordering of new models of weaponry, have been forced to seek out  ways that would permit them to at least make ends meet in these  difficult times.    The problem of military science, without which the army  cannot manage, is no less acute. Everything would appear to be  understandable here. But what is actually happening? Just a  hundredth of what is required has been invested in the  development of military science today. A great deal of  scientific work has been curtailed owing to the lack of  finances. We have considerable scientific potential at the same  time. It just needs to be preserved and strengthened with  funding. The need, however, does not always match the  capabilities. The Ministry of Defense is losing excellent cadres  of scientific personnel, who will scarcely be coming back in the  future, as a consequence.    Other difficulties being experienced by the army could be  cited as well, said Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata. But it will  live on nonetheless, and take on new forms and outlines. I am an  optimist by nature, so if you ask me what I would like to see  for our armed forces in the future, then I would answer without  reflection--to be respected by the people and the state. How can  that be achieved? There is certainly no unequivocal answer to  that question, as it is complex and multifaceted. And  nonetheless, it seems to me, many of these problems could recede  by themselves if we are able to raise the prestige of military  service and the prestige of the military person in society. So  once again, how? You will not achieve anything here by  punishment or some willful decisions, and could even make  matters worse. Let us make a small excursion into the recent  past in order to understand and look into the reasons for the  decline in prestige of military service.    More or less better conditions have been created for people  in the spheres of trade, business and entrepreneurship over the  last five or six years or so. That has had an immediate effect  on the armed forces. Military cadres, and not the worst of them,  began to flow out of the ranks. This process was not halted  after Ukraine began to build its own army. I do not want to say  that business and trade are not needed by our society. But  without reliable people devoted to their homeland serving in the  army, we cannot talk about a strong state. I would like to see,  that is, intelligent youth loyal to their Fatherland come to us.    I also touched at the beginning of our discussion on the  problem of financing the army. I would like to see our armed  forces have a budget that would be sufficient not only for their  maintenance, the training of personnel and the upkeep of  hardware in combat-ready condition, but also for the development  of military science, the creation of new models of hardware and  weaponry etc. Only in that case will our troops be engaged in  what they should be, that is, raising the level of their combat  readiness. But one can only think about that now; time does not  wait. And that is where this could lead.    I will refer as an example to a problem connected with the  development and creation of our hardware and weaponry.    Everything our army is equipped with today is hardware and  weaponry of the former Soviet Army, which is, by the way, not  eternal and has entirely concrete service lives. A completely  new tank, say, can be operated for a span of fifteen or twenty  years. The vehicle is obsolete upon the expiration of that  period, and it must be replaced. Financing is needed today, in  order to place an order for a new model of weaponry, for  scientific development, and then for the manufacture of the  vehicles at enterprises in the military-industrial complex.  Taking into account the fact that the average time period for  the birth of a new model of a weapon, depending on the  complexity of the work, is seven to fifteen years, one may say  that if money is not invested in the development of weapons  today, then in seven or fifteen years we will not have them.    It would not be quite correct to say that no one understands  the ruinous nature of this situation. Ask any of our workers and  you will be convinced of that. The understanding is possibly  worse at higher levels. If, say, we want to get our finances in  order, then people appear who will say that perhaps we could  wait for the future for our armed forces, and let them survive  through the reserves that they have. But everything that used to  be in the army is coming to an end today. It has actually  already lived and maintained its combat readiness for two years  thanks to internal reserves. Today we need to think seriously  about the future of the armed forces, that is, about their  further improvement and development. And in all of this we have  still not said anything about the accumulation of material  resources and reserves for difficult times.    Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata emphasized, in answering a  question regarding what the ideology will be in the army, that  the leadership of the armed forces is doing everything to see  that it has one, uniform ideology--the state ideology. To put it  in more concrete terms, then we will try first and foremost to  see that every serviceman--officer or warrant officer, sergeant  or soldier--is a citizen of his Fatherland, and that his level  of training and readiness would permit him to fulfill his  patriotic duties to defend the independent Ukraine with honor.  That is first. Second, I also see my task as seeing that there  is unity, harmony and understanding of their tasks among the  servicemen with regard to the security of our state. Avoiding  discord in the thoughts of soldiers, sergeants and officers is  facilitated to no small extent by the work to avert the  influence of political parties and movements on the military  collectives. It is no secret that such influence exists in  Ukraine. I would like to remind them once again that our army is  not needed for political battles, it is needed for the  protection of the interests of the state and its land, sea and  air borders, and for the maintenance of peace and harmony in  society. And there are not, and cannot be, even the slightest  actions here by those who have quite different aims and  interests.    With a view to continuing the discussion of this topic, the  chief of the General Staff was asked a question regarding the  political situation in Sevastopol and, in particular, the  motives for the recent murder of the chief of the press center  of the Black Sea Fleet, Captain 1st Rank A. Lazebnykov. That  city, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, is becoming a tangled knot of  political problems and many unresolved issues pertaining to the  further existence and presence of the ChF [Black Sea Fleet] on  our land. As for the murder of the head of the press center,  neither the armed forces nor the Ukrainian Navy have any  relation to that whatsoever. The opinion of the chief of the  General Staff is that there were no political motives at all at  the heart of that tragic incident, the more so any of the  conflicts that existed at one time between the sailors of the  ChF and the Ukrainian Navy. Something else is concealed here.    The journalists were also unable to avoid asking about some  of their own problems at this meeting. The discussion concerned  in particular the fact that it has become more difficult for the  members of the press to obtain information pertaining to  military topics, and whether that was connected with any  prohibitions. That is in reality not so. The armed forces of  Ukraine, emphasized the chief of the General Staff, have never  been closed to the mass media. But here is something to worry  about. Quite a few commentators have appeared here recently who  are, without any authority or rights whatsoever, sharing with  this or that correspondent their ideas pertaining to this or  that factor or incident, and are frequently passing that off as  the stance of the Ministry of Defense. I, said Colonel-General  Anatoliy Lopata, am categorically against that treatment of the  issue. If we want to tell our people about the life of the  military collectives, then we should turn to the people who know  what they are talking about, what the essence of the problem is.  Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to confirm  once again what I have said many times before: Ask our  specialists, ask me, ask our chiefs of directorates any question  at any time if you please, and no one will fail to inform you of  anything. By the way, we will never close the gates of a unit to  journalists, we will not conceal problems from them connected  with non-regulation relations, with desertion from the army. In  confirmation of what he said, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata  related in quite a bit of detail how many of our servicemen are  on the run today, and what reasons prompted them to take such a  step. There are currently fifty-three soldiers "on the run" in  the Carpathian region, for example. The motives that impelled  them to leave their military collectives are very diverse. The  people left their units, however, as a rule not because they  were beaten or driven from them, but rather because many of them  are simply not ready to bear all of the difficulties of military  service in a steadfast manner.    The army is not able to solve this problem alone. It exists,  one might say, at the boundary of military and civilian  activity. Much here depends on the schools, parents and labor  collectives, and on their work with regard to the patriotic  indoctrination of the pre-draft youth.    Seeing alternative service as one realistic way of restoring  the situation in the military collectives, the journalists were  interested in hearing from the chief of the General Staff how  the call-up for that service was proceeding, what difficulties  are arising. Reminding them of some of the provisions of the Law  of Ukraine "Alternative (Extra-Military) Service,"  Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata observed, not without regret,  that hundreds of youth who have expressed the desire to work,  for example, in construction or at treatment centers, hospitals  or other places are not being called. Some fear the longer term  of service, others are unaware, and still others... There is, in  short, much here to think about and work on.    The discussion next turned to national problems and, in  particular, what the composition of the army will be. In  accordance with the principles of military organizational  development, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, the armed forces of  Ukraine have to be popular rather than national. I like the name  of our newspaper NARODNA ARMIYA on that plane. The people  [narod] are a union of many peoples and  nationalities. Look how many there are in our country. Living  here, aside from the Ukrainians, are Russians, Belarusians,  Moldovans, Poles, Germans...    Why am I talking about this? Because if we want there to be  peace and harmony in our independent state, then it is very  important to have a well-disposed and understanding attitude  toward each person, no matter what nationality he may be. The  fact that each member of society is passionate about Ukraine and  defends its independence is no less important in turn. And if  that is so, then he is obliged to enjoy all the same rights as  Ukrainians. There will otherwise not be harmony in society, and  the state will not have a mighty and combat-ready army.    At the end of the meeting the journalists were interested in  the thoughts of the chief of the General Staff on the nuclear  weapons that are located on the territory of our state, ways and  options for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, the procedure for  the transfer and future use of of military compounds after the  disbanding of military units in the strategic forces and a great  deal more. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, answering all of the  questions clearly and exhaustively, appealed to the journalists  with the request and wish to be very considerate and delicate  with regard to covering the life and activity of the armed  forces, and called for objective writing on current event and  more vigorous and purposeful work in favor of the army, to  strengthen its reputation and raise combat and mobilization  readiness.</p>

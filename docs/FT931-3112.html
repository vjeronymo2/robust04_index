			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / National Grid pay offer of 3.95% MORE than 5,000 electricity workers employed by National Grid have been offered a 3.95 per cent pay rise backdated to February 1, plus one-off payments of between Pounds 700 and Pounds 900 linked to a deal on working practices. The offer is substantially more than the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for the public sector and twice the rate of inflation. It is also more than the PowerGen offer of a 2.5 per cent pay rise plus lump-sum payments of between Pounds 250 and Pounds 550, and last October's National Power deal of 3.9 per cent over 15 months.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales at Oslo health products group rise 13% Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products, yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in annual sales and a doubling of the dividend to NKr4.40 a share, writes Karen Fossli. Hafslund boosted pre-tax profit last year, to NKr1.57bn (Dollars 207.4m) from NKr1.5bn in 1992, as sales, including royalties, advanced to NKr6.58bn from NKr5.84bn. The improvement came in spite of European government measures to curb healthcare costs and price pressures in Nordic markets. Royalties rose to NKr803m from NKr659m. Operating expenses climbed to NKr3.79bn from NKr3.04bn.</p>

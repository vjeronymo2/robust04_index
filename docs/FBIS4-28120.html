			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A former Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) chairman Friday [3 June] denied the commission  made a back-door deal with politicians in 1992 not to file a  criminal complaint against a bid-rigging group in exchange for  their help in revising the Antimonopoly Law.    Former FTC head Setsuo Umezawa told the House of Councillors  Budget Committee that his contacts with then ruling Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) members were necessary for consulting  about the law.    But Umezawa, testifying as a witness, flatly denied any FTC  deals with LDP members, saying, "it is absolutely untrue."    Criticized over the ineffectiveness of the law in stopping  rampant bid-rigging by construction contractors, the FTC had  considered raising penalties against firms breaking the  Antimonopoly Law but met with strong opposition from some LDP  members who had represented the profits of contractors.    In early 1992, the FTC made on-the-spot inspections of  contractors allegedly involved in a bid-rigging case in Saitama  Prefecture, north of Tokyo.    But by the time it was considered unavoidable for the FTC to  file the complaint, the commission announced in May 1992 it  would not file any accusation with prosecutors and only ordered  the 66 companies involved to stop the antimonopoly practice.    Some LDP members are suspected of having pressured the FTC  to  drop the complaint on behalf of the group of 66 companies,  including major contractor Kajima Corp.    The FTC is suspected of then having chosen not to file the  complaint with prosecutors because it wanted the LDP members'  cooperation in revising the Antimonopoly Law according to the  way it had originally planned.    One of the LDP members, former Construction Minister Kishiro  Nakamura, was arrested in March this year and later indicted on  a charge of accepting a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima in  January 1992 in exchange for helping to block the FTC's criminal  allegation.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Observer: Jam on it Talk about making a virtue of a necessity. Hotels around the notorious M25 motorway orbiting London are urging motorists to stay with them while spending seven days creeping round the perimeter, and sight-seeing during the frequent stoppages. Recommended hold-up points for the Pounds 250 holiday include junction 12 with view of Thorpe theme park, junction 3 for Winston Churchill's Chartwell, and junction 33 with prospect of Windsor Castle. One of the 28 hotels involved, the Churchgate Manor at Harlow, is putting extra jam on its offer by providing a free tank of petrol daily, plus survival picnics for those who get gridlocked too often to use it.</p>

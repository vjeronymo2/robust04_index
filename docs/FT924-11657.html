			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / La dolce vita among the ruins: Even in a crisis, Christian Tyler finds Rome is still civilised IT IS SAID that the barbarians were overawed when they descended on Rome for their regular pillages. We, the latter-day Franks, Huns, Norsemen and Celts, are not so much overawed as intimidated by the Eternal City. We come in a spirit of pilgrimage, not pillage, crossing the Alps to be dazzled by the light, liberated by the life and cowed by the monuments of the emperors and popes. Even at this time of the year when lightning flickers behind the seven hills and the city steams in daily downpours we are to be seen swarming through the streets. At the head of each patient flock marches a drover, an umbrella held aloft in place of a shepherd's crook. When two flocks collide and merge there are bleats of alarm from some of the old wethers, afraid of becoming detached and maybe lost for ever. Shoulder to shoulder, nose to tail, the pilgrims plod through the Vatican galleries; they shuffle dutifully past sculptures, tapestries, busts, urns and frescoes until, more dead than alive, they are squeezed through the last narrow doorway into that sublime collecting ring, the Sistine Chapel. Our puritan decency may be shocked by the pagan extravagance of Rome's religious art. But our blood is certainly heated by the sensuality of a Michelangelo or Bernini nude, by the sight of strong marble fingers pressing into soft marble flesh. The sculptor Canova is said to have been so excited by his portrait of the beautiful Pauline Borghese, Napoleon's sister, that he would sniff her marbled armpit to make sure his statue was not alive. We sweat, we suffer; but we have no choice. And the Romans know it. They smile at us with pity as they charmingly disembarrass us of our money. It is no good us saying the Italians have nothing but their past to be proud of. Of course the economy is bankrupt, the government perilously feeble, the politicians corrupt, the bureaucracy a joke and the country beset by scandal. The Roman modus vivendi is enough to drive the punctual, orderly northerner to the verge of insanity. But secretly we are envious. How do they get away with it? In this atmosphere of crisis - and the present crisis, you are daily assured, is the greatest of them all - they should be going about with furrowed brows, grasping at any straw of comfort they can glean from the news bulletins. Instead you see everywhere the same old insouciance. A glass of dry Marsala to wash down the stuffed quail? Why not? A drop of brandy to finish off? Of course. The self-confidence of the Italians is superb. One veteran observer explains it by saying that Italy does not exhaust herself by looking for answers but lives with her problems. It is the trick of believing that so long as the little things of life 'vanno bene' the big issues will take care of themselves. Perhaps that is why Italians have always been among the keenest federalists in Europe. If Brussels wants to take on some of our bigger burdens, then let her do so: it cannot be worse than the government in Rome. If the foreign banks want to do business here, let them: they can only be an improvement on what goes on already. After all, wasn't the original treaty signed in Rome and didn't the word subsidiarity originate in the Vatican itself? One cannot help making the comparison with Britain, a country struggling to remain in the first division of nations and psychologically still crippled by the loss of empire. It is as if Britain's past were a burden to her rather than a cause for self-confidence and pride, as if a great cultural legacy were an excuse for obsessive nostalgia rather than a guarantee of future enjoyment. To live in a museum need not make you whey-faced with worry: on the contrary, what is more comforting than to wake up each day surrounded by the glorious remains of your past? With their exploding debt and collapsing politics the Italians have every reason to be afraid of finding themselves beggars on the fringe of Europe. And maybe, this time, they will. But what matters is that they don't see it like that. Something will turn up. Where we northerners look for big problems and complete solutions, the Romans are content to piece their lives together from day to day, like mosaic. And that is why, like Goethe and Ibsen, Liszt or Mozart, we need to climb the Alps and take a breath of air on the other side. Here in Italy, everyone can have his shout.</p>

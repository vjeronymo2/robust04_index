			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Tarnished Gilts The gilts market really is a sorry sight. According to Salomon Brothers it has been the worst performer of all leading bond markets so far this year with a negative return in local currency terms of 7.18 per cent. Last week the Bank of England again intervened to ensure orderly markets. With long yields nudging 8 per cent it has switched to a floating rate issue for this week's auction. Clearly the UK has been caught up in worldwide bond anxiety since the Federal reserve started raising interest rates last month. But that does not explain why it has suffered more than any other. Part of the answer is that last year's supply problem has finally come home to roost. Heavy borrowing then was easily absorbed by speculative hedge funds and other professional dealers attracted by a particularly favourable combination of an upward sloping yield curve with falling inflation and interest rates. But it is now clear that much of this paper did not find its way into firm hands. Institutions bought only Pounds 13bn worth against issuance of about Pounds 50bn. Yields have to rise to the point where paper now being off-loaded by its original buyers becomes attractive to long-term investors. The institutions have no particular incentive to jump in when they think they can buy the same bonds cheaper tomorrow. Looked at from this perspective, the gilts market is clearly overshooting. Though investors have become less optimistic about inflation, the deterioration does not appear sharp enough to warrant the 20 point fall in the long end of the market since its peak in late January. Once cooler heads prevail and investors do decide that the absolute level of yields is attractive, the rebound could be quite strong, especially since the prospect of further floating rate issues will mitigate supply worries for 1994-95. But that leaves the question of what actually represents value in the gilts market. Against expectations that inflation could fall to around 2 per cent during the summer, a yield of nearly 8 per cent looks attractive. Price rises would be unlikely to stick at these levels, though. Assuming inflation rises to the top of the government's 4 per cent target in the medium term, yields between 7 and 7.5 per cent would not look out of place. The biggest problem is that expectations of where inflation - and interest rates - will finally settle are shifting. Recent US experience is a reminder of what can happen when the stance of monetary policy changes and the UK is considerably further along the cycle than the rest of Europe. In December, the sterling money market was discounting base rates just below 5 per cent by the end of 1994 and 5.6 per cent by the end of 1995. On Friday it was projecting rates of 5.7 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The money market, of course, is often wrong in its predictions. But its recent behaviour is a reminder that, while there may have been a structural downward shift in inflation, the cycle has not been done away with altogether. The gilts market has to contend with the realisation that inflation and interest rates are now at or near their trough. Even if it now rallies, that implies a basic shift in mood.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as triple witching boosts trade Wall Street BLUE-CHIP stocks jumped sharply in heavy trading on US stockmarkets yesterday after the expiration of stock and stock-index futures and options generated huge demand for leading industrial issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 44.04 at 3,313.27, its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 5.84 at 441.27, a new record close. Other indices were less buoyant, with the Amex composite finishing 1.61 higher at 392.03, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.83 at 661.29. Because of the 'triple witching' of futures and options expirations, trading volume on the NYSE totalled 371m shares, the busiest day on the Big Board since the mini-crash of October 16 1989 when volume reached over 400m shares. Rises outnumbered declines by 1,292 to 567. After five consecutive days of decline, Thursday's 14-point gain in the Dow was interpreted by some market observers as the prelude to a Christmas-week and New Year rally. Consequently, the market opened yesterday in a positive mood, with investors keen not to be left out of what some analysts were labelling a significant end-of-year mini-rally. Sentiment was aided by another strong showing from stocks overseas. Wall Street has been worried recently about the slump in European economies, so any sign of confidence from Europe's stock markets is welcomed by US investors. Among individual stocks, Thursday's recovery in IBM proved fleeting, with investors returning to pummel the stock in the wake of the news earlier in the week that its annual dividend may be threatened because of the cost to the company of its radical restructuring plans. IBM fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 , a new 11-year low. Other big computer stocks were mostly firmer. Compaq was particularly strong, rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 5/8 in turnover of 1.6m shares, Hewlett-Packard edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 65 7/8 , and Motorola gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 104 3/4 . Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which fell sharply on Thursday after the company said that it was comfortable with new, lower estimates of its forthcoming earnings, recovered all of its lost ground, jumping Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 103. Van Dorn jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 on the news that the company is to be bought by Crown Cork &amp; Seal for about Dollars 175m, or Dollars 21 a share. Crown Cork &amp; Seal fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 . On the Nasdaq market, Varlen climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2 after the company's principal shareholder dropped a proposed public offering of stock, but agreed to sell a 30 per cent stake in Varlen for Dollars 17 a share. Canada TORONTO share prices rallied late in the session to post a healthy gain yesterday and on the week. Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index was up 16.08 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 3,320.41, with advancing issues topping declines 354 to 283. Volume was 49.077m shares valued at CDollars 464.8m compared with Thursday's 44.712m shares worth CDollars 375.7m. On the week, the index was up about 53 points, or 1.6 per cent.</p>

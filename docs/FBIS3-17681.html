			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindj Abdullayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku March 28 TASS -- In an exclusive interview with  ITAR-TASS, Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov  described the characteristic features of his country's diplomacy  at the present stage as pragmatism and an aspiration to  establish partner- like relations with as many countries as  possible. According to Hasanov, initially they plan to  establish durable contacts with 60 countries. This is one-third  of all the U.N. member states.    The head of the Azeri Foreign Affairs Department attributed  special places in this list to contacts with the United States,  Russia, Great Britain, France and China, the five permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council and arbiters in world  politics. According to Hasan Hasanov, stable working ties have  currently been established with four of the countries, excluding  the U.S., and documents regulating bilateral relations on a  normative-legal basis have been signed.    The minister emphasised that "in relations with Russia, an  end has been put to the policy of mutual reproaches and  accusations". He said to that, thanks to measures adopted by the  republic's new leadership, faults and instability in the  relationship have been removed, old ties are being revived and  new ones, especially trade and economic ones, are being  established.    The second most important feature of the Azeri foreign  policy, according to Hasan Hasanov, is the need to reassess his  country's ties with the two neighbouring states of Turkey and  Iran.    Although membership in the Commonwealth of Independent  States  (CIS) is approved in the republic, as relations with the CIS are  relegated to third place Azerbaijan's foreign policy.    Membership in the CIS, which is considered here as one of  the  most authoritative interstate regional organizations, has helped  the republic restore its ties with traditional economic  partners, and has politically helped it ensure the protection of  the republic's national interests.</p>

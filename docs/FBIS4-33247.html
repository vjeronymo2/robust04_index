			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo spoke before the Senate plenum today. He strongly  defended the government bill on pharmaceutical patents,  emphasizing that its implementation will not provoke a rise in  medicine prices.    Cavallo said the government bill contemplates the  possibility  of importing medicines from other countries if prices go up  "excessively."    Cavallo said the government's eagerness to approve a patents  law "is not due to the possibility of economic sanctions by the  United States, but to the need to encourage investment and  permit our scientific and technological development."    Cavallo participated in the Senate public hearing, before  representatives of all interested committees, to explain the  government position with respect to the controversial patents  law, an initiative that the U.S. Government tenaciously wants  approved.    Cavallo spoke for over two and a half hours. During this  time he answered innumerable questions from legislators and  directors of the different entities interested in the issue of  medicines manufacturing and trading.    The finance minister's visit to the Senate was within the  framework of a round of hearings organized by the Industry  Committee, presided over by Senator Jose Genoud of the Radical  Civic Union. The patents bill, however, is also being analyzed  by the Science and Technology Committee, the Health Committee,  and the Commerce and Penal Affairs Committee.    During the long session Cavallo did not mention the  possibility of submitting a new draft bill replacing the one  currently under discussion in the Senate. The executive branch  sent the bill to Congress in March 1993. Cavallo said that  senators will introduce all the necessary changes into the  original bill.    The economy minister said the protection of intellectual  property rights in general, and particularly the protection of  intellectual rights in the field of pharmaceuticals, is  "essential for investment in research and development."    He made clear he was talking about "large investments,  because efforts to discover new products and find solutions to  health problems demand very large amounts of money and a lot of  knowledge."    Cavallo said that in order to achieve those objectives "you  need to risk capital, and those who risk it want to have certain  guarantees that the product resulting from their investment in  research and development will not lose value because it is easy  to copy."    The minister said he was convinced that "Argentina will be  able to receive risk capital only if intellectual properties are  well protected."    "The reason why the executive branch presented this project  on patents was because it wanted the country to offer the best  possible conditions for strong investment in research and  development," Cavallo said.    The minister said that a country capable of organizing teams  of good scientists and technicians involved in research and  development "can also create the conditions for national capital  to take advantage of the good climate for the application of  human knowledge to invest in research and development in the  country."    Cavallo emphasized that the protection of intellectual  property rights through a patents regime "is part of a policy  that aims at encouraging investments in Argentina, and above all  forms of investment that are very important for the future  growth of the nation."    The minister explained that this was why the Carlos Menem  administration supported the establishment of a minimum level of  protection for intellectual property rights in the GATT talks.    The economy minister said that the idea of approving a  patents law in exchange for the elimination of agricultural  subsidies by developed countries "is a very weak argument,  because anyone with a good understanding of the way the world  economy and national economies function knows that a country  that does not provide protection for intellectual rights will  pay for it in the long run, because it will be forced to remain  on the sidelines of the flow of investments."    "It is not very convincing to threaten to do something that  will end up hurting your country," Cavallo said, in justifying  the scarce benefits developing countries obtained through the  GATT talks.    During the long negotiations, which lasted almost eight  years, the poorest countries argued with little success that  they could protect intellectual property rights only if they  obtained concessions in the agricultural field.    Cavallo said he was convinced developing countries will be  able to remove the industrialized countries' distorting policies  "when each one of our countries has obtained the degree of  economic power capable of transforming us into relevant  negotiators on a world scale."    The minister said: "In order to achieve this objective we  must create the best conditions for investment, but particularly  for investments that yield the greatest return, such as  investments in research and development, well directed and  intelligently administered."    Cavallo reiterated that the eagerness of the executive  branch  to give protection to intellectual rights "is part of a policy  that wants to encourage investment and growth in Argentina."    Referring to the possibility that the bill protecting  intellectual rights could hurt the population by provoking a  rise in medicine prices, Cavallo said: "The argument is  deceitful and has a minimum degree of truth."    "When you speak about satisfying the needs of the people,  you  cannot only think of the act of production in a factory, once  you have finished your research and you have something new.  Because it is more important to have the capacity and the means  to discover something than the ability to take a product to the  market."    "The more we encourage investment, the more we will have the  competitive ability to develop new products, new medicines, and  new solutions to health problems," Cavallo said.    The minister said that the supply of a determined drug or  medicine "in the medium and long term, which is what matters,  depends essentially on the amount of investment by the different  laboratories in finding solutions to unsolved problems."    "Nothing can guarantee you that those who copy a medicine  and  introduce it into the market will be able to sell it cheaper,"  Cavallo said.    He said there are cases of copied medicines that are more  expensive than the original products. Cavallo, however, did not  give details about brands or laboratories.    "It is very important for medicines to have reasonable  prices. There is no reason why we should not encourage  competition through prices, always giving, of course, the best  possible information about the product," Cavallo said.    "I do not believe national or foreign laboratories when they  say that they can supply the market at lower prices. I think  Argentina's and the world's experience is that the  pharmaceutical industry tends to charge the highest possible  prices," the minister said.    He said the solution to the problem of high prices "must be  faced, on one hand, by encouraging investment, so that each  laboratory makes the maximum research effort and generates more  competition; and second, by the implementation of general rules  used by countries to make sure that prices are not excessive."    Cavallo defended the application of the law of competition  in  the case of medicines, recalling that the official project on  pharmaceutical patents includes a clause permitting the  importation of products if there are excessive price increases.    This clause permits the importation of medicines, but from  countries with patent laws that recognize intellectual property  rights.    Cavallo said the executive branch bill recognizes research  efforts, and protects the population by guaranteeing reasonable  prices.    "It is not true that the patents law will provoke price  increases," the minister said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] has said the fall of some 40 Palestinians  injured in Hebron by Israeli occupation troops' gunfire within  view of foreign observers confirms once again that the foreign  presence in its current form does not provide effective  international protection of the Palestinian people.    In a statement issued today, the DFLP says the  implementation  of Resolution 904 was just a deal between the Oslo team and  Israel to expedite the implementation of the self-rule  administration in Gaza and Jericho, at the expense of the  Palestinian people, their interests, and their national rights.  The DFLP urges the international community and peace-loving  forces to work seriously to provide effective international  protection of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories  as a first step on the path to implementing the resolutions of  international legitimacy.    DFLP Secretary General Nayif Hawatimah reiterated his  rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the applications  agreement in Cairo. He considered it a deal of individual  submission that will only lead to more frivolous play and  self-deception. In statements, Hawatimah said these separate  deals were struck behind the back of the Palestinian people and  against their national will. He said preparations are under way  now to hold a broad-based popular conference that will reaffirm  rejection of what is going on and seek to establish the national  terms of reference. He said the agreement will not fall by a  magic blow, but will need struggle and ceaseless work within the  ranks of the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied  homeland. He called for improving the alliance of the  Palestinian forces, as well as all other forces that reject the  agreement.    Hawatimah also reaffirmed the DFLP's refusal to participate  in any way in the self-rule authority because the question, he  said, has never been that of quotas, but a national issue in the  first place.</p>

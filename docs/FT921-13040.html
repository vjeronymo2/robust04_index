			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Cohse plans database for local NHS bargaining COHSE, the health service union, said yesterday it was going to give its branches access to a comprehensive pay database to help them deal with local bargaining in the National Health Service. NHS bargaining has traditionally been highly centralised but, with the growth of self-governing trusts, unions are resigned to a fragmentation of bargaining. Few trusts have so far broken away from NHS pay rates and industrial relations structures. The best-known exceptions are Northumbria Ambulance Service and Guy's Hospital, in London. One health union official said yesterday: 'If the Tories win the election most of the trust personnel directors will dust off their plans for radical changes.' Trusts, especially in south-east England, are expected in many cases to want to pay above existing NHS rates and increase differentials in order to attract staff. In some areas, however, they are expected to seek to cut pay. A trust in Dorset recently tried to employ a radiographer on less favourable terms and conditions than current NHS rates, but the unions ensured that nobody applied for the job. Nupe, the public-service union, said it had won six race-discrimination cases in the past month.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAN truck unit in red but sees profit ahead MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German truck maker, suffered a pre-tax loss of DM80m (Dollars 53.44m) in the year to the end of June, but the company forecast yesterday that it would return to profit in the current year. Its profitability has declined during the past three years, with last year's loss following pre-tax profits of DM61m in 1992-93 and DM506m in 1991-92. The group, the second largest German truck maker after Mercedes-Benz, has been hit by recession in the European truck market. It fell to a net loss in 1993-94 of DM97m from net profits of DM32m a year earlier. However, the company has restructured and Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chief executive, said yesterday that the group had been operating profitably in recent months. Mr Rupprecht said that truck prices had dropped dramatically last year, cutting earnings by DM300m, while the drop in sales volumes cut profits by a further DM200m. MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering group, had reduced its overhead costs by DM100m last year, said Mr Rupprecht. Production fell by 10 per cent to 32,500 - it has fallen by 22 per cent from 41,600 in 1991-92 - while group turnover fell by 5 per cent to DM6.9n. MAN truck sales in west Europe declined by 15 per cent last year to 26,600 from 31,200 a year earlier reducing the group's market share from 14.8 to 13.8 per cent. MAN is planning to re-establish the production of trucks and buses in Turkey following the failure of an earlier venture. It is investing DM20m to acquire a 33 per cent equity stake and take management control of Manas, a company in which Isbank, the Turkish bank is the majority shareholder.</p>

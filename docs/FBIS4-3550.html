In an interview with the Russian daily "SEVODNYA" (TODAY)  issued on Thursday, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that "I  do not completely agree to Vitaliy Churkin," Yeltsin's special  envoy in former Yugoslavia, who reportedly accused the Bosnian  Serbs earlier this week of "duplicity" and of "abusing" Russian  goodwill.    Grachev stressed that the Bosnian Serbs had not launched any  attacks on the Moslem-held town of Gorazde in the past "two  days."    He described it as "tactless" simply to charge them with  violating ceasefire and launching attacks.    The defense minister held both the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims  responsible for the latest outburst of fighting and said air  strikes were not the way to end the conflict.    Regarding air strikes as highly dangerous, Grachev said  60,000 to 70,000 UN troops would have to be sent to  Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the conflict by force, an option he  said was out of the question since it would spark a large-scale  war.    According to the local press, both the Bosnian Serbs and  Moslems forces renewed fighting in Gorazde on Wednesday only  hours after the Serbs signed a truce with the UN to end their  assault.    After meeting with international mediators David Owen and  Thovald Stoltenberg in Moscow on Wednesday evening, Foreign  Minister Kozyrev told reporters that "Serbian attacks on civil  cities, hospitals, Red Cross cites and UN observers in Gorazde  cannot be justified."    "They (Bosnian Serbs) violate the interests of Serbs  themselves and Russia alike," the Russian foreign minister  stated.    He also stressed that Bosnian Serbs should understand that  each step toward all-round halting of warfare will entail  appropriate decisions on lifting sanctions.    Both his and Churkin's remarks were seen as that Moscow had  finally lost patience with the Bosnian Serbs, its traditional  allies in the Balkans, over their continued attacks on Gorazde.    However, Kozyrev stressed, Russia cannot agree with mounting  air strikes by NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization)  forces, since this may only escalate tension in the region.    Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the Coordination  Committee of the International Conference on Yugoslavia, arrived  in Moscow on Wednesday for talks on Bosnian settlement.    At a meeting of Russia's Security Council Wednesday, Yeltsin  pointed out that force would not solve the conflict, noting:  "Use of military force -- moreover delivering such strong air  strikes -- without coordination in the UN Security Council is  impermissible."</p>

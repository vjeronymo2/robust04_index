			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for ERM re-entry Sir, The paper published by the No Turning Back Group ('Radical Tories urge benefits overhaul', February 3) contains many interesting ideas for the future of the European Union. The attitude taken towards the possibility of re-entry into the exchange rate mechanism in the future, however, does seem to take more account of the problems of the past than those which might arise in the future. With the bands set as widely as they are today, the scope for damaging realignment speculation is minimised, while a degree of linkage is maintained. Even narrowing the bands would be possible in the future, although the perils of over-rigidity should be borne in mind. The key weakness of the system in recent years has been the reunification of Germany, which has injected a shock which must be seen as one unlikely to be repeated. In some years, when Europe has genuinely begun to act as a unit, when this shock drops out of the system and the economies of the member states are much more closely aligned, it is possible that a much tighter system of co-operation could be appropriate. To rule this out would be foolish, for the argument against such a scheme is strongest when based on economic fundamentals. This scenario is certainly unlikely to occur in the near future, but there is always the possibility that at some point a cross-border monetary policy will become beneficial.

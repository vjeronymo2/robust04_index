			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Ryabov: "Universal Soldier Without a </F> Military Uniform"]    [Text] Yuriy Baturin, the president's new national  security adviser, remains an unknown personality even to the  head of state.    The president has formed a new structure in the Kremlin. On  6  January Boris Yeltsin signed an edict appointing the 44-year-old  lawyer Yuriy Baturin to the office of the president's national  security adviser. The pre-New Year reform of the former KGB was  continued on Christmas Eve.    The new Kremlin institution has an obvious counterpart in  the  office of the American President. In the United States the  security adviser not only coordinates the activity of the power  departments and intelligence. His role is far more important. It  is sufficient to recall the influence of Zbigniew Brzezinski  under Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger under Richard Nixon on  the foreign policy of the White House administration.    Considering also that Russia is today a state with  predominant presidential power, it may be assumed that the  president's new adviser could have considerable influence in the  affairs of state.  <H5>  For What Merits? </H5>   Yuriy Baturin is, evidently, destined to play the part of  chief strategist in the president's team on matters of national  security. What merits and qualities should such a person  possess? What is the nature of his interaction with the  president and the president's circle?    Bill Clinton's assistant for national security, Anthony  Lake,  has several features in common with Yuriy Baturin.    Lake is a college lecturer, teaching a course in  international relations. Yuriy Baturin has also been involved in  lecturing activity in the Moscow State University Journalism  Faculty.    Both are distinguished by plain dealing. True, the  experienced Lake has had more opportunities to demonstrate it.  Back in 1970 he tendered his resignation as assistant to U.S.  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in protest against the war in  Vietnam. Baturin displayed a certain refractoriness in  criticizing the president's actions at the time of the  dissolution of the Supreme Soviet last fall.    According to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Lake "can alter his  position  on any issue if he believes that this is what the situation  requires." The adviser to the Russian president also amended his  words when Boris Yeltsin's decisiveness fell into the category  of strict but necessary measures.    Both advisers say very little about their foreign policy  views, preferring silent but eloquent action.    The differences in the position of Lake and Baturin in the  presidential teams are more appreciable than the similarities.    Anthony Lake has known Bill Clinton for 24 years now. Yuriy  Baturin became a member of the Presidential Council less than a  year ago, on 17 March 1993. In addition, as distinct from  Anthony Lake's well-oiled relations with the American  President's entire team and the power ministers, Yuriy Baturin  is closely acquainted with practically no one. He met Nikolay  Golushko only last August. He met Sergey Stepashin, first deputy  director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, only a few  days ago at a news conference. He knows no one from Pavel  Grachev's ministry. He has met with Viktor Yerin only a few  times. Yuriy Baturin's closest acquaintance is Yevgeniy  Primakov. They got to know one another at the end of the 1980's.    So who is he--this mysterious national security adviser?  <H5>  He Did Not Sleep at Night </H5>   Having graduated from a Moscow school, in 1967 Yuriy Baturin  entered what was at that time the strongest technical higher  educational institution--the Moscow Physico-Technical Institute.  But even during his schooling he thought of working not only in  the exact sciences but in current affairs activity also.  Journalism was his dream.    He retains the habit of resolving all problems by the  inveterate "grease-monkey" method--studying the range of  questions, identifying the essence, finding an effective  solution. Such a method helps him confront all difficulties.    Another habit has been retained also--sleeping little and  working a lot. As his former classmates tell it, even against  the background of the customary industriousness of many of the  "phys-tech" students Baturin was distinguished by an incredible  capacity for work.    Aside from his main classes, he studied philosophy,  political  science, and literature. He wrote his first article on  international relations in the institute. Having as a student  chosen for himself the hobby of study of foreign languages,  today he knows English, Japanese, French, Swedish,  Serbo-Croatian, and German.    It is said that there were evenings when Yuriy Baturin, as a  listener, could not hold out and fell asleep from overtiredness.  But when the power of narrator switched to him, he was  transformed and forgot about his tiredness.    Graduating from the "phys-tech" in 1973, Yuriy Baturin went  to work at the Space Research Institute. Having spent seven  years there, he abruptly, at first sight, changed the nature of  his activity, switching to the Institute of State and Law.    At the start of the 1980's Baturin acquired a further two  educations--at the All-Union Legal Institute and at the Moscow  State University Journalism Faculty.    For some period Yuriy Baturin acknowledged that he had  acquired a "second wind" in the field of current affairs  writing. He forced himself to discourse lightly on the most  diverse topics. As of a particular moment it was all the same to  him what subject he took--the law, politics, or computer  crime.... He was published in our journal also.    Many of his works are distinguished by a saturation with  ironical passages. And his political articles were sometimes  nontraditional also. In one highly serious digest, for example,  he published an article entitled "The Songs of Vladimir  Vysotskiy as Poetical-Political Journalism."    It was thanks to the original work "Law and Policy in the  Computer Sphere," incidentally, that Yuriy Baturin was invited  to the American Prospective Russian Research Institute [as  published] in Washington in 1990 in order that he might take  part in devising support backing for computer security in U.S.  legislation.  <H5>  Translator of Pamphlets </H5>   Nor did Candidate of Legal Sciences Yuriy Baturin escape the  notice of Soviet legislators.    In 1989 he devised in conjunction with two authorities, one  of whom was Mikhail Fedotov, former minister of press and  information, the first originating draft constitutional law in  Soviet legislation. This was the News Media Act. The coauthors  offered the public the act before the USSR Supreme Soviet made  public its draft.    In 1991 Yuriy Baturin began work on the staff of Georgiy  Shakhnazarov, the former editor of his scientific articles, who  at that time was an assistant to Mikhail Gorbachev. Baturin was  one of those who prepared the well-known Union Treaty.    After the 1991 putsch and the departure of the president of  the USSR and his team from the political arena which followed  this, Yuriy Baturin retired into the background, although  continuing to work at the Gorbachev Foundation.    The year following the putsch Yuriy Baturin became a doctor  of legal sciences. He devoted much time, as before, to current  affairs writing, frequently locking himself in his book-strewn  two-room apartment on Leninskiy prospekt. He published a  translation of a pamphlet by Lewis Carroll. In order to remain  in the public view Yuriy Baturin accepted an offer of the  producers of the television program "Itogi" that he be its chief  political consultant.    Last March Yuriy Baturin switched to a position on the  Presidential Council.  <H5>  Analytical Center in Place of a Network of Spies </H5>   It is hard to say on whose recommendation, it was surely  someone's, but Boris Yeltsin noticed Yuriy Baturin. Last March  and somewhat later, when, on 2 June, Baturin became the  president's assistant for legal matters, and on 6 January of  this year. It can be seen, in any event, that the protection has  been of a purely professional nature.    It is also important that the position of specialist  connected with the work of the security authorities and army  structures has for the first time been offered to a person who  has studied warfare only in an institute department.    Who, for all that, was that adviser from the "small group,"  as Baturin himself said?    The "small group" could have included Yuriy Skokov, leader  of  the Security Council, and Gennadiy Burbulis, who, probably,  knows Yuriy Baturin from the times of the work on the Union  Treaty. It could have been Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,  whose favorite, Mikhail Fedotov, knows Baturin's merits well  enough.    What remains of most importance in the appointment of the  new  adviser is, undoubtedly, not "who proposed him" but "what he  will do."    In the immediate future he will, obviously, devise the  concept of the work of the new structure. This will, possibly,  be a massive analytical office designed to coordinate the  activity of the power ministries.    The center of gravity of the control of the state security  authorities will in this case be in the president's camp instead  of the Ministry of Security. Especially since certain functions  of the security authority are already being performed by the  Office of Protection of the President.    And, obviously, the strategic function, not the function of  all-powerful "state within a state" for all of life's  contingencies, will be predominant with the new office.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc producers conspire in their own downfall - An opportunity for a return to profitability has been missed Some years ago the chief executive of a major European metals group delivered a speech on the future of the European zinc industry. To make his point he compared the decision makers in the industry with the heroes of ancient Greek plays - who acted in ways that inevitably led to their destruction. In the end that chief executive proved a perfect example of his own analogy. There is no predetermination, however, that the European zinc industry shall always be a loss-maker. Its failures have been caused by wrong decisions - repeated over and over again. The present situation has been exacerbated, of course, both by the unforeseeable rise in metal supplies from the former eastern bloc countries and by the adverse business cycle. But it is not the first time that the European zinc industry has found itself in turmoil; low profitability has been its main feature for decades. Zinc production is characterised by high fixed costs, stemming from high capital intensity and the structure of power supply contracts, which sacrifice intake flexibility for low power tariffs. The European zinc producers, who are at a comparative cost-disadvantage, have always seen only one way to stay competitive - spreading fixed costs by expanding capacity. What makes sense for an individual producer does not, however, work in the interest the whole industry. It inevitably results in oversupply. No wonder that western Europe, a high-cost region, is punished by the lowest zinc prices. Several attempts have been made to remedy the situation by concerted action of producers and the European Commission. The last attempt to negotiate a 'shut-down agreement' failed some months ago. It was aimed at facilitating the closure of unprofitable capacity by raising money from the whole industry in order to get a balanced European zinc market. The high cost of closing a plant in Europe is the main barrier to withdrawing from the market place. This exit barrier would have been lowered by the financial scheme of the shut down agreement. It failed mainly because the financial weakness of some of the participants encouraged others to believe that plants would be shut in any case, without the need for an injection of their money. They hoped, in other words, that market forces would solve the problem for them. But market forces have not worked in the European zinc industry for more than 20 years. Why should they work now? Cash-strapped companies are in no position to bear the high expenses of plant closures. In the short run at least, it costs less to keep even an unprofitable operation open. The withdrawal of the stronger market players from the shut-down agreement has backfired, as market developments prove. Experience in the aluminium sector shows that an agreement to cut capacities can easily boost prices by Dollars 200 a tonne. On top of that the zinc smelters would have been able to negotiate higher treatment charges, which dropped by around Dollars 40 per tonne of concentrate from 1993 to 1994. In addition removing oversupply from the European market would put the European producers into a position to earn premiums over metal from their competitors in other areas of the world. It is not expecting too much, moreover, to presume that others, especially the Japanese producers, would follow the European lead in closing down production. The damage to the income of the zinc industry as a consequence of the failure of the shut-down agreement adds up to enormous numbers. A loss of revenue of Dollars 100 a tonne for the smelters may be a conservative estimate - it could well be double that amount. Taking Dollars 150 a tonne as a basis for calculation it amounts to a Dollars 15m annual loss for a 100,000-tonnes-a-year operation. Calculating the net present value for 5 years, which is not unreasonable as a shut down has a lasting effect, the result would be Dollars 57m assuming a 10 per cent discount rate. In fact the European zinc smelters could only dream of a 10 per cent profit rate over a five-year period. Therefore a discount rate of zero seems more appropriate. For the 2m-tonnes-a-year zinc industry in western Europe the loss from not acting in a sensible manner amounts to between Dollars 1.14bn and Dollars 1.5bn - an amount from which compensation for the cost of closures could easily have been provided. Thomas Baak, now a consultant, is a former chief economist of Metallgesellschaft, the German metals group.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Baker condemns Israel over settlements A FRUSTRATED US secretary of state, Mr James Baker, yesterday sharply criticised Israel over new settlements in the occupied territories amid signs that his peace shuttle may be faltering. Speaking to reporters in Damascus after marathon talks with President Hafez al-Assad, Mr Baker said he was 'very disappointed to learn .. that there is yet another new settlement established in the (Israeli) occupied territories'. 'That points up vividly that it is easier to obstruct peace than to promote it,' he added, in a departure from his previous muted approach to the vexed settlement issue during his current Middle East tour - his third in six weeks. Mr Baker, who arrived in the Soviet Union last night for a meeting with his Soviet counterpart, spent nine and a half hours with Mr Assad on Tuesday in talks that reportedly bogged down on UN involvement in a proposed regional peace conference. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syria's foreign minister, who was sitting beside Mr Baker at yesterday's press conference, said 'the Syrian position vis-a-vis this point is very clear. The UN should play an important role in this conference.' Damascus also wants the conference to have European Community involvement and to be given the authority to oversee the implementation of decisions reached. As Mr Baker prepared for today's meeting with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister, in a Caucasus resort, it was clear that his peace shuttle was in trouble. In his efforts to coax all parties to the dispute to accept the need to begin talking, he is battling decades of suspicion and prejudice. He is also obliged to deal with an Israel deeply divided on the international community's central demand - that agreement be based on exchanging 'land for peace' in the occupied territories.</p>

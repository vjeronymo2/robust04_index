			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (11): A new image for tourism - Privatisation may spur more upmarket visitors BULGARIA'S privatisation agency has just been presented with a plan to upgrade the country's tourist industry through privatisation and foreign investment. 'We are targeting some 500 potential western investors, and over 50 of them are already showing interest in the privatisation of our tourism industry,' says Mr Yaroslav Karaboikov, senior expert at the privatisation agency's tourism division. The plan calls for the privatisation of 30 companies, including Black Sea resorts, hotels, tour operators and other travel-related firms, by the end of the year. Committee of Tourism officials say that most of the currently existing 150 state companies in the sector should be privatised by 1998. The hope is that privatisation will help Bulgaria's tourist industry improve its quality of service and target more upmarket visitors. Under communism, the country was forced into the lower end of the mass tourism market: cheap package holidays in block-like hotels along the sandy Black Sea coast. Most of the 2m tourists a year came from the former eastern bloc countries. In 1989, tourists from eastern Europe accounted for 63 per cent of all holiday makers in Bulgaria. Last year their numbers dropped to 18 per cent. They have been partially replaced by an influx of western tourists, a trend which should encourage foreign investment. A list of potential western buyers is appended to a programme developed by a team of international consultants Arthur Andersen. Last July the consultants won an EC Phare programme tender to advise the government on privatisation. They used as a starting point a study of Bulgaria's tourism sector funded by the British Know How Fund and completed by the UK group Horwath Consulting last August. According to Horwath, the future of Bulgarian tourism lies in the development of specialised package tours, catering for those interested in history, religion, arts, archit - ecture, rural tourism and hunting. The country has much more to offer than cheap summer seaside or winter skiing packages. It boasts a wealth of Thracian, Roman and Byzantine remains, monasteries and mosques as well as extensive woodlands and mountains. The report also recommended developing religious heritage trails, converting former monasteries to hotels, and restoring a royal train. It identified other opportunities in conference travel, spa treatment and ecological tourism. Casinos, roadside tourism and holiday villages emerged as other attractive targets. Horwath emphasised the need for speedy privatisation. Though some 3,000 of the country's 3,150 tourism-related companies are private, they account for only 10 per cent of the total turnover. Obstacles to foreign investment include unclear ownership due to the restitution of property to its former owners, and ambiguous legislation. The Committee of Tourism is expected to submit a Tourism Bill to the government later this month. Arthur Andersen's privatisation strategy mainly targets big western investors. But the Committee of Tourism and the Privatisation Agency have also considered proposals put forward by Bulgarian consultants such as Intertourist-consult, Deni and Triada Consulting. Meanwhile Balkan Holidays and Balkantourist, the country's main tour operators, report steady demand from Germany, Britain, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries. Bulgaria's tranquil Black Sea coast offers an alternative to Croatian coast resorts that have been closed because of the fighting in former Yugoslavia. 'We had a successful winter season, and most of the summer vacations that we offer have also been booked,' says Mr Ognian Avgarski, president of Balkan Holidays International. 'This year we expect to bring over 150,000 western tourists through our companies in 17 countries.' Balkan Holidays is also working on a privatisation plan, but is taking a cautious approach. Mr Avgarski believes a management buyout might be a better option than allowing western tour operators to obtain a majority stake.</p>

They did not make any press statements but an Iranian  diplomatic source told IRNA after the 45-minute meeting that the  talks "went very well."    "They discussed bilateral relations and the situation in the  Balkans and the Middle East."    Meanwhile, Balkan Greece and the Islamic Republic of Iran  are  to exert joint efforts to end the bloodshed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina (B-H).    "I will soon contact Bosnian President Mr. (Alija)  Izetbegovic, with whom we have close ties, to discuss the  European Union's (EU) peace proposal, but peace should be just  and honorable," Velayati made it clear to reporters after talks  with his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias.    The Greek minister said he briefed Velayati on the efforts  of  the EU to find peace in B-H, and added that Greece as the  current president of the EU, will exert efforts for peace in B-H.    Velayati and Papoulias held 60-minutes of talks on a wide  range of issues before being joined by the delegations of the  two countries.    Papoulias said they discussed issues of common interest, the  Balkans and the situation in former Yugoslavia, and Velayati  briefed him on the problems in the Persian Gulf region.    "We held very significant talks and we reached good results  in all sectors," the Greek foreign minister stressed.    He said Velayati will send a special envoy to Athens to meet  with Greek economy undersecretary to discuss ways to boost  bilateral commercial and economic ties.    Velayati described the talks as "very friendly," and said he  had extended an invitation to his Greek counterpart to visit  Tehran. A Greek diplomatic source told IRNA Papoulias is  expected to visit the Islamic Republic in March.    Earlier, speaking to IRNA, Papoulias said Athens will help  in  promoting EU-Iran dialogue and in bringing Tehran closer to the  12-member European bloc. Greece assumed the rotating six-month  EU presidency on January 1.    When asked about his recent talks in Washington, Papoulias  declined to disclose the contents of his discussions with senior  American officials.    Velayati arrived in Athens Thursday night for a 24-hour  working visit, accompanied by Hoseyn Nuqrekar Shirazi, deputy  commerce minister, 'Ali Ahani, the director of West European  affairs at Iran's Foreign Ministry, Ibrahim Rahimpour, director  of East European affairs, and other Foreign Ministry officials.    Greece was the third leg of Velayati's Balkan tour. He  visited Bulgaria and Romania and will fly to Turkey Friday  afternoon.    The Iranian foreign minister will meet the leader of the  Political Spring Party Antonis Samaras before leaving Athens.    Samaras visited Tehran in 1991 when he was the foreign  minister under the conservative new democracy government.    An Iranian diplomatic source told IRNA that Velayati's visit  to Bulgaria and Romania was of outmost important. "We have an  annual trade exchange of around dlrs 1 billion with Bulgaria and  Romania together, 70 percent of which is Iran's oil exports,"  the diplomat told IRNA requesting anonymity.    He said Tehran has welcomed the new atmosphere in East  Europe, "the atmosphere of freedom, democracy and parliament."    Iran was thinking of opening an embassy in the only European  Muslim-majority state of Albania, he added.</p>

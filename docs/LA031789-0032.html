			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE REKINDLES CCAA HOPES WITH 7-6 WIN  </P> <P> Having lost five of its past six California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games,  the Cal State Northridge baseball team resorted to voodoo before practice  earlier this week.  </P> <P> In an effort to get the proverbial monkey off their collective back, the  Matador players burned a stuffed toy monkey, then buried the ashes behind home  plate at Matador Field.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Northridge hitters ignited for 15 hits and pitcher Robert  Wheatcroft doused a ninth-inning rally by UC Riverside to preserve a 7-6  victory in a CCAA game at the Riverside Sports Complex.  </P> <P> "We've had some weird things happen the last few games," said Northridge Coach  Bill Kernen, whose team fell from fifth to 16th in the NCAA Division II  rankings this week. "Some pretty strange things, not just bad luck.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's a psychological thing. Who knows what happens. But we came out  today and had a lot breaks."  </P> <P> With the victory, Northridge improved to 12-6 overall, 4-6 in conference play.  Riverside dropped to 8-15, 4-6.  </P> <P> Wheatcroft (6-1), a senior right-hander, scattered 11 hits and struck out three  in pitching his fourth complete game. Craig Clayton was four for five and  scored two runs for Northridge while Greg Shockey and Randy Thompson each had  three hits.  </P> <P> Northridge led, 7-5, in the seventh inning when Scott Einhorn hit a solo home  run for Riverside to pull the Highlanders within a run.  </P> <P> Wheatcroft walked John Holmes then surrendered a single to Scott Einhorn to  open the Riverside ninth. But Holmes was cut down at third on a sacrifice  attempt by Jim Radler.  </P> <P> Wheatcroft then walked Jeff Goodale to load the bases before Logan Ostrander  popped out to third and Mike Eatinger lined out to left.  </P> <P> Northridge will play host to Riverside at 2:30 this afternoon and conclude the  series with the Highlanders on Saturday night at 7:30 at Riverside.

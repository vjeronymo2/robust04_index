			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (4): Equity is in short supply - Structural problems bedevil the market 'AUSTRIA - a time to be buying,' cried the headline of a bullish study on the Austrian stock market published at the end of August by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Coming after two years of sharp declines in volumes and prices, this was something that market participants wanted to hear. The report flashed through Vienna's depressed financial community at facsimile machine speed. More important, the leaders of the financial community have finally got together to address the not inconsiderable structural problems that bedevil the market. Now that Vienna has a chance of becoming a serious regional financial centre in a rejuvenated central Europe, there is a greater sense of urgency about addressing these problems. A few days ago a high powered committee chaired by the finance minister met for the first time with a mandate to put things right. The main problem is an inadequate supply of equity. Trading volume in the 10 leading shares in the first half of 1992 amounted to only ASch47.1bn. The market is open for only three hours a day and only 18 shares are continuously quoted. Supply is hindered by the fact that many of the largest companies in Austria are state owned. The borse would like to see the process of privatisation, which has seen half a dozen companies come to market in recent years, speeded up. The government is also looking seriously at a change in the tax system that would encourage owners of companies to come to the market. At the moment, wealth tax is a deterrent to them, because it is paid on market value of quoted companies but only an assessed value on private companies. This change is on the agenda for the next important tax overhaul, scheduled for the end of next year. There are also problems on the demand side. General insurance companies are allowed to invest only 5 per cent of their liability funds in equities. And, because the government provides very generous pensions to all citizens, there are very few private pension funds in the country. Individuals have little experience of investing in equities, prefering to stuff their savings into anonymous savings accounts which are taxed at only 10 per cent. The government intends to raise the tax to about 20 per cent next year, which could make equities look more attractive. The borse has become infamous lately for insider scandals. Within the past year there have been two cases of substantial trades taking place in advance of a company announcing a serious deterioration of its profits. At the moment, insider trading is not a criminal offence. The borse has no effective means of enforcing its regulations on members. The government intends to amend the borse law later this year to make insider trading a criminal offence, but both bankers and government officials are sceptical about eliminating insider action so long as the number of participants in the market is so small.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, Egypt, May 22 (AFP) -- The outlawed militant  Islamic group the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has urged young people  to join the holy war to topple President Husni Mubarak's secular  government.    The appeal for jihad, or holy war, was made in a statement  distributed after prayers marking Saturday's [21 May] feast of  'Id al-Adha in the southern Egyptian provinces of Bani Suwayf,  al-Minya and Asyut. A high police presence in Asyut meant the  statement was not as widely distributed.    "You young people of Islam, what are you waiting for to join  the march of the jihad, which will never cease," the leaflet  asked. "The blood (of Islamists) is still flowing in prisons,"  it added referring to the death of the "martyr" 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani, an Islamic defence lawyer who died in police custody.    Initial autopsy reports said he had died from being  tortured,  but a later statement from the Interior Ministry said he had  suffered an asthma attack.    The al-Jama'ah has waged a two-year campaign to overthrow  the  government in which nearly 400 people have been killed.    The al-Jama'ah also denounced the Israel-PLO autonomy accord  which launched Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West  Bank town of Jericho. In another statement it said the accord  signed on May 4 in Cairo aimed to "wipe out the Islamic movement  and give up the Al-Aqsa Mosque" in Jerusalem, one of the holiest  sites in Islam.    The Muslim Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious  organisation, also denounced the self-rule deal accusing PLO  leader Yasir 'Arafat of giving in while praising the radical  Hamas movement, saying "as long as people fight back, there is  hope."</p>

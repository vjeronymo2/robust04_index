			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER QUARTERFINALS;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY DOWNS MATER DEI ON HAMPTON'S GOAL IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> Andy Silva was especially relieved to get through his team's Southern Section  4-A Division quarterfinal match Friday against Mater Dei High.  </P> <P> After all, Simi Valley was stumped in the quarterfinals last season by  Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Friday, the Pioneers kept their coach in suspense through a scoreless  regulation period and until Craig Hampton scored with nine minutes left in the  second overtime -- 91 minutes into the match -- to give Simi Valley a 1-0  home-field victory.  </P> <P> "I just feel that the quarterfinal matches are the toughest to get through . .  . for me," Silva said.  </P> <P> A shot by Kenny Greninger rebounded off a Monarch defender and back to Hampton,  who pumped it in for the deciding goal.  </P> <P> The Pioneers (27-1-0) outshot Mater Dei, 16-6.  </P> <P> Simi Valley will play Don Lugo on Tuesday in a semifinal at a site to be  determined.  </P> <P> SMALL SCHOOLS  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist 1, Cerritos Valley Christian 0 -- Ron Simpson scored on a penalty  kick seven minutes into the second half and goalkeeper Jeff Hampsten recorded  his 10th shutout to spark the Knights at home.  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist (20-2-2) was awarded a penalty kick when Valley Christian  goalkeeper Chris Miller tackled forward Dan Stepper in the penalty area in an  effort to stop a free kick by Kurt Rayners.  </P> <P> In the semifinal round Tuesday, top-ranked L. A. Baptist will meet No. 3  Harvard. The teams tied, 0-0, in a nonleague match Dec. 16.  </P> <P> Harvard 5, Fillmore 0 -- Midfielder Andrew Weiss scored two goals, one  unassisted, and Jerome Schwartz had two assists to pace the Saracens (18-3-4)  at Harvard. Schwartz, striker Mark Fein and midfielder Dar Rejayan also scored  for Harvard.  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 1, Simi Valley 0 -- Sophomore midfielder Jill Florey scored off a  head pass from Kelly Hampton with five minutes left to lift No. 8 Mission Viejo  (19-3-3) over the top-ranked Pioneers in a 4-A match in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Simi Valley defender Liz Albin dislocated her hip late in the second half and  was treated at Mission Regional Medical Center. Goalkeeper Kim Duran, who has  43 career shutouts, made eight stops for Simi Valley (26-2), the Marmonte  League champion.  </P> <P> Redlands 1, Agoura 0 -- The Chargers' season ended as visiting Redlands  (15-4-6) scored what Agoura Coach Don Hagenburger termed a "fluke goal" in a  3-A match.  </P> <P> Agoura (23-2-2), which had won four consecutive division titles, outshot  Redlands, 25-3.  </P></p>

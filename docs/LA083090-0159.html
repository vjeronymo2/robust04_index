			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS SUE TWO RESIDENTS OVER FLYER;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: MEMBERS OF ZAFERIA NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP ARE ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO  DEFAME TWO FIRMS. DEFENDANTS' ATTORNEY CALLS THE ACTION A BID TO 'SHUT  GRASS-ROOTS CRITICS UP.'  </P> <P> Sharon Douglass has lived here off and on all of her life. Michael Horrigan  raised his family here. So when developers set out to put a high-rise  condominium building in their neighborhood of quaint old houses, they  circulated petitions, passed out flyers and called their neighbors to the  fight.  </P> <P> Their actions did not seem unusual in a town of about 50 neighborhoods, many of  them fighting to preserve their integrity.  </P> <P> But the response from two Huntington Beach development companies that want to  build the high-rise in the Zaferia neighborhood -- east and west of Redondo  Avenue, off Pacific Coast Highway and south of the traffic circle -- is said to  be unprecedented here: They have sued Douglass, 40, who is on a fixed income,  and Horrigan -- a 54-year-old grandfather of four -- for more than $1 million.  </P> <P> The suit, filed last month in Long Beach Superior Court, alleges that Douglass  and Horrigan engaged in a conspiracy to defame the G.M. Peters Development Co.  and H&amp;P Development, which want to build the 63-condo complex with 13,000  square feet of commercial space at 2600 Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> A Long Beach attorney defending Douglass and Horrigan said his clients were  "SLAPPed" -- hit with what has come to be known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against  Public Participation, a recent corporate invention to "shut grass-roots critics  up."  </P> <P> "These people are being sued for the crimes of speaking up at City Council and  Planning Commission meetings and talking to their neighbors," attorney Marc  Allen Coleman said. "This lawsuit is an attempt to stop residents from voicing  their concerns in violation of their First Amendment rights. It is ludicrous."  </P> <P> Attorney Stephen R. Kilstofte, who represents the developers, declined to  discuss the lawsuit without the permission of his clients. The developers could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> But in the lawsuit, the developers allege that the residents made "false and  fraudulent" statements, such as the question posed in a homemade flyer full of  misspellings and typos that asks: "Do you want 5 to 7 story condo's next to  single-family residents and over crodinbg (sic) of our neighborhoods?"  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the flyer "misrepresents the actual size" of the  project, which is four stories.  </P> <P> Also, a petition signed by 20 Zaferia neighbors says the proposed condominium  would make street parking "totally intolerable"; that lights from the structure  would be "like living in a parking lot," and that the development would surely  lead to an increase of "vice and drugs."  </P> <P> Such arguments prompted the City Council to freeze permits for the structure,  which had been approved by city planners April 5, and send the project back to  the Planning Commission for study. A new hearing is pending.  </P> <P> The developers contend that the delay is costing them money and that the  residents are guilty of "intentional interference with prospective economic  advantage." They are seeking $1 million in compensatory damages, plus  unspecified punitive damages.  </P> <P> Even if they win the lawsuit, Horrigan and Douglass said, the court battle  alone could wipe them out.  </P> <P> Douglass, a former postal clerk, said she is disabled with severe allergies and  lives on a fixed income. Horrigan is a construction manager whose proudest  financial achievement is that he has almost paid off his Molino Avenue home.  Both are new to the theater of community activism, having given their Zaferia  Neighborhood Assn. a name just a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Coleman has reduced his fee and delayed billing. Still, neither resident can  afford so much as the $2,500 retainer fee required to begin the legal defense,  they said.  </P> <P> "When I first saw the lawsuit I was mad as hell," Horrigan said. "But then I  was a little scared. People start running around saying a million this, a  million that. At my age, I am not in a position to lose my house."  </P> <P> They plan to go to neighborhood groups throughout Long Beach to ask for  financial help, contending that a successful SLAPP could chill the rights of  anyone who signs a petition or speaks out at a Planning Commission meeting.  </P> <P> "An injury to one is an injury to all," attorney Coleman said.  </P> <P> So common have SLAPP suits become elsewhere that legislation aiming to curb  them recently won state Senate approval.  </P> <P> They are typically filed by developers and others who stand to suffer financial  losses when citizens protest their projects. The mere filing of such a suit can  hush a vocal resident.  </P> <P> Horrigan, for example, said he has spoken out just once since the suit was  filed. Upon advice of their attorney, he and Douglass have resolved to keep  fighting, however.  </P> <P> "We are just ordinary neighbors trying to improve our neighborhood," Douglass  said. "I don't think we've done anything wrong."  </P></p>

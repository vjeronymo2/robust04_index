			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Essentially a Challenge to China's </F> Sovereignty--Further on the Report Issued by the British  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee"]    [Text] An experienced member of parliament from the  British Labor Party criticized the British Parliamentary Foreign  Affairs Committee's report on Sino-British relations as "sheer  nonsense."    This is absolutely true. One example is that the report  attacks Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law as "a  serious hidden threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the implementation of the  Joint Declaration."    The spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC) replied to this, pointing out  that these provisions of the Basic Law were a concrete  expression of the Chinese Government resumption of the exercise  of sovereignty on 1 July 1997. It was totally unreasonable for  the report to attack these provisions. Such an attack precisely  reveals the real motive behind the British side's attempt to  extend Britain's control and influence over Hong Kong.    Article 18 of the Basic Law states: In the event that the  Standing Committee of the NPC decides to declare a state of war  or, due to turmoil within the HKSAR which endangers national  unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of  the Region, decides that the Region is in a state of emergency,  the Central People's Government may issue an order applying the  relevant national laws in the Region.    Article 158 states: The power of interpretation of this Law  shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC.    The importance of these provisions to realizing and  safeguarding China's sovereignty is self-evident.    China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong in 1997 is not just a matter of changing flags. The HKSAR,  which will be directly under the Central People's Government,  must be established in accordance with the decision of the NPC;  the Basic Law of the HKSAR approved by the NPC must be  implemented; foreign affairs must be administered by the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs; national defense must be the  responsibility of the Central People's Government; the chief  executive and principal officials of the executive organs of the  HKSAR must be appointed by the Central People's Government; the  declaration of a state of emergency of the HKSAR must be decided  by the NPC; and the power of interpretation of the Basic Law  must be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. All these  represent the expression of China's resumption of the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong and are also an expression of the  principle of integrating upholding the country's unity with  ensuring a high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR. The NPC is the  highest organ of state power, and it exercises state sovereignty  in a unified manner. China's resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong will inevitably be reflected in the  participation of the NPC and its Standing Committee in the  handling of Hong Kong affairs. How can we talk about upholding  the principle of sovereignty if the NPC and its Standing  Committee cannot exercise even the power of declaring a state of  emergency in Hong Kong or the power of interpreting the Basic  Law? Britain is opposed to these two articles of the Basic Law.  Is this not a brazen challenge to China's sovereignty?    We really cannot understand why the NPC's possession of  these  two kinds of power can constitute a "serious threat" to the  HKSAR. Suppose the NPC declares a state of emergency in the  HKSAR because the Region is threatened by war, or by reason of  turmoil within the Region which endangers national unity or  security and is beyond the control of the government of the  Region, and this enables Hong Kong to avoid aggression and  ensures the unity and security of the state -- does this  represent a "serious threat?" If some people attempt to tamper  with or distort the meaning of the provisions of the Basic Law  and attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong, and the NPC Standing  Committee interprets the relevant provisions in order to ensure  the correct implementation of the Basic Law, does this represent  a "serious threat?" The right to enjoy a high degree of  autonomy is invested in the HKSAR by the NPC, and this can be  realized only if the Basic Law approved by the NPC is correctly  implemented. According to the report, Britain, which is opposed  to the Basic Law, seems to have become the defender of the  HKSAR's autonomy, while the Chinese NPC, which resolutely wants  to implement the Basic Law, seems to constitute a "threat" to  this autonomy. Has anyone ever heard such logic?    That the NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned  above  is entirely a guarantee of the realization of "one country, two  systems" and is a guarantee for the prosperity and stability of  Hong Kong. To the several million Hong Kong residents who love  their country and Hong Kong, this can only produce a "sense of  stability" and a "sense of security," and will not produce any  "sense of threat."    Only the following types of people will have a sense of  "threat" and even "serious threat": People who have all along  been opposed to the Basic Law and who intentionally attempt to  tamper with or distort the Basic Law; people who hope that Hong  Kong will become an "independent" or "semi-independent"  political entity; and people who are "opposed to anything put  forward by China" and who are dead set on regarding China as  their enemy. As a matter of fact, these kinds of people can be  put under one category, a category of people who willingly  grovel at the feet of the British and serve the colonial rule.  The number of people in this category is not large. That the  NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned above will  certainly constitute an enormous obstacle to their perverse  acts, and, therefore, this will naturally cause a sense of  "serious threat" among them. When the British parliamentary  report attacks the Basic Law, it is absolutely speaking for  these people, and the motive is evident.    When the Basic Law was approved by the NPC, the British  Foreign Ministry made a statement saying that the Basic Law was  an important milestone in Hong Kong's future, it reflected the  spirit of the Joint Declaration, and was welcomed as a  constitution. Only four years have passed, and the Basic Law  has not yet been implemented, but Britain has changed from  "praising" the Basic Law to opposing it. Chris Patten, who kept  on saying that he "read the Basic Law more often than the  Bible," also said a few days ago that Britain pointed out long  ago that the Basic Law was harmful to the Joint Declaration.  What does that mean? Did Britain say one thing and mean  another in the past or is it playing tricks today? Either  alternative shows Britain's hypocrisy and ulterior motives.</p>

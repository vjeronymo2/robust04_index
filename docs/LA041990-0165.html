			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> GREAT COMMUNICATOR ON WAY BACK  </P> <P> Great Communicator, the California-based hero of the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf at  Churchill Downs, has been out of sight and out of mind since his miserable  showing last October in the Oak Tree Invitational.  </P> <P> The quirky gelding finished eighth that day, floundering in the propwash thrown  by Hawkster, who set a world record for 1 1/2 miles on the grass. The Oak Tree  debacle marked Great Communicator's fourth consecutive loss in a troubling  downward spiral. Clearly, the old boy had reached the end of the line.  </P> <P> Or had he?  </P> <P> This week, as the second anniversary of Great Communicator's victory in the San  Juan Capistrano Handicap approaches Sunday at Santa Anita, trainer and  part-owner Thad Ackel was delighted to tell the world that his 7-year-old  campaigner has returned to the track and is being pointed toward a comeback  this summer.  </P> <P> The '88 San Juan not only launched Great Communicator as one of North America's  most popular thoroughbreds, it also provided one of the most emotional moments  in Santa Anita history. The race came just five days after family patriarch  George Ackel -- the "great communicator" of New Orleans politics -- died of a  heart attack.  </P> <P> Thad Ackel dedicated the San Juan to his father, and Great Communicator did the  rest. The former claimer went on to win five more major races in the next 13  months, boosting his earnings to $2.8 million and amassing a record of such  consistency that he earned the nickname, "the Great One," with absolutely no  apologies to Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> Great Communicator's victory in the '88 Breeders' Cup Turf remains his finest  hour. Taking on the best 1 1/2-mile grass horses from France (Triptych),  England (Indian Skimmer) and New York (Sunshine Forever), he beat them all at  12-1 with a memorable front-running performance.  </P> <P> But Great Communicator's decline through the second half of 1989 left a sour  taste with his many fans. After winning the Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 29,  the gelding failed in the Golden Gate Handicap, the Arlington Handicap, the  Arlington Million and then the Oak Tree race.  </P> <P> Ackel spent most of the summer and fall second-guessing himself and tending to  Great Communicator's growing list of nagging ailments.  </P> <P> "The one thing I definitely should not have done was run him at Golden Gate,"  Ackel said. "The Hollywood race was harder on him than I thought. I should have  stopped on him right there and given him two months off.  </P> <P> "But he'd always had a bunch of aches and pains, and he seemed to overcome  those during his races. I never really worried about him during his morning  work, because that was just him."  </P> <P> In the subsequent Arlington Million, Great Communicator suffered deep cuts on a  hind leg. Ackel was relieved to discover that the vital suspensory ligaments  were spared any damage.  </P> <P> "I basically thought the cuts were the extent of the injury," he said. "But I  think when it happened, it actually threw his stride off up front, and he  wrenched his ankle a little bit."  </P> <P> "After the way he ran in the Oak Tree Invitational, though, I knew without a  doubt that he needed some time off," Ackel said.  </P> <P> After two months of walking and pampering at Ackel's Hollywood Park stable,  Great Communicator was sent to Fred Sahadi's Cardiff Stud Farm in Creston, just  east of Atascadero. The gelding took up temporary residence alongside Flying  Paster, California's leading sire, and Skywalker, winner of the 1986 Breeders'  Cup Classic.  </P> <P> According to Ackel, Great Communicator had his own paddock, an acre of lush  pasture and plenty of attention, despite the fact he was a definite  non-participant in the breeding season going on around him.  </P> <P> Great Communicator's vacation ended in late March when he returned to Hollywood  Park. He has been galloping for about two weeks now, growing stronger every  day.  </P> <P> "He really needed the rest," Ackel said. "He was getting a little tense, a  little irritable. Now he's much more relaxed."  </P> <P> Ackel is not deluding himself about the chances for Great Communicator to reach  his old heights.  </P> <P> "If you don't expect too much, you're never disappointed," the trainer said.  "Realistically, I'm looking at a 7-year-old horse. He looks great, but he's got  some wear and tear. Hopefully, the rest repaired all his aches and pains."  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee falls as metals climb higher - Week in the Markets Commodity markets took a mid-week breather from the fizz and fury that has sharply driven up most prices. Then the markets took off in different directions: Copper and other metals renewed their bull run; Coffee and cocoa ended the week with heavy losses as investment funds started to sell. Meanwhile, the oil market remained uncertain about whether to extend the explosive rally that lifted prices by 25 per cent since the end of March. London July futures for the benchmark Brent crude closed last night at about Dollars 16.30 a barrel, unchanged from a week ago. Traders said buyers had appeared any time the price dipped towards Dollars 16. A long-awaited sell-off hit the coffee market after prices had started the week much stronger and traders were looking for the market to make fresh highs. However, the rout started in New York late on Tuesday when weakness across the commodity markets, starting in grains, spilled into coffee and cocoa. Coffee lost most of its gains made earlier in the week on Wednesday when prices plunged by Dollars 138 a tonne on the London Commodity Exchange. The price fall intensified on Thursday when the market lost Dollars 175 a tonne in nervous trading. Coffee prices began to stabilise on Friday, however. Prices remained extremely volatile and the London market lost Dollars 30 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,004. Analysts point out that coffee stocks remain tight. Soyabean futures prices in Chicago tumbled by over 60 cents on news of rainy weather. This nervousness was evident across the soft commodity markets with cocoa losing Pounds 73 a tonne after hitting a 6-year high at the start of the week. It closed on Friday at Pounds 993 a tonne - Pounds 17 a tonne lower than Thursday. Copper prices also fell victim to the mid-week sell-off. But a bigger-than-expected fall in London Metal Exchange copper stocks yesterday sparked trade buying and metal for delivery in three months ended last night at Dollars 2,264.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35 on the week. Attention on the LME switched to zinc and tin yesterday after Metallgesellschaft, the financially-troubled metals group, announced it would cut production at Ruhr-Zink's Datteln zinc smelter from 200,000 tonnes a year to 90,000 tonnes. The Berzelius 10,000-tonne a year tin smelter at Duisberg will close. Analysts pointed out that the proposed zinc cut was only one-third of that needed to bring European supply and demand into balance. Exports from China, Russia and North Korea were adding to western over-supply. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said MG's move would merely slow the rate at which LME stocks of zinc were increasing. Nevertheless, three-month zinc was carried up with copper and closed last night on the LME at Dollars 986.50 a tonne, up Dollars 15.25 on the day but down Dollars 30 over the week. Analysts suggested that the Duisberg closure was only marginally supportive for tin prices. One said that annual output from the plant was way below capacity - less than 4,000 tonnes - so the closure would not have a substantial impact on the tin market's growing oversupply. However, three month tin was also caught up in the metals rise and closed at Dollars 5,662.50 a tonne, up Dollars 67.50 on the day and Dollars 40 from a week ago.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium         +6,850   to  2,660,150 Aluminium alloy   -1,120   to     33,560 Copper            -9,525   to    387,000 Lead              unchgd   to    350,025 Nickel               -42   to    131,904 Zinc              +3,400   to  1,169,675 Tin                 +150   to     29,245  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Rwanda aid troops attacked in Goma Demonstrators set up roadblocks in Goma, Zaire, yesterday, saying they were fed up with thieving by some Zaire soldiers sent to help in the Rwandan refugee crisis. At least six tractor-trailers bringing relief supplies to nearby refugee camps were stranded at the border because they were unable to navigate through the barricades. Some refugees joined in as about 5,000 people filled the streets, throwing stones and taunting police after a soldier shot and killed a local man who had been changing money on the black market. Goma has become increasingly tense since the refugees arrived in mid-July. Most refugees have been moved to camps away from Goma but thousands still live on the streets of the town. The soldiers have been accused of stealing goods and extorting money from aid organisations.</p>

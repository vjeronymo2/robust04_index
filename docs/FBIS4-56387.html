			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rodrigo Vera] </F>   [Text] The charges against Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San  Cristobal de las Casas, to the effect that he promoted the armed  movement in Chiapas, intensified last week in several national  publications.    The charge was echoed in editorials, articles, and  interviews  with priests and Indians displaced by the fighting, mainly in  the daily EL UNIVERSAL and the weeklies IMPACTO and SIEMPRE!.    In its 24 February editorial, entitled "The Apostle of the  Activism," IMPACTO says:    "In his statements Bishop Ruiz has been on the verge of  giving in to his activism and revealing himself as a fundamental  part of the machinery that manufactured the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN), the guerrilla organization in which he  may have cloaked his true ambitions. We need not wrack our  brains analyzing his statements, observations, recommendations,  and `conciliatory' remarks to realize that Bishop Ruiz runs the  risk of being overtaken by emotion and shouting: We won! Or Did  I win?"    It goes on to say that Samuel Ruiz "knows more than he is  admitting publicly" and that "to achieve his objective the  bishop used the hunger and poverty of the Indians."    In the editorial in its 3 March edition IMPACTO says:    "No one should be fooled if the politicized clergyman goes  further and seeks to divide up the country for himself. The  `enlightened' bishop has already set the tone and with his hosts  of catechizers, diocesans, nuns, and, in short, members of  religious orders from here and there, has had an excellent  laboratory in which to cultivate the wrath, frustrations, and  offensive and denigrating neglect of the Indians to set them  against the government and then harvest the fruit of a forbidden  tree."    IMPACTO does not think that either Manuel Camacho Solis  ("owing to his personal ambitions") or the Zapatist delegates  would dare to "unmask" the bishop and finger him "as a commander  of the guerrillas."    In its 2 March issue SIEMPRE! asserts in an editorial that  Samuel Ruiz, along with Camacho Solis and Commander Marcos,  "have turned the war in the Lacandon Forest into a Hollywood  spectacle in which each actor seeks to play the day's leading  role."    It sees the Chiapas conflict as "shady and odd," and the  manipulation of it by Zapatists and peace-makers "seems more  like a theatrical production staged for the mass media than a  bloody war the main cause of which is supposedly the social  tragedy of the Indian communities."    It concludes:    "Only time will put each of the players who have taken part  in this war in their proper place. The central figures in it  have been neither the Indians nor Zapata the revolutionary but  rather three men who for different reasons are hungry for  publicity and power."    In a feature article entitled "Landowner, subversive, and  enemy of the middle class. The other face of Don Samuel,"  SIEMPRE! reveals in the same edition, without citing sources,  the properties that the bishop allegedly owns, some of which  were used to train the guerrillas:    "Two of the ranches are in the municipality of Ciudad  Cuauhtemoc, Chiapas, one called Santa Clara and another La  Gloria, previously San Caralampio. There are those who say that  the bishop has hundreds of guerrillas hidden at present on this  ranch, as they prepare to take action in southeast Mexico.    "The bishop acquired other real estate in the area near the  Guatemalan border: Gloria Huanacaston (purchased by someone  named Braulio Hernandez); Tepancuapan (bought by Father Alfredo  Inda Andrio); La Esmeralda, San Lorenzo, El Naranjillo, El  Porvenir 1 (which is believed to have been used by Guatemalan  guerrillas as a hospital and rest area), El Porvenir II (also  bought through Father Inda Andrio), the San Pedro ranch, and the  Guanajuato ranch."    Last week EL UNIVERSAL published a series of interviews with  Indians and priests in which they accused the bishop of  promoting the armed struggle.    Diego Andres, the priest in Bochil, Chiapas, indicated that  the leader of the EZLN is a former seminarian from the diocese  of San Cristobal and that the catechizers, with the support of  Samuel Ruiz, have gone around giving military training to  believers.    Otilio Lopez Lopez, a former vicar of Ocosingo, related that  three years ago he spoke out against the imminent uprising to  Jeronimo Prigione, the apostolic nuncio in Mexico, who merely  told him that there were a "heap of charges" against Samuel Ruiz  but that the Vatican had not yet given him any instructions.    According to him, the Gospel that the San Cristobal bishop  is  promoting is "ideologized, with pamphleteer phrasing and  classist slogans." He cited the names of priests who had to  leave because they did not agree with the bishop's line:    Heberto Jose Morales, a former rector of Chiapas Autonomous  University, Antonio Patino, Elias Martinez Bulmaro Gordillo,  Aurelio Zapata, Cecilio Baraibar, Oscar Macias, and Jose Reyes  Angel.    He mentioned others who asked to be transferred to another  diocese, among them Pedro Ramuco (today in Zamora), Pablo  Arenas, Jose Conrado Ruiz, and Jose Inocencio Galvan (in  Guadalajara).    According to EL UNIVERSAL, representatives of more than  8,000  Indians from 35 communities were in Mexico City to try and see  Prigione to find out whether Pope John Paul II had replied to  the letter in which they complained about Samuel Ruiz, who  because they failed to support his "liberation church"  "punished" them by refusing them the sacraments.    The letter, which was submitted to the pontiff during his  visit to Yucatan last August, said that as a result of the  "punishment" imposed by Samuel Ruiz, 460 children had not been  baptized, 262 couples had not been married, and 884 persons had  not received confirmation; they added that Ruiz's "catechizers  are forcing the Indians to sing `Juan the landless' and `30-30  carbine.'"    The Indian leaders who were interviewed, "Brother Juan" and  "Brother Pedro," said of the bishop:    "Don Samuel is a friend of the Zapatists. He organized  everything."</p>

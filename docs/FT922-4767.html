			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (6): It 'will be one of the first areas to pick up' - Property THIS YEAR has a Spanish flavour, so perhaps it is not surprising that Wilson Bowden Properties has named the centrepiece of its Langstone Park development Columbus House. Whether the name presages deeper associations with the Iberian peninsula has yet to be revealed, but next February the first office block, comprising 55,000 sq ft, on the site will be ready for occupation at Pounds 12 a sq ft. Mr Nigel Webb, of agents Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, says the building, which is a joint venture with the Welsh Development Agency, occupies 'one of the best positions in Britain'. Mr Robert Grafton, Wilson's development manager, agrees. But then, they have a vested interest in ensuring the commercial success of the building, which is part of a Pounds 70m development. Mr Graham Moore, the Welsh Development Agency's property director, is a more dispassionate observer since the agency takes an overview on all property matters in Wales. 'You have only to look at its situation to see how it can appeal,' he says. 'It sits on junction 24 of the M4, is no more than 15 minutes from the Severn Bridge and will not be far from the Welsh end of the second Severn crossing when that bridge is opened in 1996. 'In addition, it has two hotels virtually at the entrance to the park, which is important not just to business users but also for the conference facilities they provide.' However, Langstone Park is, as Mr Moore is quick to point out, only one of several sites being marketed in Gwent. Signs of increasing activity are beginning to be seen elsewhere in this part of the country. At the exit to the Severn bridge, on junction 22, Newhouse Park is a distribution park with clients like Tesco, Nestle and Littlewoods already in occupation. Esso has just completed a service station at junction 23 where land is ripe for development if only the two local authorities, Monmouth and Newport, could agree on what sort of activity should occupy the site - distribution says Newport, offices says Monmouth. Then at junction 28 two major developments are pencilled in. First there is Celtic Lakes, a joint operation between Trencherwood, Bassaleg Group, Newport and the WDA, which will contain within it the Imperial Park, in which London's Imperial College is to have its science park. Mr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the WDA, has described this as 'one of the most important developments to take place in Wales. It will put the principality on the international map as a centre for research and development.' Trencherwood and partners are undertaking a B1 office development within which Imperial Park will be an integral, but separate, part. Celtic Lakes, the name for the whole, will comprise 170 acres in all and the infrastructure is already in place. Trencher- wood-Bassaleg will develop 50 acres in phase one and Imp- erial Park will cover 60 acres, with room for a further phase. Altogether, 2m sq ft of space will be available when the site is fully developed, creating several thousand jobs. Imperial's core block, the Innovation Centre, is already up and the first client is about to sign the necessary forms. Across the road, in Cleppa Park, Portico Estates has been quietly putting together a development that began, in conjunction with Cardiff University, as a science park but with the arrival of Imperial College has turned into another B1 development, albeit with a touch of academe. An announcement is expected soon about a developer from the south-east who, with Danish finance, would kick off the project. Next door to Cleppa Park, the Gwent Technology Park is taking shape, a joint venture between the WDA, Gwent County Council and Newport. In all these, the WDA is playing a central role. Its portfolio in Gwent runs to 36 estates, comprising 466 units providing just under 4.8m sq ft. Without its presence, it is doubtful if the property market would be sustainable. Institutional finance has alway been unwilling to commit itself to Wales and so the agency has had to underpin the market to show outside interests that Wales is as viable a market as, say, the West Midlands or the Manchester area. That policy, which has seen the WDA become the largest property-linked agency in Europe, has had some success recently and that will have great significance for the future. Institutional finance has arrived in Cardiff and now it has spread from the Welsh capital to Gwent. Last year Allied Dunbar paid Pounds 3m for a property in Newport and CIN Properties paid Pounds 4m for the remainder of Llantarnam Park in Cwmbran, just north of Newport. These may be small beginnings but they are significant because it is the agency's policy to be self-funding and so property realisations will be an important factor in the success or failure of that policy. In the financial year 1991-92 the agency raised about Pounds 55m in property transactions, Pounds 26m of it in capital sales and some Pounds 30m in rents. This year it aims to raise Pounds 50m in capital receipts alone. It intends not just to concen- trate on the M4 corridor, however attractive that is commercially. 'Our policy is to draw developers north,' Mr Moore says. 'We have plenty of sites at the top end of Gwent where the attractions are not just scenic, being on the edge of the Brecon Beacons national park, but also of the spine A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which links the tops of all the industrial valleys in south Wales to the Midlands.' The agency put up a building on the Ebbw Vale garden festival site and received an offer for it even before the festival opened in May. Nearby it has the Crown Business Park, actually on the A465, on the market. It is a common perception that the valleys are 'dead' for commercial development. Without the WDA, this feeling would persist and would therefore be self-fulfilling. But the agency has proved it is possible to get people interested in the valleys. The Ebbw Vale office block is just one example. Marine colliery, just below the festival site, one of the last pits to be working in the county at its closure, has now been cleared and levelled and is waiting for the first speculative blocks to be erected. Other coalmining sites are now busy industrial areas. Rassau, above Ebbw Vale, is the perfect example of how success can be created from a site that is generally thought to be unprepossessing. 'Ten years ago,' says Mr David Farnsworth, the agency's director in charge of urban development, 'the agency was thought to have gone mad when it decided to develop Rassau. Today, the estate provides work for 3,000 people. It shows what can be done.' According to Mr Webb of Debenham Tewson: 'Percep- tions about Gwent, as about Wales itself, are now changing. There was not a lot of develop- ment in the county in the past because people still associated it with heavy industry. But all that has now gone. The last pit has closed and the steel indus- try is more about computers than sweat and grime. 'So institutional support has begun to come as the international companies, such as Panasonic, Yuasa Batteries and Trico have moved in. This will be one of the first areas to pick up.' Such evidence as there is shows that the pick-up may be on the way. Mr Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent council, which covers the northern part of the county, says that inquiries in the first quarter of this year were 60 per cent higher than in the previous three months. Both Mr Moore and Mr Webb detect quickening interest elsewhere in Gwent. The progress at Cleppa Park supports this. So does an imminent announcement for a 140,000 sq ft expansion in Newport and a relocation in Pontypool. All this can only be good news.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] At the video rental in the basement store of the  public service center of the National Defense Ministry,  Yongsan-ku, Seoul, the most popular videotape lately is "A Few  Good Men." The title of the tape, they say, was derived from the  advertising tagline to recruit Marines in the United States.  Though three copies of the tape were imported last August, it is  so popular among the soldiers serving at the National Defense  Ministry that no one can borrow it without making a reservation.  The significance of the tape is that young officers attack the  faults committed by a commander stubbornly loyal to his  fatherland. It may perhaps be natural that such a story  interests the officers of this country.    Since the new government, the Korean military is realizing  more changes and reforms than any other group. The military  which endures the intense criticism of the people due to the  dishonorable work done by some of their predecessors under  presidents of the military cliques over the last thirty years,  bears a burden to change into a military which will receive the  people's love and confidence. In these days of reform, what  position is the military taking? In the nine months of Kim  Yong-sam government, how much reform of the military has been  carried out and which way is it going? Is it really succeeding?    It is no exaggeration to say that the aim of the military  reform by the new goverment is to remove the Hanahoe. Last 8  March, President Kim Yong-sam suddenly dismissed Kim Chin-yong,  the Army Chief of the General Staff, and So Won-su, the Defense  Security Commander. Last 18 October, he conducted the promotions  of army corps and division commanders and of rear admiral and  major general classes of the Navy and Air Force, as well as  personnel changes of key positions in the National Defense  Ministry. With this, his military reshuffle was finished.    In addition, President Kim carried out a second military  reshuffle including the dismissal of Kim To-yun, the Defense  Security Commander, and about 30 executive officers of brigadier  general, colonel and lieutenant colonel classes, thus  establishing a royal governing structure both in name and  reality. With this, the military clique, which had lasted for  thirteen years from the beginning of the 1980 Fifth Republic  through the Sixth Republic, collapsed and a new military clique  was formed.    Of the three- and four-star generals of the entire army,  only  five including General Kim Chae-chang (18th term graduate of the  Military Academy; only the number of the term will be written  hereinafter), Deputy Commander of the Combined Forces and  Vice-Admiral Yim Chung-rin (16th term graduate of the Naval  Academy) the Marine Corps Commandant, etc., were promoted by the  former President No Tae-u at the end of last year. The rest of  the generals were all promoted by President Kim with the regular  personnel changes this fall. But all generals of Hanahoe, except  for one, could not be promoted.    According to the Army authority, Hanahoe's members number  about 120 and are 20th- to 36th-term graduates of the Military  Academy. The only general still in active service and who is  prior to the 20th term graduates is Kim Chae-chang.    From a list of generals published confidentially by the  National Defense Ministry at the beginning of every year, the  following members of Hanahoe were expunged for various reasons  and registered on the list of veterans: Kim Chin-yong (Military  Academy), Cho Nam-pung (18th term), Ku Chang-hoe (ex-Third Army  Commander), So Wan-su (19th term, ex-Defense Security  Commander), An Byong-ho (20th term, ex-Army Capital Garrison  Commander), Yi Chung-sok (21st term, ex-Operation Department  Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), So Chung-il (23d term,  ex-21st Division Commander), etc.    Keeping Hanahoe at a distance was already somewhat expected  when major class officers were promoted last August. At that  time, twelve members of the Aljahoe who are 41st term graduates  of the Military Academy were not even registered on the list of  those eligible for promotion. So when lieutenant colonel and  colonel class officers were promoted, 37th-term graduates of  Aljahoe and 32d-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded. Even  when 43 officers were promoted to brigadier general, eight  27th-term and three 26th-term graduates of Hanahoe were excluded.    These are not all of Hanahoe's problems. Immediately after  that, though four lieutenant generals (corps commanders) and 16  major generals (11 division commanders and 5 others) were  promoted, none from Hanahoe could be promoted. In the personnel  changes of generals, members of Hanahoe had to leave even their  leisurely posts, not to mention the important posts. Nine  lieutenants and major generals of Hanahoe were ordered to leave  their posts and await discharge or were not assigned to any  posts.    Three generals, Lieutenant General Kim Chung-hon (18th term)  director of the Military Academy, Major General An Kwang-yol  (20th term) director of the Installation Bureau of the National  Defense Ministry, and Major General Choe Ki-hong (22d term)  policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry were  ordered to leave their posts and wait for further action at the  Headquarters of the Army. Lieutenant General Yi Taek-hyong (19th  term) Strategy Planning Department chief of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and Kim Sang-chun, Operation Department chief of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff have also informally decided to leave their  posts and wait for further action at the Headquarters of the  Army. Lieutenant General Kim Chung-bae (20th term) Third Corps  commander, Song Tok-son, 11th Corps commander, Major General  Choe Seung-woo (21st term) chief of staff of the Education  Headquarters, and Major General Yo Myong-hyon (21st term) chief  of staff of the Second Army, four in all, were appointed to  Policy Committees of the Army Headquarters. The posts of Policy  Committees are leisurely ones that are given to officers  expected to be discharged. Members of Hanahoe who took charge of  main army divisions near the capital, including Major General  Chong Chong-taek (23d term) Capital Mechanized Division  commander, Son Su-tae, 30th Division commander, and Pak Yong-il,  Third Division commander, were also transferred to less  important posts of vice-corps commander seven months before the  end of their two-year terms.    Now no one of Hanahoe has an important post in the Army. The  chief secretary of the Army Chief of Staff, 30th and 33d Brigade  commanders of the Capital Garrison Command, the Personnel Staff  of the Army Headquarters, the key posts of the ranger-commando  force and the Defense Security Command are filled with officers  other than members of Hanahoe or graduates of the Military  Academy.    Last 3 November for the first time after President Kim took  office, Kim Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff, had  an exclusive talk with the president where it is said that he  was given directions to "from next year, select and assign  members of Hanahoe." But many people say that members of Hanahoe  have suffered such unfavorable treatment that they could not  make a comeback.    Various kinds of reactions came out from people inside and  outside of the Army on the perfect purge of Hanahoe.    General A: "Hanahoe was a curse on our Army. For the unity  and harmony of the Army, even its roots must be eradicated. You  must bear in mind that members of Hanahoe survived the the Yun  Pil-yong event carried out in the 12 December coup and the 17  May Kwangju event."    Colonel B: "I recognize the abuse of Hanahoe. But it is also  wrong that even colonels and lieutenant colonels of the club are  excluded in promotions, solely on the basis of being registered  on the membership list of Hanahoe. After the 13 April 1987  Constitution protection measure, as instructed by Ko Myong-sung,  the then Defense Security commander, many majors and lieutenant  colonels became members of Hanahoe to protect the regime,  regardless of their own will, didn't they?"    Lieutentant C: "I will, as a member of Hanahoe, willingly  submit to such unfavorable treatment. It is, though, too  unreasonable that only because seniors, juniors, and companions  of mine are on good terms with Hanahoe members, they are looked  upon coldly and treated unfavorably."    Reserve General D: "If the goverment wants to purge Hanahoe  members, it should discharge them all at once from service or  leave them alone. If it transfers them to leisurely posts a few  months after it had assigned them to key posts, it will merely  cause the Army to agitate. If the current of the times is like  this, it should treat all members by the same standard and free  them from dissatisfaction and uneasiness."    Who will be the new influential group to take over the posts  of Hanahoe? Although the influential group to replace Hanahoe,  which held the Army for ten years, hasn't formed yet, it is  clear that one is rapidly forming.    In the process of forming a new military clique under the  new  government, another significant factor is the rapid collapse of  the TK [Taegu North Kyongsang Province] group. Although five  member of the TK group were promoted to brigadier generals this  year as last year, not one of the group was included in the  promotion of 16 major generals including 11 division commanders.  The four generals promoted to corps commanders were all non-TK  group -- three from Seoul and one from South Kyongsang Province.    After the new government began, the TK group collapsed.  Instead officers from Pusan and South Kyongsang Province (PK),  the areas producing the most members of the influential group,  rose remarkably to the surface. Of the promoted brigadier  generals, 14 are from PK -- 12 from South Kyongsang Province and  two from Pusan -- four more than last year. Of the promoted  lieutenant generals, Yi Yu-so (20th term) 7th Corps commander is  from Kyongnam High School of Pusan. Of the promoted major  generals, Kim Pan-kyu (24th term) 55th Division Commander and  Cho Yong-rae (177th-term graduate of the military officer  training center) Third Division commander, are from South  Kyongsang Province. Kim Hui-sang (24th term) newly appointed  Capital Mechanized Division commander is from Kojang, South  Kyongsang Province, the same place as Chong Chung-wuk, Secretary  of Diplomacy and Security of the Blue House. Rear Admiral Chun  To-bong (35th-term graduate of the Naval Officer Training  Center) deputy chief of Personnel Staff of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and Admiral Kim Mu-Ung (21st-term graduate of the Naval  Academy) are also from PK. Because Major General Kim Pan-kyu and  Brigadier General Sin Hye-kwon are from Koje Island, the native  place of President Kim, they attract more public attention.  Moreover, it is believed that because Major General Kim was  President Kim's junior in Kyongnam High School and Brigadier  General Sin was the Operations Staff of Corps exercising the  jurisdiction over Koje Island, this would have favorably  affected their promotions.    The fact that PK has not only risen significantly in numbers  but also holds important posts has attracted public attention.  Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun (3d-term ROTC graduate, the  promotion to a major general is expected next 1 January),  unexpectedly appointed to the post of Defense Security Command  last 21 October, is from Hamyang, South Kyongsang Province, and  ex-Sixth Division Commander Han Sung-ui (22d term) recently  appointed to the post of policy planning officer of the National  Defense Ministry, who graduated from Pusan High School, is from  Sanjong, South Kyongsang Province.    Another distinctive feature of the last personnel changes is  that large numbers of graduates of Kyongbok High School of Seoul  are taking posts in the Army and the new government.    As the graduates of the Kyongbok High School including Kim  Tong-chin, the Army chief of the General Staff went up into  higher classes, the Blue House and those close to the President  might have exercised their influence over the promotions.  Persons well informed of the military believe Mr. K., a younger  person graduated from Kyongbok High School, who is known to  serve near the president and has an important effect upon the  personnel changes in the government, and Minister K, etc., would  have exercised directly or indirectly their influence over the  last military personnel changes.    Of the Kyongbok High School graduates, there are Kim  Hoe-sang, ex-national defense secretary of the Blue House and  Hong Sun-ho (4th-term ROTC graduate, ex-chief of planning  security of the Army Headquarters) Fifth-Division commander and  President Kim's junior in the philosophy department of Seoul  University. Chang Chong-kil (21st-term graduate of the Naval  Academy) ex-Fifth Battle Corps commander of the Navy, and Choe  Yong-hwan (15th-term graduate of the Air Force Academy) Tenth  Battle Flying Corps commander of the Air Force are also  graduates of the same school.    It is said that Minister K, an influential person in the  government, widely associates with all sorts and classes of  people and also has a wide acquaintance in the military from  which to collect information. It is said that he put forth his  opinion on the military personnel changes to President Kim.  Considering these facts, the current influential persons in  Korea's new military world are mainly from Pusan and South  Kyongsang Province regions and graduates of Kyongbok High School.    A remarkable point is that not as many graduates of Kyongnam  High School, President Kim's old school, have been appointed to  important posts as other school graduates. It is known that of  the Kyongnam High School graduates, there is actually no general  higher than three stars in active service. Although General Ku  Chang-hoe, the Third Army Commander, was in active service up  until the beginning of this year, he was discharged from service  last April. Brigadier General Yi Hyang-su (21st term,  Intelligence School Director) and Brigadier General Kim Sang-yol  (discharge expected next January) are in active service, but  both were excluded in the promotion to major generals. Besides  Major General Chon Sang-bae (22d term, chief of Intelligence  Staff of the Army Headquarters), Major General An Song-yong (23d  term, 17th Division commander), Major General Kim Pan-kyu (24th  term) who was appointed to the post of division commander  recently, Brigadier General Pak No-sok (24th term) chief  secretary of the Army Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier  General Pak Man-taek (26th term) are all graduates of Kyongnam  High School. None of the Kyongnam High School graduates of the  25th through 27th terms of the Military Academy are in active  service. In the Marine Corps, there is Rear Admiral Chon To-bong.    A field grade officer, a graduate of Kyongnam High School,  said, "This is the case because Kyongnam High School graduates  mainly entered the medical and business worlds, while many Pusan  High School graduates launched into the bureaucratic world. Even  if Kyongnam High School graduates did join the military world,  they could not keep company with President Kim because of his  long time association with the opposition party."    On the other hand, Pusan and Kyongbuk High Schools produced  large numbers of influential persons during the Fifth and Sixth  Republics. They include General Un Yong-nam, Third Army  commander, Major General Han Sung-ui (22d term) newly appointed  policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministry, and  Major General Yi Ui-se (22d term) national defense secretary of  the National Security Planning Agency in the important posts.  Since the new government was established, the power of Kyongbuk  High School graduates is diminishing. So Wan-su, defense  security commander, was already ruined. Major General Choe  Ki-hong (22d term) was ordered to leave his post and wait for  further action at Army Headquarters. Major Sin Chong (20th term)  is in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Major General Ku Tae-to (21st  term) and Brigadier General Choe Tong-Chin (25th term, aide of  the Minister) are in the National Defense Ministry. Brigadier  General Chong Su-song (202d-term graduate of the Military  Officer Training Center) is in the personnel staff of the Army  Headquarters. These are all low-profile posts.    The Seoul High School graduates who once built up a large  area of influence in the military also seem to have decreased in  numbers as compared with the past. Lieutenant General Kim Chok  (21st term) chief of the Operations Department of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, who was appointed to the First Corps Commander  this time, and Lieutenant General Kim Sang-chun (19th term) are  both graduates of Seoul High School. Besides them, Yi Yon-rin,  Chief of Planning and Management Office, and Yi Chung-hyong,  first assistant minister, who hold the important posts in the  National Defense Ministry as reserve officers, are also Seoul  High School graduates.    On the other hand, graduates of Kyonggi High School are  advancing by leaps and bounds. Among them are: To Il-kyu, Army  Capital garrison commander, Yi Ho-sung, chief of planning staff  of the Army Headquarters, Pak Yong-ok (21st term) expected  military attache to the Korean Embassy in the United States, and  Yi Sang-hui (26th term) who was promoted to a brigadier general  this time and is serving in the Defense Secretary's office of  the Blue House. And there are many graduates of Songdong High  School of Seoul who hold important posts. They are Yi Chong-nam  (21st term) defense secretary of the Blue House, and Yi Sok-bok  (21st term) deputy chief of staff of the Combined Forces, and  Lieutenant General Yi Kyu-hwan who was appointed to the post of  Third Corps commander. Of the graduates of Chaeil High School of  Kwangju, there are Lieutenant General Kim Tong-sin, Captial  Corps commander, Major General An Taek-sun in the Air Force, and  Yi So-yong (20th term graduate of the Naval Academy) the First  Fleet commander. Colonels Kim Chang-su and Kwon An-to were  promoted to brigadier generals most recently, attracting public  attention.    In the past, the influential military men held important  posts in three commands: the Capital Garrison Command, the  Defense Security Command, and Ranger Command. But after the  civil government began, posts affecting politics tend to be  regarded with great importance. With the conception of important  posts changing, the military men being trusted by the ministers  or the Blue House are holding such posts. The chief of the  personnel staff of the Army Headquarters who in the past  exercised his enormous influence over personnel changes is also  now less popular, military men estimate. Some say that receiving  enormous bribes in connection with military construction while  in office as Seventh Division Commander, Yim Chong-sop's (22d  term, chief of personnel staff) actions contributed to the  decline in the post's popularity. Accordingly, the important  posts in the military are said to be the Policy Office chief and  policy planning officer of the National Defense Ministy, the  national defense secretary of the Blue House and minister aides,  etc.    In less than one year after being transferred to the post of  First Corps commander after serving as policy planning officer,  General Cho Song-tae (20th term) returned to the post of Policy  Office Chief of the National Defense Ministry. Graduated from  Taejon Middle School and the high school attached to the  Education College of Seoul, he had been selected by Yi Chong-ku,  national defense minister to be policy planning officer. He is  said to have carried out his duties so well as to please the  then Vice-Minister Kwon Yong-hae.    As Major General Choe Ki-hong had been dismissed from the  post of policy planning officer by reason of his membership in  Hanahoe, his classmate Han Sung-ui, Sixth Division commander,  was appointed to the post. Han Sung-ui who is from Sanchong,  South Kyongsang Province, and graduated from Pusan High School,  served as a professor of English at the Military Academy and had  been with the Combined Forces Command.    It is the selection of Yi Chong-nam, the national defense  secretary of the Blue House, that attracted the public eye more  than any other personnel changes at this time. As an artillery  man, Major General Yi Chong-nam did not distinguish himself and  was passed up twice for promotion to brigadier general. After he  served as an evaluation and management officer and operations  coordination officer of the National Defense Ministry, he was  promoted to a major general last year and was appointed to the  post of the national defense secretary of the Blue House this  time. In the middle of the 1970's when Chong Sung-hwa, ex-Army  chief of the General Staff, served as a Third Corps commander  and president of the Military Academy, Major General Yi served  as his chief secretary.    A person in the political circles who is known to advise the  president about military affairs since President Kim took office  said, "President Kim sometimes says he owes General Chong  Sung-hwa a great debt of gratitude. It is because General Chong  made speeches of support for him during the 1987 presidential  election campaign. Selecting Major General Yi could be said to  be President Kim's way of repaying General Chong for his  kindness."    Besides this reason, it was also a consideration that Major  General Yi is the most informed about the Yulgok Program which  amounts to about 30 percent of the entire national defense  budget. In the past, the presidential security service chief  discharged from military service generally advised the president  about military affairs. But as the national defense secretary  takes charge of such duties, this position might have been  raised from a brigadier general to a major general rank in order  to expand his range of authority.    The duties of the minister's aide are to assist the minister  from 8 AM when the minister shows up at the office to 6 or 7 PM.  The aide, who leads about 20 staff members including  colonel-class officers in charge of administration, protocol and  overseas, etc., must assist in even the slightest movement by  the national defense minister, by being in touch at all times  with the Blue House and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. There are  even times when he should write a letter of resignation for the  minister and then entreat him to withdraw the resignation. The  aide should be able to handle such difficult problems well.  Therefore, he, more than anyone, has to be in harmony with the  minister.    Choe Tong-chin (25th term, brigadier general) a newly  appointed aide is said to have conducted these duties well while  in the office of the chief of staff of the Army Capital Garrison  Command. It appears that coming from the same hometown (Kyongju)  as the minister has allowed him to enjoy his confidence.    Interference in the military personnel changes by the Blue  House is no less than it has been in the past, according to  persons well informed with the military. It is said that the  Blue House gathers information about high-ranking generals  through another channel, a search the Defense Security Command  did in the past. Through the channel, which field-grade officers  as well as generals use, various opinions on military affairs  are transmitted to the Blue House, a source said.    It is said that Mr. P., an influential person of the Blue  House, plays an important role in military affairs. Because his  duties are to run errands for President Kim, his role could be  said to be a natural one. But when Kim To-yun, ex-commander of  the Defense Security, who was appointed by President Kim, was  suddenly replaced by Yim Chae-mun, chief of staff of the Defense  Security Command, last 21 October, Mr. P. is said to have played  a major role.    Because at the time the government only said that "(Kim,  ex-commander of the Defense Security) resigned for personal  reasons" regarding his replacement as the commander of the  Defense Security, the real reasons were not known until now.  But, informed persons say, it is certain that Mr. P. interfered  in these affairs.    While the Blue House prohibits any exclusive talks between  the president and the commander of the Defense Security since  the new government began, it has obtained information on the  military's thoughts (especially those of Hanahoe) through the  national defense minister and separately through the managing  staffs of the Defense Security Command, they say. It is because  information obtained through official channels was in many cases  different from that obtained through unofficial lines,  especially, of the Hanahoe's thoughts which the Blue House has  given deep thought to, information obtained through official  channels tend to have less value. Accordingly, Mr. P. and Mr.  H., another influential person in the Blue House, found the  situation to be unusual and made a recommendation to the  president to replace the defense security commander.    "It is well known that since President Kim was in  opposition,  he surely has operated multiple information channels. This is  for keeping `checks and balances'. Although the president  initially trusted in the information from official channels as  much as can be, he realized it often differed from information  from unofficial lines. Thus he decided to change the official  channel. Because he could not change the minister who was in  charge of the official channel, he eventually had no choice but  to dismiss the defense security commander who was a faithful  staff officer to Minister Kwon," said a person well informed on  the military and the Blue House.    "By changing the defense security commander, the president  intended not only to secure the support of the government by the  Army but to check the arbitrary actions of ministers and the  chiefs of the general staff of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  anyone else," he added.    It is known to have been Mr. P. who, in compliance with the  president's intention, looked for a successor to the post of  defense security commander. Although Mr. P. called Major General  K. (serving at the National Defense Ministry) and Major General  L. (serving at the Army Headquarters), both of whom are 22d-term  graduates of the Military Academy and classmates of Commander  Kim, to the Blue House and asked them to take the post, they  both reportedly declined the offer.    Eventually Brigadier General Yim Chae-mun, chief of the  staff  of the Defense Security Command, was selected. The ex-Commander  Kim did not know he was being replaced even two days before. On  19 October, when the ex-commander stopped in at the U.S. Army  heliport at Yongsan on his way to the main operations meeting at  Kyeryongdae, he was said to have been comforted by some  colleague generals for his not being promoted to a major general  in the previous day's promotion changes. That is, needless to  say, because of the silence kept by the Blue House which is well  known for President Kim's ability to guard secrets better than  the military.    The next day after Yim, the newly appointed commander of the  defense security, who is the 3d-term graduate of the ROTC and is  keen and punctual like his nickname of `German soldier', took  office, he visited President Kim with Mr. Pak Kwan-yong, chief  secretary of the Blue House also attending. At that time, the  commander was said to have been instructed by President Kim to  keep special watch on unusual movements of Hanahoe members and  of graduates of the Military Academy and report to the Blue  House of any unusual occurrences.    This meant the system of the defense security commander's  direct report to the president was renewed. Therefore, Yim's  authority seems to have been expanded beyond that of  ex-Commander Kim. The system of direct reports to the president  even on the problems of the national defense minister who is  second to the president on military affairs, was established,  related persons analyzed.    As if he put such instructions into practice, five days  after  taking office, he conducted personnel changes in the command,  relieving many Military Academy graduates of their posts.    Transferred to the Defense Security Command in 1967 as a  first lieutenant, Commander Yim is a competent intelligence  officer who has mainly served at the Second (intelligence  section, abolished in the last March reorganization) and Third  (anti-Communist section) Sections. Under the Fifth Republic, he  deeply intervened in campus activities and made perfectly  logical statements even at the countermeasure meetings of the  related organizations. This style of his came in sight even in  his first personnel changes. He appointed officers other than  the Military Academy graduates to all of the important posts in  the command -- Brigadier General Song Tae-song (17th-term  graduate of the Air Force Academy, ex-section chief of the  Defense Security Command) to the post of chief of staff, Colonel  Pak Hyo-chun (military officer training center graduate,  ex-Masan Detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security  Command) to the post of first section chief (in charge of  security) and Colonel Cho Chong-ho (4th-term graduate of the  ROTC, ex-Materials and Data Management Office chief) to the post  of the 100th Detachment commanding officer of the Defense  Security in the National Defense Ministry.    On the other hand, he ordered two generals, Brigadier  General  Choe Chae-rim (23d-term graduate) ex-detachment commanding  officer of the Defense Security in the National Defense Ministry  and Brigadier General Song Hwa-yong (24th-term graduate)  ex-detachment commanding officer of the Defense Security in the  Army Headquarters, three colonels graduated from the Military  Academy including No Tok-ho (31st-term graduate, ex-detachment  deputy commanding officer of the Defense Security in the Army  Headquarters), and four senior colonels including Kim Hyon  (military officer training center graduate), to return to Army  Headquarters.    These are not all of the structure reductions of the Defense  Security Command. The Defense Security Command which made a  large-scale reform from the end of last March to the beginning  of April is undergoing a second reform under Commander Yim's  leadership. At the beginning of November, the commander  discharged from service or returned to their original units  several lieutenant colonels who had served in the command or  other detachments across the country. The same measures are  expected to be taken soon with officers below major in rank.    This year the command cut 703 persons from its  establishment,  down from 6,047 to 5,324. The command first planned to gradually  reduce approximately 400 more personnel by 1997, but the  reduction was carried out far sooner than expected. After the  new government began, the command dissolved 61 small forces of  the defense secretary which had been secretly run and annexed  them into their higher units. And it abolished the intelligence  section which was denounced for illegal intervention in politics  and inspections of civilians, and instead established a new  Materials and Data Management Office, reorganized and reduced  the structure from four sections and three offices to three  sections and four offices.    The 1994 command's budget was cut 14.4 percent from this  year's, from 37.5 billion to 32.1 billion won. A budget area  especially hard hit was the reduction of 1.8 billion won for  intelligence activities. This fact leads us to believe that the  operation of the command is being reduced. As to the role and  status of the Defense Security Command which had been the most  powerful organization in the military during the Fifth and Sixth  Republics, differences of opinions are likely.    After Commander Yim Chae-mun's structure began, the  commanding officers of the command enjoyed the confidence of the  Blue House, but the general personnel are more demoralized than  ever. Driving out the Military Academy graduates in the command  seems to be a primary factor contributing to rising  complications between the Military Academy graduates and other  officers.    A defense security officer graduated from the Military  Academy spoke frankly, "Officers in the command can be promoted  only if they serve in the headquarters, not in its subordinate  units. But in the second reform of the command, many officers  from the Military Academy were forced to return to their units  or to transfer to its subordinate units. What does this mean  except that they should be discharged from service? Although I  was frequently misunderstood and disliked while working as a  secret agent in the past, I have not regretted taking this job  as much as I do these days."    Minister Kwon Yong-hae is leading the military reform which  focuses on driving out Hanahoe and reducing the structure of the  Defense Security Command. (Most military men say that the word  `change' is more appropriate than `reform'.) Then how long will  his power really last? What is the source of the power, and in  what manner is it being exercised?    It is a firm opinion that his leadership of the military is  derived from the confidence of President Kim. First, the  President's confidence of Minister Kwon is known to be immense.  This seems to be a result of Minister Kwon's loyalty combined  with President Kim's tendency to believe in trustworthy men to  the end.    According to some in the Blue House, recently President  Kim's  view of Minister Kwon is beginning to change. Of course, his  confidence in Minister Kwon has not yet diminished. But until a  little while ago, the president's philosophy was to rely mainly  on the minister for military control, but this is said to be  gradually changing.    This is exemplified by events such as the sudden dismissal  of  Kim To-yun, ex-defense security commander, the new commander's  direct report to the Blue House, and an exclusive talk with Kim  Tong-chin, the Army Chief of the General Staff (3 November). As  stated before, the president, through changing the defense  security commander, is going to check the expanding power of  Minister Kwon and will enjoy more of the minister's loyalty and  the military brains.    But, some analyze, the change of defense security commander  may cause Minister Kwon to remain long in office. It is said to  be because the president has become confident of his control of  the military and has no man equal to Minister Kwon. In other  words, the president is said to have a plan to check Hanahoe and  the Military Academy graduates through the defense security  commander, one who has not graduated from the Military Academy,  and to carry forward the second reform of the military -- the  reasonable execution of the national defense budget and the  establishment of the future military system through Minister  Kwon's loyal work.    But Minister Kwon will know his duty well as a National  Defense Minister. It is just that he should take care of the  Army and help them perform their duties faithfully, as President  Kim promised, in observance of Armed Forces Day held in the  drill ground field at Kyeryongdae last 1 October, that he  trusted firmly in his Army and would take the lead in enhancing  their honor and dignity.    The military's discontentment with Minister Kwon up to this  point seems to stem from the minister's inability to adequately  protect them from outside influences such as the Blue House and  the political world. A colonel serving in the Joint Chiefs of  Staff said, "Everybody will recognize that although the minister  is only an ex-major general, he conducts business better and  thinks more rationally than an ex-general. But I think the  minister is an official man who has many problems to settle  politically rather than administratively. The minister did not  handle with a firmly subjective view the Hanahoe, the persons  involved in the 12 December incident, the absurd personnel  changes, and the absurdity of the Yulgok Program. The minister's  personal problems such as his brother Kwon Yong-ho's accepting  bribes from a military goods supplier and the bad rumors related  to the Yulgok Program during his tenure as vice-minister should  no longer be targets of criticism. It is urgent to prevent  unrest in the military and to stabilize them. I think this  should be the most important consideration in evaluating the  minister."    The chiefs of the general staff of the three armed services  have also changed significantly from the past. In short, they  are trying to read the minds of the minister and members of the  Blue House. They report to the minister all the military affairs  which in the past they could settle on their own. They leave  Kyeryongdae and stay in Seoul about two days a week.    Amid the circumstances, the fact that President Kim had an  exclusive talk with the Army Chief of the General Staff Kim for  the first time last 3 November is a big change. Similar talks  are expected to occur with the heads of the Navy and Air Force.  Minister Kwon may be sorry to see this happen. But, many people  think these talks are desirable because it will allow for "the  checks and balances" of the military power.    Minister Kwon is known as a man with many strengths such as  a  glib tongue, perfectly logical thinking power, and a profound  knowledge. On the other hand, he has some weak points. The most  obvious is that he does not have many reliable people around  him. According to people well acquainted with him, he had no  opportunities to make many friends around him, overpowered by  the Hanahoe's influence in the past. So he readily hired persons  with whom he had worked once or twice and in many cases, they  failed.    A typical case is Yim Chong-sop, the chief of the personnel  staff of the Army Headquarters, who was relieved of his post on  a charge of accepting a bribe in connection with a military  construction project last 8 November. Major General Yim had won  Minister Kwon's confidence during his service as an artillery  regimental commander under Minister Kwon, the then Sixth  Division commander. So, Yim had been appointed to the post of  chief of the personnel staff of the Army Headquarters to succeed  Major General Choe Sung-u (21st-term graduate) who was relieved  of this post last April by reason of his membership in the  Hanahoe.    Last 2 October, citing the special statement of Minister  Kwon, the National Defense Ministry vowed that "The Army shall  be reborn, as one which will enjoy the people's love and  confidence and carry out its original duty faithfully." "At one  time, the Army strayed from its mission of serving public  interest and justice because some groups gave priority to  regionalism, kinship, or other interests." It reflected on  itself. "The Army itself also committed bad acts by expecting or  fostering in secret uncommon human relations."    Within a month after the promotions and personnel changes of  the Army generals were completed and the wrong-doings of  suspected key post generals were exposed, some soldiers said,  "Another special statement by the minister should be made."    According to many soldiers, they do not see any changes in  the military from the past -- the military feels uneasy and even  the right of command, which is the most important factor in the  Army, seems unsettled. This is caused mainly by the frequent  personnel changes made without any firm standard.    Even this year, due to three or four sudden personnel  changes, in addition to the periodical one, soldiers say they  feel uneasy and discontented with the changes, and that sudden  changes are dangerous and has caused the military to be  discouraged. Some say, "Even if they are discharged from  service, it should be with honor and justice" or "Soldiers  discharged from the service with grudges against the military  could possibly be uneasy for the military."    With the frequent personnel changes by the new government,  the commanders of the Defense Security, the Army Education and  the Capital Corps have all changed three or four times this  year. They ask how stable can commands of units be under such  circumstances. Officers point this out because the reforms of  the military have been made impromptu, without any program. Most  officers do not want the military to be the subject of  politicians' experimentation.    According to Professor Hong Tu-sung (Sociology) of Seoul  University, last September, "the influence of the military on  our politics" is 4.85 percent, sharply down from 12.6 percent in  June 1990 and 32.3 percent in 1988. In the year 2000, less than  1.5 percent, the lowest of the power elite groups, is expected.    The competitive rate of next year's applicant for entrance  to  the Military Academy is a bit more than 4 to 1, less than that  of the average year, the lowest since the academy opened. Those  of the Naval and Air Force Academies are also, though a little  higher than the Military Academy, unprecedentedly low. The  factors which will give a sense of crisis to the military group  are drawing near more remarkably than ever.    Under such circumstances, next year's national defense  budget  is 10,490 billion won, a 9.6 percent increase over the previous  year, and will be more than 10 trillion won for the first time  in history. In the budget, operational and maintenance expenses  are 7,035.7 billion won, an 11.7 percent increase, but the  build-up expenses of new war potential show a decrease of 79  percent over the previous year.    Some people fear the day will come when such an enormous  budget will be entrusted to deteriorated career soldiers.  Military experts say that from now on, the government should  reduce the operational and maintenance expenses and divert these  funds to the modernization and specialization of the military  and the maintenance of superior manpower, and that in order to  reduce the operational and maintenance expenses, the government  should first largely unify duplicate structures in the Army,  Navy, and Air Force, and liquidate nonurgent units. Mr. Chi  Man-won (51), a commentator on the military, said, "If the  government gets rid of nonessential units and structures in the  military, it could save more than 100,000 military personnel. As  a result the government could save much in the national defense  budget. If it commits these soldiers to the industrial areas, it  could get an increase of more than three trillion won of gross  national product a year."    Many soldiers say that only if President Kim lets the  ordinary soldiers serve in the military peacefully with honor  and high morale after driving out political soldiers, will his  reform of the military succeed. If done so, nobody will object  to the notion that "the military could secure the freedom and  rights of the people and be the wheel of the cart that is loaded  with the happiness and prosperity of the people," as President  Kim said in observance of Armed Forces Day.</p>

			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Radiated soil to be removed THE GOVERNMENT is to remove soil contaminated by radiation from the Aldermaston, Berks, headquarters of Blue Circle Cement as a result of a 1989 accident at the adjoining Atomic Weapons Establishment. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister of defence procurement, said last night the contamination was 'well below levels which could cause any harm to individuals'. Ministers were first told of the contamination in April 1991. The disclosure, which followed reports that Blue Circle Cement was moving 150 employees from its headquarters, came in a response to a written question by Mr Llew Smith, Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent.</p>

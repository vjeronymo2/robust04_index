			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Rise in M0 fuels hopes of recovery A RISE in the M0 measure of money supply in December has increased expectations that the UK economy may be starting to recover. M0, which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between November and December, the Bank of England said yesterday. In the year to December, M0 growth was 3 per cent, the same as the year-on-year rise in November. That figure came after several months in which M0 growth had been depressed, reflecting low economic activity. The Treasury said Britain's underlying foreign-currency reserves fell by Dollars 2.95bn in December compared with the previous month. The overall level of the UK's reserves fell by Dollars 433m in December, bringing the total at the end of the month to Dollars 41.65bn. Most of the change in the underlying position is believed to represent D-Marks repaid last month by the the Bank of England to the Bundesbank, for currency borrowed in September in efforts to defend sterling on 'Black Wednesday'. Adding to impressions that the economic outlook may be brightening was the finding by Gallup, the market research organisation, that consumer confidence, although still depressed, rose in December compared with November. Gallup said a balance of 19 per cent of consumers last month thought the economy would worsen, as opposed to a balance of 29 per cent who felt the same the previous month. This was the most optimistic reading since August last year. M0 is considered by the Treasury to provide a good indication of demand and inflation pressures in the economy at the consumer level. The Treasury said the latest figures were encouraging. The December figure fits in with indications from retailers that shop spending picked up last month.</p>

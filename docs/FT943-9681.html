			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US trade sleuth in search of fairness - Washington's new chief investigator of commerce complains On the tennis courts, where Peter Watson relaxes when he is not cycling or running, the chairman of the International Trade Commission is known as 'a fair sport'. At his other hangout, the ITC, his reputation is much the same. He is a New Zealand-born Republican, a free trader, a former senior official on President George Bush's National Security Council, and a commission moderate. He is also known as 'a consummate politician' who is well liked by Democrats and Republicans, both being receptive when he campaigned hard for his current position. The six ITC commissioners are part judges and part sleuths. While the US commerce department determines the payment of subsidies or the existence of dumping - selling in the US at 'less than fair market value' - it is the ITC that must investigate and determine whether the dumped and subsidised goods are hurting US companies. Without a finding of injury, an unfair trade complaint goes nowhere. Although most of the executive branch is in Democratic hands for now, Mr Watson was appointed to the chairmanship in June because the office rotates between the two parties every two years and it is the Republicans' turn. The commission is designated 'nonpartisan' - no more than three members can be from one party. Mr Watson tends to be a hands-on sleuth. He can, if he chooses, lead an investigation himself, as he did when he and two other commissioners went to Canada to see for themselves the state of the wheat market. The three found that Canadian wheat exports had inflicted minimal injury on US wheat farmers, but injury nevertheless. Partly as a result of the finding, President Bill Clinton imposed only minimally intrusive quotas for one year. In an earlier study on large civil aircraft, requested by the Senate finance committee, Mr Watson and ITC vice-chairman Janet Nuzum journeyed to France to study Airbus subsidies. After meeting with officials and touring manufacturing facilities, the two concluded that government assistance gave Airbus a significant competitive advantage. As a conservative 'jurist' who believes strongly in the separation of powers in the US Constitution, Mr Watson does not see the job of commissioner as writing - or re-interpreting - law. 'What the law says is the law,' he said in a recent interview. 'You interpret it strictly and literally.' Congress is now writing 'implementing legislation' which is supposed to bring the trade laws in harmony with the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round of liberalisation talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But lobbyists and administration officials have been persuading congressional allies to slip in protectionist language with which conservative jurists will have to abide, whether or not the provisions are consistent with the multilateral rules. ITC commissioners deal with a detailed area of law which gives them little latitude for interpretation. 'There are nuances, some grey areas, but by and large we have a very regulated area of law which leaves us only a limited degree of discretion,' he said. This does not mean that Mr Watson opposes the dumping laws. Between March 1991 and March 1994, he was the only Republican to find injury more often existed than not in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. He voted affirmative on injury in 69 cases and against in 62. During the same period, the past chairman, Mr Don Newquist, widely perceived to be a protectionist, voted affirmative 96 times and negative 40. Anne Brunsdale, another past chairman, found injury 37 times and voted against relief on 95 cases. There is no single model for determining injury so the commissioners can use their own to determine if a business has been injured. 'People rightly come here expecting to have a fair hearing from independent commissioners,' Mr Watson said. 'If you don't believe in fairly and objectively applying these dumping and countervailing laws, you don't deserve to be here.' Other governments have followed the US example in developing their own 'unfair trade' regimes. As a result, laws designed to defend US companies have, at least for America's growing number of exporters, begun to seem a threat to international trade liberalisation. However, Mr Watson insists they have legitimate uses in circumstances where foreign companies are underpricing their products. 'But we all know these laws can be improved,' he said. 'I can identify areas where there are abuses . . . petitioners which use the trade laws purely as aggressive tools, rather than as a legitimate response to unfair trade practices.' Abuse of the laws can create trade distortion because many of the foreign companies involved cannot afford to pay lawyers to defend themselves, he said. Many trade lawyers have suggested doing away with the dumping and countervailing duty laws and replacing them with enhanced competition laws, such as anti-trust laws. This would require truly integrated economies with few market distortions, said Mr Watson. A number of steps would have to be taken before competition policy could approach the areas that trade policy cover, he said. First there would have to be a multinational dialogue and exchanges of information for anti-trust cases. Then the laws could be harmonised and enforcement mechanisms agreed. The process would take years. Mr Watson's term as a commissioner ends in December 2000. It is unlikely that he will work himself out of a job before that.</p>

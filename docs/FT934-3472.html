			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (9): 'Something in it for you, too' - Esops are a convenient way to give shares to employees Widening employee share ownership during a buy-out, through an employee share ownership plan (Esop), is not a priority for most buy-out teams - which may seem surprising. 'It's much easier if you can go to the employees and say, 'Well, we've bought the company, but there's something in it for you',' says Mr Mark Anderson, director of Esop and buy-out specialists New Bridge Street Consultants. The Esop provides a convenient mechanism for share distribution to employees. However, in the UK there are only 50 to 70 pure Esops, under which all employees are offered shares, according to the Esop Centre. Around 20 per cent were set up under buy-outs. Under an Esop, an employee benefit trust (EBT) is set up. It buys equity with a loan guaranteed by the company. The allocation of shares can be deferred until a time when the management has its hands less full with the buy-out. Capital and interest payments on the loan by the company are tax deductible. A profit-sharing trust (PST), in a form approved by the Inland Revenue, is often set up in tandem with the EBT, to distribute the shares. If employees hold the shares given to them by the trust for five years, income tax is not levied on them. In the 1980s, high profile private-sector buy-out involved Esops, with MFl's MBO perhaps the best known. They are no longer so prominent. 'The Esop is an additional complication, and an MBO is already a very complicated transaction,' explains Mr David Reid, tax partner and Esop specialist with solicitors Clifford Chance. Buy-outs have to be arranged in secrecy. 'The Esop is essentially a further party to the transaction.' The business climate is unfavourable. 'Esops often involve gearing, and people have cut down on that recently,' says Mr Anderson, though he adds that this is not a problem where shares are offered to the workforce at full value. It is necessary to look to the public sector to see Esops playing a more significant role in buy-outs. Service organisations with unionised workforces look on employee buy-outs as the preferred method of privatisation, and an Esop is often used to distribute shares. Port authority and bus service buy-out teams have used Esops, which are also likely to feature in rail privatisations. The biggest employee buy-out this year involving an Esop is believed by its managers to have been that of Mainline Partnership, a Pounds 50m-turnover, 880-bus company, which provides services for the Sheffield area. It was purchased from the Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority by its 2,200 staff. Shares are being allocated on the basis of length of service. Another large bus company employee buy-out with an Esop in tow is in the pipeline. Last month, Manchester Passenger Transport Authority nominated an employee team as the preferred purchaser for GM Buses South, a 2,000-employee, Pounds 50m-turnover company servicing the conurbation's southern half. 'There will be an Esop,' confirms the leader of the buy-out team and managing director designate, Mr Peter Short. 'We've been looking at a structure in outline that would involve both an EBT and a profit-sharing trust.' The ownership structure is still being discussed with funding institutions, but the aim is clear. 'The hope is that the employees will hold approaching, if not actually, 51 per cent,' says Mr Short. The deal should be concluded by the end of the year. Quadron Services is distributing shares to its 400 employees. Based in Weston-super-Mare, the Pounds 11m-plus turnover company was born this autumn out of an employee buy-out of Woodspring district council's contract services arm. It is involved in cleansing, grounds maintenance, building, leisure and catering services. A PST was not set up. The company is prepared to meet the relatively small tax liability arising on the shares on its employees' behalf. 'It's administratively easier to do it that way, given the amounts involved,' explains Mr Robin Blagburn, senior corporate finance manager at Unity Trust Bank. The bank often advises trade unions in privatisation buy-outs. Communicating the potential benefits to the workforce has not been easy. Five trade unions were involved in the buy-out negotiations. 'EBTs, Esops in themselves are complicated devices,' says Mr Mike Martin, buy-out team leader and managing director. No one group has overall control of the company. The largest portion of equity, 45 per cent, will go to the employees, while management gets 30 per cent and funding institutions the remainder. Some of the venture capitalists approached were not enthusiastic about the size of the employees' stake. 'They were interested in the concept, but not perhaps to the degree that we were interested in pursuing it,' says Mr Martin. The workers will have to purchase most of their allocation. 'We want everyone to be a stakeholder,' says Mr Martin. 'We also want them to be dipping into their own pockets, because we think that means something.' The size of the stake on offer to each employee is between Pounds 200 and Pounds 6,000 worth of shares. Mr Martin stresses that it is too early to see whether the new ownership structure will be successful. He is mindful of problems with other deals, including the outcome of last year's Pounds 31m Medway Ports buy-out. In September, a year and a half after the deal and in a more promising economic environment, the company was sold to Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. It viewed Medway as being of strategic importance and paid Pounds 104m. Three hundred dockers, who had left the company after restructuring, lost out on the bonanza, receiving Pounds 2.50 for their shares against the Pounds 37.25 they fetched nine months later. Mr Martin says that Quadron will take measures to avoid a similar situation as far as possible, including revaluation of shares at six-monthly intervals. Esops might be more popular for buy-out teams if reforms took place. Their rarity is due to the unsatisfactory nature of available structures, according to Ms Susie Hughes, director of the Esop Centre. Case-law Esops are, in theory, open to challenge by the Inland Revenue. Problems with the 1989 Finance Act's Esop include its requirement that a majority of trustees be non-director employees. The Esop Centre hopes the government will make the statutory Esop more user-friendly.</p>

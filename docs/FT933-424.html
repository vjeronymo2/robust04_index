			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television There can be only one choice tonight for Morse addicts who in Inspector Morse (C4, 8.30) are offered their last sighting of Oxford's most famous fictional inhabitant - last, that is to say, until the next season of repeats comes round to lighten our screens. Strangely enough, our farewell to the mild-mannered introspective will not be taking place against a backdrop of college quadrangles but in the brisker air of the Australian outback. It seems feeble that they could not have come up with another title for tonight's Timewatch; The Mother of All Battles (BBC2, 8.00). That was a great phrase when it fell from the lips of Saddam Hussein, redolent of a particular time, place, and culture. Now it has become just another boring journalistic cliche. The programme describes the course of what was the greatest armoured battle in history, the Battle of Kursk in the Ukraine. The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15), looks at another battle, to save the soul of Croydon, one of the south-east's least appreciated towns. A group of architects are invited to explain what they would do to make Croydon lovely.</p>

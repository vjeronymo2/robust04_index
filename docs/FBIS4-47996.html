			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi has pledged his commitment to what he terms the  development of healthy national and regional government.  Speaking at Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi said there needed to be a  constructive relationship between provincial and central  government.    His remarks are seen by observers as dispelling fears that  he  would not take part in the government of national unity, in  which it is now speculated that he may occupy one of three IFP  cabinet posts.    Dr. Buthelezi said he accepted the elections to have been  sufficiently fair and free, and he commended Mr. Nelson Mandela  and Mr. F. W. de Klerk for their efforts to establish democracy  in South Africa.</p>

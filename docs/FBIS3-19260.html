			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "heb": "Only on `Probation'"] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Government revealed its arrogance of  power not by arresting people who think differently but by  voicing one sentence. Wei Jingsheng is only a "criminal who has  been released on probation," the government spokesman said  during a visit to China by the U.S. secretary of state.    The disgust about such lies is part of the routine of  foreign  observers of China. On the other hand, arrests at night,  threats, and long prison terms for some of them are "routine"  for China's small group of dissidents, who are, however,  becoming more active again. One became all the more conscious  of that during Christopher's visit. Before, during, and after  his visit there have been arrests, sentences, and torture in  China.    If human rights were a topic like any other, Beijing would  have won on points with its rebuff of Washington. The U.S.  Administration must accept the accusation of once again having  weakened its pressure concerning human rights with "mixed  signals": While Christopher is talking about human rights, a  high-ranking U.S. military officer is in China to negotiate  about "military cooperation."    However, human rights are too serious an issue to leave them  solely to the diplomats. Courageous Chinese, human rights  organizations, "criminals released on probation," and others  will have to continue their struggle for human rights also after  the spectacle involving the extension of the most-favored-nation  clause. This time, if at all, Beijing will be released only "on  probation."</p>

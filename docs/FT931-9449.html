			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: General dismay turns to General glee - Wall Street 'A BILLION here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.' Senator Everett Dirksen, a prominent Republican senator during the 1960s, might have been talking about government spending but his sarcasm echoed down the canyons of Wall Street this week after General Motors and Ford announced collective annual losses for 1992 of more than Dollars 30bn. The majority of the lost billions is not 'real' money in the normal sense, though. GM reported a Dollars 23.5bn deficit, the largest in US corporate history; but excluding the billions in special non-cash charges taken to cover changes in the accounting of medical benefits, the auto-maker actually was in reasonable shape last year. For the fourth quarter, it actually made a profit of Dollars 273m - a significant turnaround for the troubled Detroit behemoth which, in the same quarter last year, lost Dollars 520m. Investors were delighted by the improvements in operating earnings, especially the rebound in GM's cash flow. In fact, this past week must rank as one of the best in GM's recent history. It opened with a host of negative newspaper stories about the previous week's decision by a jury to award Dollars 101m in punitive damages to the parents of a 17-year-old who died in a fiery crash in a GM pickup truck. The company's decision to appeal the ruling, and to step up its fight against charges that some of its trucks are dangerous because of badly-placed petrol tanks, was criticised widely as ill-judged and risky. By midweek, however, morale at GM was soaring after a devastating attack on the television network NBC, which last year ran a documentary about the controversial pickups and their allegedly deadly petrol tank design. Filing suit against the network, GM argued persuasively that NBC had rigged a televised test accident to show the explosive effect of a side-on collision. On Wednesday, NBC offered a fulsome apology for the rigged accidents. Within two days, GM was reporting its better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. By the end of the week, GM stock had jumped 9 per cent in value to more than Dollars 41. While GM was bouncing back from adversity, Ford was also enjoying some rare positive publicity. Despite a slightly disappointing fourth quarter, sales of its cars and trucks in the US were up last year and its share of the domestic market also was higher. However, like GM and other big US corporations, Ford had to take a big charge to cover accounting changes which, on top of the cost of a major restructuring of its European operations, left it with a 1992 loss of Dollars 7.4bn. The billions were being thrown about liberally elsewhere among the country's corporate elite (or former elite) this week. Sears, Roebuck said on Thursday that it will spend Dollars 4bn over the next five years upgrading its 800 stores as part of the plan, announced last year, to return to its roots as a retailer. Investors welcomed the facelift, along with details of Sears' proposed disposal of the Coldwell Banker property subsidiary and the Dean Witter brokerage unit, and the retailer's stock rose by Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 1/8 . While some of the nation's biggest corporate names were enjoying a good week, the overall market picture darkened somewhat. By midday yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which only a week ago reached an all-time closing high of 3,442.14, was struggling to hold its head above 3,400. Nothing specific had triggered the setback, save for some typical post-rally profit-taking and consolidation. But a slight uneasiness could be detected on Wall Street about the previous week's advances - a feeling that the markets may have been pushed too far, too early. The recent rise in the Dow, and the more spectacular gains in the wider and secondary markets, have been built on a growing confidence that, in his first year, almost everything that can go right for President Clinton will go right. If the pace of economic growth (helped by a fiscal stimulus package) continues to accelerate; if the Clinton administration manages to push deficit-reduction measures through Congress; if inflation remains dormant; if domestic interest rates stay low; if the dollar remains competitive on foreign markets; if consumer confidence stays on its upward course; and if the corporate restructuring and cost-cutting of 1990-1992 continues to pay off dividends, then the recent surge in demand for stocks will have been justified. That, however, as many investors realised this week, is a lot of ifs.  ------------------------------------ Monday        3437.54  -   04.60 Tuesday       3414.58  -   22.96 Wednesday     3412.42  -   02.16 Thursday      3422.69  +   10.27 Friday        3392.43  -   30.26  ------------------------------------</p>

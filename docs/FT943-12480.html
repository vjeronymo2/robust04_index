			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Brussels reins in plans for more EU job laws: Emphasis on consolidation will please UK The European Commission will this week agree to rein in the launch of further initiatives in EU-wide employment law, in an approach that will find favour with the UK government. Instead of pushing ahead with fresh directives, new emphasis will be placed on ensuring proper implementation of what has already been passed. This is one of the central planks of the European Union white paper on social policy, drawn up by Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, and due to be endorsed by the Commission on Wednesday. 'A lot of progress has been made over the past 18 months and we do not think it is relevant to come forward with a new legislative agenda,' said one of Mr Flynn's senior aides at the weekend. The UK has been the most hostile of the 12 EU states to the growth of European employment legislation, such as the recent directives regulating working time and young people at work. The UK government will, however, welcome a new initiative to create greater mobility for workers within the EU. The white paper is expected to recommend creation of a high-level European Commission working party, with the aim of breaking down continuing barriers to mobility, especially in occupational pensions. On the implementation of employment legislation, where the UK has a good record, special emphasis will be placed on encouraging southern European countries, such as Greece, to put into practice health and safety legislation already approved at EU level. The UK government will not, however, support everything in the white paper. The Commission is expected to emphasise that if no agreement can be reached by the end of the year on key employment directives, such as that on the rights of part-time workers, negotiations will be transferred from the political level to EU trade union and employer groups. The current German presidency of the EU is eager to reach an EU-wide deal giving part-time workers equal rights, and even equal pay on a pro rata basis, as part of its campaign to boost part-time employment in Germany. But the UK government is almost certain to block an agreement, which would open up the possibility that the issue will be dealt with by the 11 other EU states in their 'social protocol'. Other points that the social policy white paper is expected to raise include: EU-wide legislation outlawing race discrimination. Although all individual states have such legislation, those who have been the victims of discrimination while travelling from one state to another have found it difficult to get justice. An action programme on equality between the sexes, concentrating on making it easier to share child-rearing duties through provisions such as career breaks and part-time work. Greater convergence of social security systems.</p>

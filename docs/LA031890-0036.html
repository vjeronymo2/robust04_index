			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THE GREEN TEAM;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS COMBINE SKILLS TO DEVELOP DROUGHT-RESISTANT PLANTS  </P> <P> Horticultural geneticists and plant enzymologists seldom talk to each other.  The two branches of botany use the same language but their dialects are so  different they rarely translate works to compare notes.  </P> <P> But at Texas Tech's Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab, scientists from a  number of disciplines have learned to speak a common language: drought.  </P> <P> "Most enzymologists talk only with enzymologists," said James Mahan, a plant  physiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "But here, I talk to all  sorts of different people. That's why this interdisciplinary approach is so  important."  </P> <P> The lab's goal is to find varieties of wheat, corn, cotton, onions and other  plants that can survive the harsh weather of the Great Plains stretching from  Canada to Texas, with its frequent drought, bitter cold and stifling heat.  </P> <P> The results include drought-resistant cotton and wheat, a sorghum resistant to  insects called midges, and grapevines with tougher leaves to withstand hail.  </P> <P> Although it focuses on U.S. crops and conditions, the research has  international implications, said Robert Albin, associate dean of research at  Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Sciences. "In Lubbock, we're  representative of the arid and semiarid areas of the world, such as central and  western Africa. A large part of the world's land surface is semiarid."  </P> <P> John Burke, another USDA scientist studying plant enzymes, said almost all the  research has international applications: "These crops are grown throughout the  world. This research holds true no matter where you are."  </P> <P> Burke works with Ellen Peffley, a Texas Tech assistant professor of  horticulture specializing in onion genetics. She is trying to develop onions  that can withstand extreme cold. Burke identifies enzymes that make onions more  cold-hardy, and Peffley tries to get the onions to make those enzymes.  </P> <P> "As we discover the basic mechanics, this can be applied to all crop species,"  she said.  </P> <P> More than 50 scientists and graduate students from Texas Tech, the USDA and  Texas A&amp;M participate in the research at various labs and agriculture  stations; there is no centralized lab -- a major shortcoming that Texas Tech is  moving to counter with a $500,000 federal grant toward planning a $17-million  complex.  </P> <P> "It gets to be quite complicated and we have to keep people together and  coordinated," Albin said. "We're in such a specialized area of research. You  might have a molecular scientist discover something important, but he doesn't  know how to grow the plant, so you have the A&amp;M research station for that.  </P> <P> "We've got to keep coordination in mind. A geneticist might get caught up  transferring gene A into plant B and lose sight of what it's all about."  </P> <P> Congress formally created the Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab in 1988,  but the research had been going on at Texas Tech since the late 1950s. The USDA  picked Lubbock as the center of the research because of the university, the  lack of rain, and temperatures that drop below zero in winter and soar above  100 in summer.  </P> <P> Scientists affiliated with the lab are enthusiastic, although they sometimes  are at a loss for words to explain their research in lay terms -- or in those  of scientists from other fields.  </P> <P> "We have some sort of common goal in mind," said Henry Nguyen, a Tech associate  professor who specializes in finding drought-resistant cereals. "We see how we  can mutually benefit each other with our kinds of techniques.  </P> <P> "It just takes a lot of patience talking, until we understand what each other  is doing."  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Romania's premier deals stronger hand ROMANIA'S prime minister, Mr Petre Roman, yesterday replaced nearly half his cabinet in anattempt to bring new blood into the government to maintain the pace of reforms. 'The course of events, both legislative, economic and social, had worn down some members,' Mr Roman told parliament, adding that greater adaptability to 'fast change' was now needed. Several of the ministers who were replaced had complained privately about the difficulty of controlling large, bureaucratic ministries. The reshuffle is a thus a clear sign that the government is determined to place strong personalities in those ministries which bear the burdenof the reforms. The key changes include the transfer of Mr Victor Stanculescu, defence minister, to the industry ministry, which is responsible for negotiating the bulk of the partially liberalised prices. Mr Stanculescu was economics minister in the first two months after the December revolution. He was then appointed defence minister, specifically to quash the emergence of rival factions. The Finance Ministry, led until yesterday by Mr Teodor Stolojan, will be merged with the Economics Ministry. It will continue to be headed by Mr EugenDijmarescu, a close associate of Mr Roman, and a key player in designing the whole reform package. Mr Roman also stressed the need for opposition forces to 'share the responsibilities for the transition period'. He appointed three ministers from outside the ruling National Salvation Front, none of whom, however, is thought to be representative of the opposition. The Labour Ministry will be headed by Mr Mihnea Marmeliuc, a member of the pre-1946 National Liberal party. The Public Works Ministry will be led by Mr Dinu Patriciu, labour minister in the interim government and a member of the secessionist youth wing of the National Liberal party. Mr Valeriu Pescaru, of the Agrarian Party, will take charge of land privatisation within the Agriculture Ministry.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Textile recession leaves Parkland Pounds 3.6m in red THE RECESSION in the textile industry claimed another victim yesterday when Parkland, the Yorkshire-based wool textile group, announced a Pounds 5.64m downturn to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.6m for the year ended March 1 1991. The group was hit by the dramatic drop in the wool price as well as by the depressed demand for textiles. The loss equalled 43.3p per share (earnings 23.9p on pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.04m), and the final dividend is cut to 1p (4.5p) for a total of 2.5p (6.7p). Mr Paul Hanson, deputy chief executive, said the group had experienced a 'very difficult' year. The domestic and export markets were very weak and the fall in the wool price - which left Parkland with over-priced wool stocks - was 'the final straw'. Turnover fell to Pounds 50.71m (Pounds 55.8m) and the group incurred an operating loss of Pounds 1.14m (profits of Pounds 1.85m). The group paid Pounds 351,000 (credit of Pounds 193,000) in interest on year-end gearing of 20 per cent. The loss on wool stocks and rationalisation costs produced an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.11m. Extraordinary costs of Pounds 159,000 were also incurred because of the impact of the Gulf war on the Middle East export business. The ordinary shares slipped by 2p to 143p on the announcement yesterday. The 'A' shares also fell by 2p to 91p. Mr Hanson said the group had 'dug deep' in its cost cutting by accelerating the closure of two clothing factories and one weaving mill as its modernised plants came on stream. The workforce was reduced from 1,800 to 1,450 during the year. He said trading conditions were still tough, but there were some signs of slight improvement in the knitwear market and the cloth market had 'levelled off'.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> RACE FOCUSES ON CONTROL OF COUNCIL  </P> <P> West Hollywood voters are getting a flurry of last-minute mailers, phone calls  and hand-delivered flyers as nine City Council candidates make their final  pitches for votes for Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> With three seats up for grabs, voters will determine a majority on the  five-member council, which has been dominated by the Campaign for Economic  Survival, architect of the city's rent control ordinance, since incorporation  in 1984.  </P> <P> But with no other pressing issues, many observers expect the turnout among the  city's 20,000 voters to be low.  </P> <P> CES-backed candidate John Heilman is the only incumbent in the race; council  members Helen Albert and Steve Schulte decided not to seek reelection. Heilman,  who has served on the council since incorporation, and fellow CES-backed  candidate Babette Lang, 77, are running a joint campaign and are considered  front-runners.  </P> <P> Also expected to make strong showings are Sal Guarriello, 71, who is backed by  CES but has run a separate campaign; Steve Martin, 35, an attorney who is  backed by Schulte, and Robert K. Davis, 44, a swimming pool contractor with  strong support on the east side.  </P> <P> Other candidates include John O'Brien, 41, a gay activist; the Rev. John W.  VonDouris, 44, a member of the United Lesbian and Gay Christian Scientists;  John C. (Jack) Reilly, 55, a retired teacher, and Jim Sorkin, 37, an actor and  house painter.  </P> <P> Campaign contributions for the filing period ending in March showed that  Heilman had raised $17,809, Lang $11,370, Martin $24,469, Guarriello $15,939,  and Davis $11,548. Reilly reported no contributions. None of the other  candidates had filed papers that are required for contributions over $1,000.  </P> <P> A political action committee for the American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees' Local 3339, the union representing the city's 90 workers,  reported raising $3,700 in contributions to support three candidates it  endorsed: Guarriello, Martin and Lang.  </P> <P> Throughout much of the campaign, Heilman has been criticized by other  candidates for being pro-development and for supporting a failed referendum in  November on construction of a $23-million Civic Center in West Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Martin also criticized Heilman for approving a deal with hotelier Severyn  Ashkenazy that allowed Ashkenazy to convert 200 apartments to hotel rooms in  exchange for paying the city $250,000 a year for 20 years to replace the lost  housing and guaranteeing not to evict about 40 tenants.  </P> <P> And Martin and other candidates have attacked Lang's position as a  tenant-rights advocate because she has owned apartment buildings; a Martin  mailer accused Lang of being a slumlord. "She is a former real estate  speculator and slumlord," Martin said when asked about the mailer.  </P> <P> Lang, a practicing psychologist, said she was once a landlord but added: "I am  absolutely outraged. This is the biggest pack of lies that I have ever heard.  We ran good, clean buildings. We didn't gouge the tenants and we were not  slumlords."  </P> <P> She said the buildings were never cited for health code violations and were  sold seven years ago. "The experience of being a landlord gave me a better  perspective on the issues involving tenants and made me a stronger supporter of  renters' rights."  </P> <P> Heilman and Lang, in their first mailer last month, accused Martin of being  "the landlord's No. 1 candidate." The mailer accused Martin of writing an  article opposing rent control in a landlord's magazine in October, 1984.  Martin, who serves on the rent stabilization commission along with Lang and  Guarriello, denies ever writing the article, which was published under his  byline.  </P> <P> Two mailers by the AFSCME local attacking Heilman sparked criticism of the  union's leaders by city workers who accused their union of acting without  consulting the rank and file. The union, which has accused Heilman of being  pro-management, raised dues last year with the goal of taking a more active  role in the election.  </P> <P> But union members last week protested their leadership's support of a slate of  candidates, including Guarriello, whose campaign is being managed by a union  vice president. A petition protesting the endorsements was signed by 54  members, more than half the local. Guarriello said the union's actions were  being orchestrated by Heilman supporters and CES, which was not pleased with  his recent attacks on Heilman. Guarriello later apologized for comments against  CES, one of his major supporters, saying that "in the heat of my current  political campaign, I made a remark . . . that I regret."  </P> <P> Despite his CES endorsement, Guarriello, a retired insurance agent, has been  campaigning against the current council, including Heilman. "There has been too  much development in the city and it has to be slowed down," he said.  </P> <P> Davis has accused the city of not doing enough to revitalize the east end of  town, where he draws much of his support. He accused the city of trying to  "trash" the east side by putting a shelter for the homeless on La Brea Avenue.  "They're trying to litter the city with vagrants, derelicts and drug addicts,"  said Davis, who has called for the creation of more affordable housing in the  city.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Heilman and Lang's most recent mailer saying that they are the  only candidates in the race openly opposed to gambling has sparked another  controversy, including criticism that they accepted money from supporters of  legalized gambling who want to put a gambling club in the city.  </P> <P> Jerry Gould, general manager of the West Hollywood Club, also known as the  Cavendish, said he wrote checks to Lang, Guarriello, Heilman and Martin.  </P> <P> But all four candidates say they do not support legalized gambling and deny  that they received checks from Gould. They each said they would not accept his  contributions had he made one.  </P> <P> "He knows who the candidates are who are ahead, so he is going to try to give  money to everyone," Heilman said. "They are trying to buy their way into the  city. Well, he can take his money and shove it."  </P></p>

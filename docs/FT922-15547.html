			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Fellini provides a stage for party without stars BY LAUNCHING its campaign for the Italian elections with a three-day convention in the film studios of Rome's Cinecitta with Federico Fellini as patron, the small Republican Party took the risk of looking too big for its boots. Against the back-drop of a flashy set, the Republicans, who have always prided themselves as a minority centre-left party backed by the cream of business and the intellectual elite, analysed Italy's ills and called loudly for institutional reform and tough economic management. Yet with only four days before Italians vote in general elections on Sunday, the pretensions of the Republicans and their leader, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, appear to have paid off. Alone among the traditional parties, the Republicans have come through the campaign confident of substantially increasing their vote. Commentators suggest the party could get up to 7 per cent of the vote, perhaps more, doubling their poor performance in the 1987 general elections. This may still appear a small percentage but in a fragmented political arena it would be more than sufficient to convert Mr La Malfa and the Republicans into key players determining the nature of the next coalition government. At 52, and an economist educated at Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he has finally emerged from the political shadow of his late father, Ugo, who dominated the party for 30 years, casting it in the role of 'the honest conscience of government'. He has exploited the party's 'clean' image and enjoyed a sympathetic press from the most influential newspapers. His calls for institutional change and the need for competent economic management have struck a chord in the north among disillusioned Christian Democrats, former Communists, and especially Socialists in the latter's stronghold of Milan as a result of corruption scandals. His party has been the only one to gather together a panel of distinguished economists to prescribe how Italy should face the daunting task of implementing the EC's summit agreement at Maastricht. The greatest compliment paid to Mr La Malfa's increased political weight has been the way leading Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians have chosen to attack him. They know he has been poaching supporters and acquiring a higher profile. The Christian Democrats and Socialists also feel a sense of betrayal at the way this natural partner in government has gone against them: the Republicans have been present in 23 of the 50 governments Italy has had since 1945. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister, has not forgiven Mr La Malfa for removing Republican support when he was trying to form a new government last April. Although Mr La Malfa walked out in high dudgeon in a seemingly petty row over portfolio allocations, the decision has subsequently been presented as a careful tactical move to distance himself from a discredited government. This distancing act enabled the Republicans to avoid being tainted by the failures of the past legislature and present themselves either as an opposition, or as a repository of votes for those who wish the party to influence a future coalition. Mr La Malfa said he would only back the next government if it were composed of technicians committed to carry out a clear programme of reforms.</p>

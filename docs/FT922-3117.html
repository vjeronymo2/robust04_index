			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / EC should relinquish powers to member states, says Brittan THE EUROPEAN Commission should propose handing certain centralised powers back to European Community member-states to demonstrate that the commission is not 'a body wanting power for its own sake', Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for competition, said yesterday. Trying to stem the tide against the Maastricht treaty, Sir Leon suggested that he and his fellow members on the EC executive should ask the Council of Ministers to repeal legislation 'where it has gone too far or has achieved its original purpose and is no longer needed'. Last week's Danish referendum rejecting the treaty has led to growing scepticism about European union and highlighted particularly the question of how much power should be vested in community institutions. However, Sir Leon, who was speaking in Florence, had only two pieces of legislation to propose for possible repeal. He suggested that EC norms on drinking water had served their purpose by 'raising consciousness and acting as a catalyst' and could now be handed over to national parliaments to supervise and maybe amend. He also questioned whether the common EC passports were necessary. The speech was the first time a commissioner has gone beyond urging legislative self-restraint on Brussels to propose a repeal of redundant EC laws and rules. The speech also shows the increasing feeling in Brussels, as well as in Britain - which takes over the Council of Ministers' presidency from Portugal next month - that the only way to save the Maastricht treaty may be by emphasising 'subsidiarity', or states' rights. In the run-up to the Danish referendum, Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, had been casting around in the environmental field for a way of proving his belief in subsidiarity. But he failed to come up with a solid proposal in time to influence Danish opinion. Sir Leon said that he was responding to the widespread feeling that the community was a one-way-street, constantly funnelling power towards the centre.</p>

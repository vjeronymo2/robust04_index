			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Major squares up to social chapter challenge THE GOVERNMENT embarked on a high-risk strategy to outflank Tory opponents of the Maastricht treaty last night by meeting head on a Labour challenge for an explicit vote by MPs on Britain's exclusion of the social chapter. Mr John Major signalled a new effort to speed up the pace of the legislation when he agreed to a Labour demand to make final ratification contingent on a separate debate on the opt-out from its social provisions. Amid chaotic scenes in the House of Commons, the decision was immediately followed by an embarrassing, if temporary, retreat by the government on the bill's timetable. The opposition failed to reverse a decision by Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, to block a vote on an earlier amendment covering the social chapter. Under the Byzantine procedures of Westminster, the second proposed change to the bill - known as amendment 27 - is seen by Labour and by Tory Euro-sceptics as their strongest hope of derailing the ratification process. Labour responded to Mr Morris's ruling with a tactical device that forced the government to curtail debate on the legislation until next week. It said the government's failure to muster enough votes against the move demonstrated that it was no longer in control of the Commons. Mr Major's decision not to contest the first Labour amendment - known as new clause 75 - means MPs will have the opportunity to vote later in the summer on whether they want to preserve the social-chapter opt-out. That vote, though, will come only after the Maastricht bill has passed all its parliamentary hurdles and received royal assent. The timing left ministers free to float the possibility - fiercely rejected by the opposition parties - that at this late stage in the ratification process the government might simply ignore a defeat and press on regardless. Senior ministers said their aim in accepting the new clause 75 was to 'disentangle' the social chapter from the wider issue of whether Britain should ratify Maastricht. They admitted the underlying strategy was to detach the Tory Euro-sceptics from their alliance with the opposition parties. The judgment in Downing Street is that even the strongest opponents of the treaty on the Tory back benches will not be able to back inclusion of the social chapter once the rest of the treaty has been enacted into law. Mr Major's aides refused to speculate on what course the government would take if the Conservative Euro-sceptics did combine with the opposition to include the social chapter. Senior ministers voiced confidence that the present committee stage of legislation would now be completed within weeks - possibly as early as next week, when MPs will debate it on three days. The government would then be free to start its shorter final stage in the Commons immediately after the Danish referendum next month. Royal assent would follow before the summer recess at the end of July. Optimism in Downing Street that the prime minister is now poised for a breakthrough in his 18-month battle to secure ratification was dismissed by Labour. Mr George Robertson, the opposition spokesman on Europe, said Labour was determined to press its case for a vote on amendment 27 when the legislation reached its report stage. He insisted that the case for such a vote was 'unanswerable'. Parliament, Page 12</p>

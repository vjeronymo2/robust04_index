Addressing the reception, Kim Yong-nam, Politburo member of  the WPK Central Committee and vice-premier of the Administration  Council and foreign minister, said Comrade Fidel Castro visited  Korea and had a significant meeting with the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song, and this was a realisation of the  long-cherished ardent desire of the peoples of the two countries  who were fighting in the same trench of the common struggle  against imperialism and for independence and socialism, and a  historical event that developed the traditional Korea-Cuba  relations of friendship and cooperation to a new high level.    Noting that the Cuban people are accelerating socialist  construction, successfully frustrating the U.S. imperialists'  manoeuvrings to isolate and seal off Cuba, under the  revolutionary slogan "Let us defend the motherland, revolution  and the gains of socialism!", he said the Korean people extend  firm solidarity to the Cuban people in their cause of justice.    He stressed the party and people of Korea will advance  shoulder to shoulder with the Cuban party and people along the  straight road to victory of socialism for ever.    Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona, Cuban ambassador to Korea, in  his address said "Comrade Fidel's visit to the DPRK, the first  of its kind in the history of Cuba, was a realisation of the  cherished desire of our comrade supreme commander to personally  visit heroic Korea and spend supreme days with Comrade President  Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people."    He underlined the excellent bonds of friendship and unity  existing between the governments and peoples of the two  countries that are defending socialism under so difficult  conditions.    He added that unquestioned support for Korea's cause of  reunification is the first and foremost political activity of  Cuba and it will be always invariable.</p>

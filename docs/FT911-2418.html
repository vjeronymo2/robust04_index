			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Peruvian banking and finance liberalised by new law THE Peruvian financial system is to be shaken up in favour of market forces after the first big change in the country's banking law for 60 years. The new law, promulgated last week by President Alberto Fujimori, lets financial institutions to set their own interest rates and reopens the country to foreign banks. It also lets public sector companies become clients of private banks. This has been well received in general by local banks, finance institutions and insurance companies. In an attempt to curb the parallel or informal banks which have mushroomed in Peru over the past few years, the law gives banks, finance and insurance houses three months to constitute themselves as limited companies or co-operatives. Institutions will have, however, two years to meet the minimum capital requirements under the new regulations. The new law curbs the power of the Central Reserve Bank. It will no longer fix interest rates. They will be determined by the market, with the BCR setting a top limit.</p>

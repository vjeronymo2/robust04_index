			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Dances of death - Jackie Wullschlager surveys new theatre in Paris THE NEW Paris theatre season has had an early, surprise star in Mortadela, which suggests a slice of charcuterie but is about death, desire, fleshiness. It is the most irresistibly sexy show in town, a home-spun musical of one man's memories whose character and warmth not only thrill the soul but throw into relief the refined heartlessness of Paris national theatre. Mortadela, at La Cigale in Montmartre, and another powerful music drama, Zarzuela, nearby at the Bouffes du Nord, suggests that the pulse of Paris theatre is beating not in the premiere arrondissement but in the raffish outer districts. At La Cigale, an old cafe chantant or musical, Alfredo Arias' review of his Argentinian youth celebrates the tango in its heyday and is a bittersweet evocation of the women from his past. Some dance their way into his memory by erotic display, like Cecilia Rosetto in 'Banana' who seduces astonished men in the audience with peeled bananas plucked from her thighs or head-dress; the male emcee responds with drag pastiche in bikini and tropical fruit. Others move to the rhythm of sexual domination and submission; one woman beats a rope on the floor as she dances to the pace of a low-toned conga drum while another just out of reach writhes in coils of fear and invitation. Whirlwind tangos, jaunty cha-chas, offset sadder boleros and chansons while an accordion wails notes of sorrow and displacement. Never far off is the dance of death: trompe l'oeil exchange of a doll for acrobatic dwarf actress Pilar Rebollar, apparently dashed to the ground in a family row; a butcher, murdering his unfaithful wife with a meat knife, elaborates the macabre title. Most of Arias' numbers, as well as his performers, come from the music halls of Buenos Aires and they sing and dance with a passion and romance of exiles recreating a lost world: throaty, tender, lustful, desperate. The show's life-is-a-cabaret mood is raw yet slick - in songs, satiric monologues, legwork, the pattern of pumps and stilettos on the ground. Few musicals exhilarate with the kitsch glitz of purple roses and torso-hugging velvet while wearing a vulnerable heart so openly on their sleeves. The French term for play or performance, spectacle, hints at the spirit not only of French music hall and its Montmartre traditions but also of straight French drama, which is far more likely to include song and dance routines than its English or German counterparts. Caligula, which opened at the Comedie Francaise earlier this year, is a brilliant example of dance illuminating themes in a complex work through sensual power and provocative display. But too often a play degenerates into a mindless spectacle of formal kicks and tuneless squeaks, which is the catastrophe of the Comedie Francaise's newest production, Lermontov's Bal Masque. Like Mortadela, this is a dance of death, but the contrast could not be greater. Lermontov's tale of revenge via Russian aristocratic traditions - gambling, masked balls, wife-poisoning, duels (Lermontov, aged 27, was killed in one) - is enacted by puppet figures in black and white, masked, some encased in porcelain heads like 19th century dolls, who progress by candlelight to their doom. Solemn music recalls a funeral march; passionless dialogue is spat out in the kind of sharp glacial French, only heard on this stage, which could cut crystal. Director Anatoli Vassiliev has achieved a sculptural beauty which awes for perhaps 10 minutes; he leaves his ghostly tableau on stage for three-and-a-half slow motion hours. There is no interval. Here is the Comedie Francaise at its most degenerate. For decades it has lived on inflated reputation and mystique bolstered by the French press. The classical virtues it cultivated have been pushed to such extremes that they have turned decadent. Productions are lumbering, absolutely unemotional. Actors move with an authoritarian chic which is stuffy and posey, and speak in a cut glass monotone which renders all reactions the same. In particular productions by Vassiliev, the Comedie Francaise's celebrated director Antoine Vitez, and actor-director Jean-Luc Boutte, who here plays the vengeful hero Arbenine as a deadly robot, are marked by a cold intelligence which assures unity of tone, set, costumes but innoculates against force, tenderness, passion. Unless original shows of the calibre of Chahine's Caligula - disliked by critics, but playing to packed houses - continue to join the repertory, the Comedie Francaise risks decline into self parody. Across the river, Paris's second serious national theatre, the Theatre L'Europe, could attract the brightest and best of European directors but has wasted the last year in an almost exclusive 'cycle hispanique' of obscure plays in Spanish and Catalan made intelligible to French audiences by surtitles. Its home productions have been mixed - most successful was Patrice Chereau doing Botho Strauss; most dismal Peter Zadek's Measure for Measure spoken by a cast which barely seems to understand its lines. And for all the Spanish enthusiasm, the most exciting French/Spanish work now touring Europe is Alain Maratrat's feisty, moving spectacle Zarzuela, which I reviewed at its Vienna premiere, and which has come to Peter Brook's cavernous Bouffes du Nord theatre. Highlights to come in the Autumn Arts Festival emphasise the growing importance and daring of the suburban theatres which form a classy outer ring round Paris, and it is here, and in venues like the unfashionable Cigale that the future of Paris theatre looks most promising.</p>

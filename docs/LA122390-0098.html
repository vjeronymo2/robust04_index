			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIONS WIN, PUT PACKERS INTO PLAYOFF FREEZER  </P> <P> The Detroit Lions left the Green Bay Packers out in the cold Saturday. And out  of the NFL playoffs.  </P> <P> Barry Sanders ran six yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 3:37 left and Ray  Crockett returned a fumble recovery for another score in the fourth quarter as  the Lions beat the Packers, 24-17, in the coldest game at Lambeau Field since  the 1967 "Ice Bowl."  </P> <P> The Packers (6-9) lost their fourth in a row and were eliminated from  contention for the third NFC wild-card spot. The Lions, already out of the  playoff picture, also are 6-9.  </P> <P> Game-time temperature was two degrees, with winds of 23 m.p.h. That resulted in  a wind-chill of minus-28.  </P> <P> "Once you're out there, no matter how much you put on, you're still cold. You  try to block it out, but you can't," said Crockett, who ended Green Bay's final  threat with an interception.  </P> <P> Crockett's freak 22-yard fumble return with 10:42 left tied the score, 17-17.  Green Bay's Ed West caught a pass, but the ball popped into the air after he  hit the ground. Crockett caught the ball before it hit the ground and ran in  for the touchdown.  </P> <P> "It bounced off his body," Crockett said. "I didn't know whether it was an  interception or a fumble, but I knew it was a live ball."  </P> <P> Green Bay's Michael Haddix fumbled at the Detroit 26 with 7:32 left and  Detroit's Chris Spielman recovered. Sanders, who carried 19 times for 133  yards, then ran 37 yards to the Packers' 13. Three plays later, he sprinted  around the right side for the go-ahead touchdown.  </P> <P> "I've played in snow, but it wasn't this cold," said Sanders, who took over the  league rushing lead from San Diego's Marion Butts. "I thought we did a great  job of keeping team morale up. We anticipated it being cold, but not this cold.  We knew were in for a freezer."  </P> <P> Third-string quarterback Blair Kiel, making his second NFL start in six  seasons, moved Green Bay to the Lions' 14 in the closing minutes. But Crockett  intercepted with 1:51 remaining to end the threat.  </P> <P> "I really thought we were going to score on that last drive," said Kiel, who  completed 20 of 36 passes for 239 yards. "The field was very icy in the middle,  but we can't use that as an excuse. We just did not do it -- again."  </P> <P> The Packers, who failed to make the playoffs last season despite a 10-6 record,  are out again.  </P> <P> "We will probably end up 6-10 and that's very disappointing," Green Bay Coach  Lindy Infante said. "But really we should not even be considered for a spot  because we are not playing all that well at this time."  </P> <P> Darrell Thompson's 76-yard kickoff return to open second-half gave Green Bay a  14-7 lead, which was cut to 14-10 by Eddie Murray's 22-yard field goal. Chris  Jacke's 25-yard field goal with 12 seconds left in the third quarter put the  Packers ahead, 17-10.  </P></p>

These proposals, that are based on results already  achieved within the Commonwealth, cover the following main  areas: Establishing the mechanisms for an economic alliance;  ensuring human rights and the rights of minorities throughout  the CIS, and creating mechanisms to guarantee these rights;  restoring cultural, scientific, and educational ties between the  Commonwealth countries; creating a unified humanitarian space;  shaping an effective system of collective security, with the  stress on peacekeeping functions; developing practical  mechanisms of the CIS to prevent armed conflicts; ensuring  greater effectiveness for joint action by members of the  Commonwealth in the foreign-political sphere in the development  of cooperation between the CIS, the United Nations, the CSCE,  and other international organizations.    The corresponding ministries and departments will take part  in drawing up these proposals. The Foreign Ministry also  intends to draw in the representatives of scientific circles and  public organizations. These proposals will be submitted to the  Russian leadership, and then Russia, as the current chairman of  the CIS, will table them for examination by the other  Commonwealth member states.

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Jobs: Wanted, way to escape the grinder - Professionals stumped by problem of how to break out of self-sustaining downward spiral IF there's any other group of people anywhere with a better stock of work experience than Jobs-column readers, I've yet to hear of it. So you are probably Anna Greenwood's best hope of finding a solution to a problem which, although all too common in working life even at pretty senior levels, is an extremely knotty one. Brought to her by someone met via her job as a clinical psychologist in Yorkshire, it concerns a seemingly guaranteed way in which a new boss can grind down and drive out a disliked but previously proficient subordinate. The process has four stages, the first of which is enigmatic because it might simply amount to unwittingly bad management. But if it's allowed to go on long, the results - being foreseeable - might just as well be intended. It begins when the boss takes to keeping detailed watch on the staff-member's work, obviously looking for errors. Accompanying ploys are nagging on about the need to do routine tasks hitherto done without supervision, questioning any action whose purpose isn't instantly self-evident, and showing suspicion that the subordinate is either flouting or has misunderstood the proper procedure. Typically, the immediate result is that the target staff-member checks everything twice and starts to hesitate before making even the clearest-cut decisions. That in turn results in a slower work-rate, which supplies a real cause of complaint to the superior. Moreover, it ushers in stage two because with the boss now justified in adding criticism of the slowness to the earlier torments, the target is likely to rush the job, so making mistakes. Hard evidence of unreliability is thus added to the charge-sheet. Under the redoubled pressure, the subordinate is apt to move the process into stage three by losing confidence in his or her own ability. The consequent worrying about what's the right thing to do, let alone how to do it, typically leads to markedly reduced performance all-round and so to . . . . Stage four: the target either resigns, is demoted, gets sacked, or ends up being treated by the likes of Anna Greenwood as a case of mental breakdown. Hence her search for a means by which the subordinate can break out of the self-sustaining downward spiral - a quest which she began by appealing to her professional colleagues through the British Psychological Society's journal. Although it brought in a good many recommendations, she says, none of them looks likely to be fully effective. Even where there are formal complaints procedures, for example, they tend to be counter-productive unless the target belongs to a union strongly ensconced in the company or, if not, when the boss concerned is only low in the executive hierarchy. In the case of complaints against more senior managers, research suggests it is odds-on that the higher level will be upheld over the lower. Another cure mooted by the replies is to tackle the boss directly as soon as the stage-one pattern is discernible. Unfortunately, Anna Greenwood says, people need a lot of working experience to twig what's happening so early, and still more to know that allowing it to continue can be at least as damaging as a confrontation with authority. Even the canniest of the proposals, she adds, is prone to the same snags. It is to respond willingly to whatever demands are made at the workplace, and during breaks to be overheard by gossipy colleagues expressing genuine concern about the pressures making such an able boss behave so stressfully. Accordingly - recalling that two years ago readers decoded the medieval spelling of the name of a port which had defeated the French historian, Professor Bartolome Bennassar - I'm hoping that you can once again do better than the professional experts. N OW to the table below which gives indicators of going-rates of pay for upper ranks of managers in Britain, as shown by the latest survey made for the Institute of Directors by the Reward consultancy. The full report, containing detailed data drawn from a sample of thousands, costs Pounds 350 and is obtainable from Steve Flather at Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone, Staffs ST15 0SD; tel 0785 813566, fax 0785 817007. My extracts are limited to six broad ranks - from fully executive chairmen to middle managers three perches below board-level - employed by companies in three turnover brackets, which overlap. In each case, the table gives both salary and total cash rewards including bonuses. The lower quartile refers to the executive a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same rank and turnover range, the median to the person mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down. The figures are for the UK as a whole, taking no account of regional variances which can be considerable. To allow for rises since the information was collected, all the salaries should be increased by 0.7 per cent and by a further 0.35 per cent for each month from January onwards. One clear message from the table is that whatever advantages success as a manager may bring in small outfits, they are not of the material sort. In the up-to-Pounds 25m bracket the median chairman's total pay is just over 2 1/2 times that of the rank-three manager. In the Pounds 20m-Pounds 250m band the difference is 5 1/4 times, and at Pounds 200m-plus it is nearly eight times.</p>

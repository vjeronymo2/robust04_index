			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Portugal's fiscal revenue rises Fiscal revenue in Portugal rose 26.8 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared with the same period in 1993, to Es1,306bn (Pounds 1.07bn), the finance ministry said yesterday. The increase of Es276.2bn is already more than the Es240bn in tax revenue growth that the government budgeted for the whole of 1994. A 3.9 per cent increase in government expenditure from January to May was also well within budget, the ministry said. The revenue rise reflects improvement in tax collection, particularly of VAT, after virtual breakdown of the tax machine last year. Indirect taxation revenue grew 38.9 per cent over the first five months to Es827.8bn. Control over spending is largely attributable to a rise of only 2.5 per cent in public administrative sector wages during the first quarter of 1994. Portugal's budget deficit for the first five months fell 26.1 per cent, compared with the same period last year, to Es282.2bn. Peter Wise, Lisbon France's seasonally-adjusted industrial production index rose 0.2 per cent in March from the previous month to an index level of 110.3, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said yesterday. Dutch consumer spending in the first quarter of 1994 showed a strong 2.8 per cent year-on-year rise, largely due to a one-off jump in car purchases, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said yesterday. European airlines' estimated operating losses rose fractionally in 1993 to Dollars 2.24bn (Pounds 1.48bn) from Dollars 2.22bn in 1992, the Association of European Airlines said.</p>

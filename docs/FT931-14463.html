			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Progress in ex-Soviet debt talks UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk announced yesterday that Ukraine and Russia had reached a tentative agreement on division of the former Soviet Union's foreign debts and assets, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. He said the proposal, agreed at meetings in Moscow on Friday, was now being considered by the Paris and London Clubs of creditors. Last week, the unresolved dispute between Ukraine and Russia over foreign debt forced western creditors to call off debt rescheduling talks. Unlike the other former Soviet republics, Ukraine has been reluctant to accept the 'zero variant', according to which Russia would assume responsibility for both debts and assets. Instead, Ukraine has pressed Russia to disclose the full extent of the foreign assets of the former Soviet Union and has expressed readiness to pay its share of the debt. Ukrainian officials said that, according to the deal, Ukraine would independently pay for a share of the foreign debt, a solution western creditors have strongly opposed in the past, fearing that Ukraine will be unable to meet its obligations.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Mandela and Buthelezi fail to agree on poll SOUTH AFRICA'S two most important black leaders, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, met yesterday for a long-awaited summit, but failed to agree on the crucial issue of setting a date for the country's first multi-racial elections. After 10 hours of talks, Mr Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, emerged grim-faced to say that the two men had not been able to agree on an election date. The setting of a date, and the installation of a transitional executive to oversee government before elections, are preconditions for the lifting of international economic sanctions against South Africa. Mr Mandela had hoped to announce an election date when he visits the US next week with Mr F W de Klerk, the president. He said he believed a breakthrough on this issue could still be achieved in the 26-party constitutional talks, but this seemed unlikely without the agreement of Chief Buthelezi. Mr Mandela said the two men had made 'a great deal of progress' towards ending political violence between supporters of the ANC and of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. They said they would address joint peace rallies to persuade their supporters to cease fighting which has left over 15,000 people dead since 1984. In Natal province alone, 45 people died in the three days before the talks. Both also committed themselves to banning dangerous weapons at political rallies, a leading demand of the ANC. However, it seems unlikely that the meeting will lead to an early cessation of hostilities. As South Africans prepare for their first-ever multi-racial elections, provisionally set for April next year, political violence seems likely to increase, notably in volatile Natal. Chief Buthelezi said the meeting would have great symbolic significance. He had, however, opened the talks with a lengthy memorandum listing personal grievances against Mr Mandela and the ANC. He said they had assassinated his character.</p>

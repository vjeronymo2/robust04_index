			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision supporting the right to burn our country's  flag has appalled my wife and me. We have decided to fly our flag every day  from now on, not just on legal holidays.  </P> <P> If every family on every street in every community in every state would do the  same, we would be sending a powerful message to those five justices, and to the  only body who could and should right this wrong -- the U.S. Congress.  </P> <P> JERRY COWLE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

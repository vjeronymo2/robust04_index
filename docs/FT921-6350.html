			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / EC treaty could spell further complications RATIFICATION of the Maastricht treaty in Ireland could create a 'constitutional nonsense' by overriding the Irish Supreme Court's decision to allow a 14-year-old rape victim to terminate her pregnancy in Britain. Mr Geoffrey Hoon, a UK Labour MEP, told the European Parliament's legal affairs committee that Community legal experts should look into implications of the special protocol attached to the treaty, which promises that EC law will not affect the application of Ireland's constitutional 'right-to-life' amendment. The Irish Supreme Court has not yet given its reasons for setting aside a High Court decision which would have prevented the pregnant girl from travelling abroad. If the Court argues that this was a special case, some EC lawyers are worried that the Maastricht protocol could prevent Irish women appealing to the European Court of Justice against future restrictive court decisions on the right to travel abroad for abortions. Mr Willi Rothley, German Socialist MEP who called for the debate, said the Irish High Court decision had threatened EC treaty provisions guaranteeing free provision of services throughout the EC. But Mr Pat Cooney, an Irish lawyer and Fine Gael MEP, condemned fellow deputies. 'It isn't up to the EC to harmonise the cultures, the religious practices and the philosophies of member states,' he said.</p>

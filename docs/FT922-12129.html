			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / People: Banking on a weekly audience Robin Moser, chief executive of Alexanders Discount, will be going to see the Governor of the Bank of England more than most people in the City over the next couple of years. As the new chairman of the London Discount Market Association his job is to call on the Governor every Thursday afternoon and brief him on the views of the London money markets. Moser, 44, who still wears a top hat on his way to his Thursday meeting at the Bank, inherits a tradition which started when Montagu Norman became Governor in 1920. The discount houses had formed their own committee during the 1914-18 war and when peacetime came Norman decided to formalise his weekly meeting with the chairman of the committee. Thursday afternoon was chosen as it followed the weekly meeting of the Bank of England court, when Bank rate was published, and Friday's treasury bill tender. When things were difficult, the chairman would occasionally bring another member of the committee along with him. By 1929 'difficulties' had become so frequent that it became accepted that the deputy chairman would always attend; Moser is therefore accompanied by his deputy, Michael Walker, 43, managing director of Clive Discount. Traditionally, the two discount house men met the Governor and the principal of the Bank's Discount Office. However, this responsibility now falls to John Townend, head of the Bank's gilt-edged and money market division. Although the importance of the discount market is not what it was in Montagu Norman's day, the fact that the Governor of the Bank still continues with the half-hourly meeting every Thursday suggests that it serves a useful purpose. 'People are always saying that the discount market is on its last legs,' says Moser, 'but you can't write us off just yet.' He is confident that his successors will still be in business well into the next century. However, the job does have one drawback. Moser has to walk around the rest of his discount house members before his Thursday meeting, and following his talk with the Governor he cannot get involved in decisions about his own firm's position taking until after the Friday treasury bill tender.</p>

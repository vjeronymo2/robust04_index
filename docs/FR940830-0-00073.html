One PHA supported the current method of TDC and the 90% requirement. However, the PHA suggested that, HAs have the option to use CGP funds to supplement other funds to demo and replace units where that option is most advantageous to HUD and the HA. Thus, if the HA intends to modernize a project at 80% of TDC, it should have the option to add 20% of other funding to demolish and rebuild the complex. This option could require review and approval by HUD, and the Public Hearing and Resident Group review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters noted that often, the HA spends an inordinate amount of time after the architect develops the plans and specifications trying to determine how or what should be cut from the minimum to construct the development. We should be striving for quality not a specific quantity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were pleased with the proposed new way of evaluating cost reasonableness, namely by evaluating the costs of individual types of work items and comparing them with published private construction cost standards. CLPHA recommended that a PHA be allowed to demonstrate cost reasonableness under any of the three following methods: (a) The current approach using 90% of TDCs; (b) the cost reasonableness approach related to the cost of individual work proposed by HUD in the proposed rule, but also allowing PHAs to submit additional data concerning local market conditions as they relate to published cost indicators; or (c) sealed pre-bid estimates to be compared to the competitive bids received for such work. Once approved, the definition used by the PHA would remain constant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that HUD should allow HAs to develop their own methods of determining the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonableness of planned work. These cost evaluations should not be submitted to HUD on an annual basis and should not have to be retained by HAs for HUD review. The time and cost of generating this kind of data in a form suitable for HUD audit could be significant. Pre-bid estimates and competitive bids received for work should be adequate to document the reasonableness of cost for work items. HUD was urged to use a sufficiently expansive definition of reasonable cost to permit HAs to utilize very durable materials and construction techniques and revised modernization standards critical to ensuring a development's long-term viability. HUD was also urged to implement a similar standard for its development program. In particular, development cost must: (a) Be more reflective of local and changing conditions; (b) expand beyond the modest design standards; and (c) provide adequate square footage for today's family needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

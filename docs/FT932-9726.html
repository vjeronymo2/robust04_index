			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex members not tempted by doubled offer THE TEAM of New York Mercantile Exchange traders negotiating the energy exchange's take-over of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) is prepared to double its bid to Dollars 20m and make concessions on trading rights in an effort to bring the deal to closure. Still, Comex members say the offer is not sufficient, and many are losing interest in the deal. Both sides are keenly aware of the time and effort lost in failed merger negotiations between the Comex and the Chicago Board of Trade, 'We would like to settle this, either way, as soon as possible,' said a Comex official. The exchange's board of directors has a regularly scheduled meeting tomorrow and will discuss the Nymex proposal formally for the first time. Nymex's first offer for the Comex, the world's largest precious metals exchange, was for Dollars 10m in cash. Comex members immediately said the amount was inadequate, considering Comex holds Dollars 13m in cash. The new offer, which has yet to be approved by the Nymex board, is said to be Dollars 20m. That is still far less than the Dollars 60m Comex members claim as the 'book' value of the exchange. The Comex board accepted a take-over offer from the Chicago Board of Trade last January in an effort to find a financial backer and cut overheads after several years of sluggish precious metals futures and options volume. Nymex stepped in on April 27, a week after that deal failed. Now, with the gold market the busiest its been since 1991, Comex members are beginning to question the need for a merger. Comex gold futures volume jumped to 826,585 contracts in April, from 492,857 last year. Gold volume, and record April turnover in high-grade copper, sent overall Comex volume to 1.67m contracts last month, compared to 1.05m the same month last year.</p>

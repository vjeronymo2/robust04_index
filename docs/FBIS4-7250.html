			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers  on 28 April on ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to  Japan and on talks between the ROK and Japanese defense  ministers now under way in Japan.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word  article by senior Tokyo-based correspondent Pae In-chun from the  "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Defense Minister Yi's  Consciousness of 'ROK- Japan Military Exchanges.'"    The article reports that after holding talks with his  Japanese counterpart Kazuo Aichi, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae  said that the ROK will push ahead with military exchanges with  Japan in a "quiet yet substantive" manner in view of "special  relations" between the ROK and Japan in the past and of the  "unnecessary irritation" of North Korea. Commenting on the  possibility of Japan becoming a big military power, Defense  Minister Yi said that Japan seems to be keenly aware of  "concerns" by neighboring countries and the ROK's position is to  "carefully watch" Japan's moves. Asked if Japan would regard a  "reunified Korea" as the enemy, Minister Yi notes that the  concept of the enemy would "change" according to the change in  the situation. Observing that the ROK and Japanese defense  authorities are striving to begin military exchanges between the  ROK and Japan on the premise of North Korea's "threat," the  article points out that Japan is emphasizing the North Korean  "threat" more than the ROK.    TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word article by  Ha Chun-u under the headline: "Significance and Prospect of  ROK-Japan Defense Ministers' Talks." Noting that ROK Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Japan, the first of its kind in  history, will be an occasion for activating ROK-Japan military  exchanges, the article reports official talks between defense  ministers of the two countries themselves mean the "official  declaration" of military exchanges. The article notes that the  ROK and Japan maintained a "military balance and stability" in  Northeast Asia based on their respective military alliance with  the United States, and held positions to deter military threats  by the communist bloc. Nevertheless, the article notes,  ROK-Japan military exchanges have been greatly restricted owing  to the past colonial rule. Prompted by the collapse of the  communist bloc, the two nations came to have a common  understanding that their military exchanges should no longer be  put aside. The article points out that during his visit to  Japan, Defense Minister Yi discussed ways to seek "common  interests" in military and security domains, and that the two  sides reached an agreement even on "operational" matters,  including rotating training of naval academy cadets, mutual  visits of military ships, and prevention of accidental crashes  of military aircraft. The article, however, predicts that  although military exchanges between the two countries will be  gradually expanded with Minister Yi's visit to Japan, such  exchanges will likely remain "relaxed cooperative relations" for  a considerable period of time, because formulation of military  relations by concluding a military treaty or a peace treaty may  touch off "dispute" over confirmation of territories and may not  be appropriate in view of the flexible situation in Northeast  Asia. Thus, the article concludes, drastic progress in military  exchanges, including joint military exercises, will not be  "likely" for the time being.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word editorial under the headline "Conditions of  ROK-Japanese Military Ties." Describing the agreement to expand  military exchanges and cooperation between the ROK and Japan as  "significant," the editorial expresses the hope that the  security ties between the two countries will contribute not only  to "stability" on the Korean peninsula but also to "global  peace." Recalling that our national sentiment hindered expansion  of ROK-Japan military exchanges in the past, the editorial  stresses that "regional security" has now emerged as a "mutual,  common task" and that with independent strength of a nation,  security cannot be guaranteed. Pointing to the ROK's effort to  "diversify" its military friendly relations with China, Russia,  and Germany, the editorial describes ROK-Japanese military  exchanges as "desirable." The editorial, however, expresses  "concern" over the possibility of Japan becoming a big military  power, and stresses that cooperation between the two countries  is necessary only on the premise that Japan will not become a  big military power, and that military cooperation should start  from the work of broadening "mutual trust and understanding."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Riga, Jan 27, BNS -- Latvia's Cabinet will  resign if the parliament adopts a needy budget that will soar  inflation and force the government into borrowing money from the  Bank of Latvia, Finance Minister Uldis Osis told BNS Thursday.    The government agrees to redivision of some of the planned  spendings but it rejects attempts to hike the budget shortfall  to a limit that will provoke heavy inflation, said Osis.    The government bases its work on the two principal criteria,  the priority of economic development and reforms, and the  macroeconomic stabilization, the minister said.    "If the increased budget deficit causes inflation and  undermines the macroeconomic stability I will be the first to  retire," Osis said.    The government's resignation is inevitable then because it  will not be able to follow the course of reforms in compliance  with the distorted budget plan.    On the other hand, there are no other political forces in  Latvia that could set up a tenable government, Osis said.  [passage omitted]    The Latvian Saeima [parliament] is considering the budget  plan in its current plenary session.</p>

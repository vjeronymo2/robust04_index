			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Bonn agrees formula for joining UN forces GERMANY'S ruling coalition agreed yesterday on a formula to change the constitution and enable German soldiers to take part in United Nations peace-keeping and peace-making operations. The plan, which would also provide for such operations outside the UN umbrella, now has to win the support of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) to gain a two-thirds majority in parliament, if it is to become a constitutional amendment. It is planned to submit it to the Bundestag for a first reading tomorrow. The sudden agreement, after months of negotiations between the coalition partners, follows the forthright call by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali on Monday for Germany to play a full part in future UN operations. The immediate urgency is that without such a deal, German air force personnel would be taken off Nato Awacs reconnaissance aircraft monitoring violations of the no-fly-zone over the former Yugoslavia, if the UN Security Council decided to enforce the zone. Without German personnel, the aircraft would be restricted in their operations. Although the immediate reaction of the SPD to the plan was hostile, it will place the opposition in an embarrassing position of being seen to block a reasonable compromise if it votes against it. The constitutional 'amplification' proposed by the coalition, would add three paragraphs, distinguishing between UN peace-keeping operations, UN peace-making operations, and 'exercising the right of collective self-defence in terms of Article 51 of the UN charter'. German military forces would be enabled to take part in UN peace-keeping measures in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, or as defined by the UN charter. They would also be able to take part in peace-making measures, provided they have been agreed by a Security Council resolution. Both those measures would be subject merely to a majority vote in the Bundestag. The most controversial proposal, however, is the third paragraph, which would allow 'collective self-defence' operations outside the UN framework, provided they are carried out with other countries in the framework of 'alliances and other regional agreements' to which Germany belongs. The importance of the clause is that it would allow Germany to operate outside the Nato area with its alliance partners, or in the context of the Western European Union or a future European defence corps, without a full UN resolution.</p>

Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- African National Congress  [ANC] President Nelson Mandela's intimations that Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was  responsible for the weekend massacre in Natal encouraged further  violence, the IFP said on Monday [21 February]. Mr Mandela on  Sunday said Saturday's killing of 15 ANC supporters in Creighton  was the result of Natal leaders' irresponsible talk urging  resistance to the April elections.    IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said on Monday Mr Mandela's  response,  "far from subduing inflamed passions, encourages a violent  counter response to avenge the mass slaying".    "For a man of his perceived stature, we find it highly  unfortunate that he succumbs to apportioning blame before  allowing law enforcement agencies to determine culpability."    The IFP appealed to all political leaders to "consider their  words and rhetoric very carefully during this time of great  upheaval and uncertainty".    Mr Tillet expressed his party's condolences to the families  of the victins. The IFP has always subscribed to the philosophy  that an eye for an eye makes the entire world blind, he said.</p>

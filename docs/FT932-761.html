			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Income distribution survey - At a glance Income distributions from income unit trusts have tended to be lower in the first half of this year, according to Income Fund Analysis. Of 119 funds which have paid at least one half yearly or two quarterly income distributions in 1993 so far, 68 paid less than the same time last year, 14 were unchanged, and 37 made higher payments. Of 79 distributions paid in April, May and June this year, 41 were down on the equivalent payment last year, nine were unchanged, and 29 were up. Four long-running funds monitored by IFA have already secured their unbroken records of increasing income every year since 1981: Prolific High Income, Kleinwort Benson High Yield, Barclays Unicorn Income, and Allied Dunbar Equity Income. Four others have so far held steady, and may increase in the second half of 1993: Henderson Income &amp; Growth, M&amp;G High Income, Sun Life Distribution, and James Capel Income Fund.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Ui-chun] </F>   [Text] It has been estimated that North Korea will  concentrate its efforts in improving or restoring relations with  strong neighboring countries, such as Japan, China, and Russia,  this year while giving top priority to improving its relations  with the United States.    The Institute of Foreign Affairs and Security, headed by Pak  Su-kil, analyzes this in a report entitled "Prospect of Changes  in North Korea" released on 23 February, and it stresses: "We  should strengthen the position of the reformist forces [kaehyok  chihyangjok seryoktul] in North Korea so that they can attempt  to make drastic changes [kwagamhan pyonhwa] and should cooperate  and support North Korea in developing its independent system  [chajujogin cheje palchone]."    Regarding the possibility of changes in North Korea, which  adheres to "socialism of its own style," the report anticipates  that North Korea will reform itself starting from superior  offices, gradually and partially; will pursue the policy of  protecting its system; will hardly reform itself starting from  lower offices; will undergo changes after Kim Il-song dies; and  will suffer internal disputes after Kim Il-song's death.    The report says, in particular, that North Korea will  probably concentrate efforts to level the ground internally and  externally for consolidating the system of succession by Kim  Chong-il and expand strategies for developing its system by  opening its economy within a restricted scope, while laying  greater emphasis on its chuche-based independent economic policy.    The report anticipates: "Kim Chong-il will continuously take  measures of treating the military preferentially in order to  consolidate the ground of forces on his side, and will keep  exporting weapons in secret to solve economic problems."    It also expects: While adhering to a confederal system,  North Korea will inevitably give more weight to maintaining and  developing its system than to the southward revolution because  of a durable situation of international reconciliation and  cooperation. It is highly possible that North Korea will seek  reunification policies, considering South Korea to be a  potential coexisting partner, rather than a target to overthrow.    The report analyses: North Korea, however, will regard  South-North dialogue as a subordinate variable [chongsok pyonsu]  of North Korean-U.S. dialogue. It may make rapid progress in  South-North dialogue, if necessary, and will finally attempt the  resumption of South-North high-level talks.    Accordingly, it is possible that North Korea will expand  South-North human exchanges within a strategic scope to protect  its system. For the time being, however, it is hard to expect  home visits and exchanges of letters by separated families,  sightseeing tours, and permanent stationing of correspondents  because North Korea will not allow any exchange affecting its  system.    With the prospect of changes in North Korea, the report  advises the government to consider disseminating its plan to  pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea as a partner after  the nuclear issue is resolved, inducing North Korea's opening up  in a way of multilateral economic cooperation, helping North  Korea participate in the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Asia-Pacific region, and strengthening ROK-U.S.  cooperative relations so as to make North Korea have an active  attitude toward South-North dialogue while negotiating with the  United States on the establishment of diplomatic relations.</p>

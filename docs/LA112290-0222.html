			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHIVE LINKS EARNINGS DROP TO ACQUISITION  </P> <P> Archive Corp., a maker of computer memory backup products, said Wednesday that  its fiscal 1990 net income fell nearly 25% to $11.5 million from the  year-earlier $15.3 million.  </P> <P> Despite the drop in income, revenue for the year ended Sept. 28 was up 62% to  $293 million from $181.4 million in fiscal 1989.  </P> <P> The company attributed the earnings decline in part to its April acquisition of  Cipher Data Products, which cost $123 million and resulted in the May layoff of  about 95 people among the two companies' combined 3,200-employee work force.  </P> <P> For its fourth quarter, Archive reported net income of $1.8 million, down 57%  from $4.2 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue, however, nearly  doubled to $94.9 million from $49.7 million.  </P> <P> Howard Lewis, Archive's chairman and chief executive, recently attributed the  soaring revenue to the Cipher acquisition and steady sales of Archive's  0.25-inch computer cartridge tape drives and controllers.  </P> <P> But Lewis said in a statement issued Wednesday that "the outlook for the  overall economy is uncertain and the computer industry is reporting a softening  in sales." Archive, he said, "will proceed in 1991 with care to . . . maintain  expenses in line with revenues."  </P> <P> Archive attended the gigantic Comdex computer show in Las Vegas earlier this  month with a large exhibit. But the company did say it had implemented a hiring  freeze because of general concerns about a national recession and more specific  worries about the sluggishness of the computer market.  </P> <P> Archive's stock price is so depressed that it is now trading below its book  value -- essentially a corporation's value figured by subtracting all its debts  from its total assets. Archive's book value is $5.76 per share.  </P> <P> Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, recently pointed out that  Archive is one of a handful of local companies to trade at or below book value.  The company stock's high for the year is $13.88 a share and its low is $4.25.  </P> <P> Archive's stock -- traded over the counter -- was down 37.5 cents Wednesday to  close at $5.50.  </P></p>

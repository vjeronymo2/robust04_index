			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Cookery: Nice, nutty and healthy - Buckwheat, a substantial staple, shows its lighter side I USED to associate buckwheat only with Russia and sturgeon. Flour made from tiny, nutty buckwheat seeds and raised with yeast produces blinis which, when teamed with the roe of that fish and tots of vodka, make a memorable feast. The grain itself is also traditional with the flesh of the fish (or sometimes with salmon), together with mushrooms, onions, dill, butter and soured cream, the whole lot wrapped in a brioche parcel known generally as coulibiac. Now, I have learned that buckwheat is also a staple food of the people of Valtellina, in the northern fringes of Italy where the alpine peaks that rise from the valley are so snow-packed that you can ski in high summer. The buckwheat dishes I ate there were wonderful - and very substantial. The coarsely-ground seed is mixed with maize meal and whipped up with butter and cheese to make taragna, a splendidly rich variation on polenta. Buckwheat flour is used to make ribbon noodles called pizzoccheri. A dish of the same name - consisting of the noodles cooked and served with potatoes, cabbage, garlic, sage, butter and cheese - is marvellous, rib-sticking fare and just the ticket to revive you when you have spent the day swooping on skis or pony-trekking. Recipes like these are too good to miss, but I shall save them until next winter. Instead, I shall make some lighter suggestions - for which you will need to buy a packet of buckwheat flour or saraceno. You will find it sold in many health food stores as well as Italian specialist shops and delicatessens. Store it in the refrigerator when you get it home; it will keep better, and longer, than if you leave it in a kitchen cupboard. Use small quantities of buckwheat flour to replace some of the wholewheat in bread-making. This gives loaves good, nutty flavour, agreeably light texture and an attractively-speckled look. I also like using buckwheat in batter and, particularly, shaping the batter into small cakes, like king-size drop scones. Serve them for brunch or Sunday supper topped with similarly large mushrooms, fried or baked with garlic and butter. Add a scattering of chives or dill plus, perhaps, a few rashers of bacon on the side. Or, offer them as a generous first course for dinner teamed with sauteed chicken livers, onion marmalade and soured cream, or a fresh tomato salsa with basil. Last, buckwheat batter without the pepper can be served for breakfast to spread with butter and honey or marmalade - a lovely change from toast or croissants. BUCKWHEAT BATTER (Makes 8 rounds about 4 inches in diameter) Ingredients: 2 oz buckwheat flour;  1/4 teaspoon baking powder; a good pinch each of Maldon salt and freshly-ground black pepper; 1 oz butter, at room temperature;  1/4 lb cottage cheese; 3 tablespoons milk beaten with 2 large eggs. Method: Put the buckwheat flour and raising agent into the bowl of a food processor or blender. Season, add the butter, cut into dice, add the cottage cheese. Mix briefly. Pour on the liquids, adding them through the hole in the lid while the machine is running, and continue processing until the ingredients are blended to a thick, creamy batter. Heat and lightly butter a small griddle or omelette pan. Ladle enough batter into the pan to make a 4-inch circle and cook over moderate heat until bubbles begin to show and the batter is sufficiently cooked so that you can slip a spatula under it easily. Flip it golden side up and cook for a few seconds more until the second side is set. Then, remove it from the pan, wrap it between the folds of a napkin and slip it into a low oven to keep tender and warm while you cook the rest. Serve in any of the ways described above.</p>

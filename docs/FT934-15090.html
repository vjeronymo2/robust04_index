			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Jobs: How universities fared - Clear lead for Oxford in graduate employment league IT'S like saying goodbye to an old fiend - by which is meant the devilish-looking table to the right. Working it out has been a regular task for the Jobs column's present writer every autumn since the era of slide-rule calculations in 1972. As I'm due to retire in early February, however, it will tax my number-crunching patience no more. It nevertheless leaves me with twinges of regret, not least because along the way it happens to have provoked a change in attitudes towards an important item of public spending. The reason is that, while I had no such intention on starting the exercise 21 years ago, the table turned out to be the forefather of what are now called 'higher educational performance indicators' and in use in various parts of the world. But I'd better choke back the nostalgia for the moment, and explain what the figures are about. The focus of the exercise is the United Kingdom's largely state-financed campus universities - or at least the 45 of them which enjoyed university status before the erstwhile polytechnics were elevated to the same title. And the table's prime purpose is to show how the 45 institutions' new graduates fared in the badly depressed jobs market of 1992. The first column of figures sets out the total number of new bachelor-level graduates domiciled in the UK, as distinct from those coming from overseas, produced by each institution in the summer of last year. The second shows the percentages of them who could no longer be traced by their Alma Mater on December 31, six months after they gained their degree. The next section of the chart, consisting of five columns, refers to the 1992 graduates whose whereabouts could be traced, beginning with the numbers thereof. Then come four sets of percentages. The first denotes those who obtained a job with long-term prospects, and the next those who continued in full-time study or training. Both of those sets could be said to have found regular occupations for their highly educated talents. But the other two groups are different. One is the people who declared themselves not available for employment at all, as opposed to those who returned to some organisation which had kept them on its books while they were at university. The other group, coming last in the section, lumps together those who were unemployed at the year-end and those who, although they'd obtained a job, were in only temporary employment expected to last at most three months. That Short-term work or jobless figure - which could be seen as a crude gauge of the institutions' job-market performances in 1992 - was for years the best measure I could produce. Alas it gave rise to academic protests that it was unfair in making no allowance for variances in the mix of subjects taught by different universities. After all, those with a large proportion of engineers and the like in their graduate output have a built-in advantage over those concentrating more on the arts side. The snag was that, while little would have pleased me better than to adjust for subject-mix, officialdom refused me access to the necessary detailed data. So, considering the employability of expensively educated graduates a matter of legitimate public interest, I just carried on on printing the only measure I could produce. Thanks to growing acceptance of the need for performance-indicators, however, I can now do better. In the the past few years the university authorities have taken to publishing management statistics allowing the subject-mix adjustments to be made. But I still can't make them for 1992 alone, because the published figures are for three-year periods, in the latest case for 1990-92. Hence the final, three-column section of the table, on which the ranking of the institutions is based. The first of the columns gives each of them a 'target' representing the number of its new graduates who would have been in the short-term and jobless group if they'd conformed to the all-universities average for their respective subjects. The next column shows the number actually in that group, and the third shows the percentage by which the actual score bettered or fell short of the target.</p>

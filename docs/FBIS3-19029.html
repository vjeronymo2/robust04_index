			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] British reinforcement troops were today moving into  position in Bosnia just hours after arriving in the region as  part of a 7,200-strong international force to support fragile  United Nations ceasefires.    The advance party of the 900-strong battalion group based on  the Duke of Wellington's Regiment left the Croatian port of  Split at first light to move up-country into central Bosnia.  They were replacing hard-pressed troops from the Coldstream  Guards, who have been working 18-hour days striving to enforce  the truce agreements with thinly-spread resources.    They are being stationed at British bases at Duvno, Gornji  Vakuf, Vitez and Zepce and will be used to man checkpoints,  observation posts, weapon collection points and to help with aid  operations.    Once their Saxon armoured vehicles arrive, they will be able  to patrol the 125-mile buffer zone between Croat and Muslim  forces across central Bosnia.    "They have been deployed immediately on the ground to all  four locations and as more come in they will be moved up-country  straight away," said a British military spokesman.    "The speed of the operation is quite astonishing but we want  to move them into position as quickly as possible."    Troops from the 900-strong force will continue to arrive  over  the next week and ships carrying the armoured vehicles will dock  between March 21 and 23.    The Royal Fleet Auxiliary landing ships Sir Tristram left  the  Marchwood military port at Southampton today. Her sister ships  Sir Galahad and Sir Bedivere will leave tomorrow and Sunday [13  March] respectively.    Precise details of the deployment will be worked out at a  meeting tomorrow of the Joint Commission set up with Croat and  Muslim leaders and chaired by British Brigadier John Reith.    Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Williams, commander of the  Coldstream Guards, and Lt-Col David Santa-Olalla, CO of the Duke  of Wellington's Regiment, will both attend the meeting to work  out areas of operations.    "All of this will accelerate the return to normality in the  region with a consequent reduction in these tasks," said a  miliary source.    The Government hopes the "creeping ceasefire" which is  spreading across Bosnia will persuade other nations, notably the  United States to take part in the UN operation.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it was the right time to  send extra troops to reinforce the ceasefires.    "There is a good military principle about reinforcing  success. In the last couple of weeks it has become clear, not  that all danger is over, but that the war in Bosnia is beginning  to die," he said.    "Now it may come back again to being horrible and savage but  there is an opportunity now, not as part of a general settlement  so far, but place by place, Sarajevo first and now in central  Bosnia where our troops are."    Troops were needed to implement the ceasefires and create  confidence so fighting did not break out again along the truce  lines. The British force will be fundamentally reorganised  following the Government's decision yesterday to reinforce.    British Battalion One, which will have its headquarters at  Vitez, will be based on the Coldstream Guards with  responsibility for the area from Maglaj in the north to Vitez  and west to Travnik. It will consist of companies with Warrior  armoured fighting vehicles, two squadrons of Light Dragoons with  Scimitar light tanks and one company with Saxons.    British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's  Regiment, will have its headquarters in Bugojno with two  Saxon-equipped companies. A Warrior company will be based at  Gornji Vakuf. It will be responsible for the area south of Vitez  including Gornji Vakuf, which has been a key flashpoint, Prozor  and Duvno.</p>

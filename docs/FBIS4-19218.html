			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League's Speroni Quits Senate </F> Speaker Race"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- Francesco Speroni of the  Northern League told the press this morning that he was out of  the running for Senate Speaker, a move later praised by National  Alliance leader Giancarlo Fini but denied by Marcello Staglieno,  the Northern League's Senate whip before Speroni, member of his  party's delegation to the majority table on speaker negotiations.    "Like I said yesterday" Speroni told the press this morning,  "I am not taking part in today's meeting because there are  people there I don't want to having anything to do with, at  least until they change their style."    "In order not to create any obstacles on the path towards  federalism" he announced, "I withdraw my candidacy. This  because of the untrustworthiness of the alleged majority, which  is unable to guarantee its unity in a secret ballot."    The speakers for the new parliament, Speroni predicted, will  be Carlo Scognamiglio for the Senate and Irene Pivetti for the  House.    Speroni then went on to confirm his, as he put it, "complete  disgust for the party-politics with which some, but not from the  League, carried out the negotiations... I will ask my party  leadership not to be given tasks which imply having to have  political contact with those behind this sleazy run-around."    For Senator Marcello Staglieno, however, Speroni remained  the  Northern League candidate for Senate Speaker and it was  "logical" that the Northern League get the speaker's chair in  the Senate and Forza Italia the House speakership.    Senator Staglieno also said he was against Roberto Maroni,  of  the Northern League, becoming House Speaker, preferring that he  be deputy premier and Interior Minister. This, he said, would  be a real break with the past since the interior ministry has  been held by Christian Democrats for the past fifty years.    Speroni's withdrawal from the Senate speaker race was,  according to Fini, a demonstration of the Northern League's  readiness to come to a government agreement not only in word but  also fact.    Fini went on to define Carlo Scognamiglio, the candidate of  Forza Italia for the Senate chair, as "authoritative" yet  recalled how there were others adding, however, that the  decision will be known today.</p>

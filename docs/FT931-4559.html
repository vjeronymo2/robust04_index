			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Irish meat output set to reach record IRISH MEAT output is likely to hit record levels during 1993, thanks to continuing growth in the country's cattle, sheep and pig herds. According to figures released by the Irish Livestock and Meat Board this week, the breeding herds for all three livestock sectors now stand at their highest levels on record. Based on census data from last December, there are now 2.17m head of Irish breeding cows, 4.8m breeding ewes, and 170,000 breeding sows and gilts. The overall total for the cattle herd masks diverging trends for the dairy and suckler cow (beef) herds. Dairy cow numbers fell by 2 per cent to 1.26m head, while suckler cow numbers grew by 17 per cent to 912,000 head. This, says the CBF, is because of farmers responding to reforms of the European Community's common agricultural policy by building their suckler herds. The capping of ewe premiums at 1991 levels under the new CAP reforms means that the sheep breeding flock is unlikely to grow further this year, says the CBF, while it notes that the rise in the pig breeding herd by 30 per cent since late 1989 makes 'the Irish herd one of the fastest growing in Europe'. On the basis of these figures the CBF estimates that cattle supplies in 1993 will be 'somewhat over 1.9m head', sheep supplies will increase by 3 per cent to some 4.8m head while total pig slaughterings 'could exceed 3.3m head'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice </F> president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party,  YSP, by Kamal Jaballah in Aden; date not given]    [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party and Yemen's Vice President, has welcomed  decisive and responsible Egyptian mediation to resolve the  current grinding political crisis in the country because of  Egypt's immense sacrifices and assistance in support of the  Yemeni revolution and its constant backing in Yemen's  contemporary issues.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his place of residence  in "al-Husayn" in Aden, al-Bid stressed that Yemen cannot allow  itself to be a base for domestic or foreign terrorism,  especially to the extent that is harming the Egyptian people.  He said that all the Arab countries will find themselves in a  difficult situation if they do not stand united against  terrorism.    Al-Bid added that the YSP leaderships went voluntarily to  the  capital, Sanaa, with the backing of all the electoral districts.  He said that the party has made sacrifices that eliminated the  discrepancy in development resulting from the past division and  isolation, in order to create a state of law and order, a state  that takes the united Yemeni homeland into the 21st century and  not back to the 19th century, a state governed according to a  new Yemeni social contract and not merely a signed document of  pledge and agreement or "a forced return to the family house" --  which is what would ensue once that document is bypassed and  negated and the guarantees, executive programs and timetables  for implementation are abandoned.    The YSP secretary general went on to say that the current  crisis has posed a real test for his country of its ability to  establish a state of institutions, modernity, and stability  despite the complications of confrontation. He said that there  has been no clear, unified vision of a unified state. He added  that the anti-YSP forces have not given it enough time, and they  have pushed it into an unenviable position through the  assassination of leading figures and statesmen, and even the  violation of houses.    Al-Bid said that he regards the "Pledge and Agreement  Document" as a mere "way station" to put the course of unity in  the unified state into the hands of the Yemeni people. He noted  that the crisis is not a personal issue between him and  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih but a crisis among all the ruling  Yemeni organizations, bodies, and parties that are participating  in the current dialogue.    He added that all the agreements signed during the past four  years since unity was established have been set aside and in  practice we have moved in the opposite direction. He stressed  that the principles of democracy, coalition, and a state of law  and order are enough to take care of the unity program and  advance it.    Al-Bid began his interview with AL-AHRAM by saying:"It was a  historic moment when we went to live in our capital Sanaa to  establish our program, which the Yemeni national movement has  long struggled to achieve. During our stay in Sanaa, we exerted  all our efforts, but unfortunately we discovered that not all of  us had a clear vision of the practical program. In other words,  events showed that our vision of and belief in the program was  not identical. Still, we do understand that a historic task  such as this one is not easy to accomplish without suffering,  sacrifices, and enough patience. The forces opposed to this  program did not give us enough time to think calmly. They  placed the YSP in an unenviable position through assassinations  and by targeting leading figures and statesmen, such as the  Chamber of Deputies speaker, the prime minister, the justice  minister, and the YSP Political Bureau members. All of them  were targeted directly and the last thing these forces did was  to violate our houses.    The Yemeni vice president said: Yet we exerted every  effort for the sake of unity and we do not regret what we have  offered for our cause. We also tried to choose the path of  democracy and proposed a coalition to sponsor the unity plan,  because we saw various conflicting trends in the Arab world. We  thought perhaps this initiative would act as a way out and  confront everyone with their responsibilities for building a  homeland at this difficult juncture.    Al-Bid affirmed that all the signed agreements have been put  aside and that work was being conducted according to the others'  convictions, making no effort to draw up a democratic, unionist  plan for Yemen.    He explained: We have now reached an understanding within  the framework of the Pledge and Agreement Document, which is a  document of national consensus that we subscribed to and had our  own view on. We agreed that it should form the common ground for  us to rectify the path of unity. Anyone who wants unity has to  defend under appropriate conditions -- a state of unity, for  which I was most enthusiastic. After the 22 May "joy" we had in  Yemen, which left behind overwhelming passions, I consider that  the 18 January "joy" brings national awareness. Hence, let us  pause at this juncture and proceed together to rectify the  course of unity guided by the hands of the Yemeni people. I  believe that a genuine state of unity that entails the  requirements for construction and the establishment of this  democratic plan is primarily a "compound" state. The gist of  the document leads to this goal, but we the Arabs regrettably  always work according to passions, not reason. If we relied on  reason we would have been wiser.    The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party went on:  Nearly four years have passed since unity was established but  the question remains: What is the situation now in Yemen?    He replied: They say that the YSP is pursuing separation.  When we went to Sanaa with our sons we were treated like  immigrants. What did we go for and who dictated that we should  go there? We went voluntarily and won the support of all  electoral constituencies in the southern and eastern  governorates and our citizens. This party offered what it  should offer for unity, carried the banner of democracy and  coalition, demanded a country of law and order, and offered  sacrifices on behalf of the entire nation--150 cadres and  leaders from our membership. We did not stop where the gangs  and those behind them wanted.    He emphasized: The Socialist Party thinks of the future; it  is not limited to just one individual. When we embarked on  unity, we realized that we were chasing a dream. Some of us  were overwhelmed by the sense of the saying "Moving from one  framework to another provides an opportunity." Despite this, we  all felt that we were the partisans of a cause and backers of a  unionist, democratic plan, considering the plan's regulatory  mechanism on the one hand and the actual situation in Yemen on  the other.    Al-Bid pointed out that the YSP had presented 18 points,  which were supported by the Yemeni masses. "We conceded these  points in return for the "Pledge and Agreement Document," the  document on national consensus. Now, we want to implement this  document."    He added: "The document is not ideal, but neither is it  impossible, as some believe. However, it contains our minimum  goals; and we need to approach it responsibly, not by merely  signing it and `returning to the house of obedience' [legal term  meaning for a court to order a reluctant wife to live with her  husband]. Our relationship with the leadership in Yemen does not  mean that we should return to the house of obedience. We are  looking to establish a new social contract, which was delineated  in the pledge and agreement document. We now have to proceed  from another starting point. Our Yemeni character will enable  the leadership to overcome all their differences."    The YSP secretary general affirmed that individual security  cannot be separated from public security in the state. Security  cannot be restricted to the leaders without thinking about the  security of the state as a whole. "The document affirms the  importance of establishing a state of law and order, a state  that can rectify the differences in progress between the two  parts of Yemen and the isolation that existed in the past, a  state that will enter the 21st century without returning to the  19th century. When we signed the unity paper, I did not have in  mind returning Yemen to the 19th century."    Al-Bid then responded to reports about tampering with the  budget for the oil project at Hadramawt, the objective of which  is said to be to divert funds to buy weapons and ammunition in  preparation for a military confrontation between the two sides.  He said: "This agreement must be approved by Parliament and  the Council of Ministers. It is signed by foreign companies.  The things that are rumored and have been published are  impossible. How can funds be withdrawn or added in an agreement  made by the YSP? Those who spread these rumors should have  provided their evidence. Otherwise, these accusations can be  categorized as cheap and absurd, especially since they deal with  money. Shame on them."    Answering a question on the degree of understanding between  the Chairman of the Presidential Council 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and his deputy, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and whether their  relationship has reached a dead end, al-Bid said: "First, the  issue is not personal. Reports always claim that the conflict is  between the president and his deputy. True, we are responsible  for leading this country, but we do so through organizations,  parties, and councils. The issue is now out of the hands of the  coalition parties and in the hands of the sides now taking part  in the national dialogue. Any honest person will take a  positive stand on this document by providing guarantees and  starting to implement the measures in the relevant documents  within a definite time frame."    He affirmed that the Committee for Dialogue Among the Yemeni  Political Forces is entrusted with taking a decisive stand on  the whole subject, saying: We support any decision they reach  regarding this crisis.    I believe that this is a real test of our belief in our  cause, the cause of building a unified and democratic Yemeni  homeland. There is widespread support for this cause; this  proves that Yemenis are capable of resolving their differences  on the basis of the pledge and agreement document according to  the democratic process. There is broad conviction in all Yemen  that Yemenis want a life of recognized establishments, civilian  normality, and stability for themselves and those around them.  Therefore we will not be influenced by all the elements who  want to push Yemen to a clash.    Al-Bid added: "The crisis has shown that the Yemenis reject  terrorism and violence, for these things conflict with the  democratic process. It also showed their desire for social  justice and for a homeland united in a state that is "fitted  together" [ murakkabah] and can resolve the differences in  development, competition, opinion and counter-opinion, and  diversity."    He explained: "If 22 May 1990 was Declaration of Unity Day,  then 18 January is the day of rectifying the unity process.  Rectification always faces difficulties, especially as it  normally conflicts with habitual practices. The force of habit  deprives people of their will; as the Yemeni proverb says,  "Stopping a habit causes hostility."    Despite this, the crisis is not over. Our worst fear is that  the document will just be used to bypass the crisis and to  deprive it of any substance. The document therefore needs an  executive program and timetable with priorities. One of the  priorities is to arrest the outlaws who carried out the bombings  and assassinations.    Al-Bid went on to say: "We do not want Yemen to be a base  for terrorism, either in the Arab homeland or worldwide, because  it is unthinkable for Yemen to follow a democratic course and be  a base for terrorism. But it is worth recalling that many Arabs  became involved in Afghanistan with the support of foreign  international powers; but when these Afghan Arabs returned to  their Arab lands and peoples that enjoyed security and safety,  such as Egypt, Algeria, and Yemen, they began to suffer from  this tribulation [terrorism]. All these are signs of an  alternative plan for ruling. It is a terrorist plan that  opposes development and is threatening the Arab nation. We  believe that the Yemeni unity program is the nucleus of a  pan-Arab, democratic, and unionist plan and we are enthusiastic  about it. There is no harm in continuing with it despite the  difficulties in implementing it, but we should be wise and deal  with the reality consciously."    Regarding the extent of foreign intervention to escalate the  Yemeni crisis, al-Bid said: "We have a crisis, but it is under  discussion and the subject of a national dialogue. We should  not blame it on others. The Arabs have this habit, in the past  and now, of blaming foreign interference for their domestic  crises in order to end them. If we look at the recent past to  find those who had foreign ties, the question then becomes: Who  are they? Who are these, whom we have reared and fed?  Therefore, there is no need to open these files now. We are  facing rulers whose mentalities are not equal to the cause. Yet  this could help in rectifying the unity process."    He noted that the majority of regimes in the Arab countries  are not thinking about development and stability as much as they  are thinking about holding on to power. We believe that  democracy is the right way to achieve stability and development.    The Arab countries will find themselves in a difficult  situation if they do not stand against the creeping terrorist  tide.</p>

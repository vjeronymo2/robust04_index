			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Triplex mounts recovery and plans division sale Triplex Lloyd, the engineering group, returned to profit at the interim stage, after a lapse into the red during the second half of the previous year. It also announced that it had put its engineering division on the market, writes Paul Cheeseright. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 2.55m, against Pounds 1.45m in the first half of last year and an annual loss of Pounds 2.91m. The recovery comes on the back of swelling order books for its power and automotive divisions. Orders for the group totalled Pounds 67.5m at the end of the first half compared with Pounds 46.3m last time. The recovery is likely to accelerate in the second half as increased property profits become available. The engineering division contributed Pounds 15.4m to turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 84.7m (Pounds 67.5m). 'We've cut all the losses out and the division is for sale,' Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, said, adding that there were 'some interested parties'. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p, just covered by earnings per share of 2.8p (1.6p).</p>

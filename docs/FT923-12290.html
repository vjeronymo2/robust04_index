			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: M4 motorway scheme JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRU CTION is to undertake a Pounds 19.7m contract for the construction of the M4 motorway between Baglan and Briton Ferry in West Glamorgan for the Welsh Office Highways Directorate. This is the last of three contracts to be let between Baglan and Lon-Las to complete the motorway between Pont Abraham, Dyfed and London. The roadworks consist of the construction of about three kilometres of dual two-lane motorway and about one kilometre of slip roads. The project also includes the construction of about 300 metres of dual 7.3 metre-wide side road over the main South Wales railway line. At the western end, the new motorway will connect with the Briton Ferry to Earlswood section, which is currently under construction, and its eastern end will connect with the existing motorway on the Port Talbot bypass near the end of the Llywelyn Street viaduct. Temporary traffic management measures will be introduced during the contract period where the new motorway and slip roads join the existing motorway.</p>

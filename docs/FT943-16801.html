			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sponsorship helps all souls: UK universities are keen to adopt the names of commercial benefactors The decision by Oxford dons this week to approve 'Kellogg College' as a new name for Rewley House, which teaches mature and part-time students at the university, will have had some of their more reactionary colleagues spluttering over their cornflakes. To some observers it appeared to signal a sudden move by universities towards selling their souls, or at least their names, to vulgar commercial interests. On the same day Manchester College, affiliated to Oxford University but not with full collegiate status, voted to rename itself in honour of its benefactor Sir Philip Harris, former chairman of carpet company Harris Queensway. 'It might have been alright if they had just renamed a quad or a building - but did they have to rename the whole college,' asks one member of the college's governing body. Other education institutions have been more conservative: De Montfort university, formerly Leicester Polytechnic chose a local figure who had died 700 years before, when it changed its name two years ago. But those who object that the commercialisation of academic institutions is an anathema to the ethos of a university education are on weak ground. Naming a college after a generous benefactor with an industrial background is hardly novel. This century, Oxford has seen the foundation of colleges named after motor industry millionaire Lord William Richard Morris Nuffield and Lord Wolfson, whose wealth came from the mail order business. A Cambridge college is also named after Wolfson while Robinson college is named after the television rental millionare. If anything, the practice of paying tribute to donors in college names is becoming more common - two years ago Liverpool Polytechnic changed to Liverpool John Moores university in honour of the Littlewoods pools millionaire. The wooing of industrialists is a trend the government is encouraging for an obvious reason: the number of students in UK higher education has doubled in the past five years, intensifying pressure on the government's education budget. Any help from wealthy individuals to top up state funding would seem welcome. Nor is it necessarily fair to argue that Kellogg and Harris, as well-known consumer brand names, are unsuitable for Oxford colleges. Kellogg College is naming itself after the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, a charitable body which is independent of the breakfast cereal company, although it shares the same founder. It has given the college about Pounds 9m in the past few years. Objections to the Harris name came from those at the college who were anxious to preserve Manchester's roots in the Unitarian church, members of which founded the college in 1889. Some felt that a college's name was not an accolade to be bestowed lightly; in the UK and the US, universities have, literally, set in stone names such as John Harvard and Elihu Yale which might otherwise have been ephemeral. The question was whether Harris deserved a similar memorial. To the college authorities, however, Sir Philip's donation of about Pounds 3.5m offered an opportunity to ensure Manchester's standards meet the university's requirements for full collegiate status. Moreover a link with the past will be preserved - the full title of the college will be Harris College &amp; Manchester Academy. Far from being embarrassed by help from commerce, universities are exploring fresh ways of attracting still more money. One example is professorships. Oxford already boasts a chair in Media Studies endowed in the name of Mr Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, since 1900, science professorships at the University of Nottingham have been named after the Boot family, which founded the chemist chain in the town. More recently the insurance company Norwich Union has endowed a professorship of insurance studies at the university. The benefit to Nottingham University is tangible: in the 1992-93 academic year it attracted more funding from industry for research than any other UK university. Figures from the government's Universities Statistical Record show that industry funds about 10 per cent of research at UK universities. As the pool of available funds has risen, ambitious provincial universities are competing hard to win money for their research work, a phenomenon which they believe can only benefit UK industry. Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, of Warwick University, told a conference of educationalists in Paris yesterday: 'Universities and companies can work together without compromising academic excellence . . . If you do that then you will be a part of their corporate plan.' Nottingham last year overtook Imperial College, London, as the highest earner from industry. Cambridge and Oxford were in third and fourth place respectively. The competition among universities for industrial research contracts has been encouraged by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the organisation charged with allocating government research funding to university departments. Last month the council announced a change in the way it measures the quality of universities' research programmes for the purpose of deciding future funding. Instead of looking only at pure academic research and counting the number of academic publications a department has produced, it will now take equal account of research commisioned by industry. That should give an extra incentive to universities to attract commercial sponsorship - a prize for which replacing the nameboard over the porters' lodge may seem a small inconvenience.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Radovanovic and Perica Vucinic: "`When the </F> War Stops, We Will See Who Is Alive and Who Is Dead'"]    [Text] When Colonel General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the  General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia [VJ], appeared on  Television Serbia (the second daily newscast) on 29 December and  spoke a few words about the Army of Yugoslavia and the tragedies  which have befallen it (the events in Vranje and Danilovgrad),  he certainly did not suspect that a few months later certain  events which he appeared not to have recalled on that occasion  would leak out to the public.    But then Miodrag Djeric emerged. His son Srdjan is one of  two  soldiers who, according to the official version delivered to the  parents, died in the garrison in Subotica last May, which VREME  wrote about in its last issue. There was no press release about  that event, and Gen. Perisic skipped over it when he addressed  the public.    On Tuesday, 18 January, POLITIKA published an obituary of  Goran Galjak, a captain in the Army of Yugoslavia in the special  forces who "was killed by enemy bullets on 27 December 1993."  Officially, the Army of Yugoslavia never published a word about  his having been killed. Unofficially, a story emerged in public  about how Captain Galjak was killed in Bosnia (near Vogosca),  and he was not alone. According to certain sources close to the  Army of Yugoslavia, two days before Perisic was to be a guest on  the TV news program and skip over stories of this kind, three  other members of the special forces from here were killed near  Vogosca, and three were missing. Other sources give other  figures on the number killed (10 dead members of the Army of  Yugoslavia), but the essence is the same--Capt. Goran Galjak and  his comrades were killed in Bosnia.  <H5>  The Legal Cover </H5>   Aside from the general's forgetfulness and the absence of  official press releases, there are two other facts that link the  cases of Srdjan Djeric and Capt. Galjak. The first is that for  months some people from the Srpska republic have been trying to  convince Miodrag Djeric that his son is alive, that he fought on  the other side of the Yugoslav border, was captured and then  exchanged, and that he would soon return home. The other is much  simpler. In both cases, the Army of Yugoslavia made a mess of it  without having any very important need to do so.    There is a simple and effective legal cover for all the  officers and men of the Army of Yugoslavia fighting in Bosnia.  It is sufficient for them to be recorded in their own units as  men who are, say, on annual vacation or on leave. The fact that  during the 10 or 15 days they are officially absent they are on  the battlefield as volunteers of the Army of the Srpska republic  need not interest the Army of Yugoslavia at all, and, still more  important, this allows it, again officially, to remain  uninvolved in the events on Bosnian soil.    Although they have been nicely disguised, these absences are  concealed in every possible way. An officer of the Army of  Yugoslavia wounded in Bosnia says that he went to the  battlefield voluntarily, that mainly regular army officers are  involved where things are not going well, so that even closest  relatives are not notified of the absences. In case of death,  everything is reported as a "traffic accident." Our informant  says that the thing in all of this that pains him the most is  the phrase in obituaries--"killed in a traffic accident." "When  I know they died a hero's death."    The answer to the question of why so much secrecy if the  story is officially legal might be found in the fact that the  Army of Yugoslavia has usually been involved in the thick of  things, so that probably there has not even been time for all  the necessary preparations. According to VREME's informants,  that is why sometimes people go to the battlefield in uniforms  of the Army of Yugoslavia with all the relevant insignia, even  with the little metal canister around their neck with the  soldier's name, rank, military specialty, and all other  information written on waterproof paper.    The extent of this identification of its people becomes a  problem for the Army of Yugoslavia only if one of them is  captured. If he is killed, the body is extricated, and all the  rest has already been described: a traffic accident, except in  cases when the relatives obviously know what is going on, and  the obituaries mention enemy bullets and defense of the Serbian  cause. What is certainly not to the Army's credit is the fact  that even then, when everything is already out in the open (but  nevertheless can remain "covered"), even his own unit never  publishes an obituary of the person killed.  <H5>  Official Papers </H5>   The Army displayed a still greater unprofessionalism,  ineptness, and carelessness in the case of Srdjan Djeric. And it  did so from the very outset if we assume the official version of  the entire event to be accurate. (When the VREME reporter was in  Subotica, people in Djevdjelijska Street, which runs along the  perimeter of the exercise ground of the garrison there, told him  that they remembered a thick column of smoke far inside the  exercise ground and the military ambulances that quickly  arrived.)    According to the official version, Private Srdjan Djeric and  four of his comrades (none of them had at the time been in the  Army more than 40 days) were in an armored combat vehicle [BOV]  containing two Malyutkas, four Zoljas, 400 rounds for the 20-mm  cannon, and 2,000 rounds for the 7.62-mm PKT machine gun. One of  the soldiers (Sasa Boskovic, who later succumbed to his  injuries) took the Zolja and caused the accident.    The Army, of course, never explained either to Srdjan's  father or to anyone else what the BOV fully equipped for combat  was doing on a training ground, nor what five young soldiers  were doing in such a vehicle when not a single officer was  present. The official papers say that on that day the Army had  no combat alert whatsoever, but the instruction being given on  the training ground was in tactical training referred to as  "Operation of a Mechanized Squad in Preparation for March and  Combat." Anyone who has been in the army knows that that  exercise (and all others) is done without live ammunition. Nor  does it sound very likely, as is stated in the "official record  of the event," that at the moment when everything occurred  Srdjan Djeric was actually showing his four comrades the  vehicle's steering controls and interior.    The holes in the official communication might have been  filled if the Army had admitted that at the time of the accident  soldiers of the Srpska republic and the Serbian Republic Krajina  were also training in the Subotica Garrison.    One soldier whom the VREME reporter came upon in Subotica  during his visit to that city said that they (soldiers from the  western Serbian areas) have not been there for at least the last  three months (since November), but that they had been and that  they were excellent comrades.    Certain other informants of VREME, military personnel,  explain that the training of these soldiers is considerably  shorter and is frequently done with live ammunition. In other  words, Srdjan Djeric might have been on the training ground at  the same time as his comrades from the krajinas. What in fact  should not have happened is for the officers to be training him  in the same way (with live ammunition), and still less not to be  with him and his comrades in a combat-ready BOV.  <H5>  Strange Disappearances </H5>   The likelihood that all of this did nevertheless occur and  that the Army simply wanted to cover up its own lapses seems  much more likely than the possibility of someone having taken  Srdjan to Bosnia from the garrison, or his having himself  volunteered for some similar mission. A soldier who was our  reporter's informant in Subotica rejects the second possibility  and even says that "his people (the Army of Yugoslavia) would  never have let him cross the Drina."    There are certain other details that also indicate a foolish  cover-up. First of all, it seems that most of those involved in  the entire case are no longer in the Subotica Garrison. The  guards at the gate of the 1st Garrison in Subotica have not seen  Capt. Milovan Kukolj, Djeric's commanding officer, pass through  the gate for a long time now. Another officer, Capt. Vekic, "is  somewhere in the field." A third officer, Major Radoslav  Petrovic, is unable to state the whereabouts of the Privates  Zoran Jovanovic, Davor Dralic, and Radomir Ilic, who according  to the official documents were in the BOV at the time of the  accident, nor the whereabouts of Sergeant Zoran Matovic, who  marched the soldiers to the exercise ground. (Unofficially,  Kukolj and Matovic are under investigation.)    In addition to all that, Maj. Petrovic even says that Srdjan  Djeric was one of the best soldiers, while the unfortunate Sasa  Boskovic, who fired the Zolja, "was immature." Presumably, he is  thereby the only one to blame, case closed. All that is left is  for people to swallow the whole story.    Unfortunately, the Army was unable to make this one wrong  move and leave it at that. It went on to make another. The  coffin which came to the house of Miodrag Djeric contained a  body that did not correspond at all to the findings of the  autopsy at the Military Medical Academy. Miodrag opened the  grave, compared photographs and the findings with what he found,  and held his head in both hands. In short, according to the  findings of the autopsy, Srdjan Djeric's body was almost  entirely charred (and Maj. Petrovic is unhesitating to the  effect that "he saw with his own eyes--the body was burned and  very little of it could be recognized"). Also, to be brief, the  body which Miodrag Djeric dug up was not burned at all and  possessed everything that did not exist in the autopsy  findings--ribs, backbone, lungs, heart, internal organs,  stomach....  <H5>  Ruzica Also Disappeared </H5>   When he made this discovery, Miodrag Djeric wrote up a  request for exhumation and has received no reply to this day.  This kind of behavior on the part of military authorities would  be very strange on the assumption that they are convinced that  the assertions of Miodrag Djeric and five other witnesses who  were present when the grave was opened and the comparison was  made to the photographs from the autopsy are inaccurate. If they  wanted to prove that people under stress saw something other  than what was actually in that grave, they could have no easier  way than exhumation. But if there has been a mistake (an  accidental substitution of bodies at the Military Medical  Academy), the case becomes more complicated, because an extra  corpse has turned up in the whole story. From what training  ground or battlefield did it reach the Military Medical Academy?  That question would probably begin an altogether new tale. That,  of course, should never have been grounds for not explaining to  Miodrag Djeric in the calmest way, long before he came to the  editors of VREME with his story, that what had happened was yet  another stupid mistake, and for not thereupon sending him his  son's body.    As though someone really wanted complications, and so they  gave Miodrag his son's military record, in which there is no  entry at all that he was killed. And they sent him two death  notices. And summons to a trial in which Srdjan Djeric was  supposed to appear in court as an injured party. And in all of  this there emerges the mysterious Mrs. Ruzica Milanovic (VREME's  reporters tried to find her in Mladenovac, but absolutely  without success--she literally vanished), with her story about  Miodrag's son being alive, and when the father asked that  someone check it out, they told him in the police that they  could not, because she "is not an unimportant person." And then  they confirmed to Miodrag in the General Staff of the Army of  Yugoslavia itself that our soldiers are going to Bosnia. And....    Officials of the Army of Yugoslavia have promised that next  week they will arrange a meeting of VREME newsmen with the  people who worked on the case of Srdjan Djeric. Until then, the  most accurate definition of everything that has happened to  Miodrag Djeric and his son was furnished by Vukosava Bogisic,  the records clerk in the Subotica records office, whom a VREME  reporter asked about technical aspects of issuing death  certificates. When she heard about the double death certificate,  she departed from the context of explaining the technique of  reporting a case of death, and said: "When the war stops, we  will see who is alive and who is dead."</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Blow to Hawke as jobless rate surges to 9.9 per cent AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 9.9 per cent in April from 9.3 per cent in the previous month, and is likely to rise further, the government said yesterday. The figures, the worst since October 1983, are a serious blow to Mr Bob Hawke's Labor administration, which is under pressure as a result of recession and the declining popularity of Labor governments at state level. Mr Hawke was forced to abandon a pledge that the government would not allow unemployment to reach 10 per cent. He said there was 'obviously a possibility' that it would do so. The rise in unemployment will increase pressure for a cut in official interest rates, which fell by 6 percentage points last year, but have remained at around 12 per cent since the start of the year. Toyota Australia, a subsidiary of the Japanese car maker, added to the government's difficulties by blaming 'difficult economic conditions' for 400 redundancies announced yesterday, equivalent to 7 per cent of the company's workforce. The opposition Liberal party blamed the worsening employment outlook on the government's tight monetary policy, and claimed unemployment was likely to exceed 10.4 per cent before it begins to turn downwards, probably next year. Mr John Howard, the shadow employment spokesman, also indicated that the opposition will use the high level of unemployment to campaign against the government's wages Accord with the trade union movement. Mr Howard said it would be 'insensitive nonsense' for the government to proceed with the Accord, under which many workers are due to receive a ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.50) pay rise this month, plus a 3 per cent increase in pension payments and provision for further pay rises backed by productivity. The opposition supports a 2.5 per cent across-the-board pay rise, without pension or productivity payments, awarded by the Industrial Relations Commission, the statutory authority which supervises Australia's wage-fixing system. The commission's award is opposed by the government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions , which is planning a campaign of industrial disruption to force employers to pay the full Accord package. Mr Hawke's government suffered a further blow yesterday when Mr Brian Burke, the Australian ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican, bowed to opposition pressure to bring forward his resignation, announced last month. Mr Burke resigned in an attempt to protect the government from embarrassment about his relationship with business leaders while he was Labor premier of Western Australia in the mid-1980s. He intended to retain his post as ambassador until the end of July, but has been under pressure to leave earlier following an appearance before a Royal Commission in Perth, which is investigating his government's business activities. Mr Burke said the federal government would have been in an 'impossible position' if he remained as ambassador. He said he was confident the commission would establish his innocence.</p>

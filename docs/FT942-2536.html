			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: South Africans come to town British investors will soon have access to their first South African investment trust. The Old Mutual South Africa trust, run by the republic's largest life and fund management group, will invest in a wide range of local concerns, although with a bias towards industrial and financial stocks and smaller and medium sized companies. This is because some of the largest, best-known South African companies also have shares traded on the London market, making them easily accessible already to UK investors. But when it comes to smaller companies, Old Mutual thinks its team of 42 analysts can provide value for overseas investors with its stock-picking approach to investment management. Small and medium sized companies may also have more to gain from the restructuring of South Africa's economy as it reintegrates with the rest of the region and the world. Old Mutual says the fund is extremely unlikely to hold gold stocks in the foreseeable future. So, if you are looking for a play on commodities, you would do better to pick one of the specialist gold or mining funds. Institutions are expected to be the main investors in this new fund, but the minimum investment (Pounds 1,000) has been set low enough for smaller investors to get involved, too. The trust is not expected to provide a particularly high yield, though - the Johannesburg stock exchange now returns about 2 per cent. Meanwhile, anyone preferring a unit to an investment trust will not have long to wait. Save &amp; Prosper plans to launch a South African unit trust at the start of July. Offer details, page VII</p>

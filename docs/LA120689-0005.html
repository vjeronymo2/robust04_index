			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> Thieves in Oceanside looted a car while a body was in the back seat, police  said Tuesday. The body was that of Tom Van Do, 23, a Cal Poly Pomona student  who had been missing since Nov. 28. Do had been shot in the head.  </P> <P> Do's body was found after officers answered complaints from residents in the  400 block of Bush Street that a car hadn't been moved in two weeks. But, before  officers could check the car, they had a priority call.  </P> <P> A short time later residents were alerted when the car's alarm went off. They  saw Do's body, partly hidden under a pile of clothing in the back seat.  </P> <P> When police returned they found the car's rear license plate and radio had been  taken. Both had been present when police saw the car earlier. Police speculated  that thieves may have disturbed the clothing that concealed Do when they looted  the car.  </P></p>

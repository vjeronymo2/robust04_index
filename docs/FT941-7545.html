			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Book Review: Northern exposure for the unskilled NORTH-SOUTH TRADE: EMPLOYMENT AND INEQUALITY Clarendon Press, Oxford 482 pages, Pounds 45 In 1930s Britain, a highly qualified professional such as a univer-sity professor earned seven times the average wage and probably employed two full-time servants. Now he or she earns about twice the average wage and might employ someone to clean once a week. Part of the thesis of Adrian Wood's disturbing book is that levels of inequality in the developed world not experienced for 50 years are being re-established as a result of economic convergence between rich and poor countries. For most of the period since the second world war there has been a steady increase in the income of all citizens in the developed world. Though there have been large differences between the passengers, the ship of state has sailed ahead with everyone on board. Adrian Wood believes that the rich and the poor in developed countries are now in different boats, one rising and one sinking. Like Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, in his book The Work of Nations, Wood says the dividing line is no longer between capital and labour but between skilled and unskilled. Wood's book is part of a growing body of work on inequality, which seeks to explain the slump in demand for unskilled labour in developed economies, manifested in falling real wages for many American workers and persistently high unemployment in Europe. But what distinguishes it from the received wisdom is that it places trade with developing countries, rather than technological change, at the centre of the explanation. The argument is summed up by the author with typical clarity in the first paragraph: 'Expansion of trade has linked the labour markets of developed countries (the north) more closely with those of developing countries (the south). This greater economic intimacy has had large benefits, raising average living standards in the north, and accelerating development in the south. But it has hurt unskilled workers in the north, reducing their wages and pushing them out of jobs. Northern governments must take action to solve this problem.' Few would deny that north-south trade has changed significantly in recent years. Instead of the south sending raw materials to the north and the north sending manufactured goods to the south, the relationship is now dominated by the exchange of manufactured goods. The north sends skill-intensive computers to the south and the south sends labour-intensive textiles to the north. But the scale of the change is often not appreciated. The annual value of the south's manufacturing exports to the north has increased from virtually nothing in 1950 to Dollars 250bn in 1990. Some economists say this has had little net impact on employment in the north. As countries such as South Korea (where wages have doubled in the past five years) become richer, they stimulate demand for sophisticated goods from the north. Further, although Dollars 250bn sounds a big figure, it still represents only 3 1/2 per cent of the north's consumption of manufactured goods, up from 1 1/2 per cent in 1970. Thus demand for less skilled labour in the north has only been reduced by a few hundred thousand jobs. Wood disagrees. He says the impact of trade on labour demand in the north is 10 times greater than most previous estimates and has created a 20 per cent fall in demand for unskilled labour across the developed world. Previous calculations, he says, have not accounted for the fact that many northern companies have responded to the threat of southern competition by introducing production methods which eliminate low-skill labour. The south's declining demand for labour-intensive manufactures from the north has also been ignored, as have large areas of manufacturing where the north no longer competes. Not all of these arguments carry equal weight. The observation that northern companies have introduced new production methods raises the question of why they were not doing this anyway, if it was profitable to do so. And with only 18 per cent of employees in Britain working in manufacturing, it seems implausible that such a far-reaching impact on overall job levels should be conducted through such a small group. Why, in any case, is this shift in world trading patterns occurring now? Supporters of the trade case, such as Wood, say that a large gap opened up between wages in the developed world and the undeveloped world in the century to 1960, and that a combination of technology (containerisation), politics (the end of empire and the removal of trade barriers) and education (the trebling of literacy rates in the past 30 years) has only allowed this gap to be exploited by the south relatively recently. Supporters of the technology case as an explanation for inequality can, just as convincingly, point to labour-saving innovations, such as robotics, which did not exist until a few years ago. Nevertheless, Wood has eloquently raised the profile of trade in the debate about skills, equality and employment. Rather disarmingly, he accepts that the technology argument might be equally plausible, but as a strong opponent of protectionism, his policy prescriptions remain the same. The solutions are familiar but well argued: more help for unskilled workers to acquire skills, and income supplements for low-paid workers. The taxes to finance such initiatives should not destroy the incentive to acquire skills. The justification for intervention by governments is that it is unfair that the poorer members of northern society should suffer as a result of changes which benefit the majority. Those who suffer can also make life unpleasant for those who do not. It is preferable, says Wood, to be taxed than to be mugged.</p>

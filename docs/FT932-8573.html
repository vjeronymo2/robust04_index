			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD was fixed at Dollars 369.25 a troy ounce on the London bullion market yesterday afternoon, its highest level since December 1991 and up from the morning setting of Dollars 367.85. Dealers said the market had consolidated last week's gains and was expected to move higher. They noted that it was an absence of selling more than steady buying that was underpinning prices. Some had been expecting producers to sell into the market once it came close to Dollars 370, and have been puzzled by their absence so far. Gold could well break through the Dollars 370 barrier sometime this week, dealers said, which could then trigger further rises on option-related buying. BASE METAL prices closed above earlier lows on the LME, ending mixed, as markets pondered the next move. Dealers said fresh losses were seen in zinc, nickel and lead, while copper at one stage appeared to be heading back towards recent 5 1/2 -year lows. Sentiment is fragile, and when selling emerges, buyers are conspicuous by their absence. Technical factors helped to brake the falls after the heavy losses sustained on Friday.

More than 10,000 workers took to the streets to  participate in the largest labor rally in the past decade. The  movement was headed by the so-called Movement for Union  Organization and Action. Workers are protesting over the  national economic policy and demanding a general salary increase  in the province. The column marched through the downtown area  surrounded by 1,000 police agents. There were no serious  incidents, but noise bombs detonated by demonstrators did  destroy one shop window. Governor Eduardo Angeloz admitted "the  legitimacy of the workers' claims." He said: "Their protest and  claims are reasonable, but regrettably I cannot satisfy their  demands because the economic situation does not allow me to do  so."    Some 88 labor organizations participated in the march. Even  the police supported it, promising to carry out only "preventive  activities for demonstrators security." The schedule called for  the workers to leave their place of work at 1000 and gather on  the corner of Colon and General Paz Streets in downtown Cordoba.  The first groups to arrive were road workers and post office  workers. They were followed by court employees and civil  servants. Sanitary workers and teachers, the most numerous  group, joined them shortly afterward. Representatives of the 80  unions arrived around noon. President Menem's administration and  Eduardo Angeloz' government were the main topic of the protest  songs. [passage omitted]</p>

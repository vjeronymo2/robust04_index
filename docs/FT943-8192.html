			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: ITT lifts its stake in Ciga to 35% ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, has increased its stake in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, from nearly 26 per cent to 35 per cent with purchases on the depressed Milan stock market. Consob, the Italian stock market watchdog, late last month asked the US group to launch a formal bid for further shares in Ciga. However, to the annoyance of other Ciga shareholders - which include a number of Italian investment funds - it is still unclear what the price or timetable of such a bid would be. Consob said yesterday it was up to the US group to decide on the terms. It said it was in 'informal talks' with ITT representatives, and expected the US group to make an official decision shortly. ITT said: 'We are complying with the takeover regulations and final details will become public as appropriate.' ITT made clear that it had control of Ciga at a meeting of the Italian company's shareholders last month, after nearly six months of financial manoeuvring. Since then, the US group has continued to increase its stake on the market. It has also appointed three members to the seven-person board, and indicated it is looking to acquire at least 50.1 per cent. Ciga shares yesterday closed at L1,046, down L21. At that price, the company is valued at just over L1,000bn (Dollars 628.8m).</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Russia to bolster industry as west fears for reforms Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, launched his new government yesterday with a pledge to support Russia's ailing industries - lending weight to claims by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the outgoing finance minister, that Russia was abandoning fiscal discipline. Mr Valentin Sergeyev, the prime minister's spokesman, said the government's reform programme contained only 'elements of western market economics', Itar-Tass news agency reported. 'The mechanical transfer of western economic methods to Russian soil has caused more harm than good,' Mr Sergeyev quoted Mr Chernomyrdin as saying. He said the economic programme, which had been approved by President Boris Yeltsin, would be based on the 'special characteristics of our state, people and Russian traditions'. Economists in the west and Russia continued to express anxiety at the exclusion of key reformers from Russia's new government. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said he did not believe reform was over in Russia. 'What we're concerned about, obviously, is whether they'll be able to manage their inflation problem,' he said. The International Monetary Fund said it might delay sending a team to Moscow for talks because there might be no finance minister to talk to, while Group of Seven representatives conferred anxiously on the government's policy shift. Two prominent western economists, Mr Jeffrey Sachs and Mr Anders Aslund, resigned as advisers to the government. The two men, who have increasingly been seen as foreign meddlers by Russian conservatives, said they strongly opposed the new government's aims. Even within the government, concerns were being expressed, with Mr Sergei Krasavchenko, the radical deputy head of the president's administration, saying he was 'seriously anxious' about the consequences of Mr Fyodorov's resignation. Mr Fyodorov denied that he had been forced to leave for embracing over-radical reform. 'It's not a question of radical reform. It's just fiscal discipline.' Mr Fyodorov said the new government would remain too vulnerable to pressure for handouts it could not afford. That would only encourage enterprises and individual regions to ask for more money, and contribute to the huge debts between enterprises that deliver goods without demanding payment. He also warned of corruption. Man in the news, Page 6</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Sotnikova: ``Concept Prepared for </F> Protection of Populace From Radiation'']    [Text] In connection with the intensive radioactive  contamination of the local area in a number of regions of  Russia, by direction of Boris Yeltsin, work began in 1992 on a  ``Concept for Protection of the Population and Economic Activity  on Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination.''  Yesterday, at a ``round table'' at the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources, its draft was introduced for  discussion by specialists.    The document, prepared by staff members at the Institute for  Radiation Hygiene of Russia, formulates scientific principles  and basic methods for practical implementation of measures for  protecting the populace on territories contaminated by  radionuclides.    The principal aim of these measures is to protect the health  of the populace. And the way to achieve this is--reducing the  level of irradiation [obluchenie] from all basic sources of  radiation [izluchenie] (based on the principle of optimization),  medical protection, an increased level of radiation-hygienic  knowledge, psychological protection of the people, and  increasing their social and legal defense. Also defined in the  draft are principles of economic activity on these territories  after a long period of time has elapsed since their  contamination.    Except for the section on gradation of contamination levels  the remaining constituent parts of the concept raised no  disagreement. The basis for gradation was a new scale developed  by the authors of the document for evaluating the radioactive  contamination of territories, which divides the territory into  three zones--a radiation defense zone, a voluntary evacuation  zone, and an exclusion zone.    The optimal indicator of radiation level in Russia, as in  the  countries of Europe, is acknowledged to be a dose of radiation  [radiatsiya] of one mZv [presumably, ``milliZievert''] (a Zivert  [named for Swedish scientist G.R. Siewert] is a measure of the  cumulative effect of chronic irradiation of a human being in  small doses). The maximum allowable dose of radiation incurred  when carrying out certain protective and preventive measures is  considered to be five mZv. But according to estimates by the  primary opponent--the Socio-Ecological Union--this indicator  should be significantly reduced; and, in its opinion, the  lowering of radiation stress should be encouraged as well.  According to analysis by the round-table participants, one  cannot orient oneself on Europe in questions of defense against  radioactive contamination: its level in Russia is incomparable  higher. Thus, it is highly likely that the levels of radiation  safety in the program of the Russian government will be greatly  reduced in comparison with that of civilized countries.  <H5>  Recommendations for Residents of a Contaminated Area </H5>   1. Every person who lives in a radioactive contamination  zone  has the right to know their received and projected irradiation  dose.    2. One must take into consideration not only the benefit,  but  also the harm from defensive measures connected with changing  one's way of life. Therefore, a person must take the basic  decisions independently. The decision to dwell on contaminated  territories in terms of the amount of risk is comparable with  other decisions in life. For example, smoking presents a much  greater risk to one's health, to include oncological diseases,  than living in a radiation monitoring zone.    3. One should not strive to limit one's food intake  groundlessly; an insufficient or unbalanced diet can lead to  reduction of one's anti-tumoral and anti-infection immunity. One  must regularly include vegetables and fruits in one's diet, and  water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins are effective means of  prevention of tumoral diseases and the consequences of  irradiation.    4. One need not limit one's time in the fresh air, nor  swimming in reservoirs--limiting one's mobility is very harmful.    5. A state of constant psycho-emotional pressure (stress),  often caused by highly exaggerated fear of radiation, is an  enormous threat to the health of the populace living on  contaminated territories.</p>

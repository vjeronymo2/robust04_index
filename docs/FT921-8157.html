			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Head of Amstrad's French connection calls it a day AMSTRAD, the UK-based consumer electronics group which slipped into the red for the first time last year through the recession and the hiatus in the personal computer market, suffers a fresh blow today with the departure of Mrs Marion Vannier, head of the group's French company. Mrs Vannier, now 42 and one of the most trusted associates of Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's chairman, resigned as president-directeur general of the French subsidiary and from the board of Amstrad late last week. She had run Amstrad France for 10 years and had been established as one of France's best known businesswomen. Until recently, Amstrad France was the UK electronics concern's most important overseas subsidiary. In the year to June 1991 the French offshoot contributed Pounds 66.3m to Amstrad's worldwide revenues of Pounds 528m. Germany, buoyed by satellite dish sales, contributed Pounds 96m and has now overtaken France as the most significant overseas subsidiary. In the first six months of the current year, the group as a whole incurred a loss of Pounds 15.1m on sales of Pounds 196.1m. Mrs Vannier said yesterday that she had not yet decided her next move but it was certain that she would remain in business: 'It is what I know how to do best'. Her track record is impeccable. After moving in three years from junior assistant to sales director of a French electrical distributor, she established Amstrad France in 1982, building the business virtually singlehanded. The split with the company seems amicable on the surface with the Amstrad board playing tribute to her years of loyal service. But it is clear that the fiercely independent Mrs Vannier misses the freedom and excitement of the company's early days when she ran the French operation from a tiny office above a boulangerie on Sevres main road and when Mr Sugar allowed her laisser faire in almost every aspect of company policy. She said yesterday: 'I built the company up from nothing and I have given it my best. Now the rules have changed and the management is different. Decision making is becoming centralised in the UK. 'Furthermore, many of Amstrad's new products - satellite dishes, for example  -are not suited to the French market'. Games computers, an area from which Amstrad is withdrawing, were particularly strong in the French market. Divorced with a young family, Mrs Vannier sold her 500,000 Amstrad shares last year at 40p a share to cover, the company said, personal expenses. During 1991 Mr Sugar appointed Mr Bernard Steiner, formerly of Sansui Electronics, to take charge of sales and marketing in mainland Europe and Australia. Mr Steiner has now formally taken responsibility for managing Amstrad France.</p>

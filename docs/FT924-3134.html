			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Parisian transport experiment collapses PARIS'S first experiment with privately-run public transport flopped yesterday when the backers of Orlyval, a driverless automatic train, admitted they would have to write off FFr1bn (Dollars 187m) of debts and hand control of the lossmaking line to the state. The line, built for FFr1.75bn by Matra, the transport-to-defence electronics group, is to go into voluntary liquidation and be taken over and run by RATP, the state-owned Parisian public transport board, because it has attracted far fewer passengers than budgeted. Orlyval, opened in October 1991, links Orly airport with the nearest suburban rail line and is an important showcase for Matra's vehicule automatique leger. It is Matra's second Val in France, after the publicly-run automatic metro in the northern city of Lille. The private group which owns Orlyval is 34.7 per cent held by a consortium of banks, headed by Banque Indosuez, with 26.7 per cent held by Air Inter, the domestic airline, 18 per cent by Lyonnais des Eaux-Dumez, the construction and water distribution group, 17.3 per cent by Matra and 3.3 per cent by the RATP. An Indosuez spokesman said yesterday that the group owed FFr1.58bn to its backers, of which the banks and the other shareholders had agreed to abandon two-thirds. Orlyval will be able to pay back FFr250m before liquidation, while the RATP is prepared to pay back another FFr330m from future operating profits, said the Indosuez official. Orlyval carries 5,000 passengers per day, or 1.5m annually, well under half the 4m passengers per year its backers were expecting. As a result, it made a FF58.1m loss in its first year. It cut fares and launched a promotional campaign last summer to try to attract more passengers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', chief of the PLO </F> Economic Department, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio,  from the "With the Events" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Apparently, there is no alternative to  resuming the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. What is the  solution for the resumption of these negotiations?    [Quray'] First of all, we believe there is no alternative to  negotiations in order to implement the Declaration of Principles  signed in Washington. However, the negotiations cannot be  resumed without providing an appropriate climate and the  necessary conditions to resume them. Therefore, confidence,  which has been undermined, must be restored and there should be  an appropriate climate. The Israeli Government should work  seriously to provide this climate because matters are in its  hands, and not in the hands of others at all. The Israeli  Government should first ensure that settlers will not move about  carrying weapons outside their homes, if it is unable to  immediately disarm them. The second point is that there should  be a serious discussion about dismantling a certain group of  settlements, since those settlements constitute a real threat to  the peace process. The third point is that the Palestinian  people are worried about their security. After the Declaration  of Principles has been signed and while we are discussing with  the Israelis the security issues that concern them, it is now  time to have a serious discussion about the security of the  Palestinians. The real threat is the one against Palestinian  security. Therefore, the Palestinians should rest assured that  there is protection for them. Why not have an international  presence? Why not?    [Mu'addi] Do these conditions represent the minimum demands  in order to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations?    [Quray'] First of all, I did not set conditions. I spoke  about providing an appropriate climate conducive to the success  of the negotiations. This massacre has created a psychological  shock. Therefore, an appropriate climate should be created.  This is not in our hands. It is in the hands of the Israeli  Government. The ball now is in the Israeli Government's court.  If it wants this process to succeed and this agreement to be  implemented, then it should promptly take these measures.  Another question, which I believe should be taken into  consideration if the Israelis are serious, is that a committee  should be formed now to hold negotiations on the question of  settlements. I know the discussion of settlement activity was  postponed until the final status negotiations, but this massacre  has proven that settlements should be discussed now. I am not  setting this as a condition related to the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, but I am pointing out this issue so that it can be  discussed as of now. By the time the final negotiations are  held, this process will have made major steps and some measures  probably will have been taken.    [Mu'addi] Don't you think that these proposals or conditions  mean the reopening of the Oslo accord?    [Quray'] The Oslo accord is open in the first place, and it  is being negotiated. What is proposed here is not amending it,  but giving it dynamism and vitality. As is the case with any  agreement, the stages of its negotiation and implementation  create dynamism and vitality to make it succeed should there be  any obstacles. So we are only opening the negotiations about  settlement activity. Why not do this? This does not mean that  the Oslo agreement has been rejected or that its file has been  reopened, as has been said. Israel is attempting to go forward  without resolving the problems obstructing implementation. This  should not happen.    [Mu'addi] It was announced in Tunis today that a Palestinian  committee of inquiry was formed to investigate the criminal  incident in Hebron. What will this committee do and is it  possible for it to cooperate with the Israeli counterpart  committee?    [Quray'] It is simply a fact-finding committee to compile a  complete file about this ugly, horrendous, unprecedented  massacre. Regarding the possibility of cooperation, well, this  committee is going to find all the facts and everything that is  necessary to have all the information.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray'. Thank you very much.    [Quray'] You are welcome.</p>

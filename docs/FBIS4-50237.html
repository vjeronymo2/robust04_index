In 1993, the region  achieved a GNP of 3.65 billion yuan, an increase of 8.1 percent  over the previous year in terms of comparable prices. The  economies of agricultural and pastoral areas have developed  steadily. Last year, peasants and herdsmen had a per-capita  income of 521 yuan, and the production of vegetables, meats, and  butter basically met the daily needs of urban and rural  residents. Industry, communications, and production have  experienced comparatively substantial growth. Infrastructure  developments with an emphasis on energy, communications, and  telecommunications have proceeded smoothly, positive trends have  been maintained for the development of foreign trade and  tourism, new developments have been made in urban and rural  market systems, and business and the markets have been brisk.  New developments have been made in many social undertakings,  including education, public health, sport, science and  technology, and culture, and the work on nationality religions  has been strengthened further.    In the government work report, Gyaincain Norbu carefully  announced: All policies have been implemented. From 1980 to  the end of 1993, a total of 220 million yuan was spent on this  implementation, and of that approximately 100 million was spent  on temples and monasteries. United front, nationality, and  religion policies have been thoroughly completed, thus  consolidating and developing a stable and united political  situation.</p>

Although the  elections have been officially declared valid because the  statute on this organ of representative power adopted by the  oblast soviet enables it to start work with any quorum, the  assembly's viability with only half its members seems extremely  doubtful.    Even in rural districts the voter turnout has sharply  decreased. As regards the city, it can be said that Lipetsk  boycotted the elections en masse. Because of the low turnout of  city inhabitants at polling stations (between 11 and 24  percent), they were not valid in a single one of the oblast  center's districts. Not a single deputy was elected to the city  organ of representative power.</p>

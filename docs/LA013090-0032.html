			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: WHY CAN'T MUSICIANS DRESS IN CONCERT WITH GOOD TASTE?  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS  </P> <P> There is one thing that bothers me about concerts. Does it bother you?  </P> <P> A group appears on stage to perform -- anything from a full symphony orchestra  to an ensemble of six or seven. The men are dressed in tuxes. But the women are  another story.  </P> <P> What goes with men in black tuxes? Some years ago, the women usually wore long,  black dresses. But apparently now women are allowed to choose their own garb as  long as it meets the color preference.  </P> <P> Some women come in sloppy black sweaters and tight black pants and sit with  their legs wide apart -- and I am not talking about cello players. Sometimes  the women look as if they are dressed for a jog in the park rather than an  appearance on stage.  </P> <P> The most disgusting sight recently was a woman whose stomach was so fat and  whose pants were so tight that I couldn't concentrate on anything but hoping  the seams would last until the evening was over. Maybe I sit too close to the  front.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- The conventional facial expression assumed by satisfied  concert-goers -- a sort of Silly Symphony serenity, in which the eyes gaze  blankly upward and slightly to the right, while the mouth is fixed in a  half-smile -- does not allow much fashion scrutiny.  </P> <P> But Miss Manners does not consider that to be an excuse for performers (or  audience, for that matter) to dress sloppily. And indeed, when she peeked, she  found your observations to be largely correct.  </P> <P> A long black dinner dress or an equivalently dressy blouse and skirt  combination form proper concert dress for female orchestra players. Unlike the  dinner clothes (Miss Manners cannot bring herself to say "tux" or even  "tuxedo") for male musicians, such a costume can be put together with some  individuality and in any price range.  </P> <P> Perhaps gentlemen orchestra conductors are too timid to make such demands. If  so, they would not be the first towering figures to quail at the prospect of  dictating fashion to ladies. Miss Manners hopes at least that ladies who are  conductors are not fooled by the plea that ladies' evening dress can be defined  to mean anything the lady wishes to wear.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- How do you end a friendship with someone who refuses to  take the hint?  </P> <P> Seven years ago, I began a yearlong friendship (no dating) with a man with whom  I had a few lunches and dinners and many long conversations. I became his dear  friend -- in his eyes.  </P> <P> He was an odd hard-luck case whom I felt rather sorry for, and he began to make  me very uncomfortable. So I began making excuses for not seeing him, wouldn't  take his calls at the office, and ended the conversation quickly when he did  reach me.  </P> <P> That was six years ago, and he still calls. If I had dated him, I could say,  "It's best we don't speak," but we never dated. Is it polite to say, "Don't  call me anymore," and is there some excuse I can use to make it less painful  for him?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners too would like to be gentle with a hard-luck case  who fancies he has a friend in a lady who has refused to see him for six years.  She suggests that this impulse be weighed against the nuisance value involved.  </P> <P> How often does he call? If it is once or twice a year, Miss Manners suggests  you allow him to continue in his illusion. If it is once a month, you might add  to your usual refusal: "You know, I lead such a busy life that it's rather  hopeless to expect that we will be able to get together. But I appreciate your  thinking of me."  </P></p>

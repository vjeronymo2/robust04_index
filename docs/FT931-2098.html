			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: A high price to pay for high wages in the east A week ago, German politicians were jubilant about agreeing on a solidarity pact aimed at financing the economic reconstruction of eastern Germany. But a deepening wage dispute in eastern Germany is dampening the euphoria. IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade union, is threatening a strike if its members in the five eastern German states do not receive a 26 per cent pay increase beginning on April 1. This pay increase stems from a March 1991 contract designed to bring eastern German wages up to the level of their western German counterparts by April 1994 but which the employers are now trying to revoke. The contract was made between the former communist managers of east German industry, Gesamtmetall, the west German employers association, and IG Metall. For political reasons, the managers wanted high wages for its employees, regardless of the cost. The west German employers saw high wages as a way of preventing eastern Germany from posing any serious competition for western German companies. But the agreement failed to take into account the very different levels of productivity in the two economies. Today, eastern German wages are about 70 per cent of western German levels, but productivity in the steel, engineering, and electrical sectors is 70 per cent below western German levels. The result is that unit labour costs in the east are already 80 per cent above western German levels. Economic forecasts for 1993 show that eastern Germany's gross domestic product will total DM201bn (Pounds 82.65bn), while the wage bill will exceed DM248bn. In western Germany, GDP for this year is estimated to be DM2,223bn, and wages around DM1,555bn. Gesamtmetall has realised its error and is now trying to pull out of the contract, invoking a revision clause giving it the right to do so in view of the deteriorating economic conditions in eastern Germany. It is prepared to offer a 9 per cent increase. IG Metall is now threatening to call an all-out strike on April 1 and has already staged a series of warning strikes throughout the region. Mr Heiner Flassbeck, a senior economist at DIW, the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, says that the chance of the emergence of a strong, and vibrant mittelstand, the small and medium-sized companies which formed the backbone of the western German economy, is unlikely to prosper if unit labour costs continue to rise. A report published by the DIW shows that, in a survey of 3,200 privatised eastern German enterprises, 60 per cent have serious competitive problems. Many are not generating profits largely because, as the graph shows, in eastern Germany there is hardly any gap between the labour costs and productivity per hour. This means that existing enterprises are not in a position to invest, let alone think of expanding, while the obstacles to new small enterprises are high. 'These enterprises face external and internal pressures,' says Mr Flassbeck. 'The external pressure is from the Bundesbank. Interest rates are still too high. Banks will not lend to these enterprises because they are strapped for cashflow. The internal pressure is from IG Metall. Wages are too high,' he added. Mr Flassbeck argues that a 26 per cent rise will deter foreign (and western German) investment, and prevent investment by the new eastern German enterprises. IG Metall says that if it caves into the employers and accepts a 9 per cent rise, the employers will have won the first round in their attempts to undermine Germany's collective wage bargaining system. It also argues that it wants a 26 per cent increase for its members because eastern Germans have to pay western German prices for most items. The chemical and energy and utilities sectors in eastern Germany, however, have settled for 9 per cent. IG Metall also knows that if its members are afterwards made redundant they will obtain more unemployment benefit because benefits are linked to wage levels. Yet the 1.2m already unemployed in eastern Germany will not benefit in any way from a 26 per cent increase. The already massive cuts in east German employment largely explains why productivity in eastern Germany rose at a rate of 60 per cent from the beginning of the first quarter of 1991 to the last quarter of 1992. Economists at DIW believe that IG Metall's high wage demands will mean that the sacrifices of the unemployed in eastern Germany will have been made in vain: they have no chance of getting work because money saved from their jobs, instead of being invested, will have been soaked up by wages. IG Metall might yet be prepared to compromise by putting back the timetable towards income parity in return for job guarantees and/or subsidies for its members who work in enterprises which are not yet privatised. Its members fear for their jobs and do not have the stomach for a strike. But any compromise will be useless if it fails to give the fledgling enterprises in eastern Germany an opportunity to start allowing wages to lag behind productivity costs which would then give them a chance to invest and compete.</p>

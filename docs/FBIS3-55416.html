Briefing newsmen in Moscow on Thursday, Foreign Ministry  spokesman Grigoriy Karasin suggested that this step reflected  the sentiments of "certain political forces which regard  alignment with military and political unions as the key to  national security."    He called "for giving more thought to what is of prime  importance for guaranteed stability in Europe."    Moscow, in his words, favors "a genuinely European security  system for all states, collective actions to meet any challenge  today, and efforts to boost the CSCE potential."    "Equal security for each and everyone and cooperation rather  than new dividing lines between states - that's what Europe  requires today," Karasin declared.    In his words, such an approach prevails in CSCE, in the  North  Atlantic Cooperation Council, and in NATO itself. No wonder,  the concept "Partnership for Peace" has been devised to  strengthen security across Europe rather than within blocs. The  concept has drawn much response.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Proposed forces cuts threaten UK's role in Bosnia BRITAIN could not undertake further long-term peacekeeping responsibilities in Bosnia without a review of the armed forces cuts suggested in the Options for Change programme, defence officials told MPs yesterday. The cross-party defence committee was also told the UK had rejected a US request to send ground troops to Somalia because of the strain the army's commitments were already causing. Separately, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, gave a warning that Britain's ability to play an active role in seeking to resolve international conflicts had to be limited. 'Obviously we cannot be everywhere and we cannot do everything,' he said in a speech at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Diplomatic postings were undermanned compared with the UK's main colleagues and competitors. He was particularly discouraging about the prospect of a greater role for the UK in Bosnia. 'To impose and guarantee order in the former Yugoslavia would take huge forces and huge risks over an indefinite period.' The defence committee's report, due to be published on February 9, is expected to call on ministers to rethink the programme of reductions in the light of the threats to international stability that have emerged since the end of the Cold War. Labour has renewed its demand for an urgent review of defence policy. Mr Bill Reeves, a senior defence official, told the committee the number of troops needed to enforce the UN peace plan, which proposes breaking up Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, was so large that the decision would have to be for ministers. One estimate is that more than double the number of UK troops in place now would have to be sent. The committee was also told that even in a crisis the army could not send a second battalion with Warrior armoured vehicles to Bosnia to reinforce the Cheshire battalion group in the immediate future because troops were tied up in Northern Ireland.

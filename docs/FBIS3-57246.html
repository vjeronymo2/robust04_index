After losing two men killed and several wounded the  mojahedin retreated. During the battle the local population  liberated two fellow villagers seized by the Afghans.    The authorities of Gorno-Badakhshan and representatives of  the headquarters of the command of the Russian border troops in  Tajikistan protested to the Afghan side and demanded that the  organizers of this provocation are brought to justice.    The press center of the Russian border troops' command in  Tajikistan reports that the situation in other sections along  the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border remains complicated, but under  control. According to the same source, no armed incidents in  the Moskovskiy, Pyandzhskiy and other sections of the border  have been registered in the last two days.</p>

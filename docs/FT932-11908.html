			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lord Forte to retire from board FORTE, Britain's largest hotel and restaurants group, yesterday handed over formal control to a new generation with the announcement that Lord Forte, its founder, was to retire from the board together with five other long-serving directors. The retirement of Lord Forte, 59 years after he set up his first milk bar in London's Regent Street, comes six months after he handed over the chairmanship to his son, Mr Rocco Forte. At the time, the company said that Lord Forte would remain on the board as president as his experience remained a valuable resource for the group. The announcement that Lord Forte, 84, will now retire from the board at the group's annual meeting next month strengthens his son's claim that he is in charge of the company. Mr Forte has appointed three well-respected non-executive directors - Sir Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Guinness, Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo, and Mr Alan Wheatley, departing chairman of 3i - since taking over as chairman. The retiring directors have over 200 years of service between them. They include Mr Eric Hartwell, 77, a partner in the original milk bar business and now a non-executive director. Another departing non-executive is Mr Donald Durban, who joined the Trust Houses company in 1939. Trust Houses merged with Forte in 1970. Also going is Sir David McNee, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner who has been a non-executive director for 10 years. Two executive directors - Mr Dennis Hearn, who has been running the US business, and Mr Ian Johnston, managing director of Forte Supplies - are leaving at the end of this month.</p>

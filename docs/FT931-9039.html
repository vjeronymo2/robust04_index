			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent subdued in absence of Wall Street WITH US markets closed activity on the Continent was restrained yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT finished with the DAX index just 3.28 higher at 1,664.71, but from pre-market to post-bourse it moved in a 2 per cent range, and progressively higher. Turnover fell from DM7bn to DM5.6bn as the DAX recovered from a fall to 1,650 in the pre-bourse, and as the German component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index climbed higher in the afternoon. The mood of the market was exemplified in the performance of Volkswagen, for which Mr Klaus-Jurgen Melzner, of DB Research, downgraded his 1992 dividend forecast to DM4 from last year's DM11, observing that he was looking to a loss, and no dividend, in 1993. VW bottomed at DM288.50, recovered to close DM6.70 lower on DM291, and picked up another DM1.50 after hours. Among other blue chips, Allianz was quoted DM10 higher at DM2,230 and Schering rose DM11 to DM719. Preussag, the engineering and steel group, rose by DM5.10 to DM379.20. In the same sector, Linde rose DM10.50 to DM788 and Deutsche Babcock by DM3 to DM159 on a DM240m order to build four 250 megawatt power plants outside of Beijing. PARIS saw a strong rise in CGIP after trading in Carnaud Metalbox, in which it has a 25.3 per cent stake, was suspended before the start of business following an announcement by UK group, MB-Caradon, that it was to sell its own stake. CGIP improved FFr73 to FFr1,085. The CAC-40 index closed 12.40 lower at 1,899.49 in turnover of some FFr2bn. Peugeot gained FFr8 to FFr623 following its announcement of 1992 sales after Friday's close. AMSTERDAM closed early because of technical problems, the CBS just 0.2 firmer at 99.1. Before trading was halted Fokker stood 17 per cent higher on the day, up Fl 1.80 at Fl 12.30, on news after Friday's close that the Dutch government had accepted revised terms for the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in the group by Dasa. KLM went against the trend with a Fl 1.40 loss to Fl 25.70 in low volume on domestic newspaper reports of financial difficulties at Northwest Airlines, even though the Dutch operator said earlier this month that it had written down the remaining book value of its 20 per cent stake in Wings Holdings, parent group of Northwest. MILAN closed the February account with Fiat building on Friday's gains, assisted by early rumours, later denied, that Deutsche Bank was considering increasing its present 2.6 per cent stake in the car maker. Fiat fixed at L5,140, up L444, before easing to L5,080 on the kerb after the German bank said that it had no plans to lift its investment. The Comit index advanced 8.12 to 500.25. STOCKHOLM remained firm with property stocks generally stronger after weekend reports that the sector will be a beneficiary of lower interest rates. Skanska improved SKr1 to SKr95 as the Affarsvarlden index put on 2.5 to 983.7 in turnover of some SKr1.1bn. Astra was firm ahead of its 1992 results due next Monday while there was also speculation that it may announce a scrip issue or share split. The B shares rose SKr7 to SKr700. OSLO fell back with some investors discouraged by the failure of the Opec meeting at the weekend to agree new oil production levels. The all-share index fell 3.70 to 403.68 in turnover of NKr425.8m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr1.50 to NKr165. VIENNA cleared the 800 hurdle again, the ATX index rising 10.32 to 801.33 in a market which seemed short of stock. The day's winners included the cellulose fibre manufacturer, Lenzing, which rose Sch17 to Sch554, and Creditanstalt preferred, Sch15 up at Sch510. ISTANBUL's market index hit a second consecutive two-year-high, closing 96.62, or 1.8 per cent higher at 5,341.46. TEL AVIV closed sharply higher after the treasury and the central bank said that they will not intervene in the market. Private investors and provident funds were dominant as the blue chip index recouped 4.35, or 2.2 per cent to 202.69 in good volume of Shk254m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 15                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open     10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1131.51  1131.22    1131.33    1131.98 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1183.46  1183.37    1183.59    1183.93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00    14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1132.33  1132.34    1133.10    1132.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1183.55  1183.49    1183.92    1184.15  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 12    Feb 11    Feb 10     Feb 9     Feb 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1129.97   1126.71   1121.50   1124.14   1131.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1181.05   1175.45   1171.08   1177.40   1190.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1133.26; 200 - 1185.36 Low/day: 100 - 1131.05 200 - 1182.50.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

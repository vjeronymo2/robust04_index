			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Thailand to get offshore banking THE THAI cabinet has approved the establishment of a Bangkok International Banking Facility, which will allow foreign and local banks to set up offshore banking units (OBUs) with the initial aim of channelling funds to investments in the developing countries of Indochina. It was one of the last decisions of the interim government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, who has introduced numerous economic liberalisation measures during his two terms as prime minister. A general election is being held on Sunday. The cabinet approved a plan permitting OBU licences and tax incentives for an unlimited number of local and foreign banks with branches in Thailand, and to as many as 20 foreign banks with no branches in the country. Some Bank of Thailand officials regard the OBUs as a first step in an ambitious project to make Thailand into a regional financial centre, but others in Bangkok expect a slow start. Dollars held by Thais overseas could probably be lured into the new system but only if the Thai OBUs offer interest rate premiums over their competitors, the bankers say. And on the lending side, Indochina is still regarded as a very high-risk market. Several international banks have expressed an interest in the project. Those with branches in Thailand will divert business to their OBUs for tax purposes, and banks not represented in the country are likely to see an OBU licence as a chance to enter a restricted banking market. 'New banking licences are like gold dust, especially in the developing world,' said one banker yesterday. Among the benefits of the OBU licence will be a corporate income tax rate of 10 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, a waiver of the 3.3 per cent turnover tax, and a waiver of the 10 per cent withholding tax on interest payments (although this last incentive does not apply to loans directed into the Thai domestic market). Detailed regulations are expected to be announced soon, and a joint committee headed by the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, will screen applications. 'This is basically to make Thailand more at par with other financial centres where tax privileges are enjoyed,' Mr Pisit Leeahtam of the central bank said yesterday.</p>

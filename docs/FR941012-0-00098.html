			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA believes that a requirement mandating eye and face protection is necessary. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries reported involved the eyes and face (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In the final rule, OSHA is requiring only that such protection be worn whenever there is the potential for head injury due to falling or flying objects. OSHA agrees with the commenters that the potential for eye and face injury is present especially for fellers, buckers and chippers, however, there are other logging operations in which the potential for this type of injury also exists. In any logging operations when there is no danger of being struck by falling or flying objects, eye protection is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employers, under the PPE standard, will have to conduct a hazard assessment to determine when and where those hazards may exist in the logging workplace. In some cases, the presence of the hazard will be obvious (e.g., fellers and buckers). In other cases, working conditions may be such that there is no potential for injury (e.g., yarder operator working inside an enclosed cab).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the head protection provision, OSHA has retained the eye and face protection provision to alert the industry that falling objects, in addition to flying objects, are a hazard for employees in the logging industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> First-Aid Kits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that employers provide first-aid kits. The proposed standard contained this provision. First aid kits are also required by every State Plan State logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement in general.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule requires that first-aid kits be at each work site when felling is being conducted, at each landing and on each employee transport vehicle. The proposed rule stated that first-aid kits be provided ``at the work site.'' Several commenters said that OSHA should define the term ``work site'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63) in the final rule. They also said that having kits available at the landing should provide adequate protection. However, another commenter said chain-saw operators working away from the landing need first-aid kits and should each be required to carry a small first-aid kit that contains supplies to stop bleeding (Ex. 5&hyph;28).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, OSHA has clarified its intention regarding having first-aid kits at each work site. First, the records shows that first-aid kits are necessary at each work site when felling is being conducted and not just at landings. According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at the cutting site, while only one-fifth of the injuries were at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that immediate assistance must be provided for injured cutters. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, many logging establishments have central offices, but their crews are performing operations miles from that central location. OSHA has received testimony that cutting crews are often spread out and in remote locations (Ex. 5&hyph;34; Tr. OR 21). These commenters said crews are often located more than one-half hour away from a central office or spread across five square miles. First-aid kits that require that much time to access are of limited value to an injured employee. When an injury is severe, the lack of immediately accessible first-aid materials and trained personnel could result in permanent disability or death. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that first-aid kits be provided at each work site where trees are being felled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, OSHA is also requiring first-aid kits to be provided at each landing. As discussed above, one-fifth of all injuries reported in the WIR survey occurred at landings (Ex. 2&hyph;1). First-aid kits at landings are also necessary to provide assistance to other injured employees, such as those on skid trails. According to the WIR survey, nearly one-fifth of employees injured were on skid trails.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, OSHA is retaining the requirement from the proposed rule that first-aid kits be provided on each crew vehicle. The WIR survey indicates that employees are injured on employer-built roads while enroute to and from work sites (Ex. 2&hyph;1). One commenter stated that requiring first-aid kits on each employee transport vehicle could result in several kits being at each work site (Ex. 5&hyph;35). Nothing in the standard prohibits an employer from using the employee transport vehicle kits by a felling crew during the workshift, provided they are returned to the crew vehicle when it is moved at the end of the workshift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

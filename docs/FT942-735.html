			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Tom Scott jumps ship Swan Hunter's shipbuilding manager Tom Scott, the man who has kept outfitting work on target on the company's last three frigates despite receivership and mass redundancies, has left for a new job. Scott, 55, starts work next Monday at Yarrow on the Clyde, where he will be supervising the outfitting of another three Type 23 frigates, won against stiff competition from Swans a couple of years ago. He has spent more than 20 years at Swan Hunter, but continuing uncertainty over the company's future, and the offer of a plum job as Yarrow's divisional manager in charge of post launch work, tipped the balance and he quit the Tyneside shipbuilder on Friday. Scott is modest about his achievement in motivating Swan's workforce through such a difficult 13 months since receivership. 'If ever a workforce deserved success it's Swan's for what they've done.' The Ministry of Defence has yet to decide on which yard should refit the landing ship Bedivere; among the competitors for the refit, on which Swan's future depends, is Yarrow.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices slip World oil prices took a fall yesterday as traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange started selling heating oil futures in the belief that the worst of the Arctic winter in the US was over, reports Reuter. At the London International Petroleum Exchange the April futures contract for the world benchmark Brent Blend of crude oil traded as low as Dollars 13.45 a barrel, down 31 cents from Friday, before rallying in the afternoon. Brokers said the decline was led by the Nymex where heating oil tumbled on forecasts of above-normal US temperatures later this week. At midday Nymex's March heating oil futures contract was down 2.5 cents, about 5 per cent, to just under 48.5 cents a US gallon. It was Europe's turn to feel the cold as icy Siberian winds swept westward. But wholesalers said consumer stocks of heating fuel in Germany - the biggest European market - were relatively high, so the European cold snap might have to last some time before it had an impact on oil demand. In the longer term, the Vienna-based secretariat of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast of likely underlying oil demand in the forthcoming April-June quarter. An Opec official said the latest estimate was for a requirement for the cartel's oil of 23.17m barrels a day, down 240,000 from its previous estimate.</p>

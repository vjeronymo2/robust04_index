Butrus-Ghali had asked Yasushi Akashi, his special  representative for the former Yugoslavia, to study the  feasibility of using the air power offered by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation at its summit last week.    The NATO leaders made the proposal as part of tougher action  to relieve a contingent of Canadian UN troops trapped in the  eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla airport in  northeastern Bosnia to humanitarian flights.    Butrus-Ghali met with top aides here Monday on the NATO  offer  and asked Akashi to formulate a plan for the troop rotation in  Srebrenica, which is under siege by the Serbs, UN spokeswoman  Therese Gastaut said.    "A second plan is to be prepared with regard to the possible  opening of Tuzla airport and the resources that are necessary to  achieve this aim," she told reporters.    Gastaut sidestepped questions whether the operations would  involve the use of NATO air power saying that the option was  "part of a general discussion" and "that we will see when we get  to it."    Also at the meeting here were UN peace envoy Thorvald  Stoltenberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and  other top UN aides. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / IRA tune fails to slow tempo of City beat: The Square Mile's tough-minded new police chief The IRA ceasefire is unlikely to mean a relaxation in the near future of tough security measures introduced to protect the City after last year's bomb attack, according to the City's new police commissioner, Mr William Taylor. In his first interview since his appointment in April, Mr Taylor underlined the dangers of rushing to ease counter-terrorist measures which include high-profile policing, roadblocks, a restrictive traffic scheme and increasing video surveillance. 'This is a time for politicians to be talking. The business of policing will come later. At this stage law enforcement should not be getting ahead of the political situation,' he said. Mr Taylor refused to be drawn on the political situation in Northern Ireland, but said he felt 'entirely satisfied' that the continuing security measures were 'proportionate' to the perceived threat. Mr Taylor's views are thought to reflect the cautious attitude within the security forces to the IRA ceasefire. It is understood that security assessments of IRA intentions remain confused. As well as being responsible for an area covering many potential terrorist targets, Mr Taylor chairs the Association of Chief Police Officers' crime committee and is the association's adviser on terrorism. Mr Taylor, speaking at the City force's headquarters in Old Jewry, was anxious that complacency in some political quarters about the intentions of the IRA should not undermine the City's improved security, which has involved increased co-operation between police and business. 'Crime of all sorts in the City has tumbled and that is a consequence of a very real partnership between police and the business community.' The crime rate in the City fell 10 per cent last year and a further 17 per cent in the first quarter of this year according to police figures. Mr Taylor conceded that efforts to arrest and bring to trial those responsible for last year's IRA Bishopsgate bomb attack had so far failed because of lack of sufficient evidence. But he claimed the fight against terrorism had become more efficient over the past five years, with growing co-operation between regional police forces and acceptance of the primacy of MI5, the security agency, in intelligence-gathering. 'There is now a willingness to follow a lead in a way that perhaps has been absent in the past.' He spoke of 'a successful level of co-ordination and co-operation' between police and MI5, but said he was not in favour of the creation of a new national anti-terrorist unit or the extention of MI5's powers. 'Any suggestion of change has to be looked at very carefully and I would imagine there would have to be a wide-ranging debate,' he said. By contrast, Mr Taylor backs reform of the Serious Fraud Office and wants the police to have a much clearer lead role in investigating financial crime. He welcomed the recommendation that the SFO's powers which remove the right to silence and compel witnesses to answer questions be extended to the police. At present such powers can only be used by SFO lawyers and accountants. The recommendation comes from Mr John Graham - a senior Treasury official who has conducted an inquiry into the SFO on behalf of Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general. Mr Taylor said a multi-disciplinary approach was necessary in some very big fraud cases, but there was a need to re-examine the relationship between police, lawyers and accountants 'so that we are not all fishing out of the same pool'. Echoing the tensions between police and non-police personnel in the SFO over the management of investigations, Mr Taylor said: 'Investigation and prosecution of fraud has been rather more successful than has sometimes been portrayed but we have to deal with people's negative perceptions.  The key is to harness people's skills to the best advantage and I think we should be leading the investigations.' Mr Taylor, 47, is widely regarded as one of the brightest and most opinionated of police chiefs. Although his area of London has not been marked out by the prime minister for his attacks on the nation's 'yob culture', Mr Taylor insisted yesterday on contributing to the debate, claiming that aspects of the criminal-justice system still favoured the offender at the expense of the victim, and calling for increased police powers. He urges more effective use of a national DNA database, and greater limitations on the right to silence.</p>

After  meeting U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley, who conveyed  condolences for the victims of the crime, Buwayz noted that he  discussed the steps being taken by the United States toward  Israel to control such extremist actions as the attack in the  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Buwayz said:    [Begin recording] [Buwayz] Investigations are continuing  into  the church crime. At the cabinet meeting yesterday, several  decisions were made to boost security agencies' interrogations  and increase coordination among them to discover the  perpetrators of this carnage. No doubt, resolving this issue  will require great efforts, particularly because the  perpetrators are professional and capable.    [Unidentified reporter] Can you tell us about the content of  the message you received from the U.S. ambassador?    [Buwayz] The meeting had two goals: We received condolences  from the U.S. ambassador on the martyrs of the Sayyidat al-Najat  church carnage. He advised us on steps that the U.S. Government  has taken with Israel to control extremism such as the attack in  the Ibrahimi Mosque.    [Reporter] After the incidents in the Ibrahimi Mosque and in  Juniyah yesterday, do you believe that the fate of the peace  talks is now threatened?    [Buwayz] The negotiations encounter extremism from here and  there. No doubt, the decision and responsibility for peace make  it imperative for all countries and parties concerned to follow  clear and firm line in dealing with the (?rejectionists). We  believe that it is high time for the Israeli Government to put  an end to continued provocations that impede the atmosphere of  peace in the region.    [Reporter] Will the church crime affect Pope John Paul's  visit to Lebanon?    [Buwayz] I do not think it will affect the pope's visit. The  pope usually visits countries and peoples beset by difficulties,  not prosperous and stable countries. He usually visits peoples  suffering from problems.    [Reporter] The Washington peace talks have been suspended.  Do you think that they will stop forever?    [Buwayz] Talks are under way with the U.S. to ensure the  continuity of the peace talks.

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / PLO set to reject peace talks: Palestinians dismiss Israeli plans to restrain Jewish extremists as 'hollow' The Palestine Liberation Organisation is almost certain to refuse a US invitation to resume peace talks with Israel in Washington this week after Friday's massacre in Hebron. PLO officials yesterday brushed aside Israeli government plans to curb Jewish extremists, describing them as hollow and not a basis for resuming talks. 'It is too soon,' one official said. 'The blood is still warm.' Before it agrees to rejoin the talks, the PLO is expected to demand more extensive measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and to protect Palestinians living there. Another four Palestinians and a Bedouin were killed by Israeli troops and 57 others wounded as violent protests continued over the murder of 43 Moslems during prayers at a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron. The Israeli cabinet instructed the attorney-general to consider outlawing the racist Kach movement, of which Baruch Goldstein, the American-immigrant doctor who carried out the Hebron killings, was a member. The cabinet decided to place five Kach leaders in administrative detention, disarm about 20, and restrict the movements of a few dozen. One Kach activist, Shmuel Ben-Ishai, was arrested. 'We've decided to get tough with the hard core of the extremists,' said Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister. Ministers said up to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners would be released in the next few days. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO, immediately dismissed the Israeli moves as 'merely cosmetic', before meeting senior PLO officials at his home in Tunis. The Clinton administration said it hoped the Israeli action would induce the PLO to agree to negotiations in Washington that could change 'realities on the ground'. But these hopes received a blow when Syria, Jordan and Lebanon yesterday broke off their peace talks with Israel in the US. The talks had been due to end on March 2. In dismissing the Israeli moves, Mr Arafat said: 'We were not expecting better than this, because the Israeli government did not tackle the issue of Israeli army involvement, nor provide the basis of international protection for the Palestinian people, the issues that are very essential for a successful end of the peace process.' PLO officials said the meeting was expected to result in demands for tougher Israeli action and a call for the United Nations Security Council to discuss protection for Palestinians. Officials avoided suggesting that Friday's atrocity might lead to an outright abandonment of further peace talks, but said the issue of the settlers would have to top the agenda if talks were to resume. 'If the Palestinian people in the occupied territories do not have sufficient protection, the entire peace process is immaterial,' added one official. The Israel cabinet also ordered an official inquiry to establish why Israeli soldiers failed to block Dr Goldstein's entry into the mosque, why they failed to stop him firing more than 100 bullets into the rows of kneeling Palestinian worshippers, and whether soldiers had themselves contributed to the death toll. Curfews yesterday failed to deter demonstrators throughout the occupied territories. In one incident, a Palestinian teenager was killed in Gaza when soldiers fired into a mosque. Three others died in the West Bank, bringing the number of Palestinian dead since the massacre to 18. The violence has also spread to the 800,000-strong Israeli Arab community, with Jaffa, north of Tel Aviv, the focus of unprecedented clashes throughout the weekend. Meanwhile, several hundred people gathered in Jerusalem to pay their last respects to Dr Goldstein, who was beaten to death after the massacre by Palestinians inside the mosque.

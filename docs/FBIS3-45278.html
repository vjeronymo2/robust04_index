The provincial party committee and government in  Heilongjiang  always place the development of agriculture and the  solidification and expansion of the country's "huge granary" in  Heilongjiang in a position of paramount importance, from which a  complete set of work ideas and specific measures has been  formed. They have paid serious attention to the construction of  agricultural infrastructure. In 1993, nearly 100 million yuan  was invested in farmland capital construction so that the entire  province boasts an annual production capability of more than  22.5 billion kg. Moreover, they persisted in invigorating  agriculture through the application of scientific and  technological advances and disseminated advanced technology. In  the area of education, more than 4 million young and middle-aged  peasants were trained through various channels in 1993 so that  there is a crack hand in the farming line in every household.  The building of the service sector has been intensified, and  the former emphasis on technical services has been shifted to an  emphasis on supplying the means of production and helping  peasants sell their grain in an effort to resolve the tough  problems facing the peasants. In order to solve the problem of  having difficulty selling grain after bumper harvests, leading  cadres from prefectures, cities, and counties personally went to  various localities across the country to set up a marketing  network, an example of which is the secretary of the Qingan  county party committee, who succeeded in selling grain to  Beijing. The provincial party committee and government also  tried by every possible means to resolve the problem of "IOU  notes." In a bid to lighten peasants' burdens, over 600  improper apportionments have been rectified; 48,000  nonproductive personnel in villages, towns, and townships have  been laid off; and reserve funds and the unified budget for the  entire province has been reduced by 4.9 percent, which is lower  than that stipulated by the State Council. All this has greatly  released peasants' enthusiasm so that the province's grain yield  has exceeded 22.5 billion kg for four consecutive years.    The public will is stable thanks to adequate grain. Over the  past couple of months, monthly sales of grain throughout the  province have stabilized at about 250 million kg, the market  price has never reached the ceiling set by the state, and the  phenomenon of panic buying has never occurred in the entire  province. A leading cadre from the provincial authorities told  this reporter: "At present, the province has 10 billion kg of  grain in stock, and is ready to offer full assistance to any  fraternal province or city which is in difficulty."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin said that economic sanctions against Serbia  and Montenegro would not be lifted until peace is not ensured in  Bosnia. [sentence as received]    "Lifting of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia should be  preceeded by a ceasefire from all the conflicting sides (in  Bosnia)," he told TASS on Wednesday.    "Russia stood and stands on one position -- all settlement  problems in Bosnia can be solved only at the negotiating table.  Nothing can be done by military force," he said and added that  Russia does not accept "power methods."    The prime minister stressed that in general Russia stands  for  the lifting of sanctions againt Yugoslavia. "I do not  understand why peoples have to suffer, and not those forces  which profit from the conflict."    However, he added that for the time being it is impossible  to  lift the sanctions completely. "Foreign economic relations will  be impeded by combat activities," according to the prime  minister.    The situation in former Yugoslavia will most evidently be  discussed at the CIS summit in Moscow on Friday. "The example  of former Yugoslavia makes us see what a split of the country  can result in. The example shows what we can get on the  territory of the former USSR," Chernomyrdin stressed.</p>

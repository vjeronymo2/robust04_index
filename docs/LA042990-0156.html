			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PERSPECTIVES / JAPAN;  </P> <P> JAPANESE WORK MORE, BUT THEY'LL CATCH ON  </P> <P> Consider the strange story of international trade. When the government  announces our trade enemies next week, one country will be conspicuously absent  from the list: Japan.  </P> <P> To avoid a trade war, we made a kind of pre-emptive peace treaty. Among the  items in the treaty, the Japanese agreed -- as a concession to us! -- that they  would shorten their work week. They would reduce the hours for government  employees and encourage the private sector to do the same.  </P> <P> What this suggests is that working hard is somehow an unfair labor practice.  According to a University of Michigan study, Japanese men work about eight  hours more a week than Americans. We don't have to catch up; they have to slow  down.  </P> <P> This is the sort of reasoning that says Americans don't really have to start  saving money: The Japanese have to start spending it. Next year, we may demand  that their children study less.  </P> <P> The notion that the Japanese need pressures to make them work fewer hours, to  force them into leisure, fits neatly into our stereotype of their society:  hard-working and workaholic, unified and closed, disciplined and rigid.  </P> <P> But it discounts the reality that countries, like families, may go through  generational changes. One generation picks itself up by its bootstraps, the  next generation makes it, the next wonders what "it" is all about.  </P> <P> It is a familiar progression for one family to go from the shopkeeper to  professional to artist. People go through these stages in one life as well,  from the search for safety and security to what psychiatrists call  "self-actualization." Having wondered about their next meal, then their next  year, they eventually pause to wonder about the meaning of their life.  </P> <P> It's what the mid-life crisis is all about. It's behind the cliche of executive  life: "Nobody ever died wishing they'd spent more time at the office."  </P> <P> Japan may also be at the cusp of this change. Many Japanese are asking what  rewards they should have from their international success story. They also are  worrying about their own "younger generation," not sure they need to work so  hard and afraid that they might not.  </P> <P> It may be that certain questions are universal. In every culture, human beings  ask: "Is this all?"  </P></p>

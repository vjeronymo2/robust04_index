			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK DASH; COCKNEY COMMUNIST WAS 'KING OF THE DOCKS'  </P> <P> Jack Dash, 82, the Cockney Communist famous for his role in the strikes that  plagued London's docks. Dash prided himself on being involved in every London  dock strike between 1945 and 1970. A colorful figure and gifted orator, he was  much in demand on the lecture circuit after his retirement. Dash was raised as  an orphan and left school at 14, becoming a builder, a firefighter and then a  docker. Inspired by the novels of American author Jack London, he joined the  British Communist Party in 1936 and devoted the rest of his working life to  protecting the pay and jobs of the dockers. The Transport and General Workers'  Union to which he belonged barred Communists from holding union office, so Dash  operated strictly from the soapbox and became known as "unofficial king of the  docks." Although he unswervingly defended the Soviet line, he was a fervent  British patriot, always reminding listeners that his country invented the  parliamentary system and trade union tradition. Dash retired in 1969 and  immediately organized a rent strike at his public housing project. He also  painted, sculpted, wrote an autobiography and became a tourist guide, showing  visitors around the city he loved. "I'm a . . . London chauvinist," he would  often say. In London on Thursday of undisclosed causes.  </P></p>

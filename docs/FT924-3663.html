			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Swiss reject closer European ties: 'No' vote will delay EC-Efta treaty - Issue splits French and German speakers SWITZERLAND yesterday said No to closer European integration, causing a domestic political crisis and further problems for the European Community. In a national referendum on joining the European Economic Area, 50.3 per cent of voters rejected the government proposal. Under Swiss law, a majority of of the 23 cantons is also required. A decisive 16, including industrial and financial cantons such as Zurich and Zug, rejected the proposed move towards closer European integration. The rejection of the EEA treaty, which would link the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association and the 12 European Community countries in an enlarged common market, may also hurt the prospects for economic recovery in other Efta countries. The planned introduction of the EEA on January 1 will now have to be delayed for at least six months while these countries renegotiate the details of EEA entry. European governments registered disappointment at the Swiss vote, but expressed determination to start the EEA without Switzerland. In Brussels, Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, said Switzerland had chosen the path of isolation. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said there would now be talks to change the treaty. He confirmed that the vote added up to a rejection not only of the EEA but also of the EC, which the Berne government had applied to join. Among Switzerland's partners in Efta, Finland's foreign trade minister, Mr Pertti Salolainen, said he was disappointed by the Swiss rejection of the EEA and that the implementation of the agreement would be delayed. 'This means difficulties . . . because we cannot start the agreement at the same time as the internal market is realised in the EC,' Mr Salolainen said. Mr Bjoern Tore Godal, the Norwegian trade minister, said the other 18 countries planning to take part in the EEA would have to negotiate technical changes, but there would be 'no change in the agreement's substance'. Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, Sweden's trade minister, said the financial markets needed to be assured that EEA delays would be limited. In Switzerland, there was also concern yesterday that the vote could prolong Switzerland's recession and could put pressure on the Swiss franc and Swiss shares in financial markets. In Tokyo this morning the Swiss franc fell against the dollar, which was at SFr1.43825 after an hour's trading, as against its Friday closing figure of SFr1.4145. In New York the dollar had closed at SFr1.4285 on Friday. The political crisis arises because of the clear split in the voting between the country's majority German-speaking community, which voted heavily against the treaty, and the minority French-speaking community, which voted equally decisively for it. The Swiss have until now been successful in protecting minorities, but the outcome of this vote could inflame passions on both sides of the linguistic divide. Both were clearly determined to give no quarter to the other. There were record turnouts in many cantons, and every German-speaking canton, except Basle, rejected the EEA. The linguistic division showed up even in the cantons which have both French and German-speaking communities. In the cantons of Fribourg, Valais and Bern, the minority communities voted on linguistic lines. Mr Rene Felber, the Swiss president, said the clear rift between the language communities 'was a subject of great concern', and he called on all Swiss to unite. The most important immediate result of the vote may be decisions by companies to move production out of Switzerland into other European countries. During the campaign, the pharmaceutical group Roche said the outcome could influence where it built a SFr130m (Pounds 59.6m) vitamin plant. Sulzer Brothers said it was considering building a SFr60m factory to make artificial hips and knees elsewhere because it would be difficult to get EC certification for Swiss-made products. Mr Arnold Koller, the Swiss justice minister, said the country would have to accelerate the adaptation of many of its laws to EC standards, including those aimed at eliminating cartels, if it wished to remain competitive. As a member of Efta, Switzerland would continue to have a free trade relationship with the EC in most products.

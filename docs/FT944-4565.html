			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Deutsche Telekom scam probe Deutsche Telekom, which is to be privatised soon, yesterday began internal investigations following press reports that thousands of its employees were suspected of working with criminal gangs to syphon off the charges from overseas telephone calls. Police seized documents from a company in Dusseldorf which deals with telephones and computers and another company in the city was reported to have run up a bill of DM2m (Pounds 800m) after making calls to the Dutch Antilles. Neither the police nor Deutsche Telekom could confirm press reports that losses of up to DM500m had been run up in the scam. However, the investigations are a setback for the company which just two weeks ago announced a consortium of leading international banks to handle the first stage of its privatisation in 1996.</p>

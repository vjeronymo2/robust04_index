			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: Good performance in recession Sir, It is good for opera that Covent Garden is in surplus but Antony Thorncroft's report ('On song at the opera', April 17/18) that ENO is 'in decline' is not borne out by the facts. Paid attendances have declined by 6 per cent since last year, not 15 per cent. That is a creditable performance in the depths of recession. More than 320,000 people (more than for any other opera company in the UK) attended 215 performances in 1992-1993, with an average seat price of Pounds 25. Moreover, ENO increased its private-sector income to a record Pounds 1.64m last year, with 17 out of 20 productions sponsored. Rather than play one company off against the other, those who support opera should concentrate their efforts on persuading the government to reverse planned cuts to the Arts Council grant next year. Neither ENO nor Covent Garden can afford to lose further revenue. John Nickson, director of corporate affairs, English National Opera, London Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, London WC2</p>

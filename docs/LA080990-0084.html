			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTTLED WATER: NOT GETTING SOAKED  </P> <P> Even though many labels show beautiful mountain streams and cascading  waterfalls, not all bottled waters are the same. Some may be little more than  purified tap water.  </P> <P> The price of a bottled water may not indicate quality. Heavy bottles traveling  long distances carry high shipping costs.  </P> <P> So check labels closely; they'll provide clues to what's inside.  </P> <P> There are 650 different brands of bottled water sold in Canada and the United  States. Michele Asbar of Naya Beverages in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada, says some  bottled waters are nothing more than treated tap water.  </P> <P> "As with other products in the food stores today, consumers need to understand  the differences in bottled water and become alert label readers," Asbar says.  </P> <P> When choosing a bottled water, look at the label. The line beneath the brand  name tells you whether it's natural, treated or distilled water.  </P> <P> Natural spring water must originate from a natural aquifer, or underground  spring, with nothing added or taken away. It may be naturally carbonated, or  still (non-carbonated).  </P> <P> Not all natural spring waters are the same. A major difference is the amount of  dissolved minerals, or solids, they contain. The lower the dissolved mineral  salts, the better the taste. However, you do want a small amount of minerals in  the water or it will taste flat.  </P> <P> The container used to bottle natural spring waters can make a difference in  taste. For reasons of breakage and shipping weight, most bottles of still water  are plastic. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the most common material, but using  this material can mean the transfer of outside odors through to the water.  Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a newer packaging material that does not  allow foreign odors to penetrate.  </P> <P> Treated water is essentially tap water, with the harmful bacteria removed.  Ozone and chlorine, among the most commonly used additives, are effective  purifiers, but may leave a bitter aftertaste.  </P> <P> Distilled water is also known as demineralized and salt- and chemical-free  water. Distilled water is tap water with the undesirable bacteria and the  mineral content removed. This can be accomplished by charcoal filtration and  deionization and, in some cases, carbonating the water. Distilled water can  serve as drinking water, but the absence of minerals leaves a flat taste.  </P> <P> If you drink bottled water, don't make ice cubes from tap water. "Cubes made  from ordinary tap water can't help but detract from the purity of bottled  water, so chill bottled water, just as you would fine champagne," Asbar says.  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Leading Article: The Edinburgh agenda SELDOM CAN the mismatch between the challenges facing the European Community and its capacity to act on them have been as glaring as at today's Edinburgh summit. Yet seldom has there been a greater need for EC leaders to cut through the tangle of detail surrounding them. Only if they settle their immediate disagreements - problems that can either be solved fairly easily or cannot be avoided any longer - will they be able next year to focus on what is really important. The list of issues which Mr John Major and his colleagues have left off the Edinburgh agenda is striking. They are unlikely to be in a position to launch a 'growth package' that would make more than a symbolic difference. They will not attempt to reform the European Monetary System. They will leave the Gatt deal on one side. They will not discuss Mr Jacques Attali's far-sighted proposal for a pan-European free trade area. There is just a chance they will summon up the courage to override Greek objections to the recognition of Macedonia, but they will not discuss any action in Bosnia on the scale needed to halt the explosion of Europe's worst refugee crisis since the 1940s. And they will respond to German pleas for a sharing of this burden only by endorsing plans already agreed among their interior ministers, under which most refugees will be returned to the first 'safe' country they reached - usually one already overwhelmed by numbers and lacking either resources or institutions to handle them. Stop short By contrast they will hail the achievement of the single market on January 1, though without agreeing on the abolition of frontier checks on the movement of people. They will issue a declaration on subsidiarity and transparency, probably deleting a few directives from the statute book to show they are in earnest, but will stop short of opening the EC's legislature (the Council of Ministers) to public scrutiny. They will agree on an all-round increase in the numbers of the European Parliament, and will no doubt stitch up a horsetrader's bargain on the siting of new EC institutions. They may even agree to start negotiations with those Efta countries still seeking full membership, since Chancellor Helmut Kohl has apparently persuaded President Francois Mitterrand to waive his insistence that Maastricht must first be ratified by all 12 existing members. But that agreement depends on resolution of one of the two issues that do have to be settled at this summit, namely the EC's spending ceilings for the next seven years. Spain will block enlargement until it is satisfied on that issue, and so far it is not satisfied with the offers made by the main net contributor countries, Britain and Germany; while Britain is at odds with other net contributors over its own rebate. Diabolical ingenuity On that point Mr Major will probably get his way, weak though his case seems to most of his partners, because any diminution of the rebate would put paid to his hopes of getting Maastricht through the House of Commons. On the rest of the budget there will be an unseemly wrangle, but it should not be an insoluble one. The other issue that simply cannot be ducked is the 'Danish problem'. Here British and EC lawyers have been performing feats of diabolical ingenuity to devise a 'legally binding' formula which is supposed to let the Danes ratify the treaty while being exempted from most of its provisions, and yet not require re-ratification by everyone else. The danger of such a formula is that others - possibly Britain, probably some of the would-be new members - will seek to invoke the Danish precedent, although one can argue that all Denmark is doing is to invoke the precedent already set by British opt-outs negotiated a year ago. In any case, that risk can no longer be avoided if the treaty in its present form is to be saved at all. The best hope is that the formula will be accepted by all, and that both Britain and Denmark will then move as fast as possible to a decision by their respective constitutional procedures, not prolonging the agony with a ridiculous game of Gaston and Alphonse. Europe can live with the treaty or if necessary without. What it cannot afford is to spend another year haggling over the small print.</p>

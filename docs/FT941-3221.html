			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Swan Hunter bid expected 'within a week' Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French-based shipbuilder, said yesterday that it would make a bid within a week for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership. The bid is likely to be conditional on the yard winning the Ministry of Defence contract for the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. CMN said its bid for Swan Hunter would be made before Thursday March 24, the deadline for tender submission for the contract. Price Waterhouse, Swan Hunter's receivers, was optimistic it would receive a bid for the company, possibly but not necessarily from CMN, before the tender deadline. The receivers expect any bid will be conditional on Swan Hunter winning the Sir Bedivere refit, which again pins the survival of north-east England's last shipbuilder on the award of a keenly contested MoD contract. It was Swan Hunter's failure to win a MoD helicopter carrier order, after it bid Pounds 71m more than a rival VSEL-Kvaerner Govan consortium, which plunged the Tyneside company into receivership last May. The 18-month Sir Bedivere refit, worth about Pounds 30m, will provoke another fierce fight. Tenders have been invited from Swan Hunter, VSEL, Yarrow, the Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards, Appledore and Tees Dockyard. Yesterday Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said: 'We are accepting the award of the Sir Bedivere to Swan's is likely to be a condition of any bid to buy the company.' He said Swan Hunter was formulating the 'most competitive and compliant' bid possible. Since receivership, the company has cut overheads, shedding nearly 1,500 jobs. Swan Hunter's tender must be underwritten by a prospective purchaser guaranteeing completion to cost and on time. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said: 'We would expect to be submitting a bid prior to the closing date for the Sir Bedivere tender.' He is aiming for early next week. 'It's all going to be last-ditch stuff.' Swan Hunter's current workload is two frigates to be handed over in May and November. Without Sir Bedivere, the company would be 'very unattractive', said Mr Henderson. He added that CMN was still considering whether to make its bid conditional on winning the refit. Mr James said that while CMN had been overt about its bid preparation, 'others have done it quietly', and could yet move before Thursday. Union leaders at Swan Hunter will lobby Tory MPs in London next week. Failure to win the refit of Sir Bedivere would be 'catastrophic', said Mr Dick Gonzales, chairman of Swan's Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.</p>

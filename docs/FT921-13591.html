			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Part-time work the only option Sir, Alison Wolf from the Institute of Education seeks an explanation (Letters, January 16) as to why so many British women are working if the UK's childcare provision is so scarce. The explanation comes in two words - part time. While it is true that the UK has the second highest rate of female participation in the labour force, this is because we have so many part-timers. In all EC countries, married women are more likely to work part-time than non-married women. But in the UK, 53 per cent of married female employees worked part-time in 1988 (last year for which figures available) compared with an EC average of 37 per cent. A significant proportion of part-time working women would prefer to work full time, but are prevented from doing so by the lack of affordable quality childcare. The UK is also different from its EC neighbours in that 34 per cent of fathers of children under 10 worked more than 50 hours a week, the highest total in the EC. Women in Britain work out of necessity. But the lack of affordable childcare means that for most women a life of low-paid, part-time work is substituted for the prospect of a long and successful career.

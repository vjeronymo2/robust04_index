			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Changyin (1776 7022 6892)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 31 Mar (XINHUA) -- Robert Copper [name  as published], new chairman of the National Council for  U.S.-China Trade, said on 31 March that the Clinton  Administration should continue to grant the  Most-Favored-National [MFN] status in trade to China this year  because further development of U.S.-China trade will benefit  both sides.    He made the above remark in a speech at a seminar "Sanctions  and Trade Control," sponsored by the U.S. Council for Foreign  Affairs. He said: The National Council for U.S.-China Trade  hopes very much, and will be happy to see more trade and other  exchanges between the United States and China. Disruption of  trade relations between the two countries will incur heavy  losses to both sides.    According to him, Washington should not hassle over China's  MFN status every year. He called for solving this problem once  for all this year by granting permanent MFN status to China. On  the human right issue, he said the United States has its own  standards of human rights, but should not force China to comply.    He added that the National Council for U.S.-China trade, as  a  nongovernmental organization, will continue to exert efforts to  urge the Congress and Clinton Administration to grant MFN trade  status to China.    Jane Shilaka, representative of the U.S. Boeing Aircraft  Company, also spoke at the seminar. She repeatedly stated that  Boeing "entirely supports MFN for China every year." She added  that if the annual debate over the MFN status is cancelled, "it  will be much better for the American people."</p>

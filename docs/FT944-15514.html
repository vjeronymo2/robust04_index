			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Kohl promises to maintain coalition Chancellor Helmut Kohl held preliminary talks yesterday to re-form Germany's conservative-liberal coalition after its parliamentary majority was drastically reduced - from 134 to just 10 seats - in Sunday's election. Mr Kohl promised to maintain the coalition and rejected any suggestion that the majority might be too small to govern. He ruled out any thought of a grand coalition with the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD). Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, also rejected calls from his own party to propose such a move, while predicting that the present coalition would prove unstable. The coalition of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) was 'perfectly capable of government', the chancellor said. 'In a difficult situation, the German voters have shown confidence in us once again.' The final election result for the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, gave the CDU 244 seats in a 672-seat assembly, with 50 seats for the CSU, and 47 for the FDP. This gave a total of 341 seats for the government, against a combined 331 for the opposition parties - the SPD, the Greens, and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the re-formed east German communist party. The size of the government majority was bolstered at the last minute by the allocation of 16 so-called 'residual seats' to the parliament, resulting from Germany's two-vote proportional representation. Twelve of the seats went to the CDU, and four to the opposition SPD, giving the latter a total of 252 seats. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the FDP, said that coalition negotiations would begin next week, although he held a preliminary meeting with Mr Kohl yesterday. His own party emerged from the election with 32 seats fewer than in the previous parliament, after its vote sank from 11 per cent to 6.9 per cent. The Greens returned to the Bundestag with 49 seats, and the PDS came in with 30. Although the former communists did not win the minimum 5 per cent of the national vote, they gained four seats in the first direct vote, all in east Berlin, giving them the right to proportional representation. The results mean that the majority of the opposition SPD in the Bundesrat, the second house of parliament representing the 16 federal states, will be reinforced.

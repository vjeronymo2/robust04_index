			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leo: "Spate of Preferential Offers and Euro </F> Issues"]    [Text] The rush is now for raising resources through the  issue of equity shares at a premium under preferential offers to  foreign institutional investors. Euro issues also have become  popular and an amount of $1 billion has already been raised and  another $1.5 billions can be secured in the coming months if all  the contemplated issues fructify. Preferential offers have  lately been more popular as it is easy to conclude arrangements  for private placements after getting the approval of the  shareholders. On the basis of existing guidelines, the highest  quotation for the related equity shares in a period of six  months prior to the date of decision to make the preferential  offer will be the price for the equity shares involved. Vast  resources are thus being mobilised in a manner which could not  have been visualised even in the middle of last year.    As already stated, one can have a stake up to 24 per cent in  the enlarged equity capital through preferential offers and  holdings already secured through purchases from the open market  or otherwise will have to be taken into account for this  purpose. Since the allocations to different institutions give  rise to problems, efforts are being made to sort out them.  However, it is being examined by the monetary authorities  whether it is desirable to have a big increase in the stake of  foreign interests in equity capital of Indian enterprises when  there is no need for incurring heavy capital expenditure on  ongoing and new schemes. Also, the allotment of equity shares  against preferential offers in Indian currency will create an  obligation for the country to find the required forex [foreign  exchange] resources if at a later date the proceeds from sale of  equity shares now being allotted have to be repatriated by Flls  [NRIs--nonresident Indians]. There will, of course, be a drain  of forex resources only if sales exceeded fresh purchases.    RBI [Reserve Bank of India] Examining Impact of Recent  Developments    In the case of Euro issues, however, there will be an  initial  inflow of forex resources directly. (Even in respect of  preferential offers to Flls there would have been an earlier  inflow of foreign exchange though recycling may not result in an  immediate inflow of forex resources). Here again considerably  larger amounts on foreign exchange will have to be found if  equity shares so allotted appreciated substantially over a  period and sales by foreign investors or Flls exceed current  purchases. Various aspects will, therefore, have to be  carefully examined for determining the balance of advantage  accruing to the economy. However, the enterprises gathering  additional resources in this way stand to gain considerably and  it is now being discussed in market circles to what extent there  will be an increase in the net profit, before depreciation and  taxation, as a result of a lower burden of interest charges even  without any change in the gross profit, before depreciation and  interest charges.    SPIC to Issue Euro Convertible Bonds    Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) is  again  seeking to raise $80 millions this time through Euro convertible  bonds for taking advantage of the opportunity for repaying loans  in foreign currencies on costlier terms taken for acquiring  ships for handling liquid chemicals. It is also intended to  utilise a portion for investment in an urea plant in West Asia  and on new projects that may be promoted for producing polyester  filament yarn and purified teraphthalic acid within the country.  The financing of the ongoing schemes can be easily attempted as  it is now expected that the drug project in Cuddalore will be  commencing production of G. Penncillin towards the close of this  year. The modernisation of the ammonia plant and related assets  is also making satisfactory progress.    Novel Features and Options    The Euro convertible bonds that may be issued can be on  attractive terms for the management if it is eventually decided  to allot equity shares against these bonds at a high premium  later at the option of the management. The lenders also can  elect to get allotted equity shares within a stipulated period.  In that event, the equity capital will get again enlarged and  foreign ownership may rise to 48 per cent eventually if all the  holders of Euro convertible bonds exercise their option to  secure equity shares. The rise in percentage may be less  pronounced if a much higher premium is realised.    It has been explained by Mr. A.C. Muthiah, Vice Chairman and  President, that the total resources for nearly $155 millions  will be improving considerably the financial position of the  company and bringing about a considerable reduction in the  burden of interest charges. The issue of GDRs [expansion not  given] for $74.75 millions equivalent to Rs. 235 crores was made  at a time when the quotations for equity shares were much lower  than they are now. There was thus an increase in the equity  capital by Rs. 33.52 crores to Rs. 88.04 crores from Rs. 54.52  crores. The premium realised on "allotment" of equity shares was  Rs. 200.97 crores.    Earlier, the paid up capital had increased to Rs. 54.52  crores from Rs. 34 crores as a result of allotment of equity  shares against zero bonds. The premium realised was Rs. 27.04  crores. Total reserves, including share premium and excluding  revaluation reserve, are now Rs. 360.04 crores. Euro-convertible  bonds will result in a further increase in equity capital and  the stake of the promoters in enlarged equity capital will tend  to decline.    New Projects on Anvil    In order to retain the existing percentage in the enlarged  equity capital, it is proposed to issue warrants to the  promoters for enabling them to get 23 million equity shares at a  premium, which may be determined on the basis of SEBI  [Securities and Exchange Board of India] guidelines. These  warrants may be encashed by the promoter group in the light of  holders of Euro convertible bonds exercising their option to get  allotted equity shares or the directors taking advantage of the  opportunity for minimising addition to equity capital in the  event of conversion with the realisation of a higher premium.  The details relating to terms of the issue will be known after  the negotiations are completed.</p>

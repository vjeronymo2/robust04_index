			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (8): Techniques find new markets - Equity and commodity swaps AFTER A decade of dynamic growth, the global swaps market stands at Dollars 3,000bn, according to estimates by the International Swap Dealers Association. The application of existing technology to new markets is set to fuel further expansion in the 1990s. Most existing swap agreements are exchanges of interest-rate or currency flows, allowing corporate treasurers to match assets and liabilities, to hedge exposure, or to reduce funding costs. The same technology is now being used to create commodity swaps and equity swaps. While both these sectors still account for only a small portion of the global market, both have engaged a new breed of swap-market participant. While corporate treasurers are vulnerable to sharp movements of currencies and interest rates, fund managers are equally affected by equity market movements, and businesses that require large quantities of commodities suffer if commodity prices rise. For banks already involved in the swaps market, the new client base is an attractive one. Interest-rate and currency swaps have become actively traded, and, as competition among banks has increased, margins have shrunk dramatically. As they are still at an early stage of development, greater expertise is required in the equity and commodity swap markets - partly because the risk assumed by banks is more difficult to hedge - and consequently higher fees can be charged. In fact, the concept of the equity swap appears so far to have inspired bankers more than fund managers. However, there are signs that the idea is starting to take hold, particularly in the US. Several aspects of the concept hold particular appeal for US fund managers. First, it is an easy way of investing in foreign markets without assuming currency risk, which US fund managers, unlike their European counterparts, often prefer to avoid, or at least to separate. Second, many US fund managers like the idea of being able to transfer expertise in one class of asset to another. An equity swap simulates the performance of an equity index. It can be used as an alternative to futures and options for hedging. But it is most attractive to fund managers, whose target is to out-perform an index. In an equity swap, the fund manager receives a stream of payments which replicate the return of a direct investment in an equity index, and in exchange makes a stream of payments to the bank based on, usually, the London interbank offered rate. The precise structure of the transaction is tailored to suit the investment manager's needs. An equity swap combined with core holdings can increase a fund manager's ability to enhance returns. But there are deterrents. While swaps, unlike futures, can run for up to 10 years, the element of credit risk is greater. Although payments are normally made every three months to reduce exposure, credit considerations can be an issue. However, there is no exchange of principal, so exposure is relatively limited. In the UK, fund managers are fighting shy of the concept, partly because of uncertainty about the tax treatment of equity swaps. Since no such uncertainty now exists for index futures and options, many fund managers prefer to stick to this more travelled route. Although the market has been in existence for about five years, estimates of the amount of outstanding equity-swap agreements are difficult to gauge. The market is not developing in isolation, but in conjunction with the surge of business in equity derivatives, currently one of the most profitable financial markets. Equity swaps are being offered alongside an increasingly diverse range of products. At the same time, activity in exchange-traded futures and options has advanced strongly. The commodity swaps market, on the other hand, offers hedging opportunities where little or no alternative exists. Partly for this reason, the market is experiencing a healthy growth rate. The size of the commodity swaps market had grown, according to estimates, from Dollars 3bn in 1988 to Dollars 10bn before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and is now believed to total Dollars 40bn. The largest portion of the market - as much as 80 per cent  - is made up of oil-related transactions, partly a result of the volatility of the oil market. 'The Gulf war is the best thing that ever happened to the commodity swaps market,' said one trader. The extreme volatility of oil prices during the Gulf crisis appears to have brought about a change in attitude among oil consumers, which extensive marketing by banks had failed to achieve. Many companies, which had viewed derivative instruments of speculative tools, were convinced (at the cost of substantial financial losses in many cases) that, as banks had long argued, it was often a more speculative position not to hedge exposure and so to bear the full risk of any market movements. In a commodity swap, a company receives a cash flow pegged to a commodity index or price. Transportation companies, mainly airlines, have led the field. British Airways and KLM have been active in the market since the late 1980s, while US airlines have been slower to participate, fearing that the market could move in favour of unhedged competitors. Activity in the swaps market has been boosted also by the realisation that basis risk in the futures market is high. Since only a few exchange-traded oil futures contracts exist, many contracts provide imperfect hedges. For example, there is no jet-fuel contract, so a proxy, such as gasoil, has to be used. Jet fuel has historically traded at Dollars 25 per ton more than gasoil, with a high in early 1989 of Dollars 50. During the Gulf crisis, the spread ballooned to an average of Dollars 65 and a high of Dollars 186. As well as oil swaps, there are commodity-swap markets in gas and also in metals, including copper, aluminium and zinc. Agricultural commodities account for only a tiny portion of business. While the ultimate level of activity in various sectors of the swap market is hard to predict, the shift in attitude which has sparked demand for a broader range of instruments is clearly visible. 'It is no longer acceptable for companies to attribute poor performance or results to commodity price movements,' according to Katharine MacWilliams, head of commodity swaps at First Chicago. Increasing competition within their own industry - whether fund management, transportation or manufacturing - is likely to provide the greatest catalyst for change.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Corruption seeps into Russian politics: Allegations of venality exchanged in run-up to referendum RATHER than any of Russia's most pressing problems, corruption has become a pathetic hostage to the country's political infighting, illustrated by a stream of allegations in the referendum campaign. The real question is not so much whether the charges levelled against high-level individuals in the run-up to the referendum are true or not, but whether the problem can ever be tackled as long as it remains a political football, and as long as reforms to eradicate its causes are held back. Corruption is all pervasive in Russia, encouraged by incomplete legislation, a lack of political will and a failure quickly to remove assets, and economic decision-making from state hands - or at the least to discourage officials from stealing. Having had their uses in the past as a tool to fight President Boris Yeltsin's opponents, corruption allegations have been used most recently as a weapon to get at the Yeltsin camp. Tomorrow Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, a presidential hopeful who has said Mr Yeltsin cannot claim decisive victory despite winning a majority in Sunday's referendum, plans to unleash new charges of venal wrong-doing in high places. A statement by the office of Prosecutor-General Valentin Stepankov accusing Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, of corruption just three days before the referendum was also no accident. An ally of parliament in the struggle with Mr Yeltsin, Mr Stepankov, who has done little to prosecute graft until now, who has asked journalists to pay for interviews, and who published a book on the coup leaders before they were even put on trial, appeared more set on discrediting the presidential camp. The statement also threatened to undermine the hold by Yeltsin allies over the armed forces at a time when splits in the army could lead to civil war. A week earlier, Gen Rutskoi, who claims he is loyal to the president but opposed to his entourage, accused him of doing nothing to stop the plundering of the country by an alliance of senior officials, civil servants, and mafiosi. On Saturday, the government, without denying the detailed allegations, countered that Gen Rutskoi had abused or distorted material privy to him as head of an inter-governmental committee to fight corruption, making it more difficult to investigate the crimes he had mentioned. Now that he appears to have won some kind of popular mandate to continue his reform course, one of the most burning tasks facing Mr Yeltsin will be to put together an effective strategy combining institutional and economic reform to fight corruption. Although he is believed to be personally honest, Mr Yeltsin has all too frequently reorganised efforts to fight corruption. He has also been prepared to overlook violations by various local officials to buy their political support. Mr Yuri Boldyrev, the president's state inspector was fired last month after President Yeltsin complained that he had caused 'too many conflicts' with local authorities. Mr Boldyrev also said he had been under pressure to focus corruption investigations on opponents of Mr Yeltsin, and that his requests for an independent body capable of investigating crimes in the military had been turned down. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission before he was sacked and his commission dissolved in February, believes the only solution now is to create popular militias. However, the tired Russian people are unlikely to emulate Italian-style outrage against their establishment. If they do rise up, however, Mr Yeltsin knows that it will be a lot messier in Moscow than in Rome, hence the urgency of acting soon, before it is too late.</p>

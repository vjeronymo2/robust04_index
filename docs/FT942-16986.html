			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Hogg Group The prospect of a bid for Hogg Group has at least pushed the shares above 1990's 150p rights price. While Hogg is not the only insurance broker to fall on hard times, its record since the rights issue is hardly edifying. Problems in US retail broking and fine art insurance were behind the most recent disappointments. Given that troubled history, a multiple of around 25 times this year's forecast earnings at yesterday's closing price might look expensive. But potential buyers - including HSBC Holdings with a 6 per cent stake - must fancy their chances of squeezing substantially more out of the business than the current management. Combining Hogg's US retail broking offices with a larger network, for example, could transform the outlook. That logic might appeal to an established US broker with an eye on the UK market. Even after yesterday's rise, Hogg's market capitalisation is only a shade higher than its annual broking revenue. On that measure, it is not yet expensive. If HSBC is preparing to make a full bid, it must expect some competition. Sadly for shareholders in other troubled insurance brokers, Hogg looks like a special case. A high proportion of retail business sold through regional offices makes Hogg an unusually predictable target. Any potential bidder for Steel Burrell Jones - whose shares rose in sympathy with Hogg yesterday - would run the risk that its prized London market brokers would jump ship. The long awaited shake-out among insurance brokers is still not at hand.</p>

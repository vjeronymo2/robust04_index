			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Technical hitch Sir, How foolish of Lloyd's to imagine that a little tinkering with the finances of the group will prevent a recurrence of the misfortunes that have fallen on it] Its problem is not fundamentally financial - it is technical. Insurances were arranged in absence of knowledge of the technicalities of the risk - certainly in the case of asbestosis, and no doubt in other cases as well. If agents are too feckless to learn these technicalities, no accurate assessment of correct rates will ever be possible. L G L Unstead-Joss, 4 Liberton Gardens, Edinburgh, EH16 6JR</p>

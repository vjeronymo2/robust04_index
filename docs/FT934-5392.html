			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Australian securities industry votes against super shares Fund managers and members of Australia's securities industry are strongly opposed to the introduction of shares with 'super voting rights', according to a poll conducted by the Securities Institute of Australia. In a submission to the Australian Stock Exchange, which is canvassing opinion, the Securities Institute of Australia said a poll of members delivered 'a resounding 92 per cent vote against such shares'. The results of the poll are a further blow to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which in September announced plans for an issue of shares with enhanced voting rights. Critics fear such schemes would be used by managements to entrench their positions. The company has yet to issue formal details. The SIA represents individuals working in the securities industry, and members come from banking, insurance, stockbroking and other professions. Significantly, stockbroking members voted 91 per cent in favour of the existing 'one share, one vote' principle, the SIA said. Meanwhile, the Australian Investment Managers Group, which speaks for most of the major fund management businesses, said that the 'one share, one vote' principle had worked well and that 'any move to bring in another regime, whose only purpose can be to allow a minority investor to have effective control in perpetuity, will have adverse implications for the integrity of the Australian capital markets'. Earlier this month News Corp toned down key features of its proposed super share issue. The media company said it would place a 'cap' of 40 per cent on the aggregate number of votes which could be exercised by the holders of the super shares. Forcing the issue, Page 27</p>

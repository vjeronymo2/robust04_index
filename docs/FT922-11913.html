			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ross at Pounds 1.3m in first results since full listing ROSS GROUP, the rapidly growing packaging and electronics company, yesterday unveiled profits of Pounds 1.26m in its first full set of annual results since coming to the main market through last year's reverse takeover of Whittington Group, the giftware company. Mr Noel Hayes, group managing director, said the results were not comparable with the Pounds 647,000 loss reported in 1990, as that year's figures represented only Whittington's performance. All of Whittington's businesses had been sold since the takeover, resulting in a below-the-line gain of Pounds 3.5m, he said. Comparing the businesses before Whittington with the current Ross Group, pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 rose from Pounds 989,000. This year's result had been depressed by offsetting the Pounds 400,000 costs of closing Whittington's head office against the operating profits. Mr Hayes said the group had increased its market share in both the packaging and consumer electronics divisions. The introduction of new products, such as camcorder batteries, had boosted consumer electronics, while 'hard work' and new contracts had helped packaging. The acquisition of Traveller International in April had contributed about Pounds 150,000 to profits, Mr Hayes said. Stellar, the seventh company acquired by Ross in the last 18 months, had made a marginal contribution to profits as it was included for just one month. Stellar's loss-making Brighouse site - which produces battery chargers and electrical plugs and accounted for about Pounds 2m in losses last year - made a marginal deficit in the first quarter, Mr Hayes said. Net debt stood at Pounds 4.5m, representing about 28 per cent of shareholders' funds. The final dividend is 0.3p, making a total of 0.45p. Earnings per share were 1.5p.</p>

The AOE&hyph;6 PEIS proposed the upgrading of Pier D to a deep-draft pier by dredging 170,400 cubic yards of material adjacent to both sides of the pier to deepen the berthing area. The impact analysis assessed anticipated impacts resulting from dredging operations, open water dredged materials disposal, and upland dredged materials disposal. A Record of Decision for this action was issued by the Department of the Navy in March 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Suquamish Indian Tribe appealed a permit for this project that was issued by the City of Bremerton under the Washington State Shorelines Management Act and the City of Bremerton Shorelines Master Program. The permit is required by the State of Washington before certifying a proposal under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The appeal was resolved when the Navy, State of Washington, City of Bremerton, and the Suquamish Tribe agreed that the Navy would prepare an SEIS addressing the Pier D upgrade dredging project and additional work related to the dredging project and operations at the pier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pier D upgrade project involves dredging sediment and making upgrades to Pier D at PSNS in Sinclair Inlet at Puget Sound. The proposed action will provide two upgraded berths at Pier D capable of handling a minimum of two AOE&hyph;6 Class ships and will also provide the flexibility to berth other deep-draft ships assigned to PSNS. Dredging is proposed to enlarge the berths at Pier D, currently used for inactive ships. Depths at the AOE&hyph;6 berth (1,073 feet &times; 117 feet) would be increased by this project from the current depths to ^44.4 feet mean lower low water (MLLW). The deep draft berth (1,073 feet &times; 145 feet) would be increased to ^46.4 feet MLLW, and include a 400 feet &times; 116 feet area for sea chest intake clearance that would be increased to ^49.4 feet MLLW. A new steel fender pile system will be added to Pier D to increase the capacity of the existing timber fender piles; remaining timber fender piles will be replaced. As currently designed, approximately 105,000 cubic yards of marine sediments would be dredged and disposed of at one or more disposal sites approved for this purpose by various federal, state, and local environmental laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As agreed during the appeal process, the scope of the SEIS will be limited to the potential impacts associated with the proposed dredging in the vicinity of Pier D, including rehandling dredged material, transportation of dredged material, and disposal of dredged material. The SEIS will address, but not be limited to, the following issues: (1) Potential alternatives to the proposal and appropriate mitigation measures; (2) project monitoring to ensure that environmental quality is maintained; and (3) potential environmental impacts at the Pier D dredge site, including impacts to land, air, water, plants and animals, environmental health, land and shoreline uses, transportation, public services, utilities, and related socioeconomic conditions. Specific dredging related impacts to be analyzed include: (1) Potential impacts to aquatic species; (2) potential impacts associated with the resuspension and exposure of contaminated sediments in the vicinity of Pier D during dredging operations; (3) potential impacts associated with post-dredging exposure of contamination, future contamination associated with Pier D dredging activities, and coordination with cleanup efforts to be undertaken pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and (4) potential impacts associated with the handling, transportation, and disposal of dredged material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and the public are invited and encouraged to provide written comments regarding issues of concern. To be most helpful, these comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentor believes the SEIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the SEIS should be mailed no later than 30 days from the date of this publication to Mr. Peter Havens, Code 232, Engineering Field Activity Northwest, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 3505 NW Anderson Hill Road, Silverdale, WA 98383&hyph;9130, telephone (206) 396&hyph;5976. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael P.

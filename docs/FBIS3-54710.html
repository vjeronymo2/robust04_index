			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY, Tengiz  Sharmanishvili, deputy chairman of the Committee for Interethnic  Relations and Human Rights, sent a letter to the Georgian  Foreign Ministry.    The letter says: Russian news sources have recently  circulated news of the Russian Government's decision to lift the  economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia. As of now, Abkhazia's  towns and villages are receiving electricity without hindrance.    The Abkhaz committee for human rights and interethnic  relations states that the Abkhaz side has several times breached  the clauses of the Geneva memorandum on mutual understanding  signed by Georgia and Abkhazia; it has not stopped combat  actions against Georgians in the Kodori gorge, is settling  scores atrociously with the peaceful Georgian population in the  Gali rayon, and is not taking any measures for finding those  missing and reburying the killed; it is doing virtually nothing  for the return of those evicted from their own land.    The Russian Government's new year gift is nothing less than  a  breach of Resolution No. 876 of the UN Security Council and  casts doubt on the implementation of the Geneva memorandum on  mutual understanding.</p>

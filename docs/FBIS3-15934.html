He said its launching pads for environmentally-safe  new-generation boosters would provide all necessary orbit  inclinations which can now be achieved only at the Baykonur  cosmodrome situated in Kazakhstan.    During a meeting with military attaches of other countries  outside Moscow on Wednesday, Ivanov gave an overview of Russia's  military space forces, calling for greater space cooperation  with Russia. He said the MSF had 50,000 persons as well as  launch pads and equipment designed for testing space-related  hardware and launch spacecraft with the help of Russian-built  light, medium and heavy class boosters such as Kosmos, Tsiklon,  Vostok, Soyuz, Molniya, Zenit, Proton and Energia.    On the fate of the Baykonur facility, Ivanov said "we are  well aware of the need to resolve the problem and would like to  see it functioning in the future."</p>

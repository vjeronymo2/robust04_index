			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Seeking a safe grave for deadly remains: George Graham assesses an international tussle over how to dispose of spent uranium acceptably Weighed against the hundreds of tonnes of plutonium and bomb-grade uranium now being recovered from nuclear reactors and missiles around the world, 17.5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from a few dozen European research reactors might seem small. But a five-year gap, during which the US stopped taking back the spent HEU it had supplied to these reactors, has created a crisis with ramifications far beyond the world of nuclear research. The row over spent fuel has its origins in a bargain struck by the US, in the 1950s, and renewed in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To discourage other countries from embarking on nuclear bomb research, the US would help them to benefit from non-military applications of nuclear technology, such as the production of medical isotopes or neutron-scattering investigations of the structure of metals or ceramics. To keep highly enriched uranium, which fuels some research reactors and which could be used to make a nuclear bomb, in safe hands, the US agreed to take back the used fuel that it had supplied. In 1978, it went a step further, with the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors programme, or RERTR, under which operators of reactors were encouraged to convert from HEU to low-enriched uranium which could not be directly used for bombs. RERTR has had considerable success, and only four European research reactors have not begun at least to convert to LEU. 'It's one of the unsung victories of non-proliferation,' says Mr Alan Kuperman of the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington anti-proliferation group. In 1988, however, the US left European reactor operators in the lurch when it stopped accepting spent HEU, after a law suit brought by the Sierra Club, a San Francisco-based ecology group, had challenged the environmental safeguards surrounding the disposal of the fuel. The US State Department pressed hard for a resumption of the spent fuel programme. 'A breakdown of the international consensus on conversion of research and test reactors to LEU, and a return to an HEU fuel economy, would undermine 15 years of intensive US non-proliferation efforts on this matter and substantially reduce the ability of the US to influence nuclear policy in bilateral and international fora,' Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, warned. But the US Energy Department let the standstill on accepting spent fuel drag on until last summer, when Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, announced a new three-part policy. This comprised: A special waiver of environmental review requirements for reactors facing a real emergency. An accelerated environmental assessment to allow the US to take back a limited amount of spent fuel from reactors facing near-term difficulties. A full environmental impact statement to allow the US to resume taking back all the spent HEU it has supplied, and to take back spent LEU for a 10-year period as an incentive to more reactors to convert from HEU to LEU. The environmental assessment, due to be completed by the end of next month, proposes the acceptance of 448 spent fuel elements from reactors in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, for storage at the Energy Department's Savannah River facility in South Carolina. The nine reactors face a variety of problems that mean they cannot wait until the longer environmental impact statement, covering the acceptance of about 15,000 fuel elements, has been completed at the end of 1995. Some have simply run out of storage space for spent fuel; others face regulatory constraints. They could be pushed into abandoning the RERTR programme and converting back to HEU, or could be forced to shut down. Two operators, Germany's GKSS and Belgium's SCK/CEN, have already resorted to shipping spent HEU for reprocessing at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's Dounreay plant, in Scotland. Although Mrs O'Leary gave emergency clearance for SCK/CEN last year, the Belgian reactor chose Dounreay. US officials say they have no qualms about the physical safety of Dounreay but they worry that reprocessing, which the US itself abandoned in 1988, would perpetuate the use of HEU. The Belgian plant cannot convert to LEU for technical reasons involving the level of neutron flux it requires, but is frustrated at the difficulties of dealing with the US as a supplier of fuel. 'We prefer to continue to be supplied by the US but, if these discontinuities persist, we may have to look to other suppliers, including Russia,' warns Dr Carl Malbrain, director general of SCK/CEN. GKSS has converted to LEU, which cannot be reprocessed, but has told the US that it has so little faith in its long-term reliability that it may shift back to HEU so that it can continue to use Dounreay. For many plants, however, converting back is not even an option, because the Dounreay plant has to send back the resulting reprocessed fuel and radioactive waste to the country of origin. This rules out countries such as Denmark and Austria, which do not use nuclear power and so have no plan for long-term storage of highly radioactive waste. 'We are extremely dependent on a solution that is basically doing what we were doing for the last 20 years,' says Dr Klaus Singer, director of the Risoe reactor in Denmark. European reactor operators say there has been a noticeable improvement since the Clinton administration took over in the US at the beginning of 1993, though they are unsure as to whether this is due to new people and policies or because the problem had become so serious that it could no longer be avoided. They were encouraged by a meeting in Washington 10 days ago about the short-term acceptance of their spent fuel, but many doubt whether the longer-term environmental impact statement will be completed on time in 1995. 'It may take longer, like everything the Department of Energy has dealt with so far. That's why there is a mixture of optimism and pessimism: there is no reason for not being optimistic about the long-term outcome, but it will take time,' says Dr Singer.</p>

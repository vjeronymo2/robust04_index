			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian oil output in decline OIL COMPANIES are scaling back operations in Indonesia and completed only half their budgeted exploration-well programme last year, according to a report by the US embassy in Jakarta. Oil and condensate production fell 5 per cent in 1992 to an average 1.5m barrels a day. Industry analysts expect production to be held at this level until 1995 before declining towards 1m b/d by the end of the decade. Net crude and condensate exports fell 17.6 per cent last year to 700,000 b/d, the result of an 8 per cent increase in domestic consumption. Indonesia is expected to be a net oil importer by the end of the century. The report says geologists are 'guardedly optimistic at the prospects of finding new oil reserves. . . in remoter areas' of eastern Indonesia but notes that only eight of last year's 124 exploration wells were in that region. Industry executives say incentives to explore frontier areas are inadequate and cite high exploration costs at over Dollars 20m a well. Government officials say improved incentives, allowing companies to maintain a greater share of production, will be announced by the end of the year. In contrast, Indonesia's gas sector has continued to perform well. The US embassy report forecasts liquefied natural gas exports to rise about eight per cent to 25m tonnes this year, worth over Dollars 4bn. A sixth production unit with a capacity of 1.4m tonnes a year is being commissioned at the Bontang processing plant in Kalimantan and a seventh unit, worth Dollars 750m, has been ordered. This follows a string of exploration successes by Total of France in its Mahakam River basin block in East Kalimantan.</p>

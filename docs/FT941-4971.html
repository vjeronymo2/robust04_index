			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Ministers' lies to MPs defended by Waldegrave Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, yesterday rekindled the controversy over ministerial accountability raised by the arms-for-Iraq affair when he appeared to defend lying to parliament. Mr Waldegrave told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that ministers could be justified in 'very, very exceptional cases in saying something that was untrue'. He added: 'Everyone accepts that.' Mr Waldegrave said: 'Much of government activity is more like playing poker than chess. You don't lay all your cards on the table.' Mr Waldegrave's admission followed questioning over evidence given by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, to the Scott inquiry, which is investigating the sale of arms to Iraq. Sir Robin told the inquiry that giving incomplete answers to parliament was frequently necessary. He added, however, that half-answers should not mislead MPs other than in 'the most exceptional circumstances . . . like the devaluation case'. Mr Waldegrave repeated this formulation to the committee, and added that ministers often could not tell the House all that they knew, 'especially in relation to diplomatic matters'. He pointed out that parliament had appeared to accept that it was right for the government not to reveal everything that it was doing in order to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Committee members expressed surprise at Mr Waldegrave's robust defence of the practice. Mr Giles Radice, the committee's chairman, said that it was 'a remarkable statement for a minister'. Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, said the Commons had on occasion accepted that ministers had to lie in the national interest. He added, however, that it was the usual practice for a minister to offer his resignation afterwards. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow Citizen's Charter minister, called on the prime minister to repudiate Mr Waldegrave's 'accommodation with dishonesty'. He said: 'Trust and credibility are at the heart of democracy. If this dangerous and highly damaging doctrine were once accepted, confidence in ministers, already at the lowest ebb since the war, would completely collapse.' Mr Waldegrave told Channel 4 news that he was 'astonished' by the storm raised by his remarks, which were directed solely at the 'exceptional' case of an impending devaluation.</p>

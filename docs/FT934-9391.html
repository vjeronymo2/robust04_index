			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Paramount pays Dollars 552m for US publisher Macmillan MACMILLAN, the largest US business in the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, was sold yesterday to Paramount Communications, which outbid rivals with an offer of Dollars 552.75m (Pounds 366m). Paramount owns publishing imprints such as Simon &amp; Schuster and Prentice Hall. Its unsuccessful rivals in the final round of bidding are believed to have been Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the US educational publishers, K-111, the US magazine company, and Pearson, the publishing and information group that owns the Financial Times. The sale agreement takes the gross total raised by administrators Price Waterhouse from the sale of Maxwell Communication Corporation's US interests beyond Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse said he believed the net figure would fall within the predicted range of Dollars 700m-Dollars 1.1bn. 'We are looking pretty good on that,' Mr Homan said. He said he believed the main Maxwell disposals in the US could be wrapped up by the year-end. Offers are now being received for the last significant US business, Standard Rate and Data, the specialist advertising industry publication. The purchase of Macmillan will considerably strengthen the publishing interests of Paramount, itself in Dollars 10bn merger talks with Viacom, the US cable and television company. Mr Martin Davis, chairman and chief executive of Paramount Communications, said the transaction was 'a significant step in furthering our strategic objective of creating proprietary intellectual properties that can be distributed through a wide variety of media, from printed pages to computer and video screens'. As part of the sale, a reorganisation plan was filed under Chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court. Price Waterhouse said that was a technical step needed 'to remove the uncertainty created by Mr Maxwell's involvement with Macmillan Inc'. During a transition period, expected to last about three months, Mr Jonathan Newcomb, president and chief operating officer, and Mr Andrew Evans, chief finance officer of Paramount Publishing, will work on combining the two companies. Mr Richard Snyder, Paramount Publishing chairman, said the two businesses were complementary and 'significant savings' were expected from integration. Macmillan's backlist of authors includes Hemingway and Faulkner and its publishing interests range from reference to children's books and general fiction. The prestige created by the Macmillan acquisition may expand possibilities for Paramount's planned merger with Viacom, which is being hotly contested by home shopping service QVC Network.

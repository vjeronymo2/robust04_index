			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (8): Where shopping can still be a pleasure - This relatively small city offers exquisite and tranquil delights for the discerning visitor Even people who generally hate shopping will probably end up succumbing to the charms of an excursion in Zurich. Few places can boast so many interesting and well-stocked shops in a concentrated space, a combination which reflects the extraordinary wealth and earning power of this relatively small city. Moreover, apart from Saturday mornings, Zurich shops and pavements are seldom crowded; shopping here is not stressful. There are three main shopping areas in the city centre; the Bahnhofstrasse, the old town (Altstadt) and Niederdorf, although all three are within short walking distance of each other and connected by the city's usually uncrowded trams. The Bahnhofstrasse is especially pleasant because it is a car-free zone, but with tram services to take you from one end to the other. Zurich's shop window displays are among the most exquisite in Europe. Window shopping through the old town with its boutiques and many antique shops can bring surprises - here a window full of broken pieces of mirror with some sunglasses artistically arranged on top, there another with autumn fashions cunningly strewn across banks of fallen leaves. If you are tempted inside, you will find sales staff friendly, patient, multilingual and knowledgeable about their particular type of merchandise. Swiss sales staff do two years' apprenticeship in their special product area to qualify for a job. They will also gift-wrap anything you ask them to, be it a diamond ring or a humble potato peeler. Fashion Swiss fashion shops tend to cater for discerning, fairly conservative buyers  -but top quality materials and classic lines make up for any slight lack of originality. In so prosperous a city it is no surprise that many international names are based in or around the golden mile, as the Bahnhofstrasse is sometimes called: Chanel, Ungaro, Krizia, Cartier, Fendi, Jaeger, Burberry, Bally and Benetton are all here. Swiss establishments, such as Walter Gross, Weinberg, Grieder Les Boutiques (which sells couturiers' lines), Oskar Rom (fabulous evening gowns), Goldschmidt and Gassmann all stock high-class fashions and are worth a visit. Slightly down the scale is Modissa (take a peep at the vast pullover section on the ground floor, with every imaginable shade), Wollen Keller, Sturzenegger (special blouses), and Handar, all in Bahnhofstrasse, within a stone's throw of each other. There are three department stores on the golden mile - Globus, Jelmoli and Vilan. Although it recently had a face lift, Jelmoli has the most traditional, 'you can find anything here' image. Globus's range is less comprehensive but has a definite style and everything is colour co-ordinated (the kitchen and tableware department alone is worth a visit), and Vilan tries to appeal to the young. Go up to the rooftop restaurant in Vilan where you can admire the scenic view over the town and rest your tired feet in a conservatory - alas, without the Palm Court orchestra. As in London, there is an incredible number of shoe shops in Zurich. The Italian designers are especially popular. Without leaving Bahnhofstrasse, you will find exclusive and beautiful shoes at Bruno Magli, Ferragamo, Pedrino, Flair 2000, Michel, Moda Parade and, of course, Bally. Much of Limmatquai, along the right bank of the river at the edge of Niederdorf is devoted to shoes and watches, occasionally interspersed with sidewalk cafes and casual clothes warehouses, blaring deafening pop music. Not surprisingly, Zurich is particularly well endowed with shops selling Swiss watches, where you will be served with endless patience, whether you want a SFr20,000 diamond wristwatch or a crazy Swatch for SFr50. For handbags look in at Fendi or Maedler, both on Paradeplatz, or walk a few steps to Leder Locher on Munsterhof. It is next door to the most beautiful baroque building in Zurich, the guildhall Zunfthaus zur Meise. For underwear try Kowa or Perosa or the lingerie floors in the department stores. Silk foulards are at Leonardo's in Bahnhofstrasse or Seiden Fenigstein. And when it all becomes too much, you can rest your feet in Paradeplatz and watch the trams go by, at chairs and tables provided by Credit Suisse. Food You can find Swiss hand-made chocolates in imaginative packages at any of the Confiserie Sprungli branches around the town, at Teuscher in Storchengasse 9 or Hefti in Bahnhofstrasse. All department stores offer a variety of chocolate gifts, and Merkur in Bahnhofstrasse specialises in whimsical packaging for all occasions. Migros is the biggest supermarket chain in Switzerland and their basement food hall in Migros City, a glass and marble shopping centre in Lowenstrasse, is a showcase. The rows of mink-coated women at the checkout on a Saturday morning, especially before Christmas and the new year, are clear testimony that here one finds the freshest - as well as the cheapest - lobster and smoked salmon in town. Cheese shops abound - take home a specially put together mix of grated cheese for your next fondue from Chas Hebise in Rennweg, or choose from the huge selection downstairs in Globus's food hall. Leave some time to stroll through the city's open flower, fruit and vegetable market on a Tuesday or Friday morning on Burkliplatz at the lakeside (7-11am). The Swiss are enthusiastic about 'bio' produce (no chemicals used in cultivation) and the market is usually packed with housewives picking out exactly the tomato or apple they want (the stallholders don't complain).</p>

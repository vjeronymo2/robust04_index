			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Scots election campaign kicks off THE GENERAL election cam-paign opened in Scotland on Saturday night with a noisy public debate on the country's constitutional future between the four Scottish party leaders. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, was booed and for a time drowned out by an audience of 2,500 in Usher Hall, Edinburgh. He mounted a defence of the union and offered the other leaders discussions on ways of improving the workings of the present system of rule. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, was also subjected to booing and slow handclapping from an audience that contained disproportionately large numbers of Scottish National party members. He said Labour's plan for a Scottish parliament would be the greatest change to the British constitution in 300 years. It would be set up as soon as possible after the election of a Labour government and would have saved Scotland from the poll tax and the opting out of hospitals. Mr Malcolm Bruce, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the Conservative administration in Scotland had become 'wilfully out of touch with the wishes of the people'. The scheme for a Scottish parliament agreed between the Liberals and Labour in the Scottish constitutional convention offered proportional representation. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, proved the most effective performer. He said that no one would make a better job of running Scotland than the people who lived there. No independent Scottish government would have allowed British Steel to destroy the Scottish steel industry. Labour and the Liberals offered Scotland 'a plasticine government'.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Cutting red tape THE BRITISH like to think of themselves as a pragmatic nation with no time for the formalities which often burden their Continental rivals. Yet there is growing evidence that business in the UK is hobbling through ever more tangled lengths of red tape - not all of it imported from Brussels. Mr John Major is not the first prime minister to declare war on the problem and he will today meet ministers and senior civil servants to hear their ideas for reducing the burden. The extent of red tape has been well-documented. A small business owner would need to read 26 booklets running to nearly 270,000 words to understand all the regulations affecting him, one business lobby group has calculated. The 1980 edition of one of the basic textbooks on company law ran to 486 pages in 1980. By 1991 it had expanded to 3,544 pages. Small businesses in particular have long complained about the cost of administering VAT and the burden of compulsory audit. In recent years regulations have been added in food safety, child care, the environment and transport safety. Every piece of legislation may individually make sense but taken together they add up to a heavy burden. The government has had a deregulation initiative in place since 1985 but has failed to stem the tide of new regulation. What practical steps can it now take? First, it should resolve that new legislation will be drafted with a view to supervising the outcome of actions rather than attempting to control the details of the process. Business should be aware that there are effective penalties for actions which lead to financial fraud, food poisoning or accidents. Within this general principle there are clearly many activities which still need light-touch regulation. Notably, the translation of EC directives into UK law must be monitored to prevent UK civil servants gilding the Brussels lily. The government has already said it plans to introduce more formal techniques for measuring risks and assessing the cost to business of complying with new laws. These techniques and individual assessments need to be made public. Also, the existing deregulation drive requires a higher profile and greater political momentum. In the end, any system will only be as good as the officials responsible for applying it. Training should focus on the need to enforce rules efficiently but sensibly. The FT's own research has revealed startling examples of official zeal. The unseen costs of excessive regulation are considerable in terms of higher prices, the stifling of innovation and ultimately jobs. Removing red tape is an endless task requiring some delicate judgments but it is a challenge which yet again requires a sustained effort from the top.</p>

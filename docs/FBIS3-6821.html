Nguyen Ho, one of the most prominent internal opponents of  Vietnam's communist regime, was re-arrested early this month at  his home in Ho Chi Minh City, sources in the southern city said.  Ho -- a former Viet Cong guerrilla, trade union leader and  party figure -- had penned and circulated an article calling for  greater democracy and respect for human rights in Vietnam,  according to the US-based human rights group Asia Watch.    Ho, who is in his 70s, was held under house arrest from  September 1990 to May 1993 after trying to form a veterans'  association independent of the Communist Party. A number of  other members of the organization were also arrested this month  in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, said the sources, who did  not provide their names.    In Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry could supply no information  on  Ho, who is reportedly in poor health. But a source close to the  communist leadership acknowledged that Hanoi had decided to  tighten the screws on dissent to prevent any destabilizing  effects from the lifting of the US embargo, expected to increase  foreign influence as well as investment in Vietnam. "There is a  real risk," the source said. "Socialism in the Soviet Union  crumbled under the combined effect of foreign pressure and the  breakdown of the domestic system."    Since the embargo was scrapped in February, the official  press has stepped up its warnings against "peaceful evolution"  -- a Cold War term for the subversion of communist regimes  through economic and social change.    Vietnamese authorities insist on the need for political  stability to complete their program of "doi moi," or economic  renovation. They have confronted internal dissent -- whether it  be religious (Catholic or Buddhist) or political -- while  rejecting "external interference" in the country's affairs.  They are highly suspicious of overseas Vietnamese, particularly  those from the million-strong exile community in the United  States, made up largely of families who fled Saigon after the  1975 communist victory.    But Vietnam, which keenly needs their expertise as well as  their capital to develop its fledgling market economy, is  looking for ways to lure the "Viet Kieu" back while minimizing  the risks. "Ninety percent of the Viet Kieu are patriots who  left for economic reasons," said an unofficial government  spokesman. "But the others, with links to the old American  (client) regime, want to return to make contact with  anti-socialist forces, especially reactionary Buddhists and  Catholics.    Perhaps the most serious threat to the government comes not  from those who were on the losing side of the war but from some  of the winners -- disgruntled former communist guerrillas,  soldiers or party cadres, generally southerners.    Figures such as Ho, former General Tran Van Tra or former  Politburo member Tran Xuan Bach have shown varying degrees of  opposition to democratic centralism with its refusal of  political pluralism and limits on human rights. The secret  police are keeping several dozen such revolutionary veterans  under strict surveillance, Vietnamese sources said, suggesting  that purges were recently carried out within the party and state  apparatus.    But it would be difficult to prosecute or jail men with such  illustrious revolutionary credentials, said a veteran who spoke  on condition of anonymity. "We're not dogmatic. Political  renovation will follow economic renovation. But we will never  accept Western-style multiparty politics," said the source, who  is close to the leadership.</p>

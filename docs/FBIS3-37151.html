			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The transmission of programs by the Ostankino and  Russian television channels could cease across the whole  republic of Azerbaijan very soon. Since last November, Russia's  major television companies have owed Azerbaijan's Communications  Ministry over 500 million rubles for the hire of technical  equipment and other services. This has obviously had its effect  on payments between the communications and the energy sectors  and has also delayed the salaries of specialists by several  months.    A telegram demanding that the debt be cleared was sent to  Moscow, and the reply--signed by the heads of technical services  at the two television companies--came quite quickly: We have no  money, and accept that transmission of our programs will be  stopped.    The lack of a solution to the financial problems could lead  to cuts in broadcasts by Azerbaijan's own national television.  In the first two months of this year, the republic's Finance  Ministry allocated only one quarter of the funds it needed to  pay communications workers.    So, television could very well be added to our list of  shortages very soon.</p>

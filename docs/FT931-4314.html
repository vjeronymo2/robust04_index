			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cascades back in the black CASCADES, one of the world's top 10 packaging groups since acquiring Paperboard Industries last year, turned in a profit of CDollars 28.2m (USDollars 22.7m), or 49 cents a share, in 1992, against a loss of CDollars 1.56m, or 3 cents, in 1991. Sales were CDollars 902m, against CDollars 806m. Cascades, with plants in Canada, the US, France, Belgium and Sweden, has restructured Paperboard into a new international packaging group, selling-off a minority holding to the public. Hydro-Quebec, the Quebec government-owned power utility, reported 1992 profit of CDollars 724m (USDollars 583m), down 4.7 per cent from 1991, on revenues of CDollars 6.8bn, up 9 per cent, due mainly to higher rates. Domestic sales rose 3.8 per cent and exports 26 per cent.</p>

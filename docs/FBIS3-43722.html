During talks  with the Chinese foreign minister, Qian Qichen, at his office,  Prime Minister Tamirat said China, which has long years of  experience in modern rural agricultural development, could  certainly share its experience with Ethiopian farmers to change  their backward system of agricultural production.    Prime Minister Tamirat and the Chinese foreign minister  extensively discussed possible ways of further cementing  existing bilateral ties between Ethiopia and the Republic of  China as well as on broadening new areas of economic and  technical cooperation. Prime Minister Tamirat appraised the  Chinese deputy premier of the objective situation in the country  and Ethiopia's efforts for peace and stability in the subregion.    The Chinese foreign minister told the Ethiopian premier that  China, which maintains a 20-year technical cooperation agreement  with Ethiopia, will do its level best to further strengthen the  historical relations of the two friendly countries and  particularly to develop and promote the agricultural economy of  the country.</p>

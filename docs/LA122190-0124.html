			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MONDAVI RETIRES FROM RUNNING WINERY  </P> <P> Robert Mondavi, the globe-trotting chairman of the Napa Valley winery that  bears his name, has retired from daily management operations. He remains  chairman.  </P> <P> "I've been a manager and I'll miss it," said the 77-year-old visionary, who is  credited with dragging the sleepy California wine industry of the early 1960s  into the arena of world-class winemaking.  </P> <P> "I want to see my sons achieve what I've achieved, and I think they will. . . .  The future is bright," Mondavi said of his sons Michael and Timothy, president  and winemaker respectively, and equal managing partners.  </P> <P> "The Robert Mondavi family will continue its dedication to and active  participation in the production and marketing of the highest quality premium  varietal wines," his sons said in a statement.  </P> <P> Mondavi left his family's Charles Krug Winery and in 1966 built the first new  winery in California since Prohibition. The Spanish mission-style winery draws  nearly 500,000 visitors a year. The family also owns other California wineries.  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: France urges US to make fresh Gatt proposals FRANCE said yesterday it was now up to the US to produce 'new proposals' to bring the Gatt negotiations to the same successful conclusion as the Nafta accord. Mr Gerard Longuet, France's foreign trade minister, said the ball was now in the court of the Clinton administration which could and should henceforth 'devote itself fully to the Uruguay Round'. Reports from the US agriculture department that Washington was ready to discuss the Blair House farm trade agreement, as demanded by France, were welcomed in Paris. But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur warned against any attempt to present France with a take-it-or-leave-it Gatt accord hours before the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round. French officials said Paris would need sufficient notice of any agreement so it could consult all parties and its parliament. The French premier reiterated that a Gatt accord would need unanimous approval by European Union countries, giving France an effective veto. In response to suggestions Mr Balladur should now show the same political courage as President Clinton in facing down protectionists in his own party, a senior French official said yesterday France 'is not in the same phase of economic growth as the US and therefore does not have the same room for manoeuvre' in negotiations. French officials also criticised the tactics of Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director general, for 'pretending that the so-called Dunkel draft final agreement had the basic agreement of all parties' and diverting the Geneva negotiations onto other issues. Many Gatt participants, including the US and the EU, still had serious problems with the Dunkel draft of 1991. After a month free from any farmers' demonstrations, the Balladur government is now slightly more confident of selling an eventual compromise to its agricultural lobby.</p>

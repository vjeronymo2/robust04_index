			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nicholas Tozer] </F>   [Excerpt] Richard Nottage, Secretary of the New Zealand  Ministry of External Relations and Trade, arrived in town  yesterday as part of a three country tour which includes Chile  and Mexico.    In an interview with the HERALD Nottage said he was here  looking into a wide range of foreign policy issues and economic  and trade matters, stressing the common interests which exist  between Argentina and New Zealand -- southern hemisphere  countries who are non-permanent members of the UN Security  Council, major agricultural producers who compete on several  fronts but share common problems such as protectionism. In  outlining the current state of affairs between both countries  Nottage underscored the high degree of cooperation being  achieved on matters of common interest, singling out the Cairns  Group and the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations as two examples.    One of the questions being looked into with great detail is  what happens to both countries after the Uruguay Round. Nottage  said both he and his team -- which includes Crawford Falconer,  Director of the ministry's American Division; Ms. Lackey,  Director of Trade Negotiations and Ambassador Frank Wilson, who  is New Zealand's representative before the governments of Chile  and Argentina -- were also looking into opportunities for  further economic cooperation between both countries as well as  between trade blocs, Mercosur [Common Market of the South],  ASEAN, APEC, etc.    Reviewing global issues Nottage pinpointed trade and the  environment as being of particular interest. Within the latter a  whole range of topics such as forests, fishing and the climate  were currently being studied. As far as the economy was  concerned Nottage mentioned the importance of the New Zealand  experience of domestic economic reform started in 1984, under  which a highly regulated market had been opened to competition  through privatization of state enterprises.

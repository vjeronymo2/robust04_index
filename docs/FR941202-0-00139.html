Section 653.47 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;653.47  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Random Testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of &sect;653.73 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent. However, after the initial two years of random testing by large transit operators and the initial first year of testing by small transit operators, the Administrator may lower the rate the following calendar year, if the combined positive testing rate is less than 1.0 percent, and if it would be in the interest of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of &sect;653.73 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on November 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gordon J.

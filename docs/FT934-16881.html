			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Clean, tidy and ready for new brooms - Andrew Baxter on the challenge for Babcock's chief executive and managing director IT CAN'T have been much fun for Mr John Parker and Mr Nick Salmon to see news of their arrival at Babcock International, the big engineering contractor, accompanied by an immediate 20 per cent fall in the share price. The two men start work today as chief executive and managing director respectively at Babcock, less than a month after the company shocked the City by revealing it would report a loss for the six months ended September 30, and would pass its interim dividend. That was the result of a Pounds 20m provision because of cost over-runs on Babcock's Pounds 420m flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire, and closure costs for Babcock Africa's non-core mining activities. It was just the latest in a long run of knocks for Babcock over the past year - the loss of Pounds 6.2m on a power station contract in Humberside, the departure in May of Mr Oliver Whitehead as chief executive, and the choice of Devonport as the UK's nuclear submarine refitting base in preference to Rosyth, where Babcock has the management contract. Inevitably, the bad financial news rather overshadowed the appointment of Mr Parker, who joins Babcock after 10 years as chairman and chief executive of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast ship builder, and Mr Salmon, formerly deputy managing director of GEC Alsthom's gas turbine and diesel division. However, the appointments could mark a turning point in Babcock's fortunes, and those of its two new chiefs. Babcock will not disclose its succession plans, but it seems likely that Mr Parker could end up as chairman of the company, taking over from Lord King in two or three years. Mr Salmon might then step up to become chief executive. The two new men are not talking yet about their plans for the company, but a rigorous review of the business over the past year by Lord King and Mr Jeff Whalley, who has been acting chief executive since May and will remain as joint deputy chairman with Mr Parker, has laid the ground and pointed the way ahead. The picture that emerges is a company that is, in Mr Whalley's words, 'clean and tidy,' with no more shocks in store for shareholders. But it also has a number of strategic challenges to address around its main divisions: Materials handling: Last year's acquisition of Consilium was intended to add ship-to-shore materials handling to Claudius Peters' onshore bulk handling equipment, mainly for cement. Manufacturing and marketing has been rationalised and combined, and management 'needed a push along, and to show a bit more aggression,' says Mr Whalley. The division makes about Pounds 9m to Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 150m to Pounds 160m, but could achieve as much as 10 per cent return on sales, he says. Facilities management: Babcock Thorn's management contract at Rosyth, a 65-35 arrangement with Thorn EMI, runs out in April 1995, but can be extended for a year either by the government or the contractors. Mr Whalley says Babcock, as sitting tenant, is in a good position to win a renewed contract or bid for the dockyard if the government decides to privatise it. Meanwhile, with employment at Rosyth down from 7,000 in 1987 to 3,800, Babcock is keen to build up its rail refurbishment work at Rosyth, a business it entered through the 1991 acquisition of Coventry-based Tickford Rail. As Tickford only refits carriages it needs to form a partnership with a company that knows how to refurbish locomotives to be sure of winning future business from British Rail. It is talking to a number of potential partners. Energy: This is another area where partnerships or joint ventures could be crucial to Babcock's future. In the past, it was the natural supplier of boilers to UK-funded GEC power stations built all over the UK and the old British empire. But GEC Alsthom, inheritor of the GEC power plants business, has its own boiler makers in France and Germany, and Babcock has to fight much harder to win business. It is also having to respond to the need for more local content in big Far Eastern contracts, which explains why the Renfrew plant has seen employment fall by 400 to 1,150 in the past few months. In the City it is no secret that Babcock is talking to other boiler makers with different geographical strengths and modern 'clean coal' technologies. A deal with a turbine producer which lacks its own boilers could also make sense. Contractors: Closely related to the energy division, this has also had to respond to the collapse of traditional UK markets, such as nuclear work. The purchase of King Wilkinson 18 months ago took it into the Middle East oil and gas contracting business. It is also beginning to expand in Asia. At Drax, the Pounds 15m cost overrun was caused by the need to 'flood' the site with workers so that Babcock could keep to its deadlines following a technical problem last autumn. With a new team running the contract, Mr Whalley says he feels much more comfortable, and is confident that the first two of six FGD units will be handed over to National Power on December 17. The problem at Drax, however, highlights a broader issue that the new chiefs at Babcock will have to resolve. If a Pounds 15m provision can cause such havoc financially, is the company big enough to survive in the risky world of contracting? According to Mr Whalley, the current balance sheet of Pounds 90m is big enough for Babcock's current level of business. However, if the new team makes a success of developing Babcock's contracting business in international markets, which is where its skills are needed most, it looks as if the balance sheet will have to expand too. 'If they want to expand in the Far East, and cope with the penalty clauses, no money up front, and slow progress payments in modern contracting, it is obvious that the balance sheet will have to expand,' says Mr Jonathan Getz at Robert Fleming Securities. There are, of course, a number of ways Babcock could achieve this. But that will be up to the new team.</p>

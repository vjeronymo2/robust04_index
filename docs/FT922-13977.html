			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Another Hyundai company targeted by authorities HYUNDAI Merchant Marine yesterday became the latest of several Hyundai subsidiaries to be penalised within a week for financial irregularities in what South Korea's second largest conglomerate claims is a campaign of intimidation by the government. Korea's largest shipping company was fined 27.1bn won (Pounds 20m) for tax evasion between 1987 and 1991 by the Office of National Tax Administration. Mr Chung Mong-hun, the owner of Hyundai Marine, and two company officials were also charged for violating tax and foreign exchange rules. Mr Chung is a son of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai group, whose new conservative political party captured 31 seats in last month's National Assembly elections on a platform criticising the government's economic policy. Meanwhile, Hyundai Wood Industries yesterday was charged with exceeding permissible limits on pollution discharges, while three other Hyundai subsidiaries were denied permission to be registered for the country's over-the-counter market. Yesterday's actions followed a threat by the Office of Bank Supervision to abolish the unlimited borrowing rights for Hyundai Electronics Industries tomorrow because of alleged bank loan violations.</p>

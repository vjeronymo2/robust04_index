			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first step in the proposed new process would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compilation of related services that have been determined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the definition and other criteria specified in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation (the Related Service List or simply ``the list'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in proposed &sect;618.8010(c)(2), the list would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> briefly describe each related service, capturing key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguishing aspects of the activity, as well as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of the types of institutions authorized to offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specific services. Institutional restrictions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mainly be due to statutory limitations related to eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients. Finally, any special conditions placed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering a given service would be identified on the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that these conditions would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception rather than the rule and would apply mainly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex services, with readily identifiable safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soundness risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A contains a sample list consisting of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously approved related services known to have at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one active program among System banks and associations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those services specifically mentioned in the statute. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample list is included as an attachment to this <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document for informational purposes only and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not become part of the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although every attempt has been made to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing services, the FCA recognizes that its historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records may not be complete. Therefore, System banks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations currently offering services that meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related service definition, but are not part of the sample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list, should submit such services during the comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they wish to continue providing them after the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation becomes effective. Institutions should provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the title of the service and a brief description, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any previous action taken by the FCA on the related service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If there is no existing documentation, then the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should provide sufficient information for the FCA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the service based on the provisions in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8010(b). These services may be included on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial list to be published concurrently with the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. If some services require further study, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be considered for inclusion on the list after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is finalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a service is determined to meet the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria and is placed on the list, proposed &sect;618.8010(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide that System banks and associations could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop programs and subsequently offer the related service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to any special conditions and institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions identified on the list. This proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the requirement in existing &sect;618.8000(c) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA approve each institution's related services program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA believes that an institution's program for offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service and its capacity to offer that service can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed during the examination process. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8010(c)(4) would require that when a listed service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first offered by an institution, the institution must notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA's Office of Examination field office responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examining that institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution that wishes to offer a related service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not previously evaluated by the FCA would need to submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written proposal pursuant to proposed &sect;618.8010(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither a formal bank review nor a detailed operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program (per existing regulations) would be required prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to requesting that the FCA review the service. In the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of complex or controversial proposals, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8010(b)(3) acknowledges that the FCA, at its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion, may publish the proposed service in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No later than 60 days after receipt of a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, including any additional information the FCA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require, System institutions would be notified of the FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action pursuant to &sect;618.8010(b)(4). Although the FCA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally act promptly on a proposed service, for good cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and prior to the expiration of the 60 days, the review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period could be extended for up to a total of 120 days. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA would formally notify all System institutions of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action by bookletter or other appropriate forms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new related services would be evaluated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA based on the provisions of proposed &sect;618.8010(b). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA would consider two key aspects in evaluating a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. The first aspect is whether the service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized; that is, whether it meets the definition of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related service in proposed &sect;618.8000(b). For example, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service provided by a title I or title II lending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would have to be appropriate to on-farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations and would have to be targeted to the defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible recipients. When evaluating that service, the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also consider whether the service would be appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cooperative operations and, if so, include BCs and ACBs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as authorized institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second key aspect the FCA would consider is whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant risk factors are inherent in the service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether they can be managed or eliminated. This evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would involve assessing the degree of risks in the areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial liability, operational matters, and conflicts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Outcome crucial for British Coal THE election will affect British Coal more than almost any other UK company. Under the Tories, it will be privatised, and might eventually shrink to nearly half its present size. Under Labour it would be a public company, and the bulk of its pits would stay open. 'If we are elected,' says Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, 'we would immediately stop any move to privatise British Coal, and reverse any moves designed simply for privatisation.' Labour would also protect British Coal's markets by a moratorium on building new gas-fired power stations, to force the electricity industry, British Coal's main customer, to keep buying coal. Labour would further protect British Coal by restricting imports of foreign coal. The Conservatives welcome competition from gas and imported coal because it will put pressure on British Coal prices, and thus on electricity prices. If a Conservative government is returned, National Power and PowerGen, the generating companies, will probably announce plans to increase coal imports by building new terminals capable of handling around 40m tonnes by the mid 90s. Whoever wins on April 9 will oversee the contract negotiations which will determine how much coal British Coal sells to the electricity industry. A Tory government would be more likely to influence British Coal to drop prices and tonnage sales to the generators, and to sign a one-year contract rather than the long-term agreement the company would like and would get under Labour.</p>

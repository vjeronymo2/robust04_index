			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: The will to train must be there Sir, I agree entirely with Samuel Brittan's article on training (Economic Viewpoint, August 13). However, while the 'credentialist fad' is clearly out of control in the US and probably more so in Japan, it does have a more subtle effect. It ensures that training and education are important, desirable and socially acceptable - which for most of the 83 per cent of the British workforce without degrees is not the case. For them training is an occupational hazard, to be taken as quickly as possible, to be forgotten soon after and avoided wherever possible. Before training becomes effective, there must be a desire by the participant to acquire and to use the new skills and information. Otherwise, training in whatever guise will not benefit anyone.

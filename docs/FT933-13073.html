			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax-efficient pay rises ease unemployment Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'Changeable forecasts' (July 17), and would like to expand upon a theory as to why the two key indicators - retail price inflation and unemployment - have recently been so favourable. I specialise in the activity known as profit-related pay, an area of tax legislation designed to motivate employees by relating a proportion of their pay to company profits, with that profit-related element being paid without deduction of tax. The untaxed element can be up to 20 per cent of gross pay, or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower. Over the last year, virtually every profitable business employing more than 30 staff has either put in place a PRP scheme or is actively considering it for its next financial year. This is because, in most cases, an appropriately devised PRP scheme can effectively substitute up to 20 per cent of existing salaried pay with tax-free profit-related pay without recourse to movements in the company's profits. This will have the effect of providing employees earning up to Pounds 20,000 per annum with pay increases of up to 5 per cent net or gross equivalent increases of 7.5 per cent at no cost to the company. Businesses are actively introducing PRP at a time when they would normally otherwise have offered a pay rise in lieu. In other cases, where industries are hit by recession or where employers are more greedy, staff are being asked to accept gross pay reductions of up to 5 per cent while still being promised higher net salaries. This can allow an employer to avoid making redundancies that would otherwise have been necessary. More than 1.2m employees were in PRP schemes by March 1993 and their number is likely to have increased substantially since then. While the impact that PRP is having on wage inflation and unemployment figures is healthy, one should be aware of the corollary effect it is having on tax revenues collected through the PAYE system.

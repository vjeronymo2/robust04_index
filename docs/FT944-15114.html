			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Ericsson rings the bell in Chinese market  -With telecom sales doubling each year, financing expansion is a big headache Mr Lars Magnus Ericsson, the founder of the Swedish telecommunications group that bears his name, would not have been surprised at the group's success in China. He may, though, have been puzzled that it took so long to materialise. A 1906 photograph shows Mr Ericsson welcoming the first Chinese delegation to the group's Stockholm headquarters. It is only now - after the hiatus caused by the Chinese revolution - that the group's efforts to develop the market have really started to bear fruit. The rapid development of the Chinese telecommunications market has been a boon for equipment suppliers worldwide - but few have benefited as much as Ericsson. The group, which employs 1,400 in China, has seen sales in its fastest-growing market double every year over the last three years, a feat it hopes to repeat again this year. Last year China was Ericsson's sixth biggest market, accounting for SKr3.8bn (Dollars 520m) of group sales of SKr63bn. Ericsson's Chinese business centres on three areas: AXE switches for public networks, mobile telephone systems and office switching systems. In mobile systems, the group boasts a 60 per cent market share, a dominance in line with its leading global position. In fixed systems, where the leading supplier is France's Alcatel, it claims a market share of about 20 per cent and in office systems 30 per cent. By comparison, it is weak in mobile handsets, which is dominated by Motorola of the US. A steady inflow of orders over the last three years culminated in August in Ericsson's biggest contract in China so far - a Dollars 400m contract to extend the phone network in Guangdong province. China's most dynamic province, Guangdong accounts for half Ericsson's sales to the country. 'We have 3.5m fixed lines already installed in China and a further 2.5m on order,' says Mr Uldis Zervens, Ericsson's director for east Asia. On the mobile side, the group has capacity installed or on order for 1.5m subscribers. Most of the equipment comes directly from Sweden. But increasingly important are the group's joint venture colloborations in China with local partners. Ericsson already has five joint ventures, comprising three manufacturing units and two service companies, and more are planned. The biggest collaboration is in Nanjing where the group produces radio base stations for mobile systems and AXE switches with its partner, Panda Electronics. Guangdong, Beijing and Dalian are the sites for the other four ventures. The Nanjing joint venture got off the ground only after nearly three years of talks with the Chinese authorities. The decision-making involves three tiers of government - federal, provincial and local - and up to 15 different organisations, even though the end-customer has until now always been part of the ministry of post and telecommunications. At the state level alone, five different ministries are involved. In theory the Chinese cake is big enough for everyone. In practice, competition is tough, says Ericsson. At present there are only about 30m fixed lines in a country of 1.2bn people  -a penetration rate of just 2.5 per cent of the population. But the authorities are ambitious, planning 10m new lines a year to achieve 8 per cent penetration by 2000. The constraint is that the enormous development potential is matched only by the huge difficulties of financing it. Even though telecommunications is a priority area, there are clear indications that the authorities wish to restrict the availability of credits and guarantees for equipment supplies. This could pose problems for companies such as Ericsson although it could also provide an opportunity if it results in foreign operators being given more access to the country's market. Mr Zervens says project financing looms as Ericsson's biggest Chinese headache. New rules of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 25-member industrial nation grouping, mean it is much harder to get soft loans for the development of fixed networks; at the same time western commercial banks and credit guarantee agencies are reaching the limits of their China exposure. One result is that Ericsson has had to subsidise some of the loans itself. 'So far we have been able to handle this but we see it as one of the major challenges for next year,' says Mr Zervens. He says one way around the difficulty would be for Ericsson to take some financing risk on to its own books, a path it has reluctantly taken with other countries in the past. Another is for China to let foreign operators gain a foothold in the market  -a breakthrough that came all the closer last week when Cable and Wireless of the UK became the first foreign company to gain a concession to play a role in operating telecom networks.</p>

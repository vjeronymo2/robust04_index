			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK holds back from Bosnia withdrawal Britain decided yesterday to keep its peacekeepers in Bosnia for the time being, while the US offered to contribute a 'substantial portion' of any Nato force sent to provide cover for a withdrawal. Defence officials in Washington said the US was willing to send about half of a Nato force of 20,000 to 25,000 troops to provide cover for any pullout. But a White House official added that the US did not immediately expect the United Nations to pull its peacekeepers out of Bosnia. The latest US pronouncements - acknowledging the peacekeepers' humanitarian achievements, while standing ready to help withdraw them if necessary - amounted to a gesture of reconciliation towards Washington's European allies. In London, senior ministers decided to keep the status of British troops in Bosnia 'under very close review' after hearing gloomy assessments from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. But no decision was made to withdraw the British contingent of more than 3,000 soldiers, and officials said they were still conscious of the tragic consequences a pullout could have. The officials said London's pessimism reflected the negative signals coming from many different quarters in Bosnia, including Mr Radovan Karadzic, whom they viewed as 'erratic and unpredictable' despite his offer this week to enter negotiations. British officials also viewed as 'disgraceful' an attack on UK policy in Bosnia by Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador to the UN, who has accused the UK of condoning the Serbs' conduct. In Sarajevo, the UN accused the Croatian army of intervening directly in the fighting in Bosnia and called for its immediate withdrawal. The allegations of intervention by Zagreb have renewed fears of fighting between Croats and Serbs. Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, warned that if the UN failed to act, Serb fighters would be 'forced to reclaim Serbian lands' from the Croatian army in Bosnia. Croatian intervention appears aimed at driving a wedge between Serb-held lands in Bosnia and Croatia. Mr Milan Babic, a leader of the rebel Serbs from Croatia, warned that Zagreb's military involvement would sabotage an accord signed recently by the Croat government and Serb-controlled areas on restoration of economic links. 'This participation of the Croatian army clearly breaks international law and is a violation of the sovereignty of the territory of Bosnia,' said Mr Thant Myint-U, a UN spokesman. Bosnian Serbs, meanwhile, released a critically needed aid convoy headed for the Serb-besieged 'safe haven' of Bihac and freed Canadian UN troops who had been held hostage.</p>

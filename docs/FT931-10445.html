			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Safeway to cut staff as full-year profits decline SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group, yesterday unveiled plans to cut its corporate administrative staff, contributing to a charge against fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 13.8m, or 12 cents a share. The charge will also cover the cost of consolidating Safeway's distribution centre in Sacramento into a new centre in Tracy, California. Safeway, which employs about 1,000 people in corporate administration, did not say how many might lose their jobs. The company's overall earnings for 1992 were depressed by tough competition in the US food retail industry. In the 1992 fourth quarter, Safeway earned Dollars 22.2m, or 19 cents a share, against a net loss of Dollars 47.7m, or 48 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 4.85bn from Dollars 4.66bn. For the whole of 1992, Safeway earned Dollars 43.5m, or 37 cents compared with profits of Dollars 54.9m, or 48 cents in 1991. Sales totalled Dollars 15.15bn against Dollars 15.12bn in 1991. Stripping out one-time items, Safeway said its underlying annual earnings rose to Dollars 98.4m, or 83 cents, from Dollars 79m, or 69 cents.</p>

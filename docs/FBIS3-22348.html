There, he met representatives of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, World Bank, Agency for  International Development, Department of Energy, and  congressmen. Representatives of U.S. state bodies expressed  their great interest in cooperation with Ukraine in the sphere  of ecology and examined a package of proposals on steps to be  taken as a matter of priority to improve the state of Ukraine's  environment, presented by Yuriy Kostenko. Among them, in  particular, were setting up some of the most up-to-date  laboratories to monitor the radiological quality of water,  organizing the disposal of toxic waste, making educational TV  programs on ecology, and developing the MinPryrody  [Environmental Protection Ministry] informational and  educational center. The American side is planning to allocate  $6 million to implement these projects. Commenting on this  report, the MinPryrody press center added that ecological  projects would be financed by the U.S. Agency for International  Cooperation. It has long cooperated with Ukraine, and, in  particular, will take part in privatization processes. This  agency recently opened its headquarters in Kiev. It is this  headquarters that will directly support various projects in  Ukraine financially and methodologically.</p>

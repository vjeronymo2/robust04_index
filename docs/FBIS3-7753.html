			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Hours have elapsed  since the downing of four aircraft over the Banja Luka region in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday morning, but it has not been  established yet whose the aircraft were.    NATO has so far given only the basic elements about the  operation carried out on Monday morning by U.S. Phantoms. The  official NATO statement said that the operation took place at  around 07:00 hours local time, and that two F-16s fighters shot  down four aircraft near Banja Luka.    No other facts are known for the time being. It is not known  precisely which type of planes were downed, to whom they had  belonged, and from where they had taken off.    World media have neverthless been alleging since early  morning that the planes belonged to the Bosnian Serb republic  (R.S.), that they were Galebs, and had violated the U.N.-imposed  no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Two categorical denials have so far come from the R.S. that  the downed planes were not Bosnian Serb. The denials have not,  however, stopped foreign media from alleging that they belonged  to the Serb Republic.    TANJUG was told in Bosnian Serb army (VRS) circles that the  VRS had only one airfield, near Banja Luka, and that U.N.  military observers had been stationed there for quite some time.  The same sources underscored that U.N. military observers would  have no doubt seen if any VRS planes had taken off from the  airfield on Monday morning.    The VRS sources denied that any VRS aircraft had been  downed,  which they said could be confirmed by U.N. military observers.    Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo early on Monday morning  said  that Croat forces bombed the towns of Vitez and Novi Travnik,  and that afterwards, at 06:15 hours local time to be exact, Serb  planes raided the town of Bugojno.    The same source said that Croat planes attacked the  ammunition factory in Novi Travnik at 5:58 GMT, i.e. ten minutes  after the downing of the allegedly Serb planes. Unidentified  French military sources, which have been quoted by some foreign  news agencies, have created additional confusion by alleging  that the ammunition factory was bombed by Serb plames.    Naturally, it is hard to believe that the missing elements  concerning the four downed planes will not be filled in.  However, things are repeating themselves. The Bosnian Serbs  are again being blamed in advance, before the necessary facts  have been established. The same was true in the case of the  massacres in Sarajevo's Vase Miskina Street and again recently  at Sarajevo's Markale open air market.    The downing of the four planes on Monday morning was NATO's  first combat operation since the military alliance was founded  in 1949. Although the two U.N. Security Council resolutions  relating to the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina are invoked  to justify the operation, it is a clear indication that NATO was  not at all happy at not having had the opportunity militarily to  act after the expiry of the NATO ultimatum set to the Bosnian  Serbs. It has been conceded even in western political circles  that the thwarting of NATO air strikes was Russia's diplomatic  victory.    The question which presents itself in that context is  whether  the Monday morning operation was an attempt to get even with  Russia.</p>

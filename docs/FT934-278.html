			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Zhirinovsky party lead in duma confirmed Official results of Russia's December 12 general election, published yesterday, confirm the strong showing of nationalist and former Communist parties. In the lower house of parliament, or state duma the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky secured 64 seats, followed by the pro-reform Russia's Choice with 58 seats. Other results were: Communist party (48), Agrarian party (33), Women of Russia (23), Yabloko (22), Party of Russian Unity and Concord (19), the Democratic Party of Russia (14), other parties (33) and those with no party affiliation gained 130 seats. In the federal assembly (upper house), the composition was very different as the election law did not reserve any seats for parties. The overwhelming majority, 143 out of 171, claimed no party affiliation. Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, a Communist party member on trial for his role in the failed Soviet coup of August 1991, was 'almost unanimously' elected chairman of the temporary co-ordination commission of the new parliament. The party yesterday announced that about 20 representatives of parties had selected Mr Lukyanov, who was elected in the general election from his region of Smolensk in western Russia. Mr Lukyanov was once chairman of the Soviet congress of people's deputies, the parliament of the Gorbachev era. He has been released from jail since being accused of high treason but could face the death sentence if convicted in the protracted coup trial.</p>

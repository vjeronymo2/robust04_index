			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Compulsively nasty dreams PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION by D M Thomas Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 278 pages FLYING INTO LOVE by D M Thomas Sceptre Pounds 5.99, 261 pages IT IS difficult to say which of these novels - last year's Kennedy saga, Flying into Love, or this year's dose of Auschwitz-angst, Pictures at an Exhibition - is the more distasteful. Nuns, women in general and President Kennedy get a bad time in the former, while the latter has it in for concentration camp survivors and Thatcher's chattering classes. The trouble is that both books are - up to a point  - compulsively readable and no doubt their content will be given serious intellectual consideration in some quarters. D M Thomas's obsession with sexual perversity and death is supposedly rendered respectable in the case of Pictures at an Exhibition by his interest in psycho-analysis and the after-effects of the extermination of 6m Jews in the last World War. In the Kennedy book, Thomas's masturbatory fantasies about nuns and Kennedy are prefaced by the fuzzy assertion that 'fiction is a kind of dream and history is a kind of dream and this is both'. But few people have such nasty dreams as Thomas. The same D M Thomas is a poet of some stature (winner of a Cholmondeley Award in 1981; The Puberty Tree, New and Selected Poems is published by Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 8.95) but you would never guess it from these two offerings. In both, he uses mainly dialogue or some form of confessional narrative - letter, journal or a transcript of an analytical session - and so the language is reduced to the level used by his characters in everyday life. Poets do not necessarily have interesting minds outside their poetry. The White Hotel succeeded largely because of the transformational power of the heightened language in which it was written. Take that away and what you have left, as here, oscillates between the banal and the absurd. Pictures, for example, opens with the first-person accounts of Galewski, a Jewish doctor whose medical qualifications give him privileged status at Birkenau and whose psycho-analytic experience is sought by the German Dr Lorenz. We then shift to a middle-aged woman in 1991 and read verbatim her first session with a young trainee therapist, Chris, who is himself being analysed by an elderly and infirm Dr Jacobson who may or may not be related to one of the doctors in the Birkenau section. Jacobson's other student therapist, Rachel, has an obsession about a massacre of children at Byelaya Tserkov: both she and Chris are obviously totally unsuited to their new profession. Jacobson knows this, so what is he up to? The story is cleverly convoluted and there are generous helpings of illicit sex between the various protagonists as it unravels. The chapters are named after paintings by Munch, which are given further consideration during an exhibition organised by Jacobson's wife, where Munch himself appears to talk to one of the more deranged characters. The shock ending, which is presumably meant to be enigmatic and thought-provoking, comes across as merely melodramatic and cheap. Melodramatic and cheap are also the words that spring to mind to describe the Kennedy book. This is idol-bashing taken to psychopathic extremes and is interesting only as an example of the depth to which a once-talented writer can sink when he picks the wrong topic. It's a real stinker.</p>

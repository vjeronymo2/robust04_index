			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Cerus expects another heavy deficit CERUS, the troubled French holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, expects to record another heavy loss for 1991, though the deficit will be well down on the previous year, writes William Dawkins. The group expects to make a FFr1.3bn (Dollars 230m) net loss for last year, against the FFr2.2bn net loss recorded in 1990. It attributed the deficit to FFr470m write-downs on the reduced value of Cerus' investments in Spanish industry, a FFr400m loss from Dumenil Leble, Cerus' French banking arm, plus provisions for losses on further asset sales.</p>

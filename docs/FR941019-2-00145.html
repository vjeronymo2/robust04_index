			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Proposed Corrective Language <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ITC proposes that a new paragraph 5 be added at the end of IV A at page 7, to wit: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Defendants shall neither enter into any agreement or understanding, whether written or oral, and any U.S. LICENSEE, nor enforce or implement any existing such agreement or understanding, having the purpose or effect of preventing, interfering with, or otherwise handicapping efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES to enter the float process technology market anywhere in the world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Department should accelerate this critically important phase of its investigation and indicate via issuance of a press release that the investigation of alleged conspiratorial conduct among Pilkington and its licensees is continuing. The Department would be derelict in its duties were it to stand idle given the evidence in its possession. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Preventing Defendants From Using Assertions of Proprietary Float Technology Know-How Rights or Claims of Confidentiality To Preclude or Retard Efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES To Enter the Float Technology Process Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For decades Pilkington has been highly successful in discouraging prospective clients from dealing with U.S. NON-LICENSEES simply by asserting that Pilkington had been the first to develop float process technology and thus had the exclusive worldwide right to use or license that technology, and that for anyone to secure such technology from non-Pilkington sources was to invite litigation. This mantra has been repeated so often and so categorically by Pilkington and its allies that at this point in time many potential clients simply accept the primacy of Pilkington in float process-technology as an immutable given_baseless though it may be. This pattern of Pilkington conduct_fraudulent claims of exclusivity and confidentiality, accompanied by threats of litigation (should the use of non-Pilkington float process technology be contemplated) to prospective customers, competing sources of technology and float technology and sources of capital, materials and supplies, has continued at least through the spring of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this unbroken record of illegal conduct, the resulting deeply entrenched cartel, and the substantial economic harm caused thereby, it is obvious that the relief proposed in Section IV.B.2 of the proposed decree falls woefully short of the mark. In the first place, defendants having such a record of illegal conduct are hardly entitled to any benefit of the doubt regarding their alleged good faith in asserting proprietary float technology know-how rights and claims of confidentiality; to the contrary, the burden of proof regarding such assertions must necessarily rest upon Pilkington, rather than upon the victims of its repeated acts of illegality. Indeed, as proposed, the decree language invites precisely the sort of protracted exercise which places prospective new entrants at a fatal disadvantage. Further, the decree must contain a mechanism for fairly, quickly and effectively resolving any disputes regarding proprietary know-how or confidentiality in a neutral setting, and defendants must be enjoined from making any assertions regarding know-how rights and confidentiality unless and until their position is vindicated through the dispute resolution mechanism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More particularly, Section IV.B.2 should be replaced in its entirety by the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. No defendant shall assert against U.S. NON-LICENSEES (other than in respect of Agreements referred to in subparagraph B.1. above) any alleged proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY Know-how rights (including any claim of Confidentiality) that it or any U.S. LICENSEE claims to have with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY offered by U.S. NON-LICENSEES anywhere in the world, or communicate to third parties regarding any such assertions or claims, unless for each such claim the following occurs: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Defendants shall have the burden of describing in writing with specificity the item of float technology covered by each claim and shall provide a detailed statement setting forth the basis for the claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. a copy of the aforesaid statements shall be served upon the Court, the U.S. NON-LICENSEE involved and the Department of Justice; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. the U.S. NON-LICENSEE and the Department shall serve any reply thereto to the court and Pilkington within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the Pilkington specification of allegations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2d. unless the matter is resolved via negotiations between or among the defendants and the U.S. NON-LICENSEES within five (5) days, the court shall appoint a special master knowledgeable in float technology to conduct an inquiry to determine whether defendants have met their burden, and will promptly file a written report and recommendation to the court;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. the court will enter an appropriate order; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. only if the court order supports the claim will defendants then be permitted to notify others of the trade secrets rights and claims of confidentiality against any U.S. NON-LICENSEE; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Pilkington will pay all costs should it not prevail. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ITC recognizes that such a dispute resolution mechanism has a regulatory flavor and that the Department often disfavors regulatory decrees. However, several factors militate strongly in favor of such an approach in the unique circumstances here presented. First, the proposed truth seeking process would be triggered at the earliest stage of the dispute, before the invariably corrosive and damaging false accusations circulate among prospective clients, sources of financial support and suppliers. A somewhat similar approach proved potentially useful in evaluating Guardian's trade secrets claims against ITC and Euroglas. Procedural ambiguities, confusion about the format and Guardian's reluctance to participate at the critical early stage in the process substantially compromised the proceeding, but all such potential problems have been eliminated from the mechanism proposed above. The clean bill of health ultimately achieved by ITC in the Euroglas situation unfortunately had little practical effect because Guardian had had a year to fraudulently disparage the ITC design before the report was issued. This difficulty is avoided in the proposed mechanism by enjoining Pilkington from making such characterizations until and unless it had met its burden of proof, which both creates an incentive for Pilkington to cooperate in seeking an early resolution of the dispute and prevents the circulation of fraudulent assertions until the process has been completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

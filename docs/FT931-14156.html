			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges jobs strategy LABOUR yesterday dropped its controversial election plans for higher income tax and national insurance contributions as it called on the government to put a new employment and investment strategy at the heart of its March 16 Budget. In a shift signalling that the party has learnt the lesson of four consecutive defeats, Mr John Smith said that an emergency programme to tackle unemployment and boost investment could be financed largely by a windfall tax on privatised utilities. Additional revenue could be raised by deferring the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions and closing a number of tax loopholes. The package marks the first stage in a move by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, to shift the debate away from his party's tax and spending plans to its long-term strategy of improving industrial competitiveness. In a series of speeches over coming weeks he is expected to identify education, training and investment in infrastructure and industry as the core priorities of a future Labour government. He will argue that debates over the level of the borrowing requirement or the exchange rate distract attention from the central weakness of the economy: a failure to invest in the nation's productive capacity and in its workforce. He is expected to signal that the party can no longer pre-occupy itself with arcane philosophical debates over the roles of capital and labour and the line between the public and private sectors. Labour's more immediate priority is to contrast its call for a firm offer of work or training for all those out of work for a year or more with the government's intention to weaken its guarantees for 1m unemployed people aged between 16 and 24. Rejecting the concept of 'make-work' programmes, Mr Brown said the principle behind government employment and training schemes should be that they contribute to economic efficiency. He called for a series of other Budget initiatives including the offer of financial help to small companies. He demanded also that local authorities be allowed to release more of their existing capital receipts to help restore confidence in the construction industry.</p>

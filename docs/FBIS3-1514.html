This followed a siege on his home on Monday  night after earlier running gun battles between Azanian People's  Liberation Army [APLA] cadres, members of Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC military wing] and Transkei  security forces in Port St Johns.    Mr Mposelwa's nephew described how he and his three small  daughters huddled in his uncle's home as bullets flew above them  in a night of terror. "I was thinking of dying," said a shaken  Mr Mongi Hongana. "It's lucky for me I am still alive."    Speaking at the Port St Johns police station, where he and  his family took refuge early on Tuesday, Mr Hongana said he  worked on one of his uncle's smallholdings near the town.    Mr Mposelwa, accompanied by several armed bodyguards,  fetched  him from the farm about 3.30pm on Monday. As they drove through  Port St Johns men in a bakkie [pickup truck] opened fire on them  and Mr Mposelwa's bodyguards shot back.    Mr Hongana, who jumped off the bakkie in terror, made his  way  through the bush to Mr Mposelwa's house where he was living with  his wife Patricia and three daughters. After dusk the house came  under heavy fire.    He, his wife and their daughters Orienda, 10, Patience, 6,  and Unathi, 5, huddled in the dark in a corridor at the back of  the house which was not directly exposed to gunfire through  windows.    Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards were also there, he said.    "The children tried to cry, but we said no, no, because we  were hiding."    Early on Tuesday he ran to neighbours who arranged for the  police to fetch him and his family. He did not know where his  uncle went, he said. Nor did he know who was responsible for  the shooting. He had arrived from East London only three months  ago and had devoted his attention to the farm. "Because I'm new  here I don't know what is happening," he said.    "When I first came here my uncle told me someone wants to  kill him." No one in the house returned fire on monday night,  he said.    The front wall of the house, which is only a few hundred  metres from the police station and overlooks the sea, was  riddled with bullet marks and plaster was gouged out from bursts  of automatic fire. Some bullets had passed through two closed  doors and lodged in the wall of the passage where the Honganas,  Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards sheltered.    In the lounge a charred radiogram stood against one wall,  apparently set on fire by a stray bullet. Above it, a melted  plastic clock had stopped at 8.43, presumably the time of the  attack.    A Transkei Defence Force team arrived from Umtata to inspect  the scene on Tuesday afternoon.    Mr Hongana said he was expecting to be escorted to Umtata by  police.</p>

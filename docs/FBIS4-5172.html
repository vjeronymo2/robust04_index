			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A ten-day film show  opened in Korea to celebrate the 15th of April.    Showing in the period are documentary films on the history  of  the revolutionary activities of the great leader President Kim  Il-song, including "The Leader Is the Great Father of Our  People" and "The Great Leader Has Opened a Broad Avenue for  Bumper Crops", and feature films, including "The Star of Korea"  (parts 1-10), "The Sun of the Nation" (parts 1-5) and "The  Nation and Destiny" (follow-ups).    The films impressively show the course of the revolutionary  struggle of the respected leader, the national pride and honor  of the Korean people dynamically advancing under his leadership  and the superiority of the Korean-style socialist system centred  on the masses.    Opening ceremonies took place in provincial, city and county  seats Thursday.</p>

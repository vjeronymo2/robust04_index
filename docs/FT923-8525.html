			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Ramos aide resigns over mining taxes MR Peter Garrucho, the chief aide of Philippine President Fidel Ramos, has resigned over policy differences on mining taxes. Mr Ramos yesterday said he had accepted the 'irrevocable' resignation of Mr Garrucho, who was his executive secretary and key adviser on energy affairs. On July 3, only days after the Ramos administration assumed power, Mr Garrucho signed an order instructing the Bureau of Internal Revenue to refund Pesos 2bn (Pounds 43m) to mining companies, representing earlier payments of value added taxes from which, Mr Garrucho ruled, they were exempt. The BIR differed, however, and brought up the matter with Mr Ramos, who apparently was not consulted by Mr Garrucho before the order was issued. The resignation raises for the administration the awkward prospect of a cabinet upheaval after only five weeks in office. Mr Ramos has picked Mr Edelmiro Amante, now a member of the House of Representatives, as Mr Garrucho's replacement.</p>

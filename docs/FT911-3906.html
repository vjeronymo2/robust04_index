			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (33): Reaching a far wider audience - Object Oriented Programming THE computer industry throws up new jargon with monotonous regularity and nowhere is this more true than in the software sector. Software developers appear to adore arcane language and have produced a succession of intriguing, high-sounding phrases to describe the artefacts they create. Non-procedural programming languages, life-cycle management, user-friendly systems and relational databases are examples from the last decade. The start of the 1990s has seen the arrival of another: object-oriented. Its main virtue for the marketing department is its universality. It can be applied to virtually every facet of software. In the last couple of years databases, languages, design methods and systems architectures have all become object-oriented. However, behind the awkward American-English (it should, of course, be object-orientated), there is a serious intent. Object-oriented design suddenly achieved a higher level of legitimacy when, last month, the important US software company Microsoft announced its membership of the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry group founded to promote object-oriented standards. IBM is expected to follow and OMG can now boast all of the prime movers in software technology as its members. OMG was founded in 1989 by a group of companies who wanted to push the object-oriented approach into the limelight and supervise the creation of common standards. Membership has tripled in the last year and now numbers over 100. Although OMG is primarily a technical body, it will exert a crucial influence over the design of future computer systems. The concepts of object-oriented design reach into the heart of information technology systems and the OMG and its members will be responsible for laying the foundations of the new order. That IBM and Microsoft should suddenly make their interest public at this time is no surprise. The commercial exploitation of object-oriented design is just beginning, with bullish predictions for growth for tools which conform to the emerging standards. In a report sponsored by the OMG, Ovum, the UK researcher, forecasts a European market worth Dollars 196m this year, rising to Dollars 1.6bn by 1996. The US market is expected to be even larger with total product revenues of more than Dollars 2bn by 1996. Ovum's analysis is based on growth in three areas: languages and tools, developers' tools, databases and CASE tools. 'Object technology has emerged from the early days of religious fervour and is experiencing rapid acceptance,' says Ovum. Although it is a new way of looking at computer systems, object-oriented design has its roots in the past. The approach views computer systems as a set of objects, which can be directly related to objects in the real world. An invoice is an object; a manufactured product is an object and they are both represented as such within an object-oriented computer system. Object-oriented design evolved out of the same research at Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC) which produced the windows-icon-mouse-pointer interface popularised on the Apple Macintosh. Similar interfaces, such as Microsoft's Windows 3, are also available for IBM-compatible personal computers. The Apple Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows 3 are both described as object-oriented interfaces and, while this is true, the object-oriented technology goes much further than a better user interface. Object-oriented evangelists in the software industry talk of a paradigm shift in thinking about how computer systems can be built. Objet-oriented design includes several important ideas which help to clarify systems design and make better use of existing technology. The formal definition of object-oriented systems covers useful concepts such as inheritance and code re-use. Inheritance allows different objects to share the same characteristics. All invoices, for example must contain an invoice date - a characteristic which is inherited by every object called an invoice. The re-use of code is of more pragmatic use and can be seen in some personal computer software. A PC equipped with Microsoft Windows 3, for example, will use the same display-screen driver program (the software which sorts out text and graphics) in many different applications. Language developers are in the frontline in object-oriented technology with Microsoft and Borland both offering language compilers which are described as object-oriented. Database developments have been restricted to specialist suppliers such as Objectivity and Ontologic. But both Oracle and Ingres among others are reported to working on the technology and will deliver products later in the 1990s. Suppliers of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, especially those at the technical end of the market, have been at the forefront of the technology with US companies such as Interactive Data Environments (IDE) and Cadre Technologies leading the way. More important, the OMG is well on the way to formulating the first of the standards which will allow object-oriented systems to work across different computer systems. The OMG published its draft architectural specification last year and has requested tenders for the technology which will form the core of a method to control objects and the communications between them. Later this year it is expected to publish a formal definition of what an object is and this is likely to spur on the tool, language and database providers to produce object-oriented products. Object-oriented design promises to change computer systems design beyond recognition in the next decade. One of the advantages of the approach is that it opens the door to computing power - what was once called programming  -to a much wider audience. Although complex objects, such as invoice transactions, will still need professional expertise, less crucial processes can be engineered by users themselves. They will be able to combine their objects with those that already exist within a system and produce their own customised working environments.</p>

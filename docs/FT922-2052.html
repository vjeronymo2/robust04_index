			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Bullish trading TRADE IN the sterling futures and cash markets was bullish yesterday after the British chancellor made a strong commitment to European monetary convergence and the possibility that the pound would enter the narrow bands of the European Monetary System. The comments from Mr Norman Lamont gave a strong boost to sterling on the foreign exchanges, pushing the pound up by a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.9250. His remarks also boosted sterling futures. The September short sterling contract ended up 3 ticks at 90.26, and the December contract up 2 ticks at 90.55. Traders said Mr Lamont's speech reinforced the bullish mood created by two tabloid newspapers on Tuesday, both of which said that a near-term base rate cut could be signalled by the UK authorities. The longer dates in the sterling interbank market reflected that mood: everything from six-month sterling libor out to one-year finished down  1/16 at 9 7/8 per cent. The shorter dates were also softer, in spite of the large shortages forecast by the Bank of England this week. One-week sterling libor ended at 10 3/8 per cent, from a previous close of 10 1/2 per cent. Three-month money closed unchanged at 10 per cent, although in the morning it had been up at 10 1/16 per cent. The June short sterling contract expired at 89.94, coming into line with that rate. The Bank of England's operations were in the style of Monday and Tuesday. The shorter dated Bands 1 and 2 were bought at 9 7/8 per cent, Band 3 at 9 21/32 per cent and Band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn. It then purchased Pounds 18m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 7m of Band 4 bank bills, and Pounds 331m of bills for resale to the market at 9 15/16 per cent on July 6. Later, the Bank bought Pounds 18m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 18m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 121m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 2m of Band 4 bank bills, and Pounds 152m of bills for resale to the market on July 6 at 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 344m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 12m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 14m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 2m of Band 4 bank bills. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 380m.</p>

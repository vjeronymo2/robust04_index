			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Vladimir Novikov]    [Text] Murmansk May 23 TASS -- Great Britain and Russia  must closely cooperate in peace time, as during World War II,  British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd said on Monday. He  arrived on a three-day official visit to Russia on Sunday.    Sharing his impressions of his trip in the Kola peninsula,  the British diplomat noted that this region has great prospects.  They are linked with the development of the Murmansk port, vast  natural resources and talent of the people living here. Upon  return to Great Britain Hurd is expected to meet with  representatives of business circles and tell them about the  results of his journey. He stressed that it is necessary to pay  a special attention to humanitarian cooperation. Great Britain  plans to finance a blood cancer treatment project and to provide  necessary equipment to one of the Murmansk hospitals, the  British foreign minister pointed out.    Head of the British Foreign Office Douglas Hurd and Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev offered flowers at the memorial  in honour of British and U.S. navy personnel who were killed  while conducting sea convoys with allied aid to Murmansk. The  heads of foreign departments visited the navy museum. They had  conversation with commander of the Northern Sea Fleet Admiral  Oleg Yerofeyev on board the cruiser "Admiral Nakhimov". The day  before the talks Andrey Kozyrev had noted that as of today  Russian nuclear force rockets are no longer targeted at Great  Britain, similarly British missiles are also no longer aimed at  Russia. This symbolises new relations of trust between the two  countries, Kozyrev said.    Douglas Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev left by a special plane for  Moscow the same day. The British foreign minister will continue  discussing bilateral cooperation. In particular, he is to meet  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Then he will leave Moscow for Kiev. Replying to a question  about the aim of this visit to Kiev, the British diplomat said  that during his one-day visit to Ukraine he will meet with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Great Britain wants to  assist democratic reforms and Ukraine's movement towards the  market economy as well as to see Ukraine live in peace with its  neighbours, especially with Russia, Douglas Hurd added.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Bank to auction convertible bond The Bank of England plans to auction a short-dated UK government bond on May 25 that will be convertible into a long-dated gilt - the first time it has issued such a convertible stock since 1987. With a convertible gilt, investors have the option of converting the issue into a specified alternative stock on set dates and at specified terms of conversion. This gives investors the chance to participate in more than one area of the gilt market. The Bank will release details of the auction size and the maturity of the stocks on Tuesday. Gilt yields have risen steeply since the beginning of February as world bond markets took fright at the prospect of rising inflation in the US and the need to raise short-term US interest rates. The Bank has been reluctant to issue long-dated gilts during this period, stressing that yields are abnormally high given the UK inflation background. However, bond analysts said that until the precise details of the convertible gilt were announced, it was impossible to predict investor demand for the auction stock. Lex, Page 24</p>

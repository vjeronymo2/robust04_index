Solovyev; UDC </F> 629.7.05:519.2]    [Abstract] This article presents an aircraft navigation  method using reference points. The method makes it possible to  reduce the volume of cartographic information stored in on-board  memory. The method is based on analysis and comparison of the  mutual positions and distances between reference points in a  fragment of the field observed by sensors and a reference map.  This approach is similar to a person finding his location by  identifying known constellations whose position in the sky  depends on time and the location of the observer. The set of  observed reference points and the map are described by special  graphs, and the comparison procedure is formalized as finding  the maximally isomorphic subgraphs. Results of mathematical  modeling are described and the accuracy of the method is  evaluated. Figures 6; references 6 (Russian).</p>

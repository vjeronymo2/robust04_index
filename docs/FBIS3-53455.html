This was imparted by Palestinian  sources to Sa'id Ma'adi, a Qol Yisra'el in Arabic correspondent.    The sources noted that the PLO has further decided to  discontinue all talks dealing with civilian matters in a bid to  focus on security issues.    Our correspondent notes that last night the PLO leadership  held a debate on the results of the Taba negotiations. The  participants received a report from Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the chief  Palestinian delegate. The Taba talks are slated to resume  tomorrow.</p>

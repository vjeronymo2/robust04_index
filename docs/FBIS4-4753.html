			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's current account  surplus in February increased 0.1 percent from a year earlier to  11.94 billion dollars, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [5  April]. It was the third straight gain from year-earlier levels  after a drop in November.    The current account surplus, the net balance in the nation's  trade in goods and services and some unilateral transfers like  grant aid, was calculated before adjustment for seasonal  factors, the ministry said in a preliminary report.    The merchandise trade surplus rose 2.5 percent in February  from a year before to 12.93 billion dollars, the ministry said.    Exports increased 4.7 percent to 28.79 billion dollars,  while  imports grew 6.5 percent to 15.86 billion dollars.    The February current account figure followed January's  year-to-year gain of 30.9 percent.</p>

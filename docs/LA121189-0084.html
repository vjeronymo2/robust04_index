			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARCHING ORDERS ON AIDS  </P> <P> In an emergency letter to the White House, the National Commission on Acquired  Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has opened a campaign to persuade American  leaders "to match rhetoric with action" in containing the dreadful epidemic.  The report is a most timely nudge for President Bush to provide national  leadership on this critical problem.  </P> <P> "There is a dangerous, perhaps even growing, complacency in our country toward  an epidemic that many people want to believe is over," commissioners found.  "Far from over, the epidemic is reaching crisis proportions among the young,  the poor, women and many minority communities. In fact, the 1990s will be much  worse that the 1980s." Two urgent tasks for President Bush emerge from the  report: Creating a national plan for responding to the epidemic and moving  quickly to stem the alarming spread among intravenous drug users of the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> "There is no national plan for helping an already faltering health care system  deal with the impact of the HIV epidemic," according to the report. And the  search for solutions has been made no easier by the fact that the President's  National Drug Control Strategy virtually ignores the rapid spread of HIV  infection among intravenous drug users. Commissioners expressed understandable  "surprise and disappointment" regarding those omissions.  </P> <P> The report, while directed to President Bush, makes clear that an effective  campaign against AIDS will require the cooperation and work of leaders at all  levels of government and within the private sector. Furthermore, the report  realistically acknowledges that "the health care system itself requires urgent  attention." AIDS is not the cause of the unraveling of health services and, at  worst, will not itself take more than about 4% of health-care funding. But no  region is without problems as the epidemic spreads throughout the nation. Some  areas, notably New York City, already are so heavily impacted that the health-  care system itself is imperiled.  </P> <P> For us, there are two contrasting conclusions to be drawn from the report:  </P> <P>  -- The report underscores once again that there is a consensus among the  professionals about what needs to be done. Like the report prepared 18 months  ago by the Presidential Commission headed by Adm. James D. Watkins, this report  identifies key areas of action and the increased funding necessary if the  essential programs are to be implemented.  </P> <P>  -- But the report also reflects the inertia of too many leaders in  implementing these clear and urgent recommendations. That is particularly  evident regarding the call for mobilizing an adequate national drug  rehabilitation program, something the Watkins panel cited as essential even  before it wrote its final report in June of 1988. Education and on-demand drug  rehabilitation are the only known means to respond to this growing problem  which "imperils not only the drug users but also their sexual partners and  children."  </P> <P> No report was due from the commission until August, but members felt the need  for "extraordinary measures" required an earlier response from them, a quicker  mobilization of the nation. We agree. And we look now to President Bush, with  confidence encouraged by his past statements on the epidemic, for vigorous  leadership.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur: The Health Ministry has set up a new  unit to deal with the AIDS problem.    Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai said yesterday the  AIDS/STD  (sexually transmitted diseases) Control Division would be placed  under the Health Division of the ministry.    ``There will be seven medical officers manning the unit and  at least one (medical officer) in each state,'' Lee said after  presenting a RM100,000 cheque from the ministry to the Malaysian  Council of NGO's (non-government organisations) on AIDS.    ``Our aim is to make every level of society aware of the  disease,'' he said.    Lee said that based on worldwide trends, the number of AIDS  cases was expected to increase but Malaysia should not  contribute to the increase.    He said that there were already 179 confirmed HIV carriers  this year.    ``Out of 96 people suffering from the disease, 63 people  have  died up to January this year,'' said Lee, adding that the  number of HIV carriers now stood at 7,579.    When asked whether the government would stop importing drugs  from British-based firms, Lee said his ministry would abide by  the Cabinet net decision.    ``We will have to refer to our experts though on certain  drugs which may not be available elsewhere,'' he said.    He said that five or six companies with contracts worth  RM600  million would be affected.    Lee stressed however that the ongoing contract between Yeoh  Tiong Lay Construction and a Bristish company to build 12  nucleus hospitals would be honoured.</p>

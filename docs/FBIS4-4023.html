			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], April 28 (XINHUA) -- China and  Kazakhstan have issued similar press communiques on Chinese  Premier Li Peng's visit to this country, which ends today.    The communique says Li Peng's two rounds of talks with  President N.A.

Both sides are satisfied with the results of the talks and  pledged to develop bilateral relations in the spirit of good-  neighborliness and friendship and to cooperate in the  international arena, according to the communique.

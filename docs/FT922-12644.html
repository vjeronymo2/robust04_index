			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Record quarter for Bear Stearns WALL STREET securities house Bear Stearns yesterday reported record third-quarter profits of Dollars 91.3m, a near 60 per cent increase on earnings from the same quarter a year ago. The company also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents a share on outstanding common stock. The strong third quarter took earnings for the first nine months of Bear Stearns' fiscal year to Dollars 215.8m, which means profits are already running 50 per cent ahead of the Dollars 143m earned in the entire fiscal year 1990-1991. The factors behind the company's record quarter were the same as those that have powered Wall Street earnings since the middle of last year: strong demand for bond and equity underwriting services, high levels of individual investor activity in the US stock market, and favourable trading conditions across all financial markets in the wake of declining domestic interest rates. Bear Stearns' total revenues for the quarter were Dollars 531.3m, up 47 per cent from a year ago. A breakdown of the figures shows that revenues from principal trading rose 77 per cent to Dollars 310.8m, from investment banking they rose almost 50 per cent to Dollars 69.7m, while revenues from commission fees climbed to 7 cent to Dollars 104.6m. Total expenses in the quarter jumped sharply to Dollars 372.3m, but the bulk of the rise was accounted for by higher employee compensation and benefits, which are linked to profits and performance.</p>

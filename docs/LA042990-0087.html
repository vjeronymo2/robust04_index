			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S RACE  </P> <P> A community group in Fallbrook held a meeting with all the candidates for  sheriff a week ago, which was most enlightening. I would hope that more groups  do the same, because there doesn't appear to be much in the press about this  very important race.  </P> <P> One observation made was a statement by one of the candidates, a Mr. (Jack)  Drown. He said he has worked for no one else but the Sheriff's Department in  his entire adult life -- over 20 years providing us, the citizens of this  county, with the best law enforcement possible, claiming that no other  candidate matches his experience and skills.  </P> <P> Well, all I have to say is that, if the current state of the Sheriff's  Department is due to Mr. Drown's best efforts and vast experience and  leadership, I suggest he do us all a favor and step aside and allow change to  take place. It's apparent that he and Sheriff John Duffy haven't got it right  in 20 years. We can't afford another 20.  </P> <P> DAMON THORNBURG  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

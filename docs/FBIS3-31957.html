			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio </F> during a news conference upon his return from Honduras; at the  Guatemalan Air Force Base's Protocol Room in Guatemala City on  28 January -- recorded]    [Text] Honduras and Guatemala have to fight poverty and  corruption as one of the most serious problems faced by our  nations. We have to show honesty and political determination,  which, as I said before, will lead to closer relations between  both countries. President Reina and I held a brief working  meeting at the airport. I also held working meetings with the  president and the rest of the Central American presidents.  There is complete agreement on the principles of austerity,  honesty, and the fight against corruption. We need to give a  human and social image to our economic growth, which should have  a distribution with social equality. I believe there is a  complete identification with the new Honduran president.</p>

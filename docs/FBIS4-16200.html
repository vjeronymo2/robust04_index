			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Grave indications of  serious medical aftermaths, caused by the irradiation of human  beings, have appeared eight years after the Chernobyl disaster,"  ITAR-TASS was told today by staff members of the Medical  Radiology Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences.    As many as 517 people, afflicted by radiation, were found in  58 Russian cities, including Novgorod, Izhevsk, Elista, Kurgan,  Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Khabarovsk. But the Chernobyl zone of  contamination remains most threatening. It embraces 17 regions  of Russia with a total population of more than two millions.  Some children were found to be suffering form cancer of the  thyroid gland in those areas. In normal conditions there are  only a few cases of this ailment per million of children.  Today, the incidence of this terrible disease has increased  more than 20-fold in Gomel and Bryansk regions. Specialists  forecast a sharp growth of this disease in Kaluga, Tula, and  Oryol regions.    But Chernobyl is not the only danger zone in Russia. The  second vast area of contamination is the southern part of the  Urals. Several accidents there have contaminated with  strontium-90 radionuclides an area of 2,000 square kilometres,  inhabited by 300,000 people. 125,000 more people were  irradiated by discharges of radioactive wastes into local rivers.    The third territory is in the southern part of Siberia,  contaminated by the fallout of nuclear tests on the  Semipalatinsk testing ground, where 467 nuclear devices were  touched off in the course of fourteen years. Loyal to their  "internationalist duty", Soviet servicemen carried out nuclear  bomb tests only on days when the wind was blowing from China  towards Altay territory, Kemerovo, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk  regions. The population of those areas is now consuming  contaminated meat and milk. Due to the deteriorating economic  situation, people are beginning to fish and hunt intensively in  contaminated woods. They are also consuming wild mushrooms and  berries, picked in contaminated forests and meadows.    New methods of measuring the "average doses" of irradiation  were developed during the period that has elapsed since the  Chernobyl disaster. Measuring "average" doses in populated  localities is the same as measuring the "average temperature" of  patients in a hospital ward. Even in populated localities,  where the "average dose" is normal, there will always be people  with large doses of irradiation, making up the principal risk  group.    Millions of people have suffered through the fault of the  state. This is why the state must fulfil its commitment to lower  to the maximum the consequences of contamination. But the  Finance Ministry is now planning to sharply reduce or stop the  allocation of funds for the Chernobyl programme. This will  accelerate the already looming extinction of the nation's gene  pool.</p>

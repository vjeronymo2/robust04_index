			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Italy protests MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS in Italy this week have amply confirmed the public disrepute of Italy's entrenched party political system. The pro-autonomy Northern League protest party continued its recent spectacular success by capturing a third of the vote in Varese and Monza near Milan. But the growing appeal of this new party is also the corollary of the continued loss of public confidence in the traditional political parties. The depth of their discredit, which first became unmistakable in the fragmentation of the April general elections, has since been increased by the wave of political finance scandals, which have revealed the wholesale implication of the Christian Democrats and even more of the Socialists. That wave is still gathering momentum; last week parliament lifted the immunity of Mr Gianni De Michelis, the former foreign minister, and Mr Bettino Craxi, former prime minister, yesterday confirmed he is under investigation. In the medium term, the combined effects of the crackdown by the judges and rejection by the voters will seriously weaken the traditional party structures which have conspired to share the benefits of government and public office ever since the second world war. But in the short run, the paradoxical effect may be to strengthen the government of Mr Giuliano Amato, provided it presses ahead rapidly and boldly with reforms both of Italy's public finances and of its constitution. In his first eight months in office, Mr Amato has started well, with far-reaching measures to contain Italy's ballooning budget deficit, including cut-backs in public spending, restraints on public sector pay, and a sharp increase in the income tax effectively levied on the self-employed. This week he will call on parliament to endorse the necessary counterpart of these budget measures, with a programme for the privatisation of Italy's large state industrial sector. But a single austerity budget will not be enough; Italy will need to hack away at the deficit for several years to come if it is to bring its finances into reasonable order. In the longer run, political reforms will be just as important if Italy is to recover the chance of sound government. Vested interests in the party hierarchies are likely to resist all reform proposals which could seem to threaten their traditional fiefdoms. But the momentum for constitutional reform, exemplified by the pressure for a number of national referenda, should ensure that the parliament will itself put forward reform proposals early next year, including a reduction in the role of proportional representation and a strengthening of the independence of regional government. For the moment Mr Amato has the strength of a weak government which cannot be overthrown. But that strength will not last indefinitely.</p>

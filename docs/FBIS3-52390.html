They have martyred 13 more  Kashmiris in the Bandipura, Baliha, Punch and Keran areas. The  occupation forces also shot at a passenger bus at Keralahar near  Baramula, injuring 17 people. The Indian forces cordoned off 12  villages in the Uri sector and arrested several persons during a  house-to-house search. The freedom fighters hurled hand grenades  at the Indian troops in Srinagar, injuring two soldiers.    Meanwhile, protest demonstrations were held in several areas  of Srinagar yesterday against the killing of innocent people at  the hands of the Indian forces. The demonstrators raised  slogans against India and shops were closed in many areas.    Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan says Islamabad  remains committed to continuing the dialogue with India for a  peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and other problems.  However, in view of the fact that the brutal repression in  occupied Kashmir is at its height and human rights continue to  be violated, Pakistan will not schedule any talks with India at  the foreign secretary or any other level until there is a  visible improvement in the situation in occupied Kashmir.</p>

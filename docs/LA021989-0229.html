			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION WRESTLING;  </P> <P> FOUR COUNTY WRESTLERS WIN IN 2-A  </P> <P> Orange County proved itself something of a wrestling powerhouse at the Southern  Section 2-A championships at Nogales High School Saturday by placing three  schools in the top 10 and producing four individual champions.  </P> <P> Atascadero won the team championship before the final round started and  finished with 118 1/2 points. Laguna Hills was second with 91, Buena Park was  third with 88 1/2 and Mater Dei finished fifth with 78 1/2.  </P> <P> Heath Sims of Woodbridge, a state champion last year in the 132-pound division,  won the 138-pound division with a pin of Mater Dei's Troy Monge with 1 minute  45 seconds left in the second period.  </P> <P> "I had seen him wrestle before, but I never wrestled him," Sims said. "I  thought he would be a little stronger."  </P> <P> Sims seemed to wear down Monge, who had an attacking style but had difficulty  maintaining advantages against Sims.  </P> <P> Sims was stronger and has wrestled in the 145- and 154-pound divisions this  year.  </P> <P> Three other county wrestlers won their weight titles: Greg Andres of Sunny  Hills (105), Brian Bertrand of Buena Park (126) and Gabino Aguilar of Orange  (132).

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets on interest rate alert - Currencies Markets will be on an interest rate alert after a sharp wake-up call last week from the Swedish and Italian central banks. The combination of the Bundesbank council meeting again on Thursday, after a four week recess, the FOMC meeting tomorrow, and nervousness in European markets, makes for a potentially busy week. The balance of opinion in the market favours a tightening of policy from the Fed, while rate moves from the Bundesbank are also not ruled out, nor from other European countries following the Italian and Swedish examples. After a protracted spell of quiet, range-bound summer trading, Thursday and Friday last week were two of the busiest trading days for some time. Traders are expecting a continuation of more active trading conditions this week, though trade may be more muted today with most European markets closed for the Assumption Day holiday. The initial focus will be on the lira and Swedish krona, both of which were under speculative pressure last week as the market gave the thumbs-down to higher rates. Most other currencies were also wilting under the weight of the resurgent D-Mark - the beneficiary both of a flight to safety among concerned investors, and an economic recovery whose vigour continues to surprise investors. While analysts agree that raising rates in order to defend the currency is likely to be folly, they also stress that a repeat of 1992-93 ERM tensions is unlikely. Then the markets judged that governments lacked the will to impose high interest rates on economies mired in recession. Now that economic growth has re-appeared, raising rates is less problematic. The wider ERM bands also makes currencies less vulnerable to speculative attack. While many analysts still expect the Bundesbank to lower interest rates once more, it may choose to wait until it has seen the latest M3 figures, which are due for release at the end of the week. In favour of an early move, however, is that the Bundesbank will probably not want to adjust rates in the month preceding the federal elections in October. The firmness of the D-Mark also strengthens the central bank's hand. The odds of the Fed lifting interest rates would seem to be better. But with the D-Mark strong and President Clinton's political stature again in the spotlight, the risks for the dollar are probably on the downside, despite firmer rates.</p>

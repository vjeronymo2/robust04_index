			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent a letter to  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yeltsin writes:    It is with great concern and disquiet that we have followed  the developments surrounding Gorazde and Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  whole. We strongly condemn any activity which results in the  killing of the civilian population, Yeltsin writes in his letter  to Izetbegovic. Russia has been taking all possible steps to end  the bloodshed as soon as possible, to restrain the deadly  currents of the war, and to restore a situation that would help  in finding a political solution. To this end I sent the Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, to Belgrade. The activity of  our special envoy Vitaliy Churkin in Sarajevo and in Pale was  aimed at resolving the crisis. We insist on the Bosnian Serbs  complying fully with the UN conditions regarding Gorazde,  President Yeltsin says in his letter to Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE'S AFOOT AT BAREFOOT HOTELS OF ASIA  </P> <P> One wrong turn on a short walk from one tourist spot to another and we found  ourselves caught in a maze of back streets that seemed to double back on  themselves.  </P> <P> Sidewalks overflowed with street vendors selling shish kebabs, ginseng root,  live monkeys and silk sarongs. Medicine men squatted in doorways and read  fortunes in mummified horses' heads. The air vibrated with the scent of incense  and ginger.  </P> <P> We had found our way into the heart of Asia.  </P> <P> "Talk about the mysterious and exotic Orient. I didn't know places like this  still existed," my wife said.  </P> <P> "I wish our hotel was here," my son replied.  </P> <P> "Hello," called a female voice. "You want a room?"  </P> <P> My mouth had just opened for an automatic negative response when the voice  insisted, "Come, you have a look."  </P> <P> Before us stood a young Thai woman with an ingenue's smile. She ushered us into  a tiny restaurant that opened to the street like a sidewalk cafe. Westerners  and Thais sipped crushed fruit drinks at the tables.  </P> <P> We entered the restaurant and after walking through to the back found a  staircase surrounded, like a stage with an audience, by a half dozen pair of  shoes. Our hostess quickly slipped off her thongs.  </P> <P> "Barefoot hotel, in respect for the spirits of the house," she explained.  </P> <P> We padded upstairs in our bare feet to a small room with nothing but two large  beds, a chair, a sink and a fan. It was strictly pension-style, except for the  view.  </P> <P> The large windows overlooked a quilt of Oriental roof gardens bursting with  orchids and bougainvillea. The only sound was the song of caged murtabok birds  that hummed like wind playing in a cave.  </P> <P> "Eighty baht, if you like," our hostess said. "Shower next door. Only six  rooms. Very secure."  </P> <P> "Can we, Dad?," my son pleaded. "Eighty baht; that's only $3." I could see he  had already made eye contact with a shy but smiling 10-year-old Thai girl who  had been following our progress through the hotel from a distance.  </P> <P> "It would be like staying with a family," he added.  </P> <P> After a week of international-style hotels I had to admit I craved a break from  elevators, Muzak, air conditioning and the plate glass that separated us from  the countries we had flown so far to see.  </P> <P> Half an hour later a taxi carried us back with our luggage. Over a $1 lunch of  shrimp fried rice our Thai hostess and her younger sisters explained that we  had stumbled into the heart of the Banglamphu district where a grass-roots  accommodation industry was in bloom.  </P> <P> "We call these barefoot hotels 'guest houses,' " our hostess said. "Five years  ago there was only one little hotel here. Now Kao San Road has 35 guest houses  -- very popular with young travelers."  </P> <P> That was evident from a glance around. Against the backdrop of traditional  Oriental street scenes, backpack-toting youths strolled among the street  vendors and lounged at tables that spread in front of restaurants like the  tavernas of Mykonos.  </P> <P> Among themselves they chatted in German, Dutch, Swedish and English with an  Australian accent. Some spoke Thai while others used English as the lingua  franca with Asian friends. Life seemed to move in slow motion . . . even among  the children my son joined to play soccer in the street.  </P> <P> Beyond the restaurants and guest houses of Banglamphu we never saw Westerners;  the city absorbed them. Here, Bangkok opened to us like a blooming lotus.  </P> <P> Our hostess and her sisters showed us how to bargain for silk, jewelry,  Buddhist antiques. We learned where to catch inexpensive water taxis to escape  Bangkok's heat and traffic and visit city shrines by boat.  </P> <P> We gave alms to monks who queued up at our doorstep for a breakfast bowl of  rice. We found absolute peace in the cloisters of a Buddhist temple. But most  interesting of all was that we discovered how the Thais use their smiles to  wipe away the unpleasantness in life.  </P> <P> More practical travel information came our way, too. Acquaintances showed us  how the barefoot hotel network had spread through Thailand, Malaysia,  Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> The "Traveler's Survival Kits" published by the Lonely Planet guidebook service  provide good anecdotal advice about thousands of barefoot accommodations  ranging from dormitories and pensions to resort vacation homes and private  grass shacks on a tropical beach.  </P> <P> Generally, the lodging cost is less than $12 a night and often it is under $5  with a meal or two included. It has been likened, both in personal style and  economics, to a stay in Europe's bed-and-breakfast establishments.  </P> <P> With two more weeks to explore the Orient, my family and I embarked upon the  barefoot trail using the excellent Malay and Thai railway system to ferry us  between destinations.  </P> <P> It did not matter that we arrived without reserved accommodations in Hua Hin, a  Thai fishing village and resort.  </P> <P> As the train slowed for the station, three bicycle rickshaws raced alongside.  Their drivers screeched to a stop, dismounted and swung aboard the moving  train, laughing at their accomplishment.  </P> <P> "Good rooms! Good rooms!," they shouted, grabbing our bags. "Beach house. Very  cheap. OK?"  </P> <P> These were not your average touts, they were high-school boys whose jolliness  and energy put us at their mercy.  </P> <P> Five minutes later they rolled us up to a modern two-story resort home on a  quiet lane one block from restaurants and the South China Sea.  </P> <P> For $8 we had a living room, kitchen, bath of kingly proportions and two  balconies. With no landlord on the premises, it offered privacy almost unknown  in Asia, with a spectacular beach and a nearby outdoor market that turned  shopping into a carnival.  </P> <P> We might never have left Hua Hin except that Malaysia's Penang Island called to  us.  </P> <P> Once a crucial British colonial trading center, Penang's only city, Georgetown,  seems architecturally and temperamentally frozen in the days when Chinese  Tokays and turbaned Indians clogged the narrow streets and whispered promises  of ivory, emeralds and longevity potions.  </P> <P> The barefoot hotels stand at the center of the city where gold merchants,  antique traders and silk emporiums have streets to themselves. And unlike the  guest houses of Bangkok or the bungalows of Hua Hin, Penang's barefoot  accommodations are small hotels, most run by Chinese families.  </P> <P> Over the years these establishments have developed a reputation for housing  "short-time" girls, so once again we found rickshaw drivers useful in leading  us to a "barefoot" with family accommodations.  </P> <P> The Swiss Hotel on Chulia Street offered quiet rooms, laundry service,  breakfast for under $1, a serve-yourself beer locker, free newspapers and a  shaded patio that seemed a crossroads for Western travelers.  </P> <P> All this was within 50 yards of Indian parades, Chinese tiger dancers and a  Mardi Gras atmosphere of food stalls and revelers painting the streets of  Georgetown every night of the year.  </P> <P> But not all of Penang's barefoot hotels are caught in the endless throb of  Georgetown. Some, like the Southern Cliff, are on the edge of the quiet palm  forests north of town.  </P> <P> There we shared the upstairs of a beach-front restaurant with the owner Fu, his  wife and two boys. We caught our own fish, ate family style and played majong.  The boys gave each other English and Mandarin lessons while playing  hide-and-seek or flying paper airplanes out the windows.  </P> <P> Fu's youngest son had an expression for how our families related. "Learning  house together," he called it.  </P> <P> During the rest of our stay in Southeast Asia we also "learned house together"  with Tamil Indians in an urban bungalow and with Muslim Malays in a coastal  stilt village.  </P> <P> We learned the secrets of cooking with coconuts, curry and hot peppers. We  learned how patience and an exceptional sense of comic irony made life a joy in  a Muslim household with no fewer than three wives and 14 children.  </P> <P> And always, of course, we learned about friendship.  </P></p>

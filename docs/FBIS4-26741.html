			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>   [Text] Hohhot, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Cao Tiandian, director of  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said today  at the National Work Conference on the Management of Enterprise  Registration that the system of company registration would be  drastically adjusted in conjunction with the formal  implementation of the "Company Law of the People's Republic of  China" on 1 July.    With the enforcement of the "Company Law," the direction of  China's enterprise reform will shift from a mere granting of  more power to enterprises to that of a systematic change, or to  establishing a modern enterprise system. Straightening out  property rights relationships and defining the corporate  property rights of enterprises are at the center of this system.  The corporate system will be adopted as the major form of  promoting the system.    To achieve that end, the company registration system will  make a break with the former ownership registration system;  instead it will emphasize enterprise property. For instance,  registered capital (fund provider uses this to undertake  company's limited liability) will replace registered funds (no  stipulation on undertaking what kind of responsibility toward  the company) to reflect in a timely manner corporate property  rights. The new system will merge operational methods and  scopes into one and term them operational scope to realize the  granting of autonomous operation rights to enterprises.  Starting from the day of the implementation of the "Company  Law," and excluding stipulations provided for separately in the  state laws and administrative regulations, the fund provider  shall directly apply for registration with the administrative  organs for industry and commerce; thus scrapping the examination  and approval by competent administrative departments. Local  laws and provisions, administrative rules, and other documents  relating to trade and commerce management departments' special  examination and approval will cease to be the prerequisite  conditions for registration.    Cao Tiandian said the State Council will soon promulgate  "Regulations on Management of Enterprise Registration of the  People's Republic of China." The "regulations," he said, will  provide specific stipulations to the principles set down in the  "Company Law." He added that the pace of drafting a number of  documents to complement the "Company Law" has been accelerated.</p>

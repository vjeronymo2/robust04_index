			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Travel: The sound of legend - Adrian Gardiner is impressed by the natural wonders of the Western Isles Untamed for 3,000 miles, the Atlantic ocean crashes in through the mouth of Uiamh Binn, the musical cave. Foaming cascades surge over black prismatic columns of basalt. We cling to the rocks under 10,000 gleaming black polygons of the cavern roof. No one speaks. We frail humans are mesmerised by the awful power of raw nature, and gaze down at the relentless ebb and flow, silent witnesses to the geophysical copulation of sea and rock. In 1772 Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who sailed with Captain Cook, was on his way to Iceland. Storms forced him to seek shelter off the west coast of Scotland; once the weather had cleared, locals urged him to visit the musical cave. Thus was the tiny isle of Staffa put on the map. Subsequent illustrious visitors were equally impressed. 'It surpasses the finest cathedral,' wrote John Keats of Fingal's Cave, a 220-ft long cavern named after Finn McCoul, the legend also credited with the construction of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. Felix Mendelssohn, although suffering from toothache and seasickness, was enchanted: 'Like the interior of a gigantic organ for the winds and tumultuous waves to play on.' On the spot he scribbled 20 bars of music which became the theme of his Hebridean Overture. Six miles south, past the Treshnish Isles and the famous silhouette of the Dutchman's Cap, lies Iona. Columba and his 12 disciples arrived at the 'Cradle of Christianity' from Ireland in 563 AD and built a monastery. Vikings vandalised it over the next 400 years. In 1230 Benedictine monks built a new one, which was torched during the Reformation. The present abbey is mainly 16th century, with later additions. The oldest building on Iona is St Oran's Chapel. Columba received a message from heaven telling him a human sacrifice must be buried under the new chapel. His disciple Oran volunteered. Three days later (the story goes) Columba opened the grave for a last look at his friend. Oran was in fine form. 'There is no wonder in death,' he told Columba, 'and hell is not as it is reported.' Stunned by such sacrilege, Columba reburied Oran with the prayer: 'Earth, earth, fill the mouth of Oran that he may gossip no more.' Nearby, the chapel cemetery contains the graves of 48 Scottish kings, and several Irish and Norwegian ones. King Duncan lies here, murdered by Macbeth in 1040. Close by the abbey are Celtic high crosses richly decorated with carvings. Not even the most hardened atheist could be unimpressed by Iona. Summer tourists make little impact on the serene atmosphere. Quartzite rock sparkles in the sunlight, which turns the sea azure. Columba chose his site well. Staffa and Iona lie off the Ross of Mull, the south-west corner of the Isle of Mull. 'Oh Sir,' said Doctor Johnson, 'it is a most dolorous country.' No doubt it was in those days. The Highland clearances were in full swing: brutal acts of revenge prompted by the Hanoverian Georges against those Highlanders who had supported the Jacobite cause. Dolorous no; but Mull is frequently wet. Tobermory is the busy capital. Built 200 years ago, it never quite lived up to its founders' expectations as a major fishing port, but is a favourite yacht anchorage. Bounty hunters frequent the depths of Tobermory bay. In 1588 Donald Glas MacLean, a hostage aboard the galleon San Juan de Sicilia, set fire to the ship's magazine and went to the bottom with her. West of Tobermory are the white sands of Calgary, a hamlet after which emigrants named the Canadian city. At Dervaig, Mull Little Theatre, with 37 seats, is said to be the smallest in the world. The stage has room for just three actors; if the production requires more they have to be played as puppets. In the Mishnish, Quinish and Mornish areas of north Mull it is worth climbing to a viewpoint: Cruach Sleibhe, for example, an undemanding 600ft. On a clear day you can see to the west the islands of Coll and Tiree in the Atlantic; to the north, beyond Ardnamurchan Point, most westerly on the British mainland, the 'Small Isles': Rhum, Eigg, Canna and Muck. South of Calgary the island of Ulva borders Loch na Keal, the 'dark Loch Gyle' of Thomas Campbell's ballad, Lord Ullin's Daughter. The loch is the haunt of seals and harmless basking sharks. In the Western Isles things change slowly if at all - part of their attraction for cosmopolitan visitors - but last year a visitor centre and Clan Museum opened on Ulva. The tiny island boasts two minor celebrities: the father of explorer David Livingstone, and Major-General MacQuarrie, the founder of New South Wales. The Ulva ferry, a two-minute trip, must be the shortest in Britain. There are two venerable castles in the south-east of Mull. Duart Castle greets travellers on the Oban ferry, and has been guarding the entrance to the Sound of Mull for seven centuries. Torosay Castle has a famous Italian statue walk in its formal gardens and is linked to Craignure, the ferry terminal, by a narrow-gauge steam and diesel railway. Oban, three hours north of Glasgow by rail, four by road, is the gateway to Mull, Iona and Staffa; to Colonsay, Coll and Tiree. The town is a tourist centre in its own right and in July and August the population expands five-fold to 35,000, turning it into a lively resort. In Oban we meet another reference to Fingal. On the east side of Oban Bay is the Clach a'Choin, or Dog Stone, to which Fingal tethered his mastiff Bran. But Oban's most famous landmark is McCaig's Folly, an incomplete Colosseum lookalike. It was intended to be a lavish art gallery and museum but local banker John Stuart McCaig went bankrupt. As Robert Burns wrote: 'The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft a-gley.' For accommodation, contact the West Highlands and Islands Tourist Board, Albany Street, Oban PA34 4AR. Tel: 0631-63122. Ferry timetables from the head office of Caledonian MacBrayne, Ferry Terminal, Gourock PA19 1QP. Bookings: contact the Oban office. Tel: 0631-66688. A ferry (cars prohibited) runs from Fionnphort on Mull to Iona. To visit the Small Isles (round trip nine hours) depart from Mallaig near Fort William. Islay and Jura are best reached from Kennacraig, near Tarbert, halfway down the Mull of Kintyre. To Islay takes two hours, to Jura another five minutes. Calmac offers bargain tickets for those making several journeys. From Oban, Calmac runs a Three Isles Tour, May to September - an all-day trip by coach, ferries and motor launch, visiting Staffa, Mull and Iona, weather permitting. The cost is Pounds 21 adult, Pounds 11 child: very good value. The most luxurious way to see the Western Isles is aboard the converted ferry Hebridean Princess. Departures are from Oban and Kyle of Lochalsh, with prices starting at around Pounds 500 for a three-day cruise, inclusive of meals and excursions to castles, distilleries, etc. Contact Hebridean Island Cruises, Bank Newton, Skipton, North Yorkshire BD23 3NT.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "China Spurs Regional Aid For Ship </F> Inspections"]    [Text] China is stepping up efforts to ensure safer  shipping conditions in the Asia-Pacific region by cementing its  co-operation with surrounding nations on vessel inspections and  port control.    Zheng Guangdi, Vice-Minister of Communications, told the  opening of the first meeting of Asia-Pacific Port State Control  Committee that teamwork was critical to this success.    About 100 maritime authorities from 16 Asia-Pacific  countries  are in Beijing to collaborate on port control data exchange  systems and maritime surveyor training.    Last December these nations, along with Vietnam and Fiji who  are absent this time, signed the Tokyo Memorandum of  Understanding on Port State Control -- a regional treaty to  safeguard marine safety and prevent sea pollution in the region.    The deal unified inspection standards. If a ship clears  inspection after docking in a Chinese port, it will be granted  entry to the other 17 nations without repeating the same  procedures.    States are obligated under the agreement to check any  foreign  ship entering its port, along with on-board equipment and  seamen, to ensure they meet international criteria and domestic  laws.    Lin Yunai, head of China's Harbour Superintendency Bureau,  said the region faces uneven economic development which leads to  legions of substandard vessels sailing into their ports, some of  which have caused serious accidents.    In 1990 China launched its own port State control in 12 main  seaports. More than 200 Chinese officials have qualified for  overall safety checks on foreign ships, and a technical training  centre has been established in Dalian to foster more maritime  surveyors.    The number of foreign vessels inspected topped 2,000 last  year, and is expected to grow by 50 per cent annually. About 10  per cent of the examined foreign ships violated international  conventions, such as having obsolete on-board fire-fighting  devices. They were required to fix any problems discovered.  Depending on how severe the problem is, some ships may be  allowed to leave the port without making the repairs, but will  have to remedy the violations in a certain time period before  docking again in China. If the owner cannot fulfill the  requirements, the ship will be detained.    Some violators may face fines.</p>

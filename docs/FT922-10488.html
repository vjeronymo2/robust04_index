			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Ford returns to the black with earnings of Dollars 338m FORD Motor yesterday under-scored the gradual recovery under way in the US car market with its first profit since the third quarter of 1990. General Motors, the biggest US vehicle manufacturer, on Tuesday reported its first profit after six quarters of red ink. Both companies were hit hard last year by a slump in demand during the US recession, which led to heavy price discounting. They are now being helped by a modest pick-up in orders, resulting in lower rebates and sweeping cost-cutting programmes. Ford surprised analysts by also reporting a net profit of Dollars 84m from its European operations, compared with a loss of Dollars 129m in the same period of last year. Most surprising of all, the company made a small profit in the UK after record 1991 losses. The company said group earnings for the quarter totalled Dollars 338m, or 60 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 24.6bn, compared with a net loss of Dollars 884m, or Dollars 1.88, on sales of Dollars 21.34bn a year ago. Mr Harold Poling, chairman, warned that a continuation of the turnround would depend greatly on a sustained recovery in the US and other key markets. 'Although industry sales in the US remained weak in the first quarter, there are signs of an improving trend,' Mr Poling added. Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 57m, against a loss of Dollars 947m a year ago. However, the business was only put into the black by a Dollars 61m gain from the sale of a computer concern. Overseas, the group earned Dollars 28m, compared with a loss of Dollars 208m. The financial services group contributed Dollars 253m, down Dollars 18m, which the company attributed to one-off gains a year ago. Ford officials said reasons for the US improvement included a sharp reduction in heavily discounted sales to wholesale fleet buyers, which dropped from 37 per cent of vehicle sales to 29 per cent. Despite this, the company's share of the US car market rose one percentage point from the full-year 1991 level, to 21.1 per cent. Despite the improvement in Britain, Ford's Jaguar luxury car business lost 'a little' less than Dollars 100m, according to a company official, against a loss of 'a little more' than Dollars 100m a year ago.</p>

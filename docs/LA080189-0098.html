			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI POLICE CONTRACT RATIFIED  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council on Monday night ratified a four-year contract that  would raise the base salary of a police officer 7.5% in the first year, from  $26,472 to $28,457.  </P> <P> The new agreement, effective Aug. 14 through June 30, 1993, promises a salary  survey in its last year of 12 police departments, and pledges to pay Simi  police the average. It also agrees to a study by an independent consultant of  alternative work schedules, including a workweek of four 10-hour days that had  been demanded by the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. The police union  represents about 85 of the department's 100 officers.  </P> <P> The contract creates a new position of senior police officer, to be paid $200 a  month more than the base salary for a patrolman. A senior police officer would  rank between a starting officer and a sergeant.  </P> <P> The city and the union reached a settlement on the contract July 19 after an  almost three-week deadlock.  </P></p>

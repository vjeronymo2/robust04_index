			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Paribas rating maintained PARIBAS, one of France's leading investment banks, has emerged unscathed from a review by Moody's, the international credit rating agency, which has decided against downgrading the rating on its long-term debt after a six-month review. Moody's, which put Paribas under surveillance pending a possible downgrade in January, yesterday announced it had decided to maintain the bank's long-term rating at Aa2. The review coincided with a difficult period for Paribas which recently disclosed it had gone into the red for the first time in its history in 1991, with a net loss of FFr184m - due to a steep increase rise in provisions. Standard &amp; Poor's, another leading US credit rating agency, announced in April it was downgrading Paribas from AA to AA minus. However, Moody's decided against a downgrading because it believed 'the deterioration of its asset quality and profitability will be limited in time and will not threaten the bank's strong business franchise or its good financial fundamentals'.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Stern choice at the EBRD The row over who should take over the tiller of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development if poor old Jacques Attali is forced to walk the plank, is starting to get out of hand. Whatever one thinks of Attali's time at the helm - and don't forget that the first president of the EBRD's World Bank grand-daddy was booted out after only six months - he is a European, at least. True, the US is the biggest shareholder, but the Europeans have majority control. Just as the Americans like to have one of their own running the World Bank, it is hard to imagine the Europeans hiring a yank to head their bank. Of course, it would be a tremendous coup for the EBRD if it could recruit someone of the calibre of the World Bank's Ernie Stern. But why should German-born Stern, 59, want to move from being number two at the World Bank to being number two at a much smaller and less influential institution, unless he was pushed out? However, there is another Stern who has just found a safe berth in the EBRD. Professor Nicholas Stern, a 47-year-old development economist at the London School of Economics, has agreed to step into the chief economist's slot at the EBRD, following the sudden withdrawal of Michael Bruno, former head of Israel's central bank. The EBRD job had always looked a rather odd move for a politically well-connected sort like Bruno. Perhaps he does have his eye on the chief economist's job at the World Bank after all.</p>

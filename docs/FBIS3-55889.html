This was the assessment of the  State Duma's first day of work voiced by the executive secretary  of the Russia's Choice faction Sergey Yushenkov in his interview  with INTERFAX. In his opinion, one can already make a  conclusion that one of the largest factions in the new Russian  parliament, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (leader --  Vladimir Zhirinovsky), "has good organization and discipline and  acts exclusively in accordance with its leader's instructions."    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the bloc Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-  Lukin, believes that "the conflict in the State Duma will be a  permanent one under the present structure of the parliament."  At the same time, this will not affect the fate of economic  reforms in Russia, he said. During his conversation with our  INTERFAX correspondent he reminded that according to the  Constitution adopted in December, all issues related to economic  reforms had been handed over to the Russian president. "The  reforms' future is in Mr. Yeltsin's hands," he noted.    Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice bloc) believes that there  is a balance of political forces in the State Duma, there are  about 50 percent of democrats and 50 percent of conservatives in  it. He thinks that many radicals, including the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, came to the State Duma "with the aim  to participate at the presidential 1996 elections." The Duma  will be "a difficult and clamorous one but it will not abandon  the legal political activity, which the deputies have acquired  during the elections, another time," Burbulis is convinced. He  again categorically spoke against any opportunity to cooperate  with Zhirinovskiy and his party.    Leader of the communist party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov  estimates the beginning of the Duma's work as "a natural normal  process of getting accustomed under the new situation" given the  fact that "neither the chairman nor the deputies have  appropriate experience of parliamentary work." However, he  believes that the majority of the Duma's deputies demonstrate  "sound sense and do not resort to excessive polemics." He hopes  that today the deputies will manage to solve the issue on the  number of factions and not to lower it to less than 35 people.  Thanks to this, he said, we'll manage to gather leaders of  deputies associations on Tuesday evening and develop a draft of  joint proposals.    Mikhail Poltoranin (Russia's Choice) believes that the Duma  works nonconstructively. Under this situation, he said in his  conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent, "I would like to  rise and say: Dear Misters, according to available information,  there are still reserve tank shells in the Taman division,  that's why, let us work more constructively."</p>

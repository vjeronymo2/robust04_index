Mr. Galazov once again categorically turned down the proposal  of Vasiliy Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council  committee for federation affairs and regional policy, regarding  the introduction of a direct federal rule over the entire zone  of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict made upon the return of the  parliamentary delegation from the Caucasus.    North Ossetia assessed this proposal as interference in the  internal affairs of a sovereign state while, as Akhsarbek  Galazov said, it drew indignation not only from the republic's  leaders but also the entire Ossetian people.    So categoric a rejection of the parliamentary committee  head's proposal is quite explainable because once introduced,  federal rule would make it necessary to act on the Russian  president's 13 December edict on the return of Ingush refugees  to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon -- something vigorously  opposed, not without success, by the Ossetians, who first ask  the Ingush to repent, then demand a moral and political  assessment of the last year's armed conflict. Also natural is  the fact that Ingushetia leaders have supported the Russian  parliamentarians' proposal.    The North Ossetia president thinks that the interests of  both  sides should be considered in resolving such an acute conflict.  Forceful interference, even in the form of direct federal rule,  would only spark a protracted and bloody war between the Ingush  and the Ossetians. Mr. Galazov said yet one more time that the  republics would be able to settle the Ingushetia-Ossetia  conflict independently, gradually, and peacefully, and resolve  the refugee return problem.</p>

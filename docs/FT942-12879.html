			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Welcome for BAT deal The market had expected some move from BAT Industries but not necessarily in the US and not in cigarettes. Nevertheless, shares in the tobacco to insurance conglomerate leapt forward 23 on the news of its Dollars 1bn acquisition from American Brands. Some of the shine was removed with the release of US data prompting concerns of tighter interest rates. But BAT ended the day 12 1/2 up at 456 1/2 p with 9.4m shares traded. Analysts liked the deal, pointing out that BAT had boosted its share of the US market by paying less than 10 times American Tobacco's current year earnings. Mr Nyren Scott Malden of BZW, the company's broker said: 'It looks like a good deal. It is a business in which they have a relatively weak position and it strengthens that position.' He added that it would give BAT around 18 per cent of the US market compared with 11 per cent previously. Mr Chris Hitchings of UBS removed his sell recommendation and raised his 1995 forecast by Pounds 100m to Pounds 2.23bn. 'This deal is strategically sensible, it's cheap and it's not Groupe Victoire,' said Mr Hitchings referring to the persistent speculation that BAT had been preparing a bid for the French insurance company.</p>

Married with three small children. Earns: Over Pounds 30,000. Politics: Voted Conservative last time. Said yesterday: 'There isn't a lot of expenditure on new hospitals, new roads, new schools. This has got to be bad news from my point of view. The building industry is in a bad way. The change on housing benefit and private property seems very fair and logical but there are exceptions. There needs to be realistic flexibility.'</p>

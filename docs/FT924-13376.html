			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK shoots itself in the foot over wild birds THE UK's latest row with the European Commission over the shooting of wild birds has turned out to be not only a storm in a teacup - but one of Britain's own making. Senior Commission officials yesterday confirmed that the prohibition against farmers and sportsmen shooting birds such as crows and woodpigeons was inserted in the relevant 1979 directive at the insistence of member states, chief among them the UK. The Commission's original proposal 'specifically said pest birds could be shot', said Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC environment commissioner. 'It's unfair to accuse the Commission on something we didn't originally want,' he added. The dispute was seized on, particularly in the British media, as an example of the sort of meddling by Brussels which the member states will discuss how to stop at tomorrow's Birmingham summit of EC heads of government. On Monday, after prominent reports that the Commission was prosecuting the UK over the issue, Mr Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee that such isues were 'a matter for national governments acting in line with national traditions, national feelings'. The prosecution, launched after complaints from British wildlife organisations that the government was not enforcing the law, had in any case been dropped in June. Brussels shelved the case, Mr Van Miert said, because the Commission is preparing an amendment to the wild birds directive. This amendment would turn the directive back towards the original Brussels proposal allowing the shooting of pest species. 'The original reasoning is still valid,' he said, but the prosecutions went ahead 'because that is what the law said.' Mr Van Miert also revealed that the Commission is working up proposals for the decentralised implementation and monitoring of EC environment legislation. This would be a pragmatic response to the UK's proposal for an EC inspectorate to make sure all member states comply with EC law. This is a plan several member states regard as the sort of intrusion into national affairs Britain says it is trying to halt.</p>

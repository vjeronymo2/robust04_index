			<p>BFN     [Text] The police say a warrant to search the ANC  headquarters in Johannesburg was one of the options to obtain  information on Monday's [28 March] violence in the city center,  but it was decided that negotiations would be a better  alternative. Brigadier Zirk Gouws was reacting to renewed  criticism by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] that the search had  been canceled on the grounds that it could've been politically  detrimental. Brig. Gouws said the regional commissioner of  police on the Witwatersrand, Major General Koos Calitz, and Mr.  Nelson Mandela held talks before the planned search, and the ANC  leader had undertaken to cooperate fully with the police.  However, the warrant remained effective.</p>

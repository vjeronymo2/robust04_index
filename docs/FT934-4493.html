			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Observer: Oiled wheels of state Britain's royal family can sleep soundly again; the financial headache of how to pay for the restoration of the fire-ravaged Windsor Castle could soon be over, thanks to piles of the black stuff. No, not coal - oil. According to an article in the Oil and Gas Journal, the US oil industry's bible, Her Majesty could be sitting on top of one of Britain's biggest onshore oilfields. Desmond Oswald, boss of the little-known Canuk Exploration, has been poking around underneath the castle for the past four years. He believes that as many as 100m barrels of oil may be trapped in a reservoir which begins only 1,000 feet below the Castle. Little is known about Canuk, based in Gerrards Cross, but other oil industry sources say the idea is not as barmy as it sounds. Oswald expresses surprise that 'such a large structure should have remained undrilled in a country where extensive exploration has taken place'. Having done his homework, he is now seeking a competent operator to contribute financially to the drilling of an exploratory well. Of course, the royals may not be amused at the thought of nodding donkeys taking their place alongside the Household Cavalry. But times have changed. Prince Edward has set himself up in the film business and his mum opened Buckingham Palace to paying gogglers for a few weeks this summer. The possibility of a gusher under Windsor Castle should not be ignored just because it might keep the occupants awake at night.</p>

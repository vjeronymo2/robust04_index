			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Nervous end to roller-coaster ride: The uncertain future facing the railway supply industry AFTER A 120-year roller-coaster ride through the peaks and troughs of equipment contracting, Britain's railway supply industry is facing an uncertain future. Domestic orders are drying up, and the controversial privatisation of British Rail is looming - last week the government named seven sections of BR that could be in private sector hands by the end of next year. On top of that - and in spite of a likely go-ahead for the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express - there is continuing uncertainty over money-spinning 'mega-projects' such as London Underground's Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Line extension and the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link. The industry has reached a critical point. At stake are more than 60 companies with combined annual turnover of about Pounds 1.75bn, although the top 20 companies account for Pounds 1.2bn of the sales. Some of those companies are giants of the European engineering scene such as GEC Alsthom and Asea Brown Boveri. Yet all are feeling the effects of the current squeeze. 'If we don't get an order in the UK in the next six months, we'll not be here by the end of 1994,' says Mr Graham Bradburn, commercial director at Birmingham-based Hunslet Transportation Projects, a big producer of passenger rail vehicles. According to Mr David Gillan, director of the Railway Industry Association, the equipment suppliers' trade body, privatisation puts about half the industry's 30,000 jobs at risk immediately, and all of them in the long term. For every employee in rail contracting there is another in industries that are only partly dependent on rail business, supplying everything from seats and carpets to nuts and bolts. Yet, in a year when investment by British Rail has reached a record Pounds 1.6bn and London Underground spending is at comparatively high levels, are things really as bad as industry leaders say? Certainly, few rail equipment suppliers could have predicted their predicament three years ago. After many years of relatively low domestic demand, a considerable number of orders were placed in the late 1980s, with the promise of more to come. The industry responded by expanding and modernising its production facilities to enable it to meet projected demand. At least a third of this year's spending by BR is related to Channel tunnel business, but that is now declining. The combined effects of the recession, which has dented BR's revenues, and delays over the Channel tunnel rail link and other projects mean that some suppliers will face serious declines in orders by the end of the year. The increases in BR's external financing limit announced in the Autumn Statement will not benefit suppliers, says Mr Gillan. 'It's new money for BR but it will go to further subsidise loss-making services.' As a result, a number of large contractors could run out of work by the middle of next year, with smaller sub-contractors feeling the pinch even earlier. 'There is a mistaken belief in the minds of ministers that a short gap in production is sustainable,' says Mr Gillan. 'But shareholders don't allow production capacity to be kept open against the possibility of getting business.' Then comes privatisation. The very people who ought to be planning rail projects do not know where they are going to be in two years, says Mr Gillan. A break in ordering is therefore inevitable. Mr Bradburn at Austrian-owned Hunslet TPL says that any incoming private franchisee will not be buying rolling stock until it knows what its operating costs are, which could take two years. He doubts, too, whether franchisees will be keen to lease rolling stock unless they receive guarantees on issues such as residual values - the value of equipment at the end of a lease. The government is allowing BR to lease up to Pounds 150m of rolling stock in the next three years to create a leasing market in the run-up to privatisation. Perhaps the best hope for the industry is if the government ties the award of franchises to spending on rolling stock and infrastructure, a possibility that Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, has not ruled out. But the question remains whether suppliers can make it through the next two years and on to the mid 1990s and the next century, when some of the projects under discussion or delayed may at last take place.</p>

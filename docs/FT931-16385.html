			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Labour PR campaign gains backbench boost LABOUR campaigners for electoral reform will receive a boost today with the publication of a poll showing that two out of three of the party's MPs who first took their seats after last year's election back some form of proportional representation for the Commons. The findings, taken from soundings by New Statesman and Society magazine of 52 of the 69 new MPs, appear to counter the view that the tide within the parliamentary party is turning against change from the first-past-the-post system. The findings come on the eve of a two-day meeting in London of the party's committee on electoral systems, which is set to examine elections to the Commons for the first time. The committee, chaired by Lord Plant, is divided over the issue, which PR supporters are presenting as a litmus test of the party's readiness to take radical steps to modernise and reform. Last month Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader, came out for the first time in favour of electoral reform after years of avoiding taking a public stance on the question. Some leading shadow cabinet figures closely associated with the modernising faction in the party - including Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor - have appeared increasingly sceptical of PR. Mr John Smith, the leader, has refused to state his position. The Plant committee is expected to submit a policy recommendation on the issue to the national executive committee, possibly by March. But senior party officials have indicated that a definitive leadership position may be unlikely until after the local government elections in May. The poll shows that 34 of the 52 MPs back reform. Thirteen were against and five undecided. It is accompanied by a passionately argued article by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and a long-time advocate of PR, warning that reform is vital to Labour's bid to return to office. 'There is no long-term future for Labour as a party of government if it cannot re-establish local representation in the areas of fastest population growth in the south, and there is no serious prospect of doing so without PR,' he writes. While criticising the handling of the issue during the 1992 election campaign, Mr Cook points out that Labour won more votes in southern England than in its heartlands in northern England, Yorkshire and Scotland yet 'ended up with only three Labour MPs to show for it'. Meanwhile, opponents of PR claim that a majority of Labour MPs are opposed to change, particularly after the Liberal Democrats' failure to join them in voting against the government in the Maastricht treaty 'paving' debate in November. Mr Jeff Rooker MP, chairman of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, is planning to table a compromise proposal to the Plant committee aimed at introducing a modified version of the Additional Member System, used in Germany. Under Mr Rooker's scheme, some 500 seats would continue to be elected on the current basis, but 150 more would be allocated at regional level to 'best losers' from other parties under a formula weighted to reflect each party's overall electoral performance. Any final decision on electoral systems will have to be approved by the party conference in the autumn.</p>

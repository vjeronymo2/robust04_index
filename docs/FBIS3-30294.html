			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Natalia Ilieva] </F>   [Text] New York, January 31 (BTA) -- Bulgarian companies  have filed 5,184 applications for export of non-embargo goods to  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Sanctions Committee  since the entry into force of UN Security Council Resolution 820  of April 17, 1993, sources of Bulgaria's Permanent Mission to  the UN said. 3,623 applications were granted, 226 were blocked  or put aside for further consideration, and 1,336 are awaiting  replies. Export permission has been granted for goods worth  10,000 million U.S. dollars and 2,000 million German marks.    "This is the first case of its kind in the history of the  UN," Slavi Pashovski, Bulgarian ambassador to the UN, told BTA.  "It takes the Sanctions Committee three to four weeks to  consider the applications. The delay is due to the lack of a  special body dealing with them alone. In the summer Bulgarian  applications were blocked by Islamic member states of the  Security Council," he said. "Firms should file their  applications with the Ministry of Trade which sends them to the  Bulgarian mission in New York. We have had as many as 200  applications on some days lately."    "Currently the prevailing opinion at the UN is that no  special fund can be set up to compensate losses, like the one  set up after the Iraqi aggression, as no one can see any source  of proceeds to Yugoslavia." Ambassador Pashovski believes UN  resources of indirect compensation for Bulgaria's losses caused  by the Yugo-embargo have been tapped effectively. The Sanctions  Committee recognized Bulgaria's special economic problems  arising from sanctions enforcement and recommended to UN  specialized organisations, international financial institutions  and regional banks to adjust their programmes to Bulgaria's  needs. Their response so far shows their first step will be to  make independent studies and estimate Bulgaria's losses.,    Bulgaria's estimates of the damage caused by the embargo add  up to 3,500 million U.S. dollars. "Everything now depends on  the government's efforts and activity," Mr. Pashovski said.  "There is an idea that losses could at least be deducted from  Bulgaria's debt. This is one of the key issues at the  foreign-debt negotiations."    Mr. Pashovski said the delay in transit road haulage through  serbia on the part of Bulgaria was justified, provided it was  prompted by a desire for greater accuracy. He highly commended  the sanctions committee's decision to grant Bulgaria a transit  transport corridor, which was refused in the summer.    "The listing of Bulgarian companies in the registers of UN  suppliers is a new priority of the Bulgarian mission to the UN.  This is a multi-million-dollar business targeted mainly on  peacekeeping operations of the world organisation and many  companies will be informed about tenders for various supplies so  that they could participate. To become suppliers, however, the  companies will have to prove the advantages of their products  over other tenderers," Ambassador Pashovksi stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Several unions have held  simultaneous protest marches in major cities throughout the  country to pressure the Reina administration into honoring  promises made during the election campaign.    The protest march that has taken place in this city began  one  hour late, and participants included the National Trade Union  Federation of Honduran Workers (FESITRANH), Independent  Federation of Honduran Workers (FITH), and the United Federation  of Honduran Workers (FUTH).    In addition, San Pedro Municipality representatives such as  SITRAUNAH [Trade Union of National Autonomous University Workers  of Honduras], SITRAMEDYSH [Trade Union of Medical, Hospital and  Related, Workers], and SITRAIHSS [Workers Union of the Honduran  Social Security Institute] also participated in the event.    Peasant and teachers organizations such as the Peasant Women  Joint Development Committee (CODINCA) and COLSUMAH [Professional  Association for the Improvement of Teaching in Honduras], among  others, also participated in the demonstration.    During the march, the workers complained about the high cost  of living and demanded a general increase in salaries. They  also demanded the so-called moral revolution heralded by the  government result in in-depth agrarian reforms to the benefit of  the peasant sector, not only a minority as occurred during prior  administrations.    FESINTRAH President Mario Quintanilla has said this march  was  just the beginning of further actions the working class will  take to demand solutions to their grievances.    "President Reina has made specific promises on fundamental  issues such as voluntary military service and the education  system, and we are demanding the fulfillment of these promises,"  the union leader has said.    He has said workers feel ignored, because there are  inequalities between earned wages and the cost of the basic food  basket.    "We need positive answers from the government of the  Republic. We want a general salary increase," Quintanilla has  said.    He added the Liberal administration is obligated to provide  answers to this popular movement.    In this respect, he has urged all his fellow union members  to  strive for real price controls, "because this country's business  sector does whatever it wants with the prices of goods, and the  government says nothing."    In addition, Quintanilla mentioned the problems confronted  by  residents of the community of Lopez Arellano as the result of  the irregular manner in which the Social Housing Fund (Fosovi)  intends to collect delayed housing payments.</p>

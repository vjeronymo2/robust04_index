			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Qatar to increase steel production QATAR's state-owned steel company, just emerging from cumulative losses of Dollars 100m in the 1980s, is set to award a Dollars 275m (Pounds 182m) contract to nearly double capacity with the aim of exporting to Far Eastern markets. Qatar Steel Company (Qasco), which is 70 per cent owned by the Qatar government, said 25 foreign companies have submitted bids for the project and a decision is expected within weeks. Mr Nasser al-Mansouri, head of the company, was quoted in the United Arab Emirates newspaper al Khaleej as saying that building would begin before the end of this year. A new plant will be built under the expansion to raise capacity from the present 560,000 tonnes of reinforced steel bars by between 300,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes. The company's present plant, built in 1978 at a cost of Dollars 300m, has for several years been operating at around 70 per cent of its design capacity. Qatar plans to capitalise on its considerable resources of cheap gas from its north field operations. Mr al-Mansouri said Qasco will have to double its paid-up capital of Dollars 82m which, he said, would be welcomed by the company's present foreign partners. Two Japanese groups, Kobe Steel and Tokyo Boeki, hold 20 and 10 per cent of Qasco respectively. The company would not comment on how the recapitalisation and expansion would affect its shareholding structure. Qasco last year made sales of Dollars 192m and record profits of Dollars 40m, largely through sales to neighbouring Gulf countries, Algeria, Iran and Egypt. The group's recent profits have enabled it to clear deficits incurred during the mid-1980s and Mr al-Mansouri said the company expects to complete repayment by next year of loans taken to build Qasco's existing plant. The company is aiming to broaden its market , towards the potentially vast Iranian market and the Far East.</p>

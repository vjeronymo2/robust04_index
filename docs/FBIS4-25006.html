			<p>BFN     [Text] China last night jammed transmission into the  mainland of a controversial ATV documentary about the Tiananmen  Square massacre. Instead, Guangdong viewers who normally  receive Hong Kong TV, saw a concert by the pop star Sally Yeh.  ATV Home viewers said an episode of the Justice Pao series was  shown and then the graphics for the ATV documentary series News  Magazine came up. The screen then went black and the concert  started.    The documentary, mainly re-edited from old film taken by ATV  in Beijing five years ago, provoked a row in Hong Kong last week  when six of the station's senior staff quit after learning that  management was refusing to show it.    The programme's host, assistant news controller Selina Li  Yuk-lin, was one of those who resigned. She closed the show by  saying: "Thanks for watching and thanks for your support."</p>

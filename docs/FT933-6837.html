			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Svenska Handelsbanken posts strong recovery SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday announced plans to raise nearly SKr2.7bn (Dollars 531m) from shareholders after demonstrating a strong recovery in first-half operating profits and confidence in future prospects. The bank wants to be able to meet increased loan demand as the Nordic economies recover and to expand its network in the region further. It says a stronger balance sheet should also improve its credit rating. It is the fourth Nordic bank to announce plans for a big share issue in less than two weeks, following similar moves by its Swedish rival Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and the Finnish banking groups Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Unitas. All are taking advantage of higher share prices and a belief that the worst of the Nordic banking crisis is over to bolster their balance sheets and stave off a credit crunch when loan demand rises. Handelsbanken's one-for-two issue is being made at SKr35 per share, a deep discount on the SKr128 level at which the shares closed yesterday. The issue will lift the bank's capital adequacy ratio from 10.3 per cent to 12.3 per cent. First-half operating profit was SKr837m, against a SKr658m loss in the same 1992 period. However, the figure disappointed the market, and the shares fell SKr18, or more than 12 per cent, from SKr146. Operating profit before loan losses rose 34 per cent to SKr4.46bn, helped by a 10 per cent increase in net interest income. Credit losses remained high at SKr3.63bn, or 2.6 per cent of total lending, reflecting the long Swedish recession and the collapse in the property sector. Non-performing loans were slightly ahead of their year-end level at SKr15.8bn. The bank did not give a full-year forecast, but said it intended to resume paying dividends on its ordinary shares this year. The bank has taken advantage of its relative strength during the Nordic banking crisis to expand its operations outside Sweden. It now ranks as Norway's fifth-largest commercial bank, and has plans to build up operations in Denmark and Finland. It is also interested in buying parts of Gota Bank, which the Swedish government wants to return to the private sector.</p>

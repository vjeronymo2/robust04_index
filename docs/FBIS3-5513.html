The companies are suspected of illegally conspiring to  repeatedly fix bidding prices for municipal and prefectural  public works projects.    The prefectural association's branch office in Utsunomiya,  north of Tokyo, which lists 146 engineering works companies, was  subjected to the compulsory search.    The searches were the first by the FTC since it investigated  a contractors' association in Yamanashi Prefecture last May.</p>

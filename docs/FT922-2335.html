			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Probe on Daily News cash INVESTIGATORS on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to discover whether any Maxwell group pension funds were among the more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 107.7m) transferred last year from Maxwell private and public companies to the Daily News, Robert Maxwell's New York newspaper. The inquiry is related to claims filed in New York bankruptcy court seeking the recovery of a total of Dollars 210.4m of funds allegedly transferred to Daily News accounts at the Chase Manhattan bank. The Daily News has denied any wrongdoing and Mr Marc Kirschner, a lawyer for the newspaper, yesterday called the newspaper 'an innocent pawn in this thing'. Conversations with two executives involved in some of the fund transfers suggest an atmosphere of confusion and mystery in New York about both the sources and destination of the money just two weeks before Maxwell's death on November 5 last year. The executives told the FT that. during a visit by Maxwell to New York in October 1991, at least Dollars 86m of money arrived at the Daily News accounts from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in London and was ordered by Maxwell to be sent on to a number of US and foreign banks. Court records show that the Dollars 86m came from an MGN loan from the London office of Bankers Trust, the US bank. Court documents also show that the Dollars 210.4m of claims filed against the Daily News include: A claim by MGN for Dollars 90.5m, consisting of the Dollars 86m loan plus interest, and a further claim for Dollars 24.2m of funds that may have come from MGN. A third claim, of Dollars 1.7m, relates to a transfer made by MGN's Racing Times subsidiary in the US to the Daily News. Four separate claims made by Arthur Andersen, the administrators of Maxwell private companies, totalling Dollars 94m. The largest are a Dollars 64.2m claim on behalf of Robert Maxwell Group PLC and a Dollars 29.8m claim on behalf of London and Bishopsgate Group Limited. Mr George White, a former managing director of Sporting Life who was president of MGN's Racing Times in the US between April 1991 and February 1992, was disturbed because 'the money was coming from weird places'. Mr White added: 'I raised the question in London as to why we at Racing Times weren't getting our money directly from the Mirror Group. I was told not to ask, that it was anybody's guess.' He said that Mr Maxwell personally co-ordinated a number of fund transfers, often asking newcomers to execute his wishes. 'They hadn't become aware of his tricks. It all fitted in with the old man's strategy of keeping people in the dark.'</p>

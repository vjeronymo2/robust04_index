			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT RULING ON CIVIL RIGHTS  </P> <P> The recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court against affirmative action must  be judged within the context of the times. The United States is no longer an  ascending world power, confident of its ability to solve all problems. To the  contrary, having reached middle age, it seeks to define its goals and  priorities in accordance to its declining strength in the world stage.  </P> <P> As this country faces increasing challenges to its homogeneity from societies  as dynamic and pugnacious as Japan, it finds itself forced to maximize its  available resources within a more limited framework of utilization. Since white  males have been the traditional beneficiaries of the nation's mechanisms of  economic and political power distribution, it should come as no surprise that  the attempt is now being made to protect their historical turf.  </P> <P> In addition, it is also important to recognize that, having always had access  to the infrastructure of old boy networks as well as to relatively good  schools, this group may well indeed be better "qualified" than the minorities  and women who are now competing with them for the few good jobs available.  </P> <P> What bothers me the most about present attitudes are not that affirmative  action is being done away with (actually, there was never any affirmative  action, but simply the attempt to give the appearance of such by putting a few  blacks and Latinos in positions where they could exercise power over their own  kind: policemen, social workers, teachers, etc.), but that there seems to exist  a desire of large segments of the public to forget and even negate the effects  of racism in its present and past modalities.  </P> <P> How did it come to this? I suspect that the loss of the nation's sensitivity to  racial issues coincides with the aging of the "baby boom" generation and the  disillusionment of many of the radicals of the 1960s with the Third World and  minorities in general.  </P> <P> Disillusionment with Third World corruption was soon transferred to  disenchantment with minorities in this country.  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan came into the national stage just at the right historical time to  deal with these issues. He convinced much of the country that there is very  little wrong with America, and that a great deal is wrong with those who are  not Americans or who at least retain ties, no matter how tenuous, to lands less  innocent and pure than America.  </P> <P> Foreigners and minorities thus came to be seen no longer as the victims but  rather as the victimizers of a pure and innocent America.  </P> <P> RAMON OCEGUERA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

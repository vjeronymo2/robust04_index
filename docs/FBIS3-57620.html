The United States is planning to introduce Patriot missiles  into the ROK under the fabricated pretext [nalchodoen kusillo]  that the DPRK has missile attack capability.    According to AFP reports from Seoul, ROK political circles  are concerned about the possibility that nuclear talks with  Pyongyang will go amiss [patan] due to the deployment of those  missiles.    Beijing has officially opposed the attempt to deploy  missiles. A spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry stated that  the PRC opposes any action [imuiui haengdong] detrimental to  peace and security of the Korean peninsula.</p>

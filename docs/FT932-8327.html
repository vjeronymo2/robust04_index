			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: VIAG chief in pay-out pledge MID-YEAR profits of VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, are likely to fall below comparable figures a year earlier, Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman, told the annual meeting. However, he added that its annual dividend would remain unchanged at DM9 a share. Net profits for 1992 fell by 9 per cent to DM366m (Dollars 227m) on sales 3 per cent up at DM24.3bn. He attributed the rise in turnover largely to the first time inclusion of sales from VIAG's one-third stake in the Kuhne &amp; Nagel shipping and freight concern. Mr Pfeiffer said that Viag had an interest in buying a majority stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel but this depended on Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne, who owns the rest of the company. Profits for VIAG's aluminium division suffered the most severe setback, falling to DM78m, down from DM120m the previous year. Mr Rainer Grohe, a VIAG director, said it had cut production of aluminium products in Germany by 25 per cent.</p>

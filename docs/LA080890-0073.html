			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY'S JOBLESS NEARLY DOUBLE IN JULY  </P> <P> East German unemployment nearly doubled in July to 272,000 people, underscoring  the need for unification with West Germany to rescue the former Communist  country's crumbling economy, labor officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Labor Office said that unemployment soared 90% last month to 272,000, with  another 847,000 people working or registered for "short time," a state-funded  limbo between joblessness and welfare.  </P> <P> Labor officials tried to play down the gravity of Tuesday's data, saying it was  wrong to assume that all workers registered for short time were in fact  unemployed.  </P> <P> "My rough estimate, made from spot checks with firms, is that only half are not  working at all," said Horst Kinitz, state secretary in the Labor Ministry. He  also said that more than 6,000 companies were on short time, affecting  agriculture, textiles and electronics firms.  </P> <P> Economic union between the two Germanys July 1 was supposed to open East  Germany to Western investment, providing more jobs for the 8.4-million work  force.  </P> <P> East Germany's unemployment rate in July was still just 3.1%, well below the 7%  in West Germany.  </P></p>

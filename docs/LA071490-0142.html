			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BASTILLE DAY: TIME TO STORM THOSE FRENCH EATERIES;  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS: CAN-CAN, MUSIC AND THAT WORLD-FAMOUS CUISINE WILL BE FEATURED  TODAY THROUGHOUT ORANGE COUNTY AS THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY, FRATERNITY AND  GASTRONOMY OVERTAKE THE POPULACE.  </P> <P> Special menus, accordions, can-can dancers -- you can count on French  restaurateurs to pull out all the stops for Bastille Day today. Here are a few  options for your celebration of the 1789 attack and capture of the French  prison fortress.  </P> <P> Bastille Day commemorates the triumph of the populace, the bourgeois, according  to Marica Hefti of Le Medi in Newport Beach. So she and her chef-husband Walter  Ruttiman will serve from big pots of moules mariniere, the traditional mussels  dish, on the restaurant's patio at bourgeois prices -- from $1.75. Also  available outdoors: seafood salad and strawberries with black pepper. Inside,  diners can sit down to a dinner of duck Bigarade (with orange), French onion  soup and chocolate mousse, all for $14.95. The same menu will be served at  lunchtime, from 11:30 to 3 p.m.; and dinner, from 6 until "whatever," according  to Marica. Reservations: (714) 675-4904.  </P> <P> Can-can dancers liven the festivities at several restaurants, including La Vie  en Rose in Brea, which will also present a magician. A special multi-course  dinner, priced at $50, will be served from 6 to 10 p.m. Reservations: (714)  529-8333.  </P> <P> The celebration began Friday at the Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach with a French  fashion show. Tonight's the night for the can-can dancers, an accordionist,  door prize drawings and the opening of a methuselum (that's eight bottles'  worth) of champagne.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Argentina sees sharp decline in inflation MR Roque Fernandez, president of Argentina's central bank, has predicted that 'as from May, inflation will be zero or close to zero'. Less optimistic officials say they expect inflation to fall gradually to about 10 per cent a year. Unofficial forecasts indicate April's rate may range between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. Prices rose by 11 per cent in March, less than half February's rate of 27 per cent. Argentina introduced its toughest adjustment policy yet on April 1, when it implemented legislation forbidding the central bank from printing money to cover the government's spending deficit and made the currency convertible. Mr Fernandez also said the government hoped to reach agreement with the IMF this month opening the way for a standby loan of about Dollars 1bn.</p>

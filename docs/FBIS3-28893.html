General Secretary of the People's Unity Party of Tunisia  Mohamed Bel Hadj Amor said when he received the Korean  ambassador to his country on February 4 that he fully supported  the proposal of achieving the reunification of Korea through a  confederacy according to the three principles of national  reunification advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    He expressed full support and solidarity for the January 31  statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman, saying it is a  very important and just step for defending the sovereignty of  Korea and the interests of the third world countries.    He denounced the United States for increasing the tensions  on  the Korean peninsula and stressed that the Korean people's  struggle which enjoys support of the world people would surely  be crowned with victory.    Betty Frydensbjerg Carlsson, chairperson of the Communist  Party of Denmark, met with the Korean ambassador to her country  on February 4 and said the United States is leading the  situation to the brink of war in crude violation of the points  agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States, but it  cannot subdue the Korean people who are fighting for their cause  of justice.    The Communist Party of Denmark fully supports the Korean  people in their struggle in defence of sovereignty and  socialism, she said.    She added that the January 31 statement of the DPRK Foreign  Ministry spokesman regarding the prevailing situation was an  extremely just step.</p>

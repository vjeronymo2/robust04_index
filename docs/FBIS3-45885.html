Hong Kong-based human rights lobbyist John Kamm, speaking in  Beijing yesterday, said mainland officials had confirmed their  intention of freeing at least three prominent dissidents before  Lunar New Year.    "I have received confirmation from the Public Security  Bureau  and another ministry that three prominent dissidents will be  released in approximately 10 days," Mr Kamm said.    The authorities had declined to name the detainees involved,  saying only that the legal process was underway and that the  families would be informed in due course.    "It's possible that the Chinese are holding back on the  names  so that they can be announced in Paris," he said, referring to  tomorrw's talks in the French capital between Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    There has been widespread speculation that Wang, a leading  figure in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, might be released.  However, his relatives said yesterday they had received no  notification from the authorities.    Wang, regarded by Beijing as a key organiser or "black hand"  behind the demonstration in 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in  jail in 1992.    Other leading candidates to go free could include  41-year-old  "black hand" Chen Ziming, also sentenced to 13 years  imprisonment in 1992, and Bao Tong, the 59-year-old former  right-hand man of disgraced Communist Party General Secretary  Zhao Ziyang.    Bao was jailed for seven years in 1992 for "inciting  counter-  revolutionary activities" and "divulging state secrets" in the  run- up to the Tiananment crackdown.    According to Mr Kamm, the authorities said they had also  completed a preliminary response to a list of 235 political  prisoners submitted by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for  Human Rights John Shattuck.    Of the 235 names, the authorities said they had been unable  to locate 100, while confirming that 40 others had been  sentenced and were currently in jail, Mr Kamm said.    About 30 more had been released, while another 30 were under  investigation.    While Beijing has in the past chosen to release prisoners  around Lunar New Year, which falls on February 10 this year, any  announcement over the next week could have important  repercussions for U.S. renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation  (MFN) trading status.    Washington has made renewal of MFN status conditional on  significant progress in human rights issues, and the issue will  be the focus of the Qian-Christopher talks in Paris.</p>

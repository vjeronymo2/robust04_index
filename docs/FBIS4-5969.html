			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BY Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 17 (AFP) -- Cambodian MPs are  seeking to formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group and  to evict them from premises they maintain in the country's  capital, a senior government official said Sunday.    Members of the Cambodia People's Party (CPP), also known as  the Phnom Penh party, part of the country's three-party  coalition government, are planning to table a motion backing the  action when parliament reconvenes in the next two weeks, the  official said.    The parliamentarians need the support of their coalition  partners in the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], to  get the two-thirds majority necessary to carry the motion in the  120 strong national assembly, the government official said.    It is not known how many MPs support the move.    Co-Premier Hun Sen -- a CPP leader -- who was due to visit  Bangkok to discuss "border problems" following allegations that  the Khmer Rouge had attacked government forces from positions in  Thai territory, decided to postpone the visit until after  parliament had voted on the motion, the official said.    The move to outlaw the guerrillas comes after the Khmer  Rouge  refused co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Prince Norodom  Ranariddh's offer of a ceasefire for the April 13-15 Khmer New  Year celebrations.    Hun Sen has said the ceasefire offer was a sign of the  government's willingness to negotiate with the rebels.    But the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge, which has shown no sign of  compromise, appears to have exhausted the patience of both the  government and King Sihanouk.    The guerrillas recent kidnapping of an Australian and two  Britons further exacerbated matters, the official said.    Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng told AFP that the king  advocated the move by the national assembly "to isolate the  Khmer Rouge as rebels."    "We have kept the door open but the Khmer Rouge never joined  the reconciliation process," Sar Kheng said, adding: "Now we  should not talk anymore about keeping the door open."    Government officials said King Sihanouk was "disappointed"  that the Khmer Rouge did not follow through with his recent  peace proposal for the rebels.    Under the plan, certain "acceptable" members of the radical  faction would be given senior cabinet posts in exchange for the  Khmer Rouge ceasing all guerrilla activity, opening up their  zones and merging their fighters with the national armed forces.    In a recent interview with the Phnom Penh Post, the king  described the government's offensive against Pailin and its  March 19 seizure of the Khmer Rouge's stronghold, as  "legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable."    The Khmer Rouge office and residence facing closure under  the  MP's motion was set up here following the 1991 signing of  Cambodia's UN-brokered peace plan, which lead to elections last  May.    The Khmer Rouge, however, boycotted the polls, which saw the  former resistance allies in the FUNCINPEC party, and the  Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, form a coalition government  with the radical faction's arch foe, the Phnom Penh party.    Despite continuing a guerrilla campaign in the countryside  against the new government, the Khmer Rouge were allowed to  maintain representatives in the capital.    This anomalous situation stemmed from King Norodom  Sihanouk's  hopes for a national reconciliation plan which would include the  Khmer Rouge, and from the government's subsequent policy of  "keeping the door open" for the guerrillas.    Prior to postponing his trip to Bangkok, Hun Sen said this  was one of the major issues on the agenda for his talks with the  Thais.    "Some Thai officials said the Khmer Rouge are not yet  illegal  because they have representatives in Phnom Penh," he said.    "I want to say officially that no other people or party  except the Royal Government is legitimate, and that the Khmer  Rouge office in Phnom Penh is the internal policy of the Khmer  Nation," Hun Sen said.</p>

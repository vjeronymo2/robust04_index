			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Travel: A sackful of myths - Practical Traveller / South America is no longer a land of generals and jungles For those who think of Latin America in terms of generals, jungles and sackfuls of worthless currency, it may be time to overhaul some myths. Things have changed. South America's soldiers have long since goose-stepped back to barracks, their power usurped by squadrons of technocrats and battalions of economic miracle-makers. Hyper-inflation has largely been replaced by hypermarkets and stockmarket hyper-activity. As for jungles, you should be so lucky. Visitors to this new South America have been relatively thin on the ground. You can still find yourself virtually alone amid the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru, the solitary visitor to a Patagonian penguin colony in Chile, or the only foreigner in a Paraguayan bar with no hands-on experience of a Luftwaffe bombing raid. South America is extraordinarily varied, economically, politically and culturally. From afar it may be hard to distinguish Uruguay from Paraguay, but close up they have about as much in common as France and Albania. If the South America of your dreams is a tempestuous land of cultural exotica and rampant foliage, then steer clear of Argentina and Uruguay, the most temperate and European of states. South Americans holiday in Buenos Aires because it is just like Paris but far closer to home. Uruguay has such a sophisticated European-style welfare state that everyone there is either still studying or on the point of retirement. These countries will offer you art, theatre, style and a coffee-house atmosphere. Chile and Argentina may merge into one on the map, but historically their peoples have been arch rivals. Chileans consider Argentines arrogant, rich and lazy while Argentines view their trans-Andean neighbours as provincial and rather dull. What they have in common is the dazzling lake district and the forlorn beauty of Patagonia, both of which straddle their southern border. Northwards your chances of a culture shock or an electric shock (wiring can be hazardous) are greatly enhanced. But even in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, many of the big cities can be disappointingly western. Sao Paulo is a lot like New York, just bigger. Outside the urban centres, though, things become more like you might expect. Ponchos, llamas, parrots, ruins, deadly snakes and deadly-long bus journeys all await. Few are likely to be disappointed by the Galapagos islands in Ecuador, the astonishing Inca cities of Peru or Venezuela's Angel falls, the highest in the world. Less well-known are the Jesuit ruins of Paraguay, the desolately beautiful northern beaches of Peru, or the gold-encrusted churches of Quito. Depending on where you go, prices range from the give-away (Ecuador, Peru) to the give-me-back-my-arm-and-leg (Argentina). Because the Argentine peso is fixed to the dollar, the portenos of Buenos Aires are no strangers to the Dollars 50 cab fair or even the Dollars 5 cup of coffee. Trips to restricted areas, such as the Galapagos islands, also tend to be expensive. Air fares between South American states (and in some cases within countries) are normally expensive. If you are keen to jet-set between countries, it is usually much cheaper to buy a package of flights before you set off. In London, Journey Latin America (tel: 081-747 3108) specialises in this. Some South American airlines are not in the best of economic health, so it might be advisable to take out insurance in case your carrier folds. There are direct flights to some of the bigger cities (Sao Paulo, Rio, Buenos Aires, Caracas and Santiago) from many European capitals, with connections to smaller destinations. You can fly almost anywhere on the continent from Miami. On safety, most Latin American cities present the same kinds of risks that one associates with big cities almost anywhere. Buenos Aires and Santiago are relatively crime-free, while Rio and some Colombian cities have less enviable reputations. Dangers generally become more pronounced the greater the economic gulf between those sipping champagne and those rummaging through rubbish bins, though this is not a hard and fast rule. Visitors concerned that they may face the anti-gringo sentiments historically associated with South America should take comfort from the fact that much has changed in this respect, too. Distrust of outsiders has been tempered by a desire among many to emulate a western lifestyle. To graffiti in Santiago proclaiming 'Gringo go home', someone recently added: 'And take me with you.' The South American Handbook, which is updated annually, is virtually indispensable for travellers to this part of the world. From Trade and Travel Publications.</p>

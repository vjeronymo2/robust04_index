			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Papuan leader faces challenge Sir Julius Chan, Papua New Guinea's deputy prime minister, said yesterday that he was joining forces with opposition politicians in a challenge to Mr Paias Wingti's grip on the prime minister's job, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. PNG's notoriously volatile political scene erupted after last week's ruling by the Supreme Court that an overnight resignation and re-election maneouvre by Mr Wingti last year was invalid, and that he had not been legitimately reinstalled in the prime minister's post. Parliament, therefore, is required to vote for a new prime minister today. Mr Wingti has played down the furore, saying he expects his governing coalition to re-elect him. But alliances shift fast in PNG, and the outcome looks highly unpredictable after Sir Julius' defection.</p>

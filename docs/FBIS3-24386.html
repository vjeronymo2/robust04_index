			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Peshkov: "Will the Election Date Be </F> Moved?"]    [Text] St. Petersburg City Court continues the  hearings directly related to the City Assembly elections set for  20 March.    Yesterday hearings were held on the complaints of  independent  candidates for deputies, who had been refused registration by  the district electoral commission on the grounds of invalidation  of some of the signatures collected.    Dina Shulgina, chairman of a consumer rights protection  society in Kalininskiy Rayon, collected the number of signatures  required for registration--more than 2,000, but a small number  of the signatures were collected outside the boundaries of the  electoral district where she was going to run. The reason was  that one of Petersburg newspapers printed some incorrect  information on the addresses of buildings included in her  district. The number of "outside" votes was not great, but the  district commission refused to register D. Shulgina, and the  city commission upheld the decision. The city court, in turn,  dismissed D. Shulgina's complaint about the elections  commissions' actions. Despite the fact that the elections are to  be held in just a few days, the rejected candidate for deputy  intends to continue her court battle for validation of her  candidacy. D. Shulgina's appeal will be sent by mail to the  Supreme Court of Russia. It is obvious that it will not be  considered in time for the elections.    A similar complaint was filed by Vladimir Radushnov,  president of Tais-Sport--a St. Petersburg joint-stock company.  As the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon district commission established, some  of those who signed for Vladimir Radushnov also signed for his  competitor in the same district. All these "duplicate"  signatures were invalidated. As a result, Vladimir Radushnov  came up several hundred votes short of qualifying as a  candidate. Nobody questioned the citizens as to whom in fact  they support. As experience shows, questionable issues in  matters of signature collection are not interpreted in favor of  the candidates.    It is interesting that court hearings are taking place just  a  few days before the elections. The mayor's decision, which  excluded some citizens from participating in the elections, was  recently challenged by Federation Council Deputy Aleksandr  Belyayev, who won the case. His complaint was found valid, and  A. Sobchak's decision illegal. As we learned, A. Sobchak has  appealed the city court ruling at the Supreme Court. Until the  complaint is heard in Moscow, the city court decision is not in  force. But the elections are to take place on 20 March. And some  citizens will be deprived of an opportunity for full  participation in them. On these grounds a group of unregistered  deputies, as well as the Russian Peasant Party's branch, sent a  letter to Russian Electoral Commission Chairman N. Ryabov asking  him to interfere in the actions of the St. Petersburg city  electoral commission and to postpone the elections. At this  point, Moscow has not made its reaction known...    Today the city court will hear the Peasant Party's complaint  on the city electoral commission's actions. There are five days  left until the elections.</p>

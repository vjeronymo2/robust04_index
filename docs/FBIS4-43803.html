			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mulligan, PRESS ASSOCIATION News parliamentary </F> staff]    [Text] The prime minister today moved to calm Tory  backbench fears about further defence cuts, insisting he would  do nothing to undermine the fighting effectiveness of the armed  forces.    Mr Major was speaking at Commons question time after Andrew  Robathan, Conservative MP for Blaby, said there was "very real  concern" at the continuing reduction in Britain's defence  capability.    A Whitehall leak earlier this week suggested the jobs of  more  than 20,000 servicemen were at risk under the Front Line First  study, which aims to cut the defence budget by 2.3 billion  pounds over the next three years.    Mr Major declared: "The Front Line First programme will do  nothing to reduce the fighting effectiveness of our armed forces  and our ability to undertake defence commitments."    He told Mr Robathan: "I can reassure you that our commitment  to effective front line forces remains undiminished. The Front  Line First study is designed to make sure that money spent on  defence administration and support is kept to a minimum. That is  a sensible aim."    Mr Robathan told the prime minister: "There is very real  concern around the country about the continuing reduction in our  defence capability, as illustrated yesterday by the leak about  the defence costs study."    To loud Tory cheers, he asked: "Can you reassure your  friends  on this side of the House that you will never allow the growth  of expenditure on social security to undermine our national  security?"    Tory Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, told Mr Major that  since earlier defence cuts were prepared, the "world has become  more turbulent and less certain."    Calling for the current study to be reviewed, Mr Townsend  said the French, who had roughly similar international defence  commitments, had recently agreed to increase their defence  budget.    The prime minister said of the French: "In cash, they spend  broadly the same as we do, although they have a conscript army  in France as compared to the professional army we have in the  UK."    He went on: "Through the Front Line First defence costs  study we aim to maximise the proportion of defence resources  allocated to the front line. I believe that is the right way to  determine our defence expenditure -- unlike Labour who scream  `cuts' but would halve defence expenditure and,... if they had  the opportunity, might also scrap our nuclear capacity."</p>

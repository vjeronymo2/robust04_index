			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Scrambled policy Europe has been better at spawning regulations on the ownership of television channels than it has at encouraging new services. The latest debate - over ownership of digital satellite stations - shows signs of perpetuating the confusions of the past. Last week, British terrestrial broadcasters voted against proposals for a new code of conduct put forward in Geneva by the steering board of the European digital video project. The group, which brings together 145 organisations, is attempting to set standards for digital television, which could eventually deliver many more channels than conventional analogue signals. Although a majority of members adopted the code, the row is unlikely to die away. The UK broadcasters' concern is that the code will permit a high degree of vertical integration which could stifle new channels. In particular, they fear that one organisation could own the encryption or 'scrambling' system for delivering programmes, as well as owning the programmes. In controlling the means of delivery - in acting as 'gatekeeper', in the industry's phrase  -a company might prevent others gaining access to audiences unless they paid an exorbitant toll fee. Many are sceptical of the potential of digital television. But the issue has gained heat partly because of the success of satellite channels, delivered by conventional analogue signals, which gain some of their revenue from subscription. These include BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, as well as Canal Plus in France and Filmnet in the Benelux countries. These channels have demonstrated that where audiences are small, subscription rather than advertising may be an essential source of revenue. They also show that the first company to set up a means of encrypting programmes and then collecting subscription revenues has a natural monopoly. UK terrestrial broadcasters have been slow to appreciate the power of such combinations; they made little mention of the issue in their comments on the 1990 Broadcasting Act. But their attempts to prevent the same pattern emerging in digital television are misguided. They give little weight to the argument that the company which bore the initial risk of backing one delivery system should get some reward. Moreover, new systems are emerging to break the subscription monopoly, notably cable. Vertical integration in satellite television provides a powerful market position, which is capable of being abused. But there are better solutions than banning particular configurations. In particular, companies should press for more information about the gatekeeper's terms for allowing access to the subscriber base, and to report abuses promptly to regulators. They should avoid, though, pressing for rules which threaten to add another ill-thought out layer to one of the trickiest areas of European competition policy.</p>

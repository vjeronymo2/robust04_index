			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF / MAL FLORENCE;  </P> <P> STEVE PATE RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO AREA -- ONE OF HIS FAVORITES  </P> <P> It's understandable if Steve Pate is partial to the San Diego area. The PGA  Tour was in its early stages last year and he had already won two tournaments.  </P> <P> The former UCLA All-American won the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa  followed by a victory in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, formerly known as the  San Diego Open.  </P> <P> "My goal last year was to win twice and I did it in San Diego, so I'd have to  say it's been a pretty good area for me," Pate said.  </P> <P> Pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. Winning  early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he's progressing.  </P> <P> Pate, 27, who will defend his title in the Tournament of Champions starting  Thursday at La Costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on  the Tour.  </P> <P> He earned $89,358 in 1985, $176,100 in 1986, $335,728 in 1987 and $582,473 in  1988.  </P> <P> "After that great start I was hoping to win more," Pate said. "I guess I was a  little greedy, but I had a good stretch at the end of the year even though I  didn't win. Coming back to La Costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again."  </P> <P> Asked if he has any long-term goals, the Simi Valley resident said: "I'd like  to win every week but, obviously, that isn't going to happen. I'd like to win  more than once this year and defend one of my championships.  </P> <P> "I haven't made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. I'm just  getting better at it, like refining my swing. And I don't let bad things bother  me."  </P> <P> Pate says the T of C is the best quality field of the year. To qualify one must  win a PGA Tour tournament, or the British Open in the 12 months since the last  Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> And there's quite an attrition rate from year to year. Of the record 38  qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of  $135,000 and a total purse of $750,000.  </P> <P> Pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in  1988.  </P> <P> "I'm going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but I hate to  read about people making all that money while I'm sitting at home."  </P> <P> The Nabisco Championships last November at Pebble Beach paid Curtis Strange  $360,000 for winning a playoff with Tom Kite.  </P> <P> Asked if the Nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, Pate  said: "I think it does. That it can swing that much in one week I don't think  is particularly fair. But if I had to make a decision of not having the  tournament, or having it, I'd have it the way it is."  </P> <P> Pate is sometimes confused by galleries with Jerry Pate, a former U.S. Open  winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries.  </P> <P> Steve Pate takes it in stride.  </P> <P> "I don't think I look a whole like Jerry," "A lot of people follow me because  they think I'm Jerry. In an offhand way it gives me more recognition.  </P> <P> "Some people even ask me about diving in a lake."  </P> <P> Jerry Pate made a famous splash after winning the Tournament Players  Championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on.  </P> <P> As for Steve Pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots  consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain  abbreviated T of C by a stroke over Larry Nelson.  </P> <P> After he won last year, taking a check for $90,000, Pate said: "I'm not going  to lie to you that I was disappointed that the last round was canceled. A win  is a win. You take it any way you can."  </P> <P> He has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at Kapalua in  Maui in the Kirin Cup competition.  </P> <P> It was also a memorable year off the course for Pate.  </P> <P> "I was on the fifth hole playing in the Honda tournament when I got word that  my wife, Sheri, was about ready to have our first child. I ran off the course,  set a speed record driving to the Miami Airport and just missed the plane by 2  minutes," he said. "I had to wait 4 hours for the next flight.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles, I raced to the hospital from LAX and missed my daughter  Nicole's birth by an hour. Fortunately, Sheri and Nicole came through in great  shape, but I was a nervous wreck."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser, the Dodger Cy Young Award winner; New York Mets catcher Gary  Carter and Julius (Dr. J) Irving, the former star forward for the Philadelphia  76ers, will be among celebrities in the 30th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic  to be held Jan. 11-15 over four courses in the Palm Springs area.

Former  president Gerald Ford is among the traditional participants. . . .

Not that newsowrthy in itself. However, his wife, Pat, eagled the  same hole the next day with a 7-wood shot from 135 yards. . . . Jim Porter has  been named director of golf at Oakmont Country Club.

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> 'I SAY THROW THOSE GROVE BUMS OUT'  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Herman:  </P> <P> I've been reading about the financial troubles of the Grove Shakespeare  Festival in your newspaper. There have been stories in the Orange County news  section, in the Calendar section, in the View section.  </P> <P> Don't reporters for The Times have anything better to write about?  </P> <P> I say throw those Grove bums out. Get rid of them. Wash them out the door with  a hose. I'd even say nuke 'em, if I were sure we wouldn't have to bury the  waste products in our own back yard.  </P> <P> My name is C.M. Jerks, and the reason I don't enjoy all this brouhaha is pretty  simple. Those theater bums are out of step with the times, with the people and  with the moral climate of Orange County.  </P> <P> I fully support the City Council majority in its refusal to help the Grove out  of its cash shortage.  </P> <P> What was the first play they put on this season at the Grove? A 322-year-old  Frenchified comedy called "The Miser" about a crotchety bachelor who loves  money more than anything else and buries a pot of gold in his back yard. What  has that got to do with us?  </P> <P> I know there's a lot of material wealth around here. I'm not stupid. But I  don't remember hearing about anybody burying a pot of gold in his back yard. Do  you?  </P> <P> And just who is this Moliere character who wrote the play? Some bankrupt  libertine who didn't even go by his own name, that's who. He attacked organized  religion. He made fun of the middle class. He satirized doctors and lawyers. Is  that the kind of drivel we should be subjected to? I think not.  </P> <P> Next, those theater bums put on not one but three plays by an Englishman named  Shakespeare. Count them: "Much Ado About Nothing," "As You Like It" and  "Othello." Come on. Three plays by the same guy? Doesn't anybody at the Grove  realize there are plenty of other writers around? And I'm not just talking  about American writers. I'm not that provincial.  </P> <P> The first play took place in Italy. Who is Shakespeare trying to kid? Is this  guy Italian or English or what? He sounds bogus to me. On top of that, he's  even older than Moliere. The second play had a woman running around trying to  pass herself off as a man. That should have gotten an X rating right there.  </P> <P> The third play, though, really went beyond the pale. In it, a black man marries  a white woman and loves her so much he kills her out of jealousy. I am no  racist, but I found the interracial sex exceedingly offensive. And I would  think that black people would be offended, too.  </P> <P> It doesn't surprise me that Shakespeare would trample on a sensitive issue like  that, and with such relish. I have heard rumors that he had illegitimate  children. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't he a monumental plagiarist?  Didn't he steal his plots from other writers? Isn't there a question about  whether he wrote his own plays at all?  </P> <P> For a theater troupe to give voice to a writer of questionable character seems  to me inexcusable. And to do so by devoting almost its entire schedule to him  seems totally unreasonable. Such a writer does not deserve a platform in Garden  Grove or anywhere else.  </P> <P> In the meantime -- to add insult to injury -- those theater bums are about to  mount a play by someone even less reputable than Shakespeare. The play is  called "The Importance of Being Earnest," and its author is Oscar Wilde.  </P> <P> In case you didn't know it, Wilde was a notorious homosexual. Personally, I  have nothing against homosexuals. I'm much more tolerant than that. They have  their place, just like Catholics and Jews, blacks and yellows, the physically  challenged, the lesbians, all the minority groups that compose our multiracial,  multiethnic, equal-opportunity society.  </P> <P> But you have to draw the line somewhere. Frankly, I wish the Grove's cash  crisis had forced those theater bums to cancel "The Importance of Being  Earnest" instead of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales."  </P> <P> The poetic blatherings of a Welsh drunk like Thomas, deplorable though they may  be, would constitute a less dangerous threat to community standards of decency  than a facile comedy by a homosexual Irish dandy whose wit is liable to find  favor with high-minded reviewers such as yourself.  </P> <P> I would appreciate it if you would run this letter without any cuts. A friend  of mine doubts that you will. She says all you media folks love to slant the  news, and that any point of view opposing yours is not likely to get much of a  hearing. Please prove her wrong.  </P> <P> Yours sincerely,  </P> <P> C.M. Jerks  </P> <P> P.S: My friend also warned me not to tell that my initials stand for Council  Majority. It's an unusual name, which is why I never use it. I just go by my  initials.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AVERAGE PRICE OF HOUSE IN MALIBU NEARING $1 MILLION  </P> <P> Never mind the traffic. Ignore the tacky shops. Disregard the occasional  natural disasters. In three years, the average price of a single-family home in  Malibu will exceed $1 million.  </P> <P> Even today, most people can only afford to visit. Reflecting the escalating  prices of Westside real estate, the cost of living in Malibu jumped  dramatically in 1988. The average single-family house in the beachfront  community cost $678,000 last year, a 37% increase from 1987.  </P> <P> However, that amount probably won't land you a beachfront house. Those  properties cost an average of $1.62 million, a 20% jump from 1987. The  skyrocketing prices were reflected in the tiny jump in overall sales volume.  Only nine more residential properties were sold in 1988 than in the previous  year, but the transactions totaled $210 million, up from $149 million the  previous year.  </P> <P> The figures are based on an annual study of property sales in Malibu conducted  by real estate broker Dick Lowe, who has been tracking housing sales in the  coastal community for 11 years. Lowe compiled statistics from other brokers in  the area, then checked them against Malibu real estate sales recorded by Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to get any cheaper," said Lowe,  principal broker at Malibu Country Realty. "It's no different than it has been  in the past. It's just becoming increasingly difficult for people to find a  home in the $400,000 range."  </P> <P> Lowe said that although the figures are startling, the sales prices reflect  escalating home costs throughout the county, particularly in the affluent  Westside. In fact, the only Malibu real estate that took a dive was commercial  property -- sales dipped about $3 million to a total of $18 million in 1988.  </P> <P> The study found the biggest gain in the purchases of undeveloped land. A total  of 258 undeveloped properties were sold last year, compared to 114 in 1987.  </P> <P> "The increase in the unimproved land sales shows the interest people have in  finding something here before there's nothing left," Lowe said. "The amount of  usable land is becoming more and more scarce. The reason people come out here  is for the open feeling, the open space and the overall country atmosphere.  Today, it just costs a lot more to purchase it."  </P> <P> Even condominium and mobile- home sales continued to rise, from an average of  $187,000 in 1987 to $235,000 last year, a 25% jump.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10% Increase  </P> <P> At the rate Malibu real estate is climbing, Lowe estimates that in three years,  with a modest 10% annual sales increase, the average single-family home by land  or by sea will cost a minimum of $1 million.  </P> <P> According to a recent check of the multiple listings used by real estate  brokers, a buyer could still purchase a home on Las Tunas Beach for $700,000 --  a small two-bedroom with 1 1/2 bathrooms.  </P> <P> For $679,000, the average price for single-family homes in the area, a buyer  could get a three-bedroom home on six-tenths of an acre above Zuma Beach. It  doesn't include two full bathrooms, but it does promise an ocean view.  </P></p>

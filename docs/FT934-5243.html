			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Tory applause masks signs of unease Mr Kenneth Clarke's gamble that Conservative MPs would unite behind a package balancing still higher taxes with deep cuts in public spending last night appeared to have paid off. The Tory right applauded the additional Pounds 10bn of spending cuts over three years announced by the chancellor, while those on the party's centre-left were relieved the burden of the latest tax increases would fall on the better-off. But there were signs that the traditional applause on the day for a 'skilful' Budget disguised unease over the implications of a package which ministers admitted was much tougher than it looked. In spite of an effective and relaxed performance from Mr Clarke in his Budget debut, senior ministers left no doubt that they expected the legislation which would implement the measures to face a rough political ride. 'He has spread the misery with great skill, but it is still misery,' one member of the cabinet commented. The centrist Mr Clarke and his rightwing deputy, Mr Michael Portillo, launched an immediate campaign to persuade their allies on different wings of the party that the package had to be accepted in its entirety to preserve the political balance. Mr Portillo, the heir apparent of the Thatcherite right, saw his already rising political star boosted by the scale of the spending cuts. Mr Clarke told a crowded meeting of Tory backbench MPs that the measures to cut decisively the budget deficit represented the final piece in the jigsaw needed to ensure a steady recovery in the government's political fortunes. The implication was that if the party took tough decisions now, there could yet be scope for reductions in the basic rate of income tax before the general election due by mid-1997. A relatively generous compensation package to ease the introduction of value added tax on domestic fuel also appeared likely to defuse the threatened rebellion on the Conservative benches over an issue that has dogged the government for nine months. There was also palpable relief that the chancellor has not extended VAT into areas such as food and children's clothing, and applause for the series of measures to help small businesses. A new child care allowance for single parents and an increase in tax allowances for the blind were carefully designed to reassure the party left that tougher rules on other benefits did not signal a move to dismantle the welfare state. Deep cuts in the defence budget, the proposed cuts in invalidity and unemployment benefits, a sharp rise in petrol tax and a levy on insurance premiums were all identified as potential political flashpoints. Mr Clarke skilfully dispersed the tax rises across a range of measures to avoid a focal point for a backbench rebellion comparable to the uproar caused by the extension of VAT on fuel. But ministers acknowledged the freeze on income tax allowances, higher petrol prices, the new insurance and airport taxes and the further cut in mortgage interest relief would hit directly the Conservatives' traditional supporters in the shire counties. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, signalled the start of an opposition onslaught on the government's 'broken tax promises', charging that taxpayers, the disabled and unemployed were being made to pay for the government's economic incompetence. Labour calculated the cumulative tax increases since last March would cost the average family Pounds 10 per week from next April and Pounds 16 per week from 1995. The additional cuts assume the government can stick to a freeze on public sector pay next year, a policy likely to be threatened by industrial discontent in the main public services.</p>

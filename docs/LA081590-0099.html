			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUES FIRM OVER ASBESTOS REMOVAL ON SHIP  </P> <P> A ship repair company and its president have been charged with improperly  removing asbestos from an aircraft carrier, potentially endangering hundreds of  sailors as well as their own employees.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office, which filed the charges Monday against California  Marine Commercial Insulation Inc. and its president and owner, Frank Chavez,  contends that the firm knowingly failed to ensure that workers took proper  precautions when they removed more than 260 feet of pipes covered with dry,  crumbling asbestos from the carrier Ranger.  </P> <P> Investigators and some employees allege that workers wore no protective  clothing, tore out asbestos while sailors were present, toted dust-laden pipes  through bunk and kitchen areas and piled loose asbestos in dumpsters, all in  violation of federal asbestos removal laws.  </P> <P> Chavez has denied any wrongdoing and said that all the work aboard the aircraft  carrier was done properly.  </P> <P> The charges sprang from an eight-month investigation by the Naval Investigative  Service, which had received complaints from CMCI employees. The case will be  the first of its kind in the nation to be controlled by new federal sentencing  guidelines, said Melanie Pierson, assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego. A  guilty verdict could result in a $25,000 fine and a six-month jail term.  </P></p>

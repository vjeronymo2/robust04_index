His plea, the second in three days, was made during a  televised speech marking international working women's day when  he declared that he will devote himself to these issues.    Shortly after his disagreement with the State Duma over its  amnesty for political rebels, Yeltsin proposed at a cabinet  meeting held last Friday [4 March] to adopt a memorandum on  domestic harmony.    He said that this was particularly necessary in the present  situation where the danger of confrontation is looming,  referring to the release of former Vice-President Aleksandr  Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov.    Observers here noted that a mood of reconciliation and  cooperation, not seen over the past two years, has been gaining  ground amongst powerful political forces of the vast Russian  Federation.    In a report to the government, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin echoed the president's comments made in his state  of the nation address on February 24.    Sergey Glaziyev, chairman of the committee of the economic  policy of the State Duma, said that the theme of the president's  address on the state of the nation is consistent with the  economic policies of the State Duma, or the lower house of  parliament.</p>

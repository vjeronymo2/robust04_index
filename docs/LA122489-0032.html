			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIAMOND BAR LOSES PROPERTY TAXES DUE TO TECHNICALITIES  </P> <P> The city's last hope of salvaging $1.2 million in property tax revenues has  been dashed by Los Angeles County legal advisers, who refuse to exempt the  newly incorporated city from technicalities in state law.  </P> <P> Diamond Bar officials have negotiated with the county for months trying to find  a way around provisions in state law that say the city, because of the timing  of its incorporation election in March, isn't eligible to receive property  taxes until December, 1990.  </P> <P> In a Dec. 11 letter to Mayor Phyllis Papen, Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete  Schabarum said that after reviewing the city's request, the county counsel has  determined that "the county of Los Angeles does not have the authority to  provide an allocation of property tax monies for the 1989-90 fiscal year to the  city of Diamond Bar."  </P> <P> Assistant County Counsel Lawrence B. Launer, in a Dec. 4 legal opinion to  Schabarum, said Diamond Bar is classified as a no tax city because it  incorporated after Jan. 1.  </P> <P> "The establishment of a Jan. 1 cutoff date is rationally based," Launer said in  the opinion.  </P> <P> But city officials think otherwise. Papen said Thursday that withholding  property taxes from newly incorporated cities is unconstitutional and "an  injustice to the city of Diamond Bar."  </P> <P> "It puts the city in the position of having to provide the full scope of  municipal services without the benefit of receiving property taxes," she said.  Diamond Bar assumed full financial responsibility for services on July 1.  </P> <P> Papen added that before Diamond Bar became a city, incorporation proponents may  have been misled by the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission,  which issued a feasibility report indicating what the city's tax base would be  during the first year. That figure included property taxes, Papen said, and  didn't specify any conditions for receiving the money.  </P> <P> But LAFCO Executive Officer Ruth Benell said it was the responsibility of  cityhood proponents to determine when Diamond Bar would be able to receive  property taxes and then schedule the incorporation election accordingly.  </P> <P> "They didn't even ask me when they'd start getting property taxes," Benell said  Thursday. "If they had, I would have referred them to the controller's office,  which would have given them the right answer."  </P> <P> In fact, cityhood proponents originally wanted a November, 1988, incorporation  election. But right before the deadline, six residents formally asked LAFCO to  reconsider the incorporation application. Because LAFCO decided to hold a  hearing on their request, a November incorporation election was impossible.  </P> <P> The property tax disappointment is the second surprise development to result  from the timing of Diamond Bar's incorporation. Earlier, city officials learned  that, under state law, three council members who thought they had won two-year  terms would instead have to run for reelection after less than a year in  office.  </P> <P> City officials tried to delay the required April, 1990, election until  November, 1990, but were turned down by the county. Some approached Assemblyman  Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who promised to look into the possibility of  legislation extending the terms another year.  </P> <P> Hill said he would propose the legislation only if one of the three council  members decided not to run against him for a state Senate seat. Later, under  criticism for the remark, he dropped the idea of sponsoring the legislation  altogether.  </P></p>

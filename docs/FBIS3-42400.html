The second  edition has been revised and supplemented with materials on  combat, logistic, and technical support, and also with the  peculiarities of employing self-propelled artillery.    It is intended for officers of the Ground Forces and  military  school cadets.  <H5>  From the Authors </H5>   The purpose of the second edition of this book is to help  commanders of artillery subunits to expand their tactical  outlook and to help study more deeply the fundamentals of combat  employment of the artillery battalion and the work of the  commander and staff of the battalion to prepare and conduct the  battalion's combat operations. The book can serve as an aid in  organizing tactical drills, short exercises, and practices in  fire control.    The basic provisions for organizing and planning combat  operations by the battalion commander and staff, command and  control of the battalion, the fundamentals of combat employment,  and the combat operations of the battalion in various types of  combat and on the march are examined in accordance with the  regulation documents in effect and taking into account the  experience of the Great Patriotic War and the data of troop  exercises of recent years.    The tactical examples show the practical work of the  battalion commander and staff in organizing the battalion  operations for offensive, defensive, and march preparation  conditions. Examples are presented of documents worked up in the  battalion and orders of the commander (chief of staff) for  comprehensive support of combat operations and preparation for  firing. It also shows the actions of the battalion under various  conditions and the command and control of the battalion.    The nature of the battalion combat operations examined in  various types of combat and partially in special conditions is  supported by examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic  War and tactical exercises. The book takes into account the  changes in the outfitting of artillery subunits with weapons and  combat equipment.    In comparison with the first edition, in this edition the  tactical examples have been substantially revised; more  attention is given to organizing cooperation; a tactical example  is given on organizing the march; employment of self-propelled  artillery is more widely shown; and a number of new sections  have been introduced.    We hope that this book, addressed primarily to artillery  officers at the battery-battalion level and to commanders of  combined-arms subunits cooperating with artillery subunits, will  also be useful to instructors and cadets of artillery schools  and to reserve officers.    We express gratitude to Lt-Gen V.M. Zakharov, Lt-Gen A.P.  Lebedev, Lt-Gen Yu.I. Shumilikhin, Col E.G. Bazylev, and other  comrades for the valuable advice and suggestions expressed on  the content of the book.  <H5>  Chapter 1. Fundamentals of Combat Employment of the Battalion </H5> <H5>  The Role of Artillery Subunits in Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>   Modern battle is combined-arms battle, for it is waged by  the  combined efforts of all troops participating in it with the use  of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles (armored personnel  carriers), artillery, air defense assets, airplanes,  helicopters, and other combat equipment and armament. All  subunits and units participating in the battle operate under a  single concept, directing their efforts at achieving the rapid  defeat of the enemy. In battle, they employ techniques and  methods of battle inherent only to them, stemming from the  particular features of their organization, and the combat  performance characteristics and capabilities of the available  armament.    Constant improvement of the characteristics of conventional  weapons leads to improvement in their accuracy and speed, and an  increase in their range and the explosive force of munitions.  All this invariably leads to an increase in their combat  capabilities. These qualitative changes and the new, mostly  armored combat equipment in the inventory of subunits and units  has a significant influence on changing the nature of modern  battle. It is distinguished by decisiveness, high mobility,  intensity, and diversity in using the methods of conducting it.    The decisiveness and high mobility of combat actions lead to  rapid and abrupt situation changes, which have a significant  influence on the course of carrying out assigned tasks and which  force commanders to make new, often urgent decisions and to  carry out actions according to the situation that has taken  shape. Abrupt situation changes can be brought about by the  rapid commitment of combined-arms reserves (second echelons), a  surprise attack (counterattack), landing of a tactical airborne  assault force, a surprise attack by combat helicopters, the use  of assets for mining the terrain, the enemy's use of weapons of  mass destruction, encirclement of the enemy, and other actions.    The actions of combined-arms subunits in modern  combined-arms  battle are diverse. They may advance on the defending enemy or  defend, wage a meeting engagement or pursue the enemy, force  water obstacles or operate as part of an airborne tactical  assault force, and so forth.    They are capable of waging battle on various terrain  (mountains, deserts, forests, city, and northern regions) and at  various times of the year and day.    Therefore, all characteristics of battle, the peculiarities  of the terrain, and other conditions in which modern battle may  be waged must be taken into account by commanders of all levels  during the course of combat training.    Modern battle is, above all, a firefight. The importance of  fire and its coordination with attack and maneuver under  conditions of increased combat capabilities of weapon assets  take on a new quality. The use of modern models of conventional  weapons in battle makes it possible in short periods of time to  inflict heavy losses on the enemy and create breaches in his  battle formation, and the high mobility of subunits and units  makes it possible to deliver fire quickly, attack the enemy on  the move, and swiftly advance deep into enemy lines.    Artillery, being the main firepower of the Ground Forces,  plays a decisive role in effective engagement of the enemy. This  is evidenced by the rich experience of the Great Patriotic War.  Artillery paved the way with firepower for the offensive of our  tanks and infantry, and on the defensive it blocked the path of  the enemy.    Artillery subunits (battalion, battery), possessing powerful  and long-range fire, support tank and motorized rifle subunits  in all types of battle.    Artillery subunits destroy artillery and rocket launcher  batteries, mortar platoons, infantry fighting vehicles, armored  personnel carriers, antitank weapons, personnel, command and  observation posts, and other targets. The majority of these  targets are armored and on the battlefield will move, maneuver,  and be located at positions (firing positions) for short periods  of time. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy them immediately  after they are detected. Effective destruction of them requires  determining their coordinates with a high degree of accuracy and  opening fire quickly and without warning.    Uninterrupted and very close cooperation with supported  combined-arms subunits is the basis of the actions of all  artillery subunits.    The constant threat of the enemy using nuclear, chemical,  and  bacteriological (biological) weapons requires commanders of all  levels to continuously discover and immediately destroy them by  all available means, fully accomplish measures to protect  against weapons of mass destruction, and be able to wage battle  under conditions of the enemy's use of these types of weapons.    Special attention in modern battle should be given to the  timely relocation (maneuver) of artillery subunits and the  ability to deploy them rapidly on the move (from the line of  march) and to carry out fire missions on terrain that is  inconvenient tactically, at unprepared firing positions, and  under enemy artillery fire and air strikes. The use of  self-propelled artillery is most advantageous in these  conditions.    In order successfully to control an artillery subunit and  its  fire in the complex conditions of modern battle, commanders and  their staffs must correctly use all the available assets at  their disposal, make competent decisions in compressed time  periods, predict the course of development of battle,  persistently strive to implement the decisions, and demonstrate  initiative.    Every commander must demonstrate creativity in battle, that  is, he must look for and skillfully apply new techniques and  methods, and reject stereotypical, automatic patterns, and  dogmatism. Creativity in tactics depends on a continually  growing theoretical arsenal, which officers must constantly  master. Now it is inconceivable to lead subunits and teach and  educate subordinates without scientific knowledge.  <H5>  The Artillery Battalion: The Basic Fire and Tactical Subunit </H5>   The appearance of nuclear weapons and the considerable  modernization of conventional weapons caused profound changes in  the nature of modern combined-arms battle. In these conditions,  new demands are placed on artillery, aimed at improving weapons,  ammunition, and instrumentation; reducing the time to carry out  fire missions; and increasing the accuracy of calculating firing  data. Full preparation has become the main method of determining  firing data. Constant improvement of tactics, firing and fire  control techniques, and also methods combat training has become  the basis of daily training of artillery units and subunits.  Workers of scientific institutions, instructors at military  educational institutions, artillery staffs, and commanders of  artillery units and subunits participate actively in carrying  out these tasks.    Equipping artillery with qualitatively new models of  self-propelled artillery systems and weapon control vehicles  (command vehicles) was an important factor in increasing its  combat effectiveness. With more accurate instruments for  reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey, and command and control,  self-propelled artillery subunits are able to open accurate fire  in short time periods. They can best operate with tank and  motorized rifle subunits and units in battle and accomplish  continuous support of them.    Sophisticated modern combat equipment requires commanders  and  all personnel of subunits to maintain it in constant combat  readiness, for which it is necessary to have a thorough  knowledge of the working principles of the equipment, organize  correct operation of it, and perform periodic maintenance  (technical servicing) in a timely manner.    As an organizational unit of artillery, the artillery  battalion consists of a command element, staff, several  batteries, and combat support and maintenance subunits.  Organizationally it is part of a unit.    A battalion's artillery subunits are outfitted with various  instruments for artillery reconnaissance, fire control,  topogeodetic survey, meteorological support, and radiation and  chemical reconnaissance, and communications equipment. The  subunits also have assets for self-defense and for conducting  engineer work and camouflage, and there is an artillery  ballistic station in the battalion.    Possessing powerful and accurate fire, a battalion is able  to  destroy various targets--ground targets, surface targets,  targets in the open, and sheltered targets--and to provide  continuous fire support to combined-arms subunits in battle.    The experience of combat employment of artillery subunits  shows that destroying targets located at a site, such as platoon  strong points, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers at  positions, artillery batteries (particularly armored  self-propelled batteries), and command posts located over  considerable areas is not very effective with fire from  individual batteries, much less platoons (guns). In addition,  the increased degree of protection and high maneuvering  capabilities of these targets has resulted in a need to use  projectiles of increased power and to reduce the time of fire  pressure against these targets. For example, it takes an average  of up to 10 minutes for motorized infantry and tank subunits to  escape bombardment; ATGM subunits three-four minutes; and  self-propelled batteries five-six minutes.    Experience shows that the battalion fire in battle accounts  for 55-60 percent of all targets hit; fire from an artillery  group--up to 25 percent; and fire from batteries and individual  guns independently--only 15-20 percent of the targets. Thus, in  modern battle a battalion has to carry out most of the fire  missions. In doing so, the battalion, using various methods of  bombardment, is able to create a high density of fire against  the entire target, destroy it in short time periods, achieve  surprise, and prevent the target from maneuvering. As a rule,  the battalion engages the target independently and can be used  to concentrate fire as part of an artillery group.    In carrying out the assigned fire missions, the battalion is  able to determine the coordinates of various targets with a high  degree of accuracy using its own assets. The battalion is the  center for preparation to fire and fire control to the full  extent prescribed by the "Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures."  The factors examined above make it possible to consider the  battalion the basic fire and tactical subunit of artillery.  <H5>  The Battalion's Place in the Artillery Grouping </H5>   Modern views of the combat employment of a battalion are  based on qualitative changes that have taken place in tactics in  the postwar period. Continuous cooperation of artillery with  motorized rifle and tank subunits in battle is the basis of  combat employment of the battalion and one of the main factors  determining it--the battalion's place in the artillery grouping.    The artillery grouping for upcoming combat operations is  created by decision of the senior combined-arms commander using  organic and attached artillery. In creating this grouping, the  battalion, as a rule, is the basic standard unit. Employment of  the battalion in the grouping being created depends on the  concept of operations, the battalion's organizational  affiliation, type (towed or self-propelled) and caliber of guns,  and the battalion's combat capabilities. Being the basic fire  and tactical subunit of artillery, the battalion, as a rule,  operates jointly with a combined-arms unit (subunit), provides  it powerful fire support, has continuous cooperation with it,  and thus increases its independence in various types of battle.    An artillery battalion as part of a created artillery  grouping can support a combined-arms unit (subunit), be attached  to it, or remain on standby with an artillery group commander.    A [artillery] battalion assigned to support a battalion,  remaining subordinate to the senior artillery commander (chief),  at individual stages of battle carries out missions for delivery  of fire against the enemy, that are assigned to it by the  commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) it is supporting.    In an offensive situation (particularly when developing the  battle deep in the enemy's defenses), in a meeting engagement,  or in certain conditions in a defensive situation, the battalion  may be attached to a first-echelon battalion or a battalion  assigned to the forward detachment (advance guard).    An attached battalion becomes fully subordinate to the  combined-arms unit (subunit) commander and carries out all  missions he assigns. If the attached battalion was part of the  artillery group, it is withdrawn from it.    Experience shows that at the most crucial moments of a  battle, when it is necessary to involve a larger amount of  artillery and centralize its fire control for carrying out fire  missions, the attached battalion (battery) can be used to carry  out a mission on decision of the senior combined-arms  (artillery) commander (chief). This usually takes place when  repelling counterattacks by superior enemy forces, supporting  commitment of second echelons, and breaking through densely  occupied positions of brigade and division reserves and  intermediate positions deep in enemy defenses.    A stand-by battalion, being directly subordinate to the  artillery group commander, carries out fire missions in support  of the regiment (battalion) and missions that arise suddenly in  the shortest possible time.    A battalion can remain directly subordinate to the regiment  commander if an artillery group has not been created in the  regiment.    A battery usually operates as part of the artillery  battalion  and can be assigned to support a company (battalion), attached  to it, or be on standby with the artillery battalion commander.  <H5>  Combat Capabilities </H5>   In modern battle, an artillery battalion is capable of  destroying or neutralizing offensive nuclear and chemical  weapons, artillery and rocket launcher batteries, mortar  platoons, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, antitank and other  weapons, personnel, command posts, air defense weapons, and  electronics, and of demolishing fortifications.    A battalion's capability to destroy various targets in  battle  is determined by its fire and maneuver capabilities, and also by  its range of fire.    Fire capabilities represent the artillery  subunit's capability to carry out a specific number of fire  missions (to neutralize, destroy, or demolish a given number of  targets) with the available or allocated amount of ammunition in  specific conditions within a given time.    To determine (calculate) the fire capabilities, it is  necessary to know the battalion's composition (number of guns),  the availability (allocated amount) of ammunition, the nature of  the fire missions, the ammunition expenditure norms for  destroying given targets, and the required (planned) shell  density.    In addition, one should take into account the strength level  of gun crews, the level of their combat cohesiveness, their  political morale, and the conditions in which it is necessary to  carry out the fire mission.    Knowledge of the fire capabilities and the ability to  determine them in various conditions of the combat situation  enable the battalion commander to make sound decisions and  assign realistic missions to batteries for destroying  reconnoitered targets.    In an offensive situation, the fire capabilities are  calculated by periods of fire engagement of the enemy--for  artillery preparation of the attack, artillery support of the  attack, and artillery accompaniment of the troop offensive in  the depth--taking into account the missions typical for each  period.    The battalion commander independently calculates the fire  capabilities when carrying out such missions as repelling enemy  counterattacks, supporting commitment of second echelons, and  breaking through positions of brigade and division reserves. Let  us show this using an example.    A battalion of 122-mm howitzers (18 guns) is called upon to  take part in a bombardment during a breakthrough of positions of  enemy brigade reserves. To carry out the fire missions, the  battalion is authorized to expend 0.6 units of fire (18 X 48 =  844 shells), the crews are fully manned, and the actions are  carried out in the daytime during the spring.    It is determined from the maximum rate of the firing table  that the battalion can expend this amount of shells in 12  minutes at any charge.    Taking into account the nature of the targets to be  neutralized and the shell expenditure norms, it is calculated  that a battalion is capable of carrying out the following  missions with this amount of shells: neutralize one battery of  self-propelled armored guns, a mortar platoon, and one-two  individual targets, or neutralize one platoon strong point and  one-two individual targets, or neutralize six-eight individual  targets.    In conditions of highly mobile actions deep in the enemy's  defenses and in a meeting engagement, destruction of various  targets will be accomplished with a lesser shell expenditure  norm, for example, 0.7-0.8 and sometimes even 0.5 of the norm.  In this case, the battalion is accordingly capable of carrying  out a larger number of missions.    In a defensive situation, the battalion's fire capabilities  are calculated according to the effective engagement of the  enemy for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment  of enemy troops, for artillery repelling an enemy attack, and  for artillery support defending troops in depth and effective  fire engagement of the enemy when carrying out a counterattack.  A variant of calculating the fire capabilities of a battalion in  a defensive situation is shown in the Tactical Example 3.    When engaging targets, battalion and battery commanders must  strive to create a higher fire density.    Fire density is the number of shells expended on a  target in a unit of time. The more intense the shelling of a  target, the higher the fire density and the higher the level of  target kill.    Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War and  exercises,  the fire density for one hectare of target area in one minute  should be five-10 shells.    The high rate of fire of guns and the use of shells having  different purposes enable a battalion to create high fire  density and inflict heavy damage on enemy personnel and combat  equipment. Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War, a  battalion of twelve 122-mm howitzers fired more than 300 shells  at a target in five minutes, and almost 700 in 15 minutes.    Maneuver capabilities are the ability of the  battalion to execute a march on various types of terrain in any  weather, to concentrate secretly in the assigned area, to deploy  into battle formation in a short period of time to carry out  fire missions, and to shift from one area of firing positions to  another.    A modern artillery battalion concedes nothing to tank and  motorized rifle subunits in march capabilities, which ensures  that it will maintain close cooperation with them in highly  mobile combat actions.    Self-propelled artillery subunits possess higher maneuver  capabilities.    When carrying out fire missions, the artillery battalion  employs adjustment of fire widely. This involves concentrating  fire on one target or dispersion of fire to several important  targets simultaneously without changing firing positions over a  limited period of time.    A battalion's maneuver capabilities are expressed by time  indicators for executing a march, deploying into battle  formation, abandoning firing positions, and shifting fire.    The firing range of guns shows the battalion's capability to  engage targets in depth (range of fire).  <H5>  Order of Battle </H5>   The artillery battalion's order of battle comprises organic  and attached forces and assets deployed in accordance with the  commander's decision to carry out assigned missions.    The battalion order of battle (Figure 1) consists  of the order of battles of batteries and attached artillery  reconnaissance subunits, a command and observation post, and, if  necessary, observation posts and fire control posts.          The battery order of battle consists of the battle  formations of gun platoons, a command and observation post, and,  if necessary, an observation post (forward or lateral).    The order of battle of a battalion (battery) should ensure  the most effective and reliable execution of the assigned fire  missions, full use of the combat capabilities of subunits,  maintaining continuous cooperation with combined-arms subunits,  stable command and control of subunits, the possibility of rapid  maneuver in the course of battle, and also the least  vulnerability of subunits to strikes by all types of weapons.    The command-observation post (KNP) is intended to  control the fire and maneuver of subunits, conducting  reconnaissance of the enemy and observation of the terrain and  the actions of combined-arms subunits, and maintaining  cooperation with them. The composition of the command and  observation post includes the battalion (battery) commander, an  intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), a signals  officer (depending on the type of combat actions, he may be a  part of the fire control post), scouts with observation devices,  and radiotelephone operators (radiotelegraph operators) with  communications equipment.    The battalion (battery) command and observation post is  situated in the command vehicle or is deployed on the terrain  jointly with the observation (command-observation) post of the  combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the battalion (battery) is  attached or which it is supporting, or near this post.    The command-observation post of a standby battalion  (battery)  is positioned near the observation (command-observation) post of  the artillery group (battalion).    The command vehicle of a battalion (battery) is intended to  accommodate personnel comprising the battalion (battery)  command-observation post and to provide fire control. It is  equipped with equipment for topogeodetic survey, orientation,  reconnaissance, observation, communication, and determining  firing data. This equipment makes it possible to determine with  a high degree of accuracy the location coordinates of  command-observation post (vehicle) and targets, to prepare fire  in a short period of time, and to reduce the time for carrying  out a fire mission. To use the command vehicles most  effectively, it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the  automation equipment and devices, their operating principles,  operating procedures, and the order for input of data.    The forward observation post (PNP) is intended to  conduct reconnaissance of the enemy and observing the terrain  directly in front of the forward combined-arms subunits,  maintaining closer contact with them, and servicing battalion  (battery) fire against targets that cannot be observed from the  command and observation post. As a rule, the PNP includes an  intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), scouts  with reconnaissance devices, and a radiotelephone operator with  communications equipment.    The lateral observation post (BNP) is intended to  conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, service fire, observe the  terrain and actions of combined-arms subunits in areas not  observed from the command-observation post, and to organize  bilateral observation. The BNP consists of the reconnaissance  squad commander (scout) with the necessary reconnaissance  devices and communications equipment.    The forward and lateral observation posts are sent out by  the  battalion (battery) commander in various types of battle to  selected sites as necessary or for a specific time to carry out  missions that arise. When organizing bilateral observation, its  main post is positioned together with the battalion's  command-observation post, and the other post (right or left) is  located by itself or with the command-observation post of one of  the batteries.    The battalion fire control post (PUOD) is intended  to prepare for firing and fire control of the battalion. The  post includes the battalion chief of staff, a command and  control group, and radiotelephone operators. It is usually  located on a command and staff vehicle that is equipped for  measuring ground meteorological data and compiling approximate  meteorological messages, processing topogeodetic survey results,  determining firing data using computers and backup instruments,  fire control in cooperation with other battalion command  vehicles, and maintaining reliable communications in the  battalion.    Battery fire platoons deployed at a firing  position are intended for engaging various enemy targets with  fire from indirect firing positions or by direct fire. The fire  platoons are controlled by the senior battery officer who is  located with the radio operators and plotters in a command  vehicle or an emplacement. The command vehicle is intended for  fire control, determining observation post coordinates, and  orienting guns. The instruments it has make it possible to  conduct radiation and chemical reconnaissance and also to check  the terrain for mines.    Navigation equipment is capable of working out the current  coordinates of a vehicle's location and the grid azimuth of the  vehicle's longitudinal axis, and to plot the route of movement.    All this makes it possible to gain a quick orientation  during  the course of leading a column and to carry out fire missions  when deploying gun platoons on the move, when relocating, or on  the march.    A fire position area and a command-observation post line are  designated for deployment of the battalion into battle formation.    A battery is assigned a fire position area (fire position)  and command-observation post location. Two or three fire  positions are selected for each battery in the fire position  area and numbered with two- or three-digit numbers: the first  digit (first two digits) correspond to the battery number; the  second (third) digit corresponds to the serial number of the  position.    Battery fire platoons are deployed, as a rule, at one fire  position. In individual cases, each fire platoon may deploy at  an independent fire position.    Fire position areas may be primary, alternate, or temporary  areas according to their purpose.    The primary fire position area is designated for  carrying out fire missions in all types of battle. Its distance  from the forward subunits (forward edge of the battle area) of  our units depends on the battalion's place in the artillery  grouping, the range of artillery systems, the nature of the  terrain, and other situation conditions.    The alternate fire position area is usually  designated in a defensive situation for battalion maneuver  (battery) and to carry out fire missions during an intentional  or forced abandonment of the primary fire position area (for  example, maneuver of a battery due to systematic bombardment by  artillery or repeated enemy air raids; maneuver of a battalion  due to contamination of the terrain by toxic or radioactive  substances).    The temporary fire position area (temporary fire  position for a battery) can be designated for carrying out  individual fire missions (for supporting combined-arms subunits  operating in the forward defense area or defending the forward  position, for firing on distant targets, for carrying out  missions as roving subunits, and for carrying out other  missions).    The fire position is a sector of terrain occupied  or prepared for occupation by a battery's gun platoons (platoon,  gun) for delivery of fire. A battery fire position includes  places for guns and ammunition, for the battery senior officer's  vehicle, for personnel shelters, for emplacements for  self-defense, for the observation post, for prime movers and  vehicles with ammunition, and for a battery of rocket artillery.    In addition, it includes places for a loading point and a  meteorological station.    Fire positions can be indirect or direct.    An indirect-fire position is one in which the guns  (mortars, combat vehicles) are concealed from enemy ground  observation during delivery of fire. The possibility of  delivering fire at given minimum quadrant elevations and large  deflection shifts from the base line, the possibility of direct  laying during self-defense, and also the availability of  convenient access routes and camouflage conditions are taken  into account when selecting an indirect-fire position. As  experience in the Great Patriotic War shows that it is advisable  to select fire positions for batteries of gun and howitzer  artillery primarily on avenues of likely tank approach, which  will make it possible to destroy enemy tanks and other armored  targets that have broken through by direct fire. For best  execution of this mission, fire positions should be selected  behind natural antitank obstacles and minefields. For mortar and  missile artillery batteries, taking into account the design  peculiarities of their weapons, fire positions are selected in  areas inaccessible to tanks a much as possible. It is not  recommended that fire positions be selected near prominent local  features that make it easier for the enemy to reconnoiter and  fix these positions.    Guns are disposed at a fire position taking into account the  terrain relief with intervals between guns and mortars of 20-40  meters, and 50-60 meters between rocket artillery combat  vehicles.    To increase the survivability of artillery batteries, the  guns can be disposed at the fire position in a dispersed manner  or by platoon, taking into account the terrain's concealing and  protective features.    A direct-fire position is one in which the  equipment is not concealed from enemy ground observation or,  being concealed and camouflaged, becomes observable at the start  of delivery of fire. A direct-fire position is usually selected  near the disposition of our forward subunits, taking into  account the possibility of camouflaging the guns and the  availability of concealed access routes. Fire is delivered by  direct laying from the direct-fire position to destroy tanks,  armored vehicles, and various antitank weapons, and also to  demolish weapon emplacements.    When selecting an indirect- or direct-fire position, it is  necessary to take into account the nature of the soil and the  level of ground water. Where possible, the soil should be  sufficiently firm, but not rocky or dusty. Rocky soil increases  the fragmentation effect of shells in the event the position is  shelled by the enemy and makes engineer preparation more  difficult; dusty soil gives away the location of the fire  position during firing.    The artillery prime movers of batteries are positioned to  the  rear, right, or left of the fire position in terrain  irregularities or in prepared shelters at a distance ensuring  visual contact and rapid movement of the prime movers to the  guns (mortars). At the locations of prime movers, the drivers  dig slit trenches and keep a lookout for signals from the  battery senior officer and the observation post.    The battalion may prepare dummy fire positions and  command-observation post sites according to the plan of the  senior chief in order to mislead the enemy as to the disposition  of the artillery subunits. The preparation and camouflage of  these must not differ sharply from the actual positions and  sites. A roving battery (platoon, gun) may periodically deliver  fire from the dummy fire positions.  <H5>  Types of Fire </H5>   Targets on the battlefield are distinguished from one  another  by size, degree of protection, nature of fire activities,  maneuverability, and also tactical importance. Therefore,  artillery subunits deliver fire for effect with the mission of  destruction, neutralization, or suppression. In addition, they  may carry out missions for illumination support of the actions  of motorized rifle and tank subunits (units) and artillery  firing at night, smoke screening (blinding) the enemy,  distributing agitation material, and accomplishing target  designation.    Annihilation of a target involves inflicting on it  such losses (damage) that it completely loses its combat  effectiveness. When destroying unobserved targets, fire is  delivered until a designated amount of shells has been expended  which ensures a kill probability of individual targets equal to  0.7-0.9 or the mathematical expectation of 50-60 percent targets  destroyed in a multiple target.    Destruction of a target involves rendering it  unfit for further use.    Neutralization of a target involves inflicting  such losses (damage) on a target or using fire to create such  conditions that it temporarily loses its combat effectiveness,  its maneuver is restricted (denied), or command and control is  disrupted. When neutralizing unobserved multiple targets,  expenditure of a norm of shells ensures a mathematical  expectation that 30 percent of the targets are destroyed.    Suppression is accomplished by delivering  harassing fire with a limited number of guns and ammunition for  the purpose of exerting moral-psychological pressure on enemy  personnel in defense (concentration) areas, at command posts, in  rear installations, and so forth.    Subunits use the following types of fire in engaging the  enemy: engagement of a single target; barrage and concentrated  fire. In addition, an artillery battalion may also be involved  in delivering concentrated fire, massed fire, successive fire  concentration, and a rolling barrage.    Engagement of a single target is the fire of a  battery, platoon, or gun delivered independently from an  indirect- or direct-fire position. Single targets are various  fire weapons--recoilless guns; ATGM [antitank guided missile]  launchers; tanks; machine guns; armored personnel carriers in or  outside of emplacements; observation points (in emplacements or  mobile); radars; earth-and-timber, armored, and concrete  emplacements; and so forth.    When firing from an indirect-fire position, a battery may  engage one or (by platoons) two targets simultaneously. When  platoons fire on two targets simultaneously, one platoon is  usually controlled by the battery commander, and the other by  the headquarters platoon commander.    To annihilate armored targets and destroy permanent weapon  emplacements by direct firing, one or two guns are assigned to  each target.    Barrage fire is a solid curtain of fire set up on  one (NZO-- fixed barrage) or successively on several lines  (PZO--creeping barrage) in the path of movement of attacking  (counterattacking) enemy motorized infantry and tanks to inflict  damage on them, prevent their advance, disrupt the battle  formations, and create favorable conditions for their  annihilation by antitank weapons.    Barrage fire, as a rule, is prepared in advance on every  possible axis of enemy attack (counterattack). When necessary,  barrage fire is prepared during the course of a battle. Barrage  fire lines should be observable from command-observation and  observation posts. Howitzer and gun artillery is used to deliver  barrage fire.    The battalion (battery) commander must know precisely the  location on the terrain of each of the barrage fire lines being  prepared and ensure that fire is opened in a timely manner on  these lines. The right to request barrage fire is given to the  following: all company (battery) commanders and higher have the  right to call in a fixed barrage; all battalion (artillery  battalion) commanders and higher have the right to call in a  creeping barrage.          Creeping barrage fire (Figure 2) is prepared on  the most dangerous avenues of likely tank approach, taking into  account the fire of antitank weapons of company strong points.  The first (far) line is set at a distance of approximately 2-4  km from the forward edge, that is, at a distance from which  enemy subunits will move in platoon columns and subsequently  deploy into battle formation. The last line is set at a distance  of 700-1,000 meters from the forward edge of own troops.    The distance between the lines is set at 400-600 meters and  sometimes more, depending on the observation conditions of each  line, the possible speed of movement of enemy tanks and armored  personnel carriers [APC] on given terrain, and the preparedness  of gun crews. This distance between lines make it possible to  shift the fire of the artillery battalion from one line to the  next in a timely manner.    Creeping barrage fire on each avenue of likely tank approach  is given the name of predatory beasts such as, "Lion" and  "Tiger," and each line is numbered in order beginning with the  far line--"Lion-1," "Lion-2," and so forth.    The frontage of a battalion's creeping barrage is set  depending on the battalion's composition (not more than 25  meters per gun).    Fire is opened at the moment the lead tank (APC) approaches  the first (far) line and delivered until the bulk of the tanks  (APC's) leaves the impact area, after which fire is shifted to  the next line. If the axis of attack of enemy tanks deviates  from the prepared creeping barrage fire lines, the battalion  commander makes the necessary adjustments and continues  delivering fire on this line or shifts fire to the next line.    The enemy attack will usually be carried out by tanks  jointly  with infantry, which will advance on APC's (infantry fighting  vehicles [IFV's]) or on foot behind the tanks. After the main  group of tanks leaves the zone of fire on the last creeping  barrage fire line, the mission of artillery is to cut the  infantry off from the tanks, which can be accomplished with fire  of the same density as in delivering the creeping barrage.  Considering that there may be insufficient artillery in a  defensive situation to cover the forward edge with fire of this  density, a fixed barrage fire is planned in the immediate  proximity of the forward edge of the battle area. In this case,  the battalion's fire is shifted from the last creeping barrage  fire line to the prepared fixed barrage fire line. Let us  determine the possible ammunition expenditure for each creeping  barrage fire line.    From the line of deployment into platoon columns, enemy  tanks  deploy into battle formation as they approach the forward edge.  When there are five tanks per platoon, the depth of a platoon  column will be 150-200 meters. Advancing at a speed of 12-15  km/hr (200-250 meters per minute), the tanks cover this distance  (150-200 meters) in roughly one minute. During this time a crew  of 122-mm howitzers is able to fire six rounds, and a crew of a  152-mm howitzer four rounds. Under the pressure of the  battalion's fire on the lines, the attacking tanks may slow down  their movement somewhat; therefore, the time of delivering fire  against them may be increased to 1.5 minutes. In this time, up  to nine 122-mm howitzer shells and six 152-mm howitzer shells  may be expended on each line, which will be an average of 0.1  units of fire. This expenditure of shells can be taken as the  standard for determining a battalion's capabilities and the  ammunition expenditure to carry out assigned fire missions.    In an offensive to repel counterattacks of enemy tanks and  motorized infantry, fire is continued even after the enemy tanks  pass, cutting off the infantry from them. In this case, it is  advisable to designate the last line at a safe distance from  friendly forward subunits.    When preparing a creeping barrage during the course of  battle, the artillery battalion commander, at the direction of  the battalion (regimental) commander or on his own initiative,  determines on the terrain the axis of attack (counterattack) of  enemy tanks, plots out the first line, and determines the  coordinates of the right and left points (using a rangefinder,  bilateral observation, or a different method) and the average  height, after which he gives the command and plots the location  of the creeping barrage on the map. Fire on the second line, and  also on the third if necessary, is similarly prepared.    A fixed barrage (Figure 2) is employed to repel an  attack (counterattack) by enemy infantry and tanks directly in  front of the forward edge (in front of the forward subunits) of  own troops. It is prepared by lines no closer than 300 meters  from the forward edge (forward subunits) when personnel are in  shelters, and no closer than 400 meters when they are in the  open.    Each fixed barrage line is named for trees such as "Acacia"  or "Birch" and denoted on work maps by the initial letters of  the names of the corresponding trees--"A," "B."    The frontage of an artillery battalion's fixed barrage  depends on its composition (not more than 50 meters per gun).    Preparation of fixed barrage fire against tree lines, hill  crests, trenches, and the outskirts of populated areas should be  avoided. This is explained by the fact that enemy infantry  initiating an attack or counterattack can be detected only at  the moment they exit the woods, come out from behind a hill,  leave the trenches, or come out from the outskirts of the  populated area. Some 60-70 seconds will pass from the time the  attacking (counterattacking) enemy is detected and until the  rounds impact on the fixed barrage line. In this time the enemy  will be able to cover 120-150 meters, and the fire prepared  against the tree line or outskirts of the populated area will  inevitably be late.    Consequently, fixed barrage lines must be prepared on  terrain  150-200 meters from the tree line, outskirts of the populated  area, hill crest, or trenches in the direction of the expected  enemy movement.    Fire is opened at the moment the attacking  (counterattacking)  infantry approaches the fixed barrage line at a distance in  which the time it takes the infantry to cover corresponds to the  flight time of a shell, and volley fire is delivered. Volley  fire is delivered until the infantry is cut off from the tanks  or leaves the impact area.    Infantry which is halted (has hit the dirt) is engaged as an  observed stationary target.    Enemy infantry going around the prepared fixed barrage line  is engaged by making a general adjustment for all batteries and  shifting fire to the new axis of its attack (counterattack). To  repel an enemy attack (counterattack) in a direction where a  fixed barrage was not planned, preparation of the fixed barrage  is conducted immediately before firing, just as for a creeping  barrage.          Concentrated Fire is fire delivered simultaneously  by several batteries (battalions) on one target (Figure 3). This  type of fire is employed to engage tactical offensive nuclear  weapons, personnel and firing weapons in strong points and  concentration areas, command and command-observation posts,  artillery and mortar batteries, subunit columns, and other  observed and unobserved targets. For engaging unobserved targets  with concentrated battalion fire, the size of the target (taking  into account the fire capabilities) should not exceed the  maximum indicated in the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures.    A battalion may use the following methods of shelling  targets: overlapping fire by batteries; scaled by batteries; and  allocation of sectors (groups) of targets among batteries.    When using overlapping fire by batteries, all batteries open  fire simultaneously at different range settings relative to the  target (target center). After expending the designated amount of  shells, range settings are changed in the sequence indicated in  Table 1.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1. Sequence of Changing Range Settings When a Battalion Fires on a S-|  |ingle Target Using Overlapping Battery Fire                                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Battery's Number  |Order of Changing Range Settings                        |  |in the Battalion  |                                                        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |First Setting     |Second Setting    |Third Setting     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1st Battery       |P - DP            |P                 |P + DP            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2d Battery        |P                 |P + DP            |P - DP            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3d Battery        |P + DP            |P - DP            |P                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: P is the calculated range settings on target (target center); DP is  |  |the amount of range bound.                                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      This method of shelling ensures a more uniform distribution  of shell bursts throughout the target area.    When batteries fire by scale, all batteries also open fire  simultaneously at different range settings with respect to the  target (target center) and deliver fire until a designated  number of shells have been expended without changing range  settings. This method of shelling is used when overlapping  battery fire cannot be used; namely: when engaging enemy columns  (due to the short time of the bombardment and the lack of time  to change settings); when firing shells with a time fuse (due to  the complexity in setting the fuse); and also when delivering  volley fire by rocket artillery. When firing by scale, range  settings are accomplished in accordance with the Gunnery and  Fire Control Procedures: 1st Battery--P - DP; 2d Battery--P; 3d  Battery--P + DP.    Firing with allocation of target areas among the batteries  is  used when the size of a stationary unobserved target exceeds the  maximum size specified in the Gunnery and Fire Control  Procedures for engagement by concentrated fire using overlapping  battery fire or firing by scale.    When firing for effect as part of an artillery battalion and  when firing independently, a battery delivers fire at three  range settings (except when firing shells with a time fuse) and  at one or two azimuth settings. Fire is delivered at two  azimuth settings if the sheaf interval exceeds 25 meters when  engaging covered and armored targets and 50 meters when engaging  open, unarmored targets.    When firing for effect by the battalion and battery, the  following are designated: a range bound (scale value)  corresponding to one-third the depth of the target rounded  downward to whole elevation micrometer scale units; a sheaf  interval equal to the target frontage divided by the number of  guns in a battery.    Stationary observed multiple targets are neutralized or  annihilated by battalion or battery fire, designating the size  and order of target shelling in accordance with the Gunnery and  Fire Control Procedures.    Enemy personnel and fire weapons under cover located in  observed platoon strong points are engaged by the fire of at  least two batteries. Shelling methods are designated, based on  the actual size of the targets, by overlapping battery fire or  with allocation of target areas among batteries. The disposition  of fire weapons in a platoon strong point will to a considerable  extent depend on the terrain relief and also on their use in the  fire plan. Part of the terrain will prove to be unsuitable for  positioning fire weapons and preparing trenches. Consequently,  individual targets in a strong point will be disposed unevenly,  which will make it possible to specify two or three of the most  important targets (for example, infantry squads with their fire  weapons at positions or the location of a company  command-observation post) and allocate them for engagement among  battalion batteries. The size of each group of targets and the  coordinates of their areas are determined for the batteries  based on available reconnaissance data. Mechanical division of  the strong point into equal parts according to the number of  batteries involved is not permissible. This circumstance  imposes a special responsibility on battalion and battery  commanders in organizing reconnaissance and determining the real  location of target groups. Delivery of fire by batteries on  groups of targets in a platoon strong point makes it possible to  adjust the fire of each battery, especially for the first  volleys in bombardments, which considerably increases the  effectiveness of firing.    Successive fire concentration--single, double, or  triple--is used for supporting an attack or counterattack of  motorized-rifle and tank subunits and units (Figure 4). It  involves neutralizing enemy personnel and fire weapons on the  front and on the flanks of attacking subunits by concentrated  fire successively shifted against targets in the enemy's depth.    For successive fire concentration, targets are designated  beginning at the forward edge of the enemy's positions and to  the depth of first-echelon battalions and more; observed targets  are designated directly on the ground, and unobserved targets  according to reconnaissance data and the map. These targets  include platoon strong points, antitank weapons, radars,  command-observation posts, and observation posts.    The planned targets are connected by lines. One line  pertains  to targets located roughly the same distance from the forward  edge. The distance between the lines may be from 300 to 1,000  meters. The lines are named after predatory beasts such as  "Lion," "Tiger," and so forth; the targets are given a  three-digit number, the first digit of which indicates the line  number, and the other two the number of the target on the line,  for example, 114, 115, 224, 225, and so forth. The line  designation is the signal for opening (shifting) fire against  all targets of a given line. A battalion is assigned one group  target (platoon strong point) or two-three single targets on  each successive fire concentration line. The size of the group  target should not exceed six hectares for battalions having up  to and including 100-mm guns and mortars of all calibers in  their inventory, and nine hectares for battalions with guns over  100-mm.    A battery delivers fire as part of the battalion or  independently. In independent delivery of fire, a battery is  assigned one target whose size does not exceed two and three  hectares, respectively, for the calibers indicated above.    Fire is opened against targets on the first successive fire  concentration line on a prearranged signal with the beginning of  movement of attacking subunits from the final coordination line  (actually, fire is continued against targets of the last  bombardment of the artillery preparation of the attack, if these  same targets are designated for neutralization in artillery  support of the attack). Without allowing a break in fire, it  continues until the tanks and motorized-rifle subunits reach a  safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells. Fire is  shifted to targets on the second line on the signal of the  battalion or regimental commander. Fire is also delivered  against targets on the second line until the attacking subunits  reach a safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells.  This sequence of shifting fire is maintained through the entire  depth of successive fire concentration.    The present-day defense is saturated with antitank weapons,  particularly ATGM's, which are staggered in depth. These weapons  are capable of engaging tanks and APC's at great distances. In  this regard, it is necessary to neutralize antitank weapons and  other targets not only directly in front of the attacking  subunits, but also at successive lines in depth. In such  conditions it is advisable to employ double (triple) successive  fire concentration, which is accomplished by two (three)  artillery groups.    The first artillery group delivers fire against targets  situated directly in front of the attacking subunits; the second  group does so against targets on the next deeper line, beginning  with the second line. When shifting the fire of the first  artillery group against targets on the second line, the second  artillery group shifts fire to targets on the third line.  Subsequent shifting of fire is accomplished in the same sequence.    Concentrated fire and fire against single targets,  particularly enemy antitank weapons, is planned and delivered  against targets between the successive fire concentration lines.          A rolling barrage--single or double--is used to  support an attack by tanks and motorized rifle subunits when the  enemy's defense has a dense network of trenches and connecting  passages that make it difficult to determine precisely the  location of strong points, and also when breaking through a  fortified area. A rolling barrage is a solid curtain of fire  sequentially shifted by lines ahead of the attacking subunits to  neutralize enemy personnel and fire weapons. It can be employed  in combination with other types of fire. Main and intermediate  lines are designated when planning a rolling barrage. The  distance between the main lines may be 300-1,000 meters  depending on the expected pace of the attack and the nature of  enemy defenses. The main lines are designated according to the  probable locations of enemy personnel and fire weapons: against  trenches, strong points, antitank weapon positions, and other  targets.    The first rolling barrage main line is planned, as a rule,  along the main line (along the first trench) of enemy resistance.    Intermediate rolling barrage lines are planned to neutralize  personnel and fire weapons located between the main lines and to  prevent the enemy from maneuvering by trenches and connecting  passages. The distance between the intermediate lines is 100-300  meters, depending on the nature of the enemy defenses, terrain  conditions, and the planned pace of the attack.    The battalion's sector of the rolling barrage is divided  into  battery sectors, the size of which is determined by figuring no  more than 15 meters for guns up to and including 100-mm caliber  and mortars of all calibers, and 25 meters for guns over 100-mm  caliber.    Fire is shifted from the main rolling barrage lines on the  command (signal) of the motorized rifle (tank) regiment  commander after the attacking subunits have reached a safe  distance from the impact area of our shells. The regimental  commander's signal is received directly by the commanders of  those artillery battalions that are delivering fire in this  regiment's offensive sector. Fire is shifted from the  intermediate lines on the command of artillery battalion  commanders at the end of the established time of delivering  fire, which is usually two-three minutes.    A double rolling barrage is delivered by two artillery  groups. The first group delivers fire just as in a single  rolling barrage; the second group does so only on the main  lines, beginning with the second line.    In order to preclude hitting friendly troops, the artillery  battalion commander must use the most accurate methods of  determining firing data and charges ensuring the least  dispersion, avoid switching from one charge to another and  firing charges of different lots, and deliver fire using  high-explosive fragmentation rounds for fragmentation effect. He  must continually observe friendly shellbursts, the location of  friendly forward subunits, and the signals of combined-arms  subunit commanders, particularly when delivering a successive  fire concentration and rolling barrage. He must cease or open  fire in a timely manner on the next line at the signal.    It is permissible to begin firing for effect without  registration with a high-explosive fragmentation round and a  round with a time fuse when determining settings based on  deliberate preparation of fire. Firing may also begin using data  of registration guns, and shifting fire from registration points  (targets) and delivering fire against targets located no closer  than 500 meters from friendly troops located outside of shelters  or in unarmored vehicles at a distance up to 10 km and no closer  than 700 meters at a distance of over 10 km, and no closer than  300 and 500 meters, respectively, from friendly troops located  in shelters (emplacements, tanks, and other armored vehicles).    Rocket artillery firing is permitted against targets located  no closer than 1,000 meters from friendly forward subunits.    If fire is delivered against a target in the course of  artillery support of the attack (counterattack) and during  battle in the depth of the enemy's defense, a safe distance from  the impact area of friendly shells is considered:    --400 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking in  dismounted formation;    --300 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking on  APC's;    --200 meters for tank subunits.  <H5>  Chapter 2. Command and Control of the Battalion </H5> <H5>  Essence and Procedure of Command and Control </H5>   Command and control of a battalion (battery) in combat are  the purposeful, practical activities of combined-arms and  artillery commanders, staffs, and political workers to maintain  high combat readiness, prepare combat operations of subunits,  and direct them in carrying out assigned missions. It must be  stable, continuous, and secure.    The basis of command and control of the artillery battalion  (battery) is the decision of the commander of the regiment  (battalion, company) of which it is a part (to which it is  attached or assigned for support) or the decision (order) of the  senior artillery commander (chief).    The commander of the regiment (battalion, company) is the  main organizer of the combat operations of organic, attached,  and supporting subunits. He bears personal responsibility for  their successful accomplishment of combat missions. He alone is  given the right to make the battle plan. In organizing combat,  the regiment (battalion, company) commander performs work during  the course of which he makes the decision, gives combat missions  to subordinate commanders, organizes cooperation, and carries  out measures to support combat operations and prepare subunits  to carry out combat missions.    Successful execution of missions in combat is possible  because of artillery commanders' and staffs' in-depth and  thorough knowledge of the fundamentals of combined-arms combat  and their duties; prompt execution of orders, instructions, and  commands; and also intelligent initiative and creative activity.    In complex, combat conditions, a commander must make  competent decisions in extremely short periods of time and be  able to implement them in combat. In order to make a sound  decision and, the main thing, implement it, it is necessary to  have firm practical training based on sound theoretical  knowledge.    Command and control of a battalion (battery) includes:  maintaining constant combat readiness and high political morale  of personnel; continuous collection and study of information  about the enemy; a firm knowledge of the location and status of  subordinate subunits and the mission being carried out by them;  timely decisionmaking and tasking of subordinates; maintaining  continuous cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) to  which the artillery battalion (battery) is attached or which it  is supporting; constant monitoring of accomplishment of assigned  missions and providing assistance to subunits; restoring the  combat effectiveness of subunits subjected to air (combat  helicopter) strikes, artillery fire, and the effects of weapons  of mass destruction.    Constant combat readiness of the battalion is maintained by  a  high state of training of personnel; cohesiveness of all  subunits; their ability to operate in the most difficult combat  situation conditions; the strength level of the subunits;  maintaining weapons, transport, communications equipment, and  reconnaissance and fire control instruments in serviceable  condition; and also constant technical and rear services support.    Modern combat requires high moral-political and  psychological  qualities and physical staunchness of personnel. Each soldier's  persistent personal responsibility, firm political conviction,  awareness, allegiance to the oath, and unshakable resolve in  carrying out a combat mission are qualities developed by the  daily life of the Soviet citizen, the systematic political  education of Army and Navy personnel, and their combat training.  Military indoctrination is the duty of commanders at all levels.    The battalion (battery) commander bears full  responsibility for prompt opening of fire and carrying out of  missions by subordinate subunits. He must always know the  position, status, and capabilities of subordinate subunits.    The battalion (battery) commander controls subunits by  issuing verbal combat orders and instructions, and also by  commands and signals.    A verbal combat order is issued simultaneously to all  commanders of subordinate subunits in the prescribed volume and  sequence, usually when there is sufficient time for preparation  of combat operations.    Combat instructions are issued to the commanders of subunits  involved in carrying out a mission. They contain the data  necessary to do this. Combat instructions are usually issued  when there is not enough time to prepare for combat operations  or in the course of combat. In addition, instructions assign  missions for reconnaissance, protection from weapons of mass  destruction, topogeodetic survey, and other types of combat  support.    Commands are issued to assign fire missions and to request,  adjust, shift, or cease fire. A signal is given to specify the  time for executing an assigned mission (the beginning of  artillery preparation, attack support, shelling, and so forth);  the beginning of planned actions (a movement or maneuver,  deployment into combat formation, and so forth); for maintaining  cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company); for warning  subunits; for reporting mission execution (crossing of control  lines, concentration in a designated area, and so forth).    The battalion (battery) commander deploys the command and  observation post in a location that provides the best  observation of the terrain, enemy, and actions of friendly  subunits and adjacent units, and ensures uninterrupted  cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) and command  and control of subunits and their fire. In all cases, the  command and observation post must stand out in the combat  formation of subunits waging combat, and it is necessary to use  protective terrain features skillfully for its disposition and  movement.    The command and observation post of the artillery battalion  (battery) assigned to support a regiment (battalion, company) or  attached to it is usually deployed jointly with the battalion  (company) command and observation post or near it. When the  artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post is  temporarily deployed a considerable distance from the battalion  (company) commander's command and observation post due to  situation conditions, communications with the latter is  accomplished by technical means or via a forward observation  post dispatched to it.    The command and observation post of an artillery battalion  assigned as standby is usually deployed near the observation  post of the artillery group (regiment). For most cooperation,  the command and observation posts of the batteries of a standby  battalion are deployed as close as possible to the command posts  of first-echelon combined-arms subunits.    For convenience of battalion fire control, it is advisable  to  assign one of the batteries as a standby and position its  command and observation post near that of the battalion.    The artillery battalion staff plays an important  role in preparing combat operations and ensuring firm and  continuous command and control of subunits in the course of  combat. It constantly works in close cooperation with the  battalion (regiment) staff and simultaneously carries out  instruction of the higher artillery staff.    The artillery battalion chief of staff is responsible for  organizing and maintaining continuous command and control of  subunits and timely preparation and accuracy of fire. He is  responsible for the following: knowing the position,  composition, and nature of operations of the enemy; the position  and mission of the battalion (regiment) to which he is attached  or which he is supporting and the position, status and  capabilities of the artillery battalion's subunits; planning the  artillery battalion's combat operations and disseminating  missions to the subunits; organizing comprehensive support of  the artillery battalion's combat operations; arranging the  determination of firing data and supervising the work of the  battalion's fire control post; directing the movement and  deployment into combat formation of fire subunits; organizing  stable communications and protection against electronic  countermeasures by the enemy and ensuring secure command and  control of subunits. In addition he must organize surveillance  of and warning about the air enemy and disseminate to subunits  the methods and signals for identifying friendly aircraft  (helicopters); monitor the readiness of subunits to carry out  assigned missions and the execution of instructions; inform  subunit commanders about the situation and keep track of  personnel, weapons and equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other  materiel, and, in addition, the radiation doses of personnel.  Paper work includes keeping a record of instructions and reports  issued and received; submitting reports to higher headquarters;  and studying past combat experience and disseminating it to  battalion personnel.    The artillery battalion commander determines the location of  the battalion staff. The staff usually travels at the head of  the battalion column when executing a march or when moving up to  the deployment area. After the battalion deploys into combat  formation, the staff is usually located in the vicinity of a  fire position of one of the batteries 300-500 meters from the  guns, deploying the battalion fire control post.    Restoring the combat effectiveness of subunits is one of the  most important duties of the artillery battalion and battery  commanders. It includes: restoring disrupted command and  control; ascertaining the degree of combat effectiveness of  subunits; detailing missions to subunits that have retained  combat effectiveness; withdrawing subunits from contaminated  zones and areas of destruction, fires, and flooding; providing  subunits with replacement personnel and replenishing their  weapons, equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies;  maintaining high political morale and psychological  steadfastness of personnel.    The combat effectiveness of those subunits that have  suffered  the fewest personnel and combat equipment losses is the first  restored.    Quick restoration of disrupted command and control is  possible by ordering a number of measures restored while  organizing combat operations. These measures include arranging  for one of the battery commanders to assume command and control  of the battalion; dispersal of command and observation posts;  establishing a procedure for battery commanders to enter the  radio net of the commanders of the artillery group and the  supported battalion (regiment); designating alternate radio  operating data; and other measures.    The battery command and observation post farthest from the  artillery battalion command and observation post is designated  in advance to assume command and control of the artillery  battalion in the event its command posts are knocked out. The  commander of this battery is provided the fire plan, radio  operating data, and the call signs of stations and officials. He  plots the necessary data for the battalion on his work map.    The battery commander assuming command and control of the  battalion must: notify battery commanders of assuming command  and control by the prescribed signal, and reporting the  coordinates of his command and observation post; receive reports  from battery commanders on their receipt of the signals,  coordinates of their observation posts and command and  observation posts, and information on the availability of guns  and ammunition; report to the senior artillery commander (chief)  on the assumption of command and control of the battalion, the  coordinates of his command and observation post, and, if  necessary, the status of subunits and data on the enemy;  establish cooperation with the battalion (regiment) commander;  and assign reconnaissance and fire missions to subunits. All  battery commanders in the artillery battalion must be ready to  assume command and control of the battalion.    During the course of combat, disrupted command and control  with subordinate subunits is restored immediately. The artillery  battalion commander (battery commander assuming command and  control of the battalion) first of all must find out and assess  the cause of disruption of command and control, and take steps  to restore it. They include: command and control of the fire  platoons of those batteries whose command and observation posts  have been knocked out; restoring the battery and fire platoon  command and observation posts put out of action by using other  subunits; moving command posts from contaminated zones or  shelling area to other places.    The battalion (battery) commander reports to the senior  commander (chief) on the results of the enemy's use of weapons  of mass destruction, the status and combat effectiveness of  subunits, and the steps taken to restore it.  <H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>   Preparation for the combat operations of a battalion  (battery) begins with the battalion (battery) commander's  receipt of the mission from the senior artillery commander  (chief).    The battalion commander fully briefs his deputies and the  chief of staff on the situation and the mission received.    The sequence (order) of the work of the commander, deputy  commander for political affairs, battalion staff, and battery  commanders for preparing for combat operations depends on the  mission received, the order of work of the battalion (company)  commander, and the time available. The artillery battalion  commander will have the most complete information with the  receipt of the combat order. It should also be taken into  account that the highly mobile conditions of modern combat and  rapidly changing situations will limit the time for preparing  for combat operations. In such conditions, subunit commanders  must use the sequence of work which would ensure preparation of  the subunits to carry out the mission in the designated time  period.    A variant of the sequence of work by officials for preparing  for combat operations of the artillery battalion (battery) is  given in Table 2.      <H5>    Decisionmaking </H5>   Making a decision that corresponds to the conditions of the  situation at hand is possible only on the basis of a thorough  clarification of the mission received and comprehensive  assessment of the situation.    The artillery (battery) commander clarifies the mission  while  it is being received and plots it on the map. In doing so, he  must understand: the combat mission and the concept of the  commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the  battalion (battery) is attached or which it is supporting; the  missions being carried out by assets of the senior commander  (chief) on the axis of operations of the combined-arms unit  (subunit); the missions of adjacent units and the procedure for  cooperation with them; the missions of the battalion (battery)  for fire engagement of the enemy, and the areas of observation  posts and command and observation posts; the base line of fire  and the methods of determining range and azimuth settings for  most effective firing; the time and order for the battalion  (battery) to move to the designated area and the order of  maneuver during the course of combat; and the readiness time for  carrying out the mission.    As a result of clarification of the mission, the artillery  battalion (battery) commander determines the measures that must  be carried out immediately and gives instructions for their  execution. When calculating time, he determines how much total  time is available to prepare the battalion for combat  operations, including daylight time. He plans the primary  measures for preparing subunits and the time periods for  carrying them out, taking into account measures being carried  out by the senior artillery commander (chief) and the battalion  (company) commander. Variants of calculating the time by the  artillery battalion commander are given in the tactical examples.    Experience shows that it is advisable to record the planned  measures and timing in a special tablet, in a notebook, or on  the back of the work map. The planned sequence of carrying out  measures is tentative. Necessary updates are made as the  situation changes.    When organizing preparation of subunits for combat  operations, the artillery battalion commander indicates to the  chief of staff the following: measures for preparing personnel,  armament, equipment, and ammunition; the order of replenishing  supplies; the time and order of work to organize combat  operations on the terrain; and other measures which must be  conducted for the most rapid preparation of the subunits.    The artillery battalion commander (chief of staff) tasks the  battalion. He assigns tasks of organizing reconnaissance of the  enemy to the battalion intelligence officer (the battery  commander tasks the headquarters platoon commander). He tasks  the chief of the artillery reconnaissance group for  reconnaissance of the fire position area.    In assessing the situation, the battalion (battery)  commander  must determine the effect of each element of the situation  individually and together as he assesses the accomplishment of  the mission; he also must establish what must be done to  eliminate or lessen the effect of negative factors.    The information, subject to assessment, is often incomplete  and frequently contradictory. It should be taken into account  that the available information on the situation may prove to be  outdated in a short time. Therefore, the battalion (battery)  commander must be constantly concerned about receiving new  information.    When assessing the situation, the battalion (battery)  commander must study the enemy's position, composition, and  possible nature of his actions, and the position, status, fire  capabilities, and state of supply of battalion (battery)  subunits; take into account the position and missions of  adjacent artillery subunits, the nature of the terrain and its  effect on the combat operations of the battalion (battery), the  radiation, chemical, and biological situation, the weather, the  time of day, and season of the year.    From the assessment of each situation element, the battalion  (battery) commander determines the following basic conclusions  to be used for the best preparation of the battalion (battery)  for accomplishing the assigned mission:    --From the assessment of the enemy: reconnaissance missions,  additional fire missions, and measures for protection against  weapons of mass destruction;    --From the assessment of the position and status of the  battalion (battery): measures for preparing equipment,  instruments, communications equipment, and primary artillery  movers, and for replenishing stores of ammunition and other  supplies; the ability of the battalion subunits to carry out  fire missions with the amount of ammunition issued in the  prescribed time, taking into account the maximum rate of fire;    --From the assessment of the terrain: battery fire position  areas, sites for the battery and battalion command and  observation posts, and also the conditions of performing  topogeodetic preparation; places difficult to negotiate on the  movement routes or when executing a march; detours of areas of  destruction and obstacles; the order of engineer preparation of  fire positions and command and observation post sites, and  measures for camouflage, local security, and self-defense;    --From the assessment of the radiation, chemical, and  biological situation: the degree of combat effectiveness of the  battalion (battery) depending on the received and expected  radiation doses and the degree of contamination, and also  measures for protecting battalion personnel;    --According to the weather, time of day, and season of the  year: measures for warming up personnel, maintaining access  routes to the fire positions in a passable state, preparing fire  platoons for delivering fire and command and observation  (observation) posts for conducting reconnaissance and fire  control at night.    Based on the clarification of the mission and assessment of  the situation, the battalion commander specifies in his  decision: the distribution of batteries for support of  combined-arms subunits; fire missions for batteries, fire  position areas and command and observation sites, and the time  and order of occupying them and moving during the course of  combat; basic measures for comprehensive support of combat  operations; and organization of command and control.  <H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>   As the experience of the Great Patriotic War indicates, one  of the conditions of successful accomplishment of assigned  missions in combat is reliable knowledge of the terrain and the  ability of commanders to orient themselves on it quickly and  accurately.    The diversity of situation conditions (type of combat,  battalion position, nature of the terrain, operating procedures  of the combined-arms and senior artillery commander or chief,  availability of time, and so forth) results in different  operating procedures of commanders on the terrain.    When working on the terrain, the artillery battalion  (battery) commander usually participates in the work of the  senior artillery commander (chief) or the commander of the  regiment (battalion, company) which the artillery battalion has  been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He  also works on the terrain independently with subordinate  commanders. During the course of the senior artillery  commander's (chief's) reconnaissance, the artillery battalion  commander must study the terrain carefully. He must make clear  the names of local features and reference points, the targets to  be engaged by battalion fire and other subunits in the zone of  operations of the supported battalion (regiment). The combat  mission assignment for commanders of the battalion (regiment),  an artillery battalion assigned as a standby battalion, or the  artillery group commander must clearly indicate if he is left  directly subordinate to the regimental commander.    After being assigned the mission from the senior artillery  commander (chief), the artillery battalion (battery) commander  must report at the designated time to the commander of the  regiment (battalion, company) which the battalion (battery) has  been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He  must report the following: the composition, position, status,  and state of supply of the artillery battalion (battery); the  missions received and the established ammunition expenditure,  the fire capabilities of the artillery battalion (battery), the  designated areas for the fire positions and command and  observation posts, and the time and order of occupying them; the  order of movement (maneuver) during the course of combat; and  the readiness time for opening fire. He must also be ready to  answer any question the battalion (company) commander may have  regarding the employment of the artillery battalion (battery) in  combat. (Variants of the artillery battalion commander's  report are given in the tactical examples.)    The artillery battalion (battery) commander arrives at the  designated location promptly to participate in the regimental  (battalion, company) commander's work. Experience shows that in  offensive operations beginning in the assembly area, it is  advisable to begin work on organizing cooperation in the  assembly area, and then on the terrain in the course of  commander's reconnaissance. In offensive operations beginning  with direct contact with the enemy or when shifting to the  defense, it is desirable that the artillery battalion commander  participate in the regimental (battalion) commander's  reconnaissance at the start. When participating in the  regimental (battalion) commander's reconnaissance, the artillery  battalion commander receives his tasks and instructions on  cooperation from the regimental commander.    The artillery battalion commander independently conducts  reconnaissance only if there is enough time. It includes the  intelligence and signal officers and battery commanders. In  favorable situation conditions, the chief of staff may also be  involved in the commander's reconnaissance.    Considering that an extremely limited amount of time will be  allotted to organizing combat operations in modern combat, the  artillery battalion commander will usually combine his work on  the terrain and that of his subordinate commanders with the work  of the battalion (regiment) commander, that is, conduct it in  parallel. In doing so, the battery commanders and other  battalion officers, located near the reconnaissance group of the  combined-arms commander, study the terrain and fire missions and  organize their work at the direction of the artillery battalion  commander.    The organization of combat operations when shifting from a  defensive to an offensive operation, following the necessary  regrouping, can be accomplished when the battalion has deployed  into combat formation and is carrying out fire missions. In this  case, the artillery battalion commander usually involves only  the commanders of batteries assigned to support companies in the  commander's reconnaissance as preparation for carrying out the  new mission.    For successful accomplishment of a large amount of work on  the terrain to organize combat operations, the artillery  battalion plans in advance the composition of the group, the  location and time of work, and issues to be resolved at each  location, and prepares data for assigning missions (issuing the  combat order) to subunits and for updating cooperation  procedures.  <H5>  Assignment of Missions to Subunits </H5>   After the commander's reconnaissance, the artillery  battalion  (battery) commander indicates the following in the combat order  when assigning missions:    In the first paragraph--brief conclusions from the  assessment of the enemy and the nature of his actions;    In the second paragraph--the mission of the  regiment (battalion, company), missions of adjacent units, and  boundaries with them;    In the third paragraph--the objectives (targets)  to be engaged by assets of senior commanders (chiefs) on the  regiment's (battalion's, company's) axis of operations, and  safety limits;    In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the  artillery battalion or battery (place in the artillery grouping  and who it is supporting), the base line of fire, method of  determining azimuth and range settings for firing for effect,  and the order of moving to contact, deployment, and changing  position in the course of combat;    In the fifth paragraph after the words "I  order"--the missions for the batteries (platoons);    In the sixth paragraph--ammunition expenditure;    In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for  carrying out the mission;    In the eighth paragraph--the location of the  artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post and  the battalion fire control post; who is to assume command and  control of the artillery battalion (battery) in the event the  command and observation post is knocked out.    Before issuing the combat order on the terrain, the  artillery  battalion (battery) commander indicates the prearranged name  designations of local features and reference points, if they  were not indicated earlier.    Immediately after assigning missions, the artillery  battalion  commander updates the procedures for maintaining cooperation  with combined-arms subunits. By giving directions and listening  to subordinates, he makes sure battery commanders understand the  order of accomplishment of the combat mission by tank and  motorized rifle subunits and the fire missions for supporting  them in the course of combat.    The experience of the Great Patriotic War showed that  coordinated actions of subunits of various branches of troops  made it possible to carry out combat missions with the least  loss.    In organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion  commander (chief of staff) tasks subordinates for comprehensive  support of combat operations, organizing communications, and  political work by separate instructions. Comprehensive support  of combat operations is broken down into combat (artillery  reconnaissance; protection against weapons of mass destruction;  camouflage; engineer support; chemical support; topogeodetic,  meteorological, and ballistic preparation for firing; and local  security), technical, and rear services support.    In the course of combat, missions are disseminated to the  subunits by field instructions, in which the artillery battalion  (battery) commander usually indicates: brief information about  the enemy; the combat mission of the battalion (company); the  mission of the battery (platoon) and the time of readiness for  carrying it out; and, if necessary, other data.  <H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>   The artillery battalion staff plans the battalion's combat  operations based on the missions received from the senior  artillery commander (chief) or battalion (regiment) commander  and the instructions of the artillery battalion commander.    Planning combat operations includes planning and scheduling  fire, maneuver, and comprehensive support of the battalion's  combat operations.    Planning and scheduling fire of the artillery  battalion is accomplished by periods (missions) of fire  engagement of the enemy. When planning and scheduling fire,  the battalion staff determines the volume of fire missions;  updates the position and size of observed targets on the  terrain; calculates the fire capabilities of the batteries and  allocates fire missions among the batteries; determines the  coordinates of targets and aiming points of the batteries for  engaging group targets, taking into account the specific  disposition of individual targets; establishes the sequence and  order of execution of fire missions by batteries; determines  ammunition expenditure by each type of target and methods of  shelling; draws up a battalion fire plan and disseminates  excerpts from it to the batteries; determines the firing data  for artillery battalions and prepares a table of the computed  data.    Fire missions are allocated among the batteries taking into  account their fire capabilities, the disposition and firing  range of batteries, the least expenditure of rounds for given  conditions, and the possibility of observing and adjusting  battery fire. Planning and scheduling of fire is constantly  updated as new reconnaissance information on the enemy and new  fire missions are received.    When planning a maneuver, the artillery battalion  staff determines: the order of movement toward contact and the  deployment of the battalion into combat formation; new fire  position areas, and the route and order of relocating to them;  the time needed for the relocation and the times of readiness to  carry out the missions at the new areas; lines for beginning the  relocation and readiness (if not indicated by the senior  commander); the order of relocating battalion and battery  command and observation posts; deployment lines and the order of  relocating artillery reconnaissance subunits.    Planning comprehensive support of the combat  operations of the artillery battalion includes planning  reconnaissance, protection against weapons of mass destruction,  camouflage, engineer and chemical support, topogeodetic,  meteorological and ballistic preparation, local security, and  technical, logistical and medical support.    The results of planning combat operations are reflected on  the work maps, in the combat order and instructions of the  artillery battalion commander and staff, and in other documents  listed in Table 3.

Every officer keeps a work map both when  preparing combat operations and in the course of them. All the  data necessary for carrying out assigned missions is plotted on  the work map.    The following is plotted on the work map of the artillery  battalion commander (chief of staff): the disposition of enemy  forces and assets; the composition, position, and combat  missions of the combined-arms subunit (unit) to the extent  necessary for cooperation; missions being carried out by assets  of the senior commander (chief) and other artillery subunits in  the interests of the supported subunit (unit); the command post  of the senior artillery commander (chief); the fire positions of  the battalion and batteries, indicating target numbers; planned  (prepared) fire position areas and command and observation post  sites; the base line of fire; reference points; lines, points,  and positions of attached artillery reconnaissance assets; the  maximum and minimum firing range for each fire position area;  the routes and order of moving to contact, deployment,  relocation, and maneuver; safety lines; control, warning, and  coordinating signals; areas of destruction, obstruction, and  fires; sectors of flooding; and zones of radioactive, chemical,  and bacteriological contamination. The call signs of  communications operating stations (centers) and officials, and  signals are recorded on the map; a record of the expenditure and  availability of ammunition is kept.    The fire plan is drawn up by the artillery  battalion staff as a separate document, both in an offensive and  a defensive situation. Excerpts from the fire plan are given to  the battery commanders.    The table of computed battalion firing data is  compiled and constantly kept up by the artillery battalion staff  (battalion fire control post) during preparations for and in the  course of combat operations. This document enables the chief of  staff to monitor the correctness of computed firing data  calculation in the batteries for all planned and unplanned  targets.    The range card [landmarks only] is intended for  facilitating study of the terrain, orienting on it, and target  designation, and for convenience of assigning missions (Figure  6). It is compiled by the intelligence officer (headquarters  platoon commander, reconnaissance squad commander).          The log of instructions and reports issued and  received is kept to record all instructions issued by the  commander and chief of staff to the commanders of subordinate  subunits for preparing to conduct combat operations, all  instructions received from the senior commander (staff), and  also reports transmitted to higher headquarters. The format of  the log and an example of how it is filled out are shown in  Table 4.    Table 4.

Communications by radio is the main, and in many cases the  only, means of command and control of battalion subunits in  modern combat when conducting combat operations. Radio  communications in the battalion, taking into account the  availability of forces and assets, are organized by radio nets  and radio links.    Landline communications, as a rule, are organized as a  defensive system, when preparing an offensive move, and when  disposed at a site. This type of communication is convenient for  conversing, is relatively secure compared to radio  communications, and almost completely precludes enemy jamming.    Mobile communications are used in all types of combat  operations of the artillery battalion for the purpose of  relaying verbal and written instructions and reports and are  accomplished by transport and messengers available in the  battalion.    Flares, lanterns, handflags, sirens, and other means are  used  as signal devices for warning subunits and relaying commands.    Communications equipment in the battalion must be used  comprehensively and ensure the reliability, speed, timeliness,  and security of transmission in any situation.    Available UHF radios in the battalion with a wide range of  frequencies ensure maintaining communications with the UHF  radios of commanders of motorized rifle and tank subunits.    In addition, the artillery battalion commander and chief of  staff and battery commanders must constantly maintain  communications with the senior artillery commander (chief),  subordinate commanders, and artillery reconnaissance subunits.    One of the battalion's radios periodically comes up on the  meteorological support radio net in accordance with the schedule  for meteorological message broadcast to receive meteorological  data.    A variant of a battalion radio communications diagram is  shown in Figure 7.          In organizing radio communications when there is a limited  radio equipment available, it is advisable to set up radio nets  with a larger number of command posts (of commanders), that is,  shift from communications via radio links to communications via  a radio net.    The artillery battalion command and observation post's  landline communications with battery command and observation  posts, the fire control post, and forward (lateral) observation  posts are organized by links by the battalion's forces and  assets.    Depending on the type of combat, the battalion's  communications equipment is deployed by decision of the  battalion commander at the location of the battalion command and  observation post or fire control post. The battery command and  observation posts and the battalion fire control post  communicate with the gun platoons over lines laid by the forces  and assets of the batteries. Landline communications between the  artillery battalion command and control post and the maneuver  battalion command and control post are accomplished via maneuver  battalion and artillery battalion switchboards over a connecting  line laid by the forces and assets of the artillery battalion.  This makes it possible to have alternative communications links  both in the interests of the maneuver battalion and in the  interests of the artillery battalion.    A variant of a landline communications diagram is shown in  Figure 8.          Organizing and maintaining stable communications in a combat  situation are the most important duties of the artillery  battalion commander and staff. The artillery battalion commander  determines with whom and by what time to establish  communications, taking into account the mission assigned. In  combat, the artillery battalion commander must have constant and  reliable communications with subordinate subunits, regardless of  the location.    The chief of staff supervises communications in the  artillery  battalion; he is responsible for its timely organization and  continuous command and control of battalion subunits. The  artillery battalion signal officer directly organizes  communications and is responsible for its stable operation in  the battalion; the headquarters platoon commander does this in  the battery. Based on the decision of the artillery battalion  commander and the communications instructions from higher  headquarters, the chief of staff issues instructions on  organizing communications, in which he indicates the following:    --To the battalion signal officer: information on the enemy  and the battalion's mission; the location of the command  (observation) post of the senior artillery commander and the  direction of its relocation; the locations of the command and  observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the  combined-arms subunit, the attached (assigned for servicing)  artillery reconnaissance subunit, and the battalion fire control  post and battery fire positions; with whom, by what time, and by  what means to establish communications; restrictions in the  operation of radio and landline communications equipment and  operating procedures of radio equipment; and measures for  protecting communications from enemy electronic countermeasures.    --To the subunit commanders: with whom, by what time, and by  what means to establish communications; the call signs of  communications stations and officials; radio operating data and  restrictions in the operation of radio and landline  communications equipment; operating procedures of radio  equipment; and the procedure and times for charging batteries.    During the course of combat operations, the chief of staff  updates organization of battalion communications, taking into  account situation changes and communications equipment losses.    The battalion signal officer must constantly know the  battalion's combat mission, the locations of the command and  observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the  senior artillery commander (chief), and the maneuver battalion  (regiment) commander, the battalion fire control post (staff),  and the battery fire platoons; promptly plan the organization of  communications; task subordinates; supervise the deployment of  communications equipment; ensure protection of radio  communications against jamming; and monitor the work of  personnel for observing secure command and control procedures,  and the status and maintenance of communications equipment.  <H5>  Checking the Readiness of Subunits </H5>   One of the most important elements of the work of the  artillery battalion commander and chief of staff and battery  commander is checking the readiness of subunits for carrying out  the assigned mission. This readiness check must be thoroughly  thought out, conducted in a timely manner, and combined with  practical assistance to subordinate commanders in carrying out  the tasks facing them and in eliminating detected shortcomings.  It is planned and accomplished both in the organization and in  the course of combat operations and must contribute to the  timely and precise execution of fire missions.    In accomplishing the readiness check, the artillery  battalion  commander checks the battery and headquarters platoon  commanders' knowledge of the prearranged name designations of  local features and reference points; the combat missions of  combined-arms subunits, and battery fire missions; organization  of reconnaissance in the battalion and batteries; preparation of  the command and observation post for conducting reconnaissance  and fire control at night; the drawing up and keeping up of the  necessary combat documents; senior battery officers' knowledge  of the fire missions; correctness of calculating computed firing  data for assigned targets by comparing the data of the battalion  chief of staff with the data of the batteries; the quality of  technical and ballistic preparation, topogeodetic survey,  engineer preparation and camouflage of fire positions;  preparation of fire platoons to deliver fire at night and in  conditions of limited visibility; provisions of ammunition,  fuel, and other supplies; organization of communications, local  security, and self-defense; and also knowledge of prearranged  control, warning, and coordinating signals.    When checking the organization of local security and  self-defense, the knowledge of personnel of warning signals and  the practical actions of gun crews at these signals are checked.  <H5>  Battalion Fire Control </H5>   Fire engagement of the enemy is the basis of the artillery  battalion's combat operations. Therefore, battalion fire control  is one of the most important duties of the battalion commander  and staff.    Battalion fire control must ensure timely engagement of  targets with high effectiveness. It includes: receiving fire  missions (selection of targets for engagement); clarifying fire  missions and conditions for executing them; making decisions for  executing fire missions; assigning fire missions to subunits and  monitoring their execution.    The battalion commander uses the personnel of the command  and  observation post located in the command vehicle or on the  terrain for fire control. The accommodation of personnel,  instruments, and communications equipment of a command and  observation post located on the terrain must be convenient,  ensure a view of the forward terrain in the assigned  reconnaissance zone to as great a depth as possible, and provide  good camouflage. Command and observation posts can be situated  in trenches, in tall trees, in bushes, in attics and on upper  floors of industrial and residential buildings, and in other  places.    When conducting mobile combat operations in the course of an  offensive, in a meeting engagement, and when pursuing the enemy,  battalion and battery command and observation posts and also the  battalion forward command post are situated in vehicles, that  is, the command and observation posts become mobile, which makes  it possible to more reliably maintain continuous cooperation  with the battalion (company), control fire, and preserve  survivability. When the command and observation post is deployed  on the terrain, a vehicle is positioned close to it in a natural  or prepared shelter. A variant of positioning a battalion  command and observation post on the terrain is shown in Figure 9.          The timeliness in preparation for firing, particularly  unscheduled firing, is achieved by advance distribution of  functional duties among the personnel of the command and  observation post and battalion fire control post, commanders,  and battery senior officers and plotters, and also by precise  execution of these duties.    When controlling firing, the battalion (battery) commander  must know the situation, the combat strength, position, supply  status, and firing capabilities of subordinate subunits, the  operating procedures and capabilities of automation equipment  and other fire control, reconnaissance, and fire servicing  equipment; personally conduct enemy reconnaissance, conduct  registration fire, and monitor the course of combat and firing  results; quickly accept (update) decisions for executing fire  missions; in a timely manner assign fire missions to subordinate  subunits, give commands (signals) to request (open), shift, and  cease fire; monitor execution of fire missions; report to the  senior commander (chief) on the execution of fire missions, the  opening and ceasing of firing against targets, and ammunition  expenditure; be ready, if necessary, to assume fire control of  the artillery group (battalion) of which the battalion (battery)  is a part; and take steps for immediate restoration of disrupted  command and control.    Missions being carried out by artillery fire are called fire  missions. They may be scheduled or unscheduled.    Scheduled fire mission--the target has been  reconnoitered; target coordinates and size have been determined;  the mission has been assigned to the batteries; and the settings  for the target have been calculated and recorded in the tables  of calculated settings and with the gun commanders. The nature  of the target and ammunition expenditure may be updated before  execution of the fire mission.    Unscheduled fire mission--the target has just been  reconnoitered or was reconnoitered earlier, but has not been  assigned to the battalion for engagement; the mission is  assigned by the senior commander or the decision to execute it  is made by the artillery battalion commander immediately before  engagement of the target.    It is obvious from the conditions of executing these  missions  that the artillery battalion spends considerably less time on  opening fire against a scheduled target than against an  unscheduled target.    Timely engagement of targets in the interests of supporting  combined-arms subunits in the course of combat is achieved by  the speed of deployment of the battalion in an unprepared area  and of preparing fires against the targets.    In making the decision for execution of an unscheduled fire  mission, the artillery battalion commander selects the most  important targets to engage for the success of the combat  mission being carried out by the supported combined-arms  subunit. Correct target selection and determination of the  moment (time) for to begin its engagement are possible only with  continuous monitoring of enemy and friendly troop operations.    In his decision, the artillery battalion commander specifies  (clarifies): the targets (target), the objective of the firing,  and the open (readiness) and cease-fire times; the number of  batteries, platoons, or guns involved in firing on each target;  the type of fire; the methods of fire; the shell, fuse, charge,  and type of trajectory; the order of executing fire missions;  the method of determining settings for firing for effect; the  assets to be used for adjusting fire; shell expenditure; safety  measures for friendly troops; and signals for requesting  (opening), shifting, and ceasing fire.    The artillery battalion commander and staff check the  readiness for executing fire missions and firing for effect.    When checking the readiness for executing fire missions,  they  check subordinates' knowledge of their fire missions and the  order of executing them, the correctness of determining settings  for firing for effect, and the designation of the method of  firing on the targets. Checking firing for effect involves  checking the timeliness of opening (shifting) fire, ending fire  on a target, adjusting fire in the course of firing for effect,  expenditure of the designated amount of shells, and  determination of the results of firing for effect.  <H5>  Chapter 3. Political Work in the Artillery Battalion </H5>   The entire history and combat experience of the Soviet Armed  Forces convincingly indicates that success in conducting combat  operations depends decisively on the high political-moral state,  psychological steadfastness, and combat skills of personnel.  Political work plays a most important role in instilling these  traits.    "...There is no laxity in the Army, its order and spirit is  better, and there are more victories...where political work is  conducted most importantly."[.sup]1[/]    Political work is a component part of preparing and  conducting combat operations. In the combat situation, it aims  at firm and consistent implementation of the policy of the  Communist Party in the Armed Forces, strengthening the  political-moral state and conscious discipline, skillful mastery  of weapons and combat equipment, improving military proficiency  of personnel, ensuring high combat readiness and combat  effectiveness of the artillery battalion, and mobilization of  artillerymen for successful execution of combat orders and  missions.    A most important task of political work in the combat  situation is educating personnel in a spirit of selfless  devotion to their people, the motherland, the Communist Party  and the Soviet Government, the cause of communism, allegiance to  military duty, unshakable determination to carry out the  assigned mission, and constant readiness to fight selflessly and  give every effort, and one's life if necessary, for the sake of  victory over the enemy.    The saturation of enemy combat formations with  high-precision  and mobile weapons, particularly antitank weapons, makes it  necessary to hit them in short periods of time. It is advisable  to engage these weapons with the fire of the entire artillery  battalion. Therefore, in the process of political work it is  necessary to instill a sense of each soldier's high  responsibility for timely and accurate fire and for explicit  execution of his duties.    Political work in the combat situation is distinguished by  its diversity in content, form, and method. This obligates  commanders, political workers, and the combat aktiv to  constantly demonstrate initiative and creativity in ideological  and educational work with personnel.    The experience of the Great Patriotic War is invaluable in  organizing and conducting political work in a subunit in modern  combat. The selfless courage of frontline artillerymen, among  whom there were 1,885 Heroes of the Soviet Union and more than  1.6 million orders and medals awarded, will always serve as an  example for today's generation of artillerymen. Two  artillerymen--V.S. Petrov and A.I. Shilin--earned the title Hero  of the Soviet Union twice.    Progressive character and devotion to the socialist  motherland and to the cause of communism were sources of mass  heroism of Soviet soldiers during the Great Patriotic War. This  was the result of continuous, purposeful political work in the  combat situation.    Explaining to soldiers the nature and political goals of a  war that may be imposed on the Soviet Union by the imperialist  aggressors is of great importance.    "...Awareness by the masses of the goals and causes of war,"  pointed out V.I. Lenin, "is of tremendous importance and ensures  victory."[.sup]2[/]    Fostering a burning hatred toward the enemies of socialism  and communism in the soldiers, exposing the aggressive essence  of imperialism, and struggling with bourgeois ideology develops  in soldiers a deep confidence in the rightness of our great  cause and in victory over the enemy.    Cultivating in artillerymen high readiness, vigilance, and  responsibility for preserving military and state secrets remains  a timely task of political work.    An important political task is propagandizing revolutionary  and combat traditions, popularizing the heroic feats of Soviet  soldiers and servicemen of fraternal socialist armies, and  effectively using their experience in the combat situation that  has taken shape.    Commanders, political workers, and combat aktiv of the  artillery battalion must convey the assigned missions to all  personnel, explain the methods of carrying them out, and rally  soldiers to aggressive and decisive actions for effective  engagement of enemy targets in any situation.    Modern combat places particularly high demands on officers.  They must possess a firm will and the ability to assess the  situation rapidly and correctly, control the subunit, and be  masters of artillery firing. In party-political work with  officers it is necessary to constantly increase their political  awareness; cultivate a high party spirit, moral purity, and  efficiency; develop initiative, creativity, and efficiency in  combat work; develop professional competence; and arm them with  progressive experience in commanding and educating soldiers in  the combat situation.    Today, when radical transformations are taking place in  military affairs, and the nature of combined-arms combat is  changing, even greater demands are placed on officer personnel  in command and control of subunits and in training and educating  personnel. Special attention should be given to educating young  officers who do not have sufficient practical experience, and  officers called up from the reserves.    In conditions of modern, highly mobile combat, a most  important task of political work is developing in soldiers a  sense of military comradeship, mutual assistance, cohesiveness,  and a profound understanding that only the joint precise and  coordinated actions of all personnel of the gun crews, platoons,  batteries, and the battalion as a whole can ensure successful  accomplishment of the combat mission.    Political work to unit multinational, military collectives  and create in them a healthy moral atmosphere and a great sense  of friendship among soldiers of different nationalities acquires  special significance.    The experience of the Great Patriotic War and large tactical  exercises and maneuvers shows that the best results in the  actions of artillerymen are achieved when there is a  differentiated approach to individual work with servicemen of  different specialties directly in the subunits. In work with  scouts and plotters, it is necessary to pay attention to  ensuring high fire accuracy, conducting aggressive  reconnaissance in all types of combat activities, and achieving  error-free actions when determining target coordinates and  computed firing data and topogeodetic survey of fire positions  and command and observation post sites. In work with gunners,  attention should be given to being able to work quickly and  without error on aiming devices and gun elevating and traversing  mechanisms.    During the course of preparing for carrying out fire  missions  in the platoons and batteries, training sessions should be  organized for combat activities and improving the  interchangeability of crew members, since the success of combat  of artillerymen depends on the high proficiency of each  specialist and the collective actions of all personnel.    Preparing the personnel of artillery subunits for combating  enemy tanks and destroying its antitank weapons, and fostering  in soldiers faith in the strength and might of their weapons and  their high combat capabilities is of exceptionally great  importance in modern combat.    An important aspect in the work of commanders, political  workers, and the combat aktiv is instilling in personnel a class  hatred of the enemies of the Soviet motherland; exposing the  anticommunist nature and ideology of imperialism, hostile  propaganda, and ideological subversion; and maintaining in  artillerymen the ability to withstand the enemy's ideological  and psychological influence.    A special place in political work should be given to  fostering psychological and moral steadfastness in combat and in  combat operations when the enemy uses weapons of mass  destruction. It must develop in personnel a firm conviction that  reliable protection from these weapons is possible and that the  combat mission must be carried out in any conditions.    Political work in a combat situation must show a fatherly  concern for people, continuously provide subunits with  everything needed for their combat activities (ammunition,  food), satisfy in a timely manner the material and cultural  needs of personnel, their rest, medical assistance for the  wounded, and commendations for those distinguishing themselves  in combat.    The severe reality of war, inevitably involving human  losses,  requires a careful approach to organizing the burial of soldiers  who die in battles for the motherland. Paying last respects to  those who die and their memory are a means of strengthening the  morale of Soviet soldiers and mobilizing them for a decisive  struggle with the enemy.    Successful accomplishment of the tasks of political work in  the combat situation is achieved:    --By timely assignment of tasks for political work and  thorough briefing of commanders, political workers, and the  combat aktiv on the substance of their work in various  conditions of combat situations;    --Proper assignment of party members and the combat aktiv;  ensuring that communists and Komsomol members set a personal  example in combat; increasing in every possible way the  activeness and fighting spirit of party and Komsomol  organizations;    --Constant communication by commanders and political workers  with subordinates; a comprehensive and in-depth study of their  moral-political and fighting qualities; knowledge of moods and  needs; their continuous and active influence on subordinates,  particularly in the most difficult moments of combat;    --Organizing continuous combat and political briefings of  personnel during the course of combat operations; and  propagandizing progressive combat experience.    One of the decisive conditions of the effectiveness of  political work is the correct determination of its forms and  methods, and their skillful combination and creative use in  accordance with combat missions and the situation. Political  work must be conducted continuously, effectively, purposefully,  and all the more actively as the combat situation becomes more  complex and intense.    It is difficult to use forms of political work involving all  battalion personnel in the combat situation. When conducting  combat operations, battalion personnel are spread out--at the  fire positions, at battalion and battery command and observation  posts, in command and staff command vehicles, and in support  subunits. Personnel will be in individual protective gear when  conducting combat operations on terrain with radioactive and  chemical contamination. In these conditions, the main forms of  political work are individual and group talks, briefings,  reading of leaflets and appeals, publishing operational news  sheets, reading pamphlets, holding short party and Komsomol  meetings directly in the subunits, and extensive use of various  technical means of propaganda, especially radio.    The artillery battalion (battery) commander bears full  responsibility for political work, education, and the  political-moral state and military discipline of personnel  subordinate to him. He determines the main tasks of political  work in upcoming combat operations and must be personally  involved on a daily basis with political and military education  of soldiers. In his practical work, the battalion commander must  rely on party and Komsomol organizations and the combat aktiv,  and direct their activities toward successful execution of  assigned missions.    The battalion commander makes a decision based on a  clarification of the combat mission received and the conclusions  from the situation assessment. Simultaneously with making the  decision, he determines the main tasks for political work and  its special features. The battalion commander assigns the tasks  for political work to the deputy battalion commander for  political affairs. In doing so, he specifies:    --the particular features of the upcoming tasks and what  must  be explained to personnel;    --where to direct special attention in political work with  soldiers in preparing for combat operations and during them;    --what basic political measures it is advisable to take and  at what time in order to ensure accomplishment of the combat  mission;    --the deadline for submitting the political work plan for  approval.    Based on the battalion commander's decision and the  instructions of the deputy regimental commander for political  affairs, the deputy battalion commander for political affairs  draws up a plan for political work with battalion personnel for  the period of preparing for and conducting combat operations.  The political work plan must be approved by the artillery  battalion commander before he assigns combat missions to the  battery commanders and their deputies for political affairs.    The measures of the plan for political work with personnel  (Table 5) usually encompass two phases--preparations for combat  operations and the battalion's combat operations.    Table 5.

In a combat situation, the deputy battalion commander for  political affairs will not always have enough time to compile a  detailed political work plan. Therefore, the plan may be brief,  but specific, and specify the main measures aimed at  accomplishment of the combat mission.    In the instructions for organizing and conducting political  work in the subunits, the artillery battalion commander  emphasizes the requirements of documents of the party, the  Soviet Government, and the command authority. These must be made  the basis of political work in preparing personnel for combat  operations; particular features of combat actions, typical  difficulties, and ways of overcoming them; the procedure for  explaining to personnel the combat mission and the goal of  combat actions; categories of personnel and subunits to which  political work should pay special attention, depending on their  role in the combat operations; the scale of mass political  measures and approximate times for conducting them; measures for  material and technical support of the combat actions, to which  commanders and political workers should give priority attention;  procedure for restoring combat effectiveness of personnel in the  event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; political  measures for ensuring cooperation with supported subunits and  times for conducting them; and the order and times of briefings  on political work done and on the political-moral state of  personnel.    After the artillery battalion commander issues instructions  on organizing and conducting political work in the subunits, his  deputy for political affairs informs subordinate officers of the  content of the plan for political work with battalion personnel  for the period of preparing for and conducting combat actions.  He must personally task deputy battery commanders for political  affairs, and provide them with the necessary materials for  conducting political work with subunit personnel.  Footnotes    1. V.I. Lenin, Poln. sobr. soch. [Complete  Works], Vol 39, p 56.    2. Ibid., Vol 41, p 121.  <H5>  Chapter 4. The Artillery Battalion in an Offensive Situation </H5> <H5>  Battalion Missions </H5>   The goal of offensive combat is the complete defeat of the  opposing enemy and seizing of an important area or line.    The goal of an offensive in modern combined-arms combat can  be achieved by effective fire engagement of the enemy by all  available assets, by combining the efforts of all branches of  troops and aviation, by a decisive attack, and by the swift  advance of combined-arms subunits into the depth of the enemy's  defenses.    An important and sometimes decisive role in achieving the  goals of an offensive move belongs to the artillery. Firing at  long ranges, firepower, and accuracy of fire enable artillery to  engage the enemy by fire suddenly, both before an offensive and  during the course of it.    Fire engagement means to deliver fire against objectives  (targets) from various types of weapons with strikes by rocket  forces and aviation using conventional ammunition, as a result  of which the objectives completely or partially lose their  combat effectiveness (their basic functions).    Artillery accomplishes fire engagement by periods: artillery  preparation of an attack, artillery support of an attack, and  artillery accompaniment of a troop offensive in depth. The  existence of these periods of fire engagement is caused  primarily by the goals and uniqueness of the missions being  carried out by artillery in each period, the difference in the  methods of carrying them out, and the nature of the maneuver by  artillery during the course of combat operations. At the same  time, artillery carries out missions in support of the advance  of units at a high tempo in each of the periods.    Artillery preparation for an attack immediately  precedes the attack by motorized rifle and tank subunits and is  conducted to the depth of enemy first-echelon units, and to the  depth of effective fire against the most important targets and  objectives. Its duration and configuration are determined by the  concept of operations. As a rule, it consists of several  shellings.    During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery  battalion may engage offensive tactical nuclear and chemical  weapons; neutralize artillery batteries, mortar platoons, strong  points (at the forward-most defensive positions and in the  immediate depth), and command posts; destroy antitank weapons at  and between company strong points, electronic assets, and other  enemy assets. The battalion carries out these missions by  concentrated fire and by fire at single targets.    Artillery preparation for an attack begins with a surprise  powerful shelling by all artillery against planned targets and  primarily against personnel and weapons at the forward-most  defensive positions, artillery batteries, and other important  targets. Direct-fire weapons destroy tanks, armored personnel  carries, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers, and guns, and  also destroy enemy emplacements. Artillery preparation ends at  the established time with a shelling of first-echelon company  strong points and antitank weapons outside of strong points when  first-echelon motorized rifle and tank subunits reach the final  coordination line. The last shelling against artillery  batteries and mortar platoons usually begins before the end of  artillery preparation and overlaps the time of the attack on the  enemy's forward-most defensive positions.    Artillery support of an attack begins when  first-echelon subunits begin moving from the final coordination  line and continues nonstop until they seize the defensive areas  of the enemy's first-echelon battalions and is conducted to a  great depth. Participating in conducting a successive fire  concentration or a rolling barrage, the artillery battalion  neutralizes earlier reconnoitered strong points, antitank  weapons, and command posts in front and on the flanks of  attacking subunits. A battalion (battery) not being used in a  successive fire concentration, or rolling barrage, neutralizes  newly detected targets whose fire is impeding the advance of  attacking subunits. A battalion may also be used to neutralize  newly detected offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery  batteries, and mortar platoons. With the start of artillery  support of the attack, guns and tanks assigned for direct firing  and ATGM launchers play an important role in destroying  surviving targets at the forward-most defensive positions and in  the immediate depth.    Artillery accompaniment of a deep troop offensive  is accomplished for the purpose of continuous fire engagement of  the enemy as the offensive moves deep in the enemy's defenses.  It begins after artillery support of the attack ends and  continues until the attacking subunits have carried out their  combat missions.    During this period the battalion may engage newly detected  offensive tactical nuclear and chemical weapons and neutralize  artillery batteries, personnel, and weapons offering resistance  to the attacking first-echelon subunits.    In the course of artillery accompaniment, the battalion may  also participate in carrying out missions to support the  commitment of second echelons, repel counterattacks by enemy  reserves, support subunits crossing water obstacles, and prevent  the enemy from consolidating on favorable lines. In addition,  the battalion may be used to engage targets when supporting a  tactical airborne assault.    During this period the battalion most often has to carry out  unscheduled fire missions assigned by the senior artillery  commander, maneuver battalion (regiment) commander, and also at  the decision of the artillery battalion commander. The artillery  battalion and batteries will use engagement of single targets,  concentrated fire, or barrage fire, and may also be used for  massing fire according to the plan of the senior artillery  commander (chief).    The depth of the combat operations during this period and  the  need for timely opening of fire to neutralize reconnoitered  targets to support the advance of tank and motorized rifle  subunits will require repeated relocation of the artillery  battalion. Taking into account the extent of enemy resistance,  the nature of actions of our subunits, and the artillery  battalion's place in the artillery grouping, the artillery  battalion may relocate at full strength or by batteries.  <H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>   Depending on the situation, a maneuver battalion's attack  against a defending enemy may be accomplished on the move with  subunits moving up from the attack position or from a position  of direct contact with the enemy. It usually begins with a  breakthrough, which involves softening up the enemy defenses by  strikes from all types of weapons and a swift assault by tank  and motorized rifle subunits, with subsequent development of the  actions deep and to the flanks.    An attack on the move by a maneuver battalion against a  defending enemy is usually accomplished from the attack  position. Preparation of the attacking subunits for combat  operations in these conditions is usually accomplished under the  cover of the subunits defending in direct contact with the  enemy. It is usually done on the terrain, secretly, and over  short time periods. In the attack position, the artillery  battalion is disposed by batteries in a formation that ensures  rapid and organized movement to the assigned fire position area.  Terrain folds and other natural and manmade shelters are used to  accommodate combat equipment, motor transport, and personnel.  Before moving out to the fire position area, they organize local  security and self-defense; engineer preparation and camouflage;  preparation of armament, equipment, and personnel for the  upcoming combat operations; and replenishment of supplies.    At the attack position, the artillery battalion commander  receives the mission usually according to a map, with subsequent  update of the mission on the terrain. A variant of the sequence  of the artillery battalion commander's work to prepare the  battalion's combat operations in these conditions is shown in  Figure 10.          The artillery battalion commander and staff organize the  receipt and updating of information on the enemy from artillery  and combined-arms subunits operating in direct contact with the  enemy in the course of commander's reconnaissance. Command and  observation posts of the artillery battalion and all batteries  are deployed for reconnaissance of the enemy in the artillery  battalion assigned to support the maneuver battalion. An  artillery reconnaissance group is dispatched for reconnaissance,  topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of fire positions  and command and observation post sites. The artillery battalion  withdraws from the attack position to the fire position area and  deploys into the battle formation at the time established by the  senior artillery commander, usually at night or in other  conditions of limited visibility.    The maneuver battalion's attack on the move can also be  accomplished directly from the line of march. This usually takes  place when developing combat operations deep, when the enemy  strives to delay our units' advance by a defense on favorable  lines. The artillery battalion may move as part of a forward  detachment or advance guard, behind the advance guard, or in the  main-force column. Artillery reconnaissance subunits of a  battalion attached to a forward detachment or advance guard move  with the advance party, and those of a battalion moving behind  the forward detachment (advance guard) and at the head of the  main forces move in the main-force column of the advance guard.    The artillery battalion commander makes a decision and,  using  a map, tasks the batteries during the approach to the enemy  defenses. With the battalion's arrival at the fire position area  and deployment of the command and observation posts, the  battalion commander updates the missions to the batteries on the  terrain by separate instructions and commands. Formalized  documents (tables, diagrams) are widely used to reduce the time  for planning and disseminating missions. The command and  observation posts of an artillery battalion operating as part of  an advance guard (forward detachment) or assigned to support a  first-echelon maneuver battalion deploy jointly with the  maneuver battalion's command and observation posts.    The maneuvering battalion's offensive against a defending  enemy is accomplished in the battle formation set up earlier  after the necessary regrouping from the defense, and sometimes  with troops advancing replacing defending subunits.    In such conditions, the artillery battalion commander  conducts all the work for organizing combat operations on the  terrain. Depending on where the breakthrough sector is planned,  the artillery battalion may remain at the fire positions, which  makes it considerably easier to prepare for combat operations,  or it may relocate to a new area. The artillery battalion may be  moved up to fire positions; in this case, the move up and  deployment into battle formation are accomplished at night or in  other conditions of limited visibility.    Let us follow the preparation of an artillery battalion's  combat operations in a tactical example in which it is part of a  regimental artillery group and assigned to support a  first-echelon battalion attacking without a halt from the attack  position. The sequence and substance of the work of the  artillery battalion commander and staff in this example should  be considered as one of possible variants. The tactical example  shows how the commander and the chief of staff resolve the most  important issues.  <H6>  Tactical Example 1 </H6> <H6>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 11) </H6>         The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment [AR], arrived by  rail at Kovni Station (not on map). During the course of  off-loading, the artillery battalion commander received the  following field instruction from the commander of the 8th  Artillery Regiment:    "1. The enemy has halted the advance of our troops at an  earlier prepared line 100-110 km west of Kovni Station. His air  support is conducting aggressive reconnaissance, and small  groups of aircraft are making bomb strikes using incendiary  weapons. Operations by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties  have been noted in our troop dispositions.    "2. The artillery battalion is to execute a march over the  route Kryuki, Beloye, Pletni (not on map), and by 2300 hours 12  October concentrate in the area of Hill 61.2, (exc.) Butki, the  grove. The head of the artillery battalion column is to pass the  starting point, the western outskirts of Golevo, at 2030 hours.    "The 1st and 3d artillery battalions are located in areas...  (indicated on map); the command and observation post [COP] of  the 8th Artillery Regiment... (indicated on the map).    "Communications by radio are forbidden before the start of  combat operations.    "3. Signals:    "--radioactive contamination--`Radiation Danger';    "--chemical and bacteriological (biological)  contamination--`Chemical Alert,' chemical alert signal flares;    "--enemy air attack--`Air,' green signal flares;    "--enemy ground attack--`Motorized Infantry,' `Tanks';    "--deploy into battle formation from the line of  march--`Lafet';    "--continue movement--`Motor.'"    Based on the instruction received, the artillery battalion  commander dispatched an artillery reconnaissance group (ARG) for  reconnaissance of the assigned area and gave tasks to the  subunit commanders for executing the march. The artillery  battalion passed the starting point at the indicated time and  continued to execute the march.    When approaching the designated area at 2255 hours 16  October, the ARG chief met the battalion commander and reported  on reconnaissance of the area and the planned sites for the  subunits. The battalion commander marked these places on his  work map, approved the ARG chief's report, and issued the  following combat order to the subunits:    "1. The enemy is located in the western sector at a distance  of 25-30 km. His air support is conducting active reconnaissance  of our units' dispositions and is making bomb strikes  periodically with small groups of aircraft.    "2. We arrived at the battalion's designated disposition  area.    "3. Subunits are to occupy the following places: 4th  Battery..., 5th Battery..., 6th Battery..., battalion staff and  support subunits... (indicated on map). Position combat  equipment and motor transport secretly, using terrain  irregularities. Dig slit trenches at each gun for sheltering the  crews.    "4. Organize local security in each subunit to prevent  penetration by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties and  organize self-defense to repel a possible attack by them.    "5. Dangerous sectors are... (shown on the terrain).  Organize  patrols in these sectors, assigning two patrols from the 5th  Battery. The chief of staff will assign missions.    "6. Warning signals are as previously indicated. Password is  `Machinegun'; reply is `Poltava.'    "7. By 2330 hours 16 October the chief of staff is to  organize landline communications between the battalion staff and  each subunit, compile a local security and self-defense diagram  for the battalion, and prepare an action report."    At 2345 hours 16 October, the chief of staff reported to the  artillery battalion commander on the documents he had drawn up.    Only the action report is given here.    To the Commander, 8th Artillery Regiment    Action Report No 6 of the 2d Artillery Battalion.  Command and observation post--the ravine (1634). 17 October,  2330 hours. Map 1:100,000, 1973 edition.    "1. The enemy is located in the western sector at a distance  of 25-30 km. His air support is conducting reconnaissance of our  units' dispositions.    "2. The 2d Artillery Battalion is located in the assigned  area--1 km north of Butki (1433).    "The battalion is at 100-percent strength in personnel,  armament, artillery prime movers and motor transport, personal  weapons, and instruments of all types.    "3. The combat equipment and motor transport have been  concealed using terrain irregularities and are being camouflaged.    "Slit trenches are being dug to shelter personnel.    "4. Local security and self-defense have been organized.    "5. The battalion's supply status is as follows:    "--ammunition: 1.0 basic load for guns and small arms;    "--fuel: 0.7 fuelings;    "--food: 3 days' rations.    "6. There have been no losses."    Commander 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, Maj (G.  Vishnyakov)    Chief of Staff, Capt (O. Lebedev)    At 0430 hours 17 October, the deputy chief of staff of the  8th Artillery Regiment came to the commander of the 2d  Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, delivered to him topographic  maps of the area of the upcoming combat operations, and relayed  (verbally) the warning order of the 8th Artillery Regiment  commander.    "1. Beginning on the morning of 16 October, the enemy has  been taking up a defense with subunits of the 4th Brigade with  the forward edge running from Hill 90.3, the dairy farm, and  further to the south.    "A position of brigade reserves is being prepared on a line  running from the group of trees to Uzkaya Grove. There is up to  a battalion of 155-mm howitzers in the area of Hill 92.0, the  single house, and the brush.    "2. The 8th Artillery Regiment is a part of the 5th  Regimental Artillery Group [RAG]. The group commander is the  commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment. The 2d Artillery  Battalion is assigned to support the 1st Battalion, 5th  Motorized Rifle Regiment.    "3. By 0800 hours 17 October, organize and conduct  reconnaissance from the command and observation post of the  battalion and batteries and the artillery ground reconnaissance  station [SNAR] radar in the area: to the right--Hill Bob, Hill  92.0; to the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, the mound.    "The mission of reconnaissance: detect and locate the strong  points before the start of the offensive, determine the nature  of their fortifications and artificial obstacles; reconnoiter  weapons and determine their coordinates, especially antitank  weapons, and also command posts and mortar platoons in the area  of the road junction and 500 meters to the south.    "The command and observation post line is: Hill Bob, Hill  88.0.    "Receive reconnaissance information from the commander of  the  1st Artillery Battalion operating as part of the 19th Motorized  Rifle Regiment of the defense in direct contact with the enemy.  His command and observation post is on the northern slopes of  Hill 88.0.    "Present reconnaissance information to the group observation  post: Present the information received from the 1st Artillery  Battalion by 1200 hours, and subsequently every hour.    "Reconnaissance subunits are to leave the western outskirts  of Peski at 0600 hours 17 October under the leadership of the  regimental chief of intelligence.    "4. The artillery battalion's fire position area is: Hill  83.0, the single tree, and the brush. Dispatch an artillery  reconnaissance group to reconnoiter and prepare the fire  position area. The ARG's of all battalions under the leadership  of the deputy commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment are to  leave the western outskirts of Peski at 0620 hours. The base  line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00.    "Select and prepare one fire position for each battery.    "Complete engineer preparation and camouflage by 0600 hours  18 October.    "Perform topogeodetic survey by map using the navigation  instruments of the command vehicle; determine the grid azimuths  of the reference points using the gyroscopic method by 1200  hours 17 October.    "The battalion will be supplied ammunition in the fire  position area in the amount of 2.5 units of fire by 2100 hours  17 October. Arrange to meet the transport at the crossroads  (1963).    "5. Conduct technical preparations in the occupied areas  using subunit forces before 1800 hours 17 October.    "6. Conduct calibration firing of the new batches of charges  using the battalion's reference piece from a temporary fire  position of one of the batteries of the 19th Regimental  Artillery Group using ABS from 1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and  from 0500 to 0600 hours 18 October.    "7. Have the following supplies: 1.2 fuelings of fuel with  the vehicles; a fuel tanker will arrive at the battalion by 1300  hours 17 October; rations should be according to troop norms.    "The regiment's rear subunits are at the western edge of the  forest (1768).    "Readiness to move out to the fire position area is at 2130  hours 17 October; readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18  October.    "8. Arrive at the regimental command post by 0730 hours 17  October to receive missions. The commander of the 5th RAG  conducts commander's reconnaissance from 1230 to 1330 hours; the  commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment,  does so from 1330 to 1430 hours 17 October."    Based on a study of the warning order, the artillery  battalion commander determined the following measures which had  to be carried out immediately:    --summon to the battalion staff the battery commanders, the  senior officer of the 5th Battery (chief of the ARG), motor  transport equipment, artillery equipment, and the commander of  the administrative section;    --issue instructions for carrying out the 8th Artillery  Regiment commander's warning order;    --arrange to feed personnel before 0600.    Next the commander and chief of staff synchronize timing  (Table 6) for preparing the battalion for combat operations and  prepare to issue a warning order to subunit commanders.    Table 6. Timing. It is now 0500 hours 17 October. Readiness to open fire is at  0630 hours 18 October. Total time available for preparing the battalion is 25  hours 30 minutes, with 11 hours of daylight.

Terrain Assessment. The route of movement to the  fire position area runs through a large wooded area. The route  has two bridges across small streams, the capacity of which is  difficult to ascertain. The fire position area, considering its  size, makes it possible to disperse the batteries. The nature of  the terrain is semibroken. There are no swampy areas, which  will make it possible to perform the engineering preparation of  the fire positions. All this will increase the survivability of  subunits. A dirt road runs through the fire position area, which  will ensure the battalion rapid deployment into battle formation  at night. The most convenient places for the fire positions may  be: 4th Battery--the area 200-250 meters south of Hill 83.0; 5th  Battery--the area of the brush; 6th Battery--the area of the  single tree.    The developed geodetic network makes it possible to perform  topogeodetic survey of the fire positions accurately and in a  short time.    To conduct reconnaissance to as great a depth as possible,  it  is advisable to select sites for the command and observation  posts on the line of the second trench of our defending  subunits: 4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the  southwestern slopes of Hill 88.0; 5th Battery and the  battalion--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0.    At 0515 hours 17 October, the battalion commander assembled  the subunit commanders and ordered the chief of staff to issue  them topographic maps, after which he gave instructions on  preparing for combat operations:    "The enemy has been taking up a defensive position with  subunits of the 4th Brigade since 1610 hours with the forward  edge running from Hill 90.3, the dairy farm, and further to the  south.    "The position of brigade reserves is on a line running from  the group of trees, the single houses, and mound 3.    "The 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is preparing to go over to  the offensive from the staging area. The 2d Battalion, 8th  Artillery Regiment, is part of the 5th RAG and assigned to  support the offensive of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion.    "The chief of reconnaissance is to organize and conduct  reconnaissance in the following area: on the right--Hill Bob and  the height from Hill 92.0; on the left--the southern slopes of  Hill 88.0, mound 3.    "The mission of reconnaissance is:    "--prior to the start of the offensive: determine the  location of strong points and the nature of fortifications and  artificial obstacles; reconnoiter other targets and determine  their coordinates, such as weapons (especially antitank weapons)  and also command posts and mortar platoons in the vicinity of  the road junction and 500 meters to the south.    "Additional missions will be indicated during the course of  the offensive.    "Deploy the command and observation posts as follows: the  battalion and 5th Battery--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0;  4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the southwestern  slopes of Hill 88.0; deploy the SNAR radar attached to the  battalion in the vicinity of Hill 88.0.    "Receive reconnaissance information from the commander of  the  1st Artillery Battalion. The battalion is deployed in the  defenses of the 19th Motorized Rifle Regiment in direct contact  with the enemy. The command and observation post of the 1st  Artillery Battalion is on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0.    "Number the targets as follows: artillery batteries and  mortar platoons--20-30; other targets--60-80.    "Present reconnaissance information to the group observation  post: present the first information by 1200 hours, and  subsequently every hour. The reconnaissance subunits are to  depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0600 hours 17 Oct under  the leadership of the regimental chief of intelligence.    "An artillery reconnaissance group is being dispatched from  the battalion for reconnaissance and preparation of the fire  position area. It is comprised of the chief of the ARG, the  senior officer from the 5th Battery, gun platoon commanders of  4th and 6th batteries, and two gun-crew members from each  battery with instruments and equipment for topogeodetic survey,  for conducting radiation and chemical reconnaissance, and for  checking terrain for mines.    "The fire position area is Hill 83.0, the single tree, the  brush. Select the battery fire positions as follows: 4th  Battery--in the vicinity of Hill 83.0; 5th Battery--in the  vicinity of the brush; 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the  single tree.    "The fire positions should provide a minimum firing range of  2500 meters.    "Select and prepare one fire position for each battery;  clear  out the field of fire; prepare gun emplacements, ammunition  pits, and slit trenches for personnel; and prepare access  routes. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable ground  objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform  engineer preparation and camouflage under camouflage nets and  complete this work by 0600 hours 18 Oct.    "Prepare a site in the vicinity of the 5th Battery's fire  position for the battalion fire control post.    "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00.    "Perform a topogeodetic survey of the fire positions, by  map,  using the navigation equipment of the command vehicle, and  determine the grid azimuths of bearings to aiming points by the  gyroscopic method by 1200 hours 17 October.    "To ensure the topogeodetic survey and its monitoring, the  orientation transmission post is deployed at Elevation 79.4 from  0600 to 1100 hours 18 October. The callsign is "Gamma"; the main  frequency is 29300 kHz, and the alternate is 32500 kHz.  Operating procedures are the first 10 minutes of every half-hour.    "The ARG under the deputy commander of the 8th Artillery  Regiment is to depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0620  hours.    "Report the results of the work to me upon arrival at the  fire position area.    "Battery commanders are to assign 20 people from each  battery  for engineer preparation of the fire positions and one motor  vehicle from each battery to transport them. They will proceed  with the ARG chief; organize preparation of equipment, prime  movers, instruments, and ammunition.    "Technical preparation of guns, command vehicles, and  instruments is to be performed from 0600 to 1800 hours 17  October in the staging area; inspect the guns' sighting devices  and recoil mechanisms and inspect instruments for calculation of  ballistic range correction.    "Perform calibration firing of the lots of propellant  charges  delivered using the reference piece from a temporary fire  position of one of the batteries of the 19th RAG using ABS from  1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and from 0500 to 0530 hours 18  October. Submit the results of the calibration firing to the  battalion staff after they have been processed. The chief of  staff and senior officer of the 5th Battery are responsible for  the calibration firing.    "Sort and distribute ammunition among the batteries before  0300 hours 18 October; measure the propellant temperature and  report to the battalion staff every 2 hours, beginning at 0200  hours 18 October.    "The chief of staff is to compile a work plan for carrying  out these measures and for conducting calculation of ballistic  range correction and technical preparation; establish the  equipment operating time in the batteries to provide assistance;  submit requisition for work to be done by forces of the  regimental artillery workshop; monitor the work being performed  in all batteries. When the battalion arrives at the fire  position area, report to me on the accomplishment of measures  for technical preparation and calculation of ballistic range  correction.    "The artillery battalion will be issued ammunition at the  fire position area in the amount of 2.5 basic loads by 2100  hours 17 October. The commander of the 5th Battery is to arrange  to meet the transport at the crossroads (1963) and to unload  them the battery fire positions. Have a fuel reserve of 1.2  fillings with the vehicles; the fuel tanker will arrive at the  battalion by 1300 hours 17 October. Have the standard unit-level  supply of food rations. The regiment's rear services subunits  are at the western edge of the forest (1768). The signal officer  is to prepare the signal squad to proceed to the fire position  area and lay communications lines according to additional  instructions. Time of departure is with the artillery  battalion ARG.    "The motor vehicle mechanic is to check the technical  condition of all motor vehicles by 1800 hours, paying special  attention to the working condition of lights and brakes. Report  the results to the chief of staff.    "The commander of the administrative section is to provide  departing personnel with one day's rations of food and water.    "At 0730 hours I am leaving to join the regiment commander  to  receive the mission. The chief of staff will remain in my place.  Everyone is to leave for their subunits."    Based on the instructions received, the chief of staff  compiled a plan of measures for preparing subunits for combat  operations (Table 7).    Table 7.

The enemy was defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade  on a prepared line with the forward edge running: trig point  90.3, dairy farm, and further to the south.    Strong points of the first-echelon companies and other  targets had been reconnoitered (see map).    The position of brigade reserves had been prepared on the  line running: the group of trees, the single house (see map).  Brigade reserves of up to a tank battalion of a tank group  [tbtgr] are in the following area: (exc.) Borki, Hill  Figurnaya, Belino.    2. The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, is part of the  5th RAG and is assigned to support the 1st Battalion, 5th  Motorized Rifle Regiment, which is attacking in the regiment's  first echelon. A battalion of the adjacent regiment is attacking  on the right, and the 2d Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle  Regiment, is attacking on the left.    The boundaries with them are shown on the map.    The artillery battalion's missions are:    --during artillery preparation of the assault lasting 50  minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07) neutralize: in the  first shelling (15 minutes) on the signal "Buran" target 114,  expenditure 540; in the third shelling (11 minutes) on the  signal "Tayfun" target 66, expenditure 324; in the fourth  shelling (14 minutes) on signal "Dozhd" target 114, expenditure  324;    --during artillery support of the assault: support the  assault during breakthrough of the first position with a  successive fire concentration along two lines: No 1--target 114,  expenditure 72; No 2--target 223, expenditure 255;    --during exploitation of the assault between the first and  second positions: be ready to repel a possible counterattack by  brigade reserves during their movement forward and  deployment--target 174, with a fixed barrage in depth [GNZO]  "Pikhta-2";    --during breakthrough of the brigade reserves' position,  support the assault with a successive fire concentration along  two lines: No 1--target 444, expenditure 408; No 2--target 548,  expenditure 192;    --with commitment of the regiment's second echelon, support  the 3d Motorized Rifle Battalion;    --during artillery accompaniment of the troops' advance in  the depth: when repelling the counterattack by division  reserves, be ready to deliver massed fire "Mars-1," concentrated  fire against target 601, and fixed barrage "Akatsiya."    The fire position area assigned to the artillery battalion  is  to be occupied by 0430 hours 18 October.    Relocation of the artillery battalion is to be accomplished  at full strength: the first relocation, after the 1st Motorized  Rifle Battalion seizes the first-echelon company strong points,  is to fire position area No 2 (see map); the second, when  subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reach the line  Hill 75.0, mound 3, is to fire position area No 3 (see map). The  relocation route is the road junction, bridge, Borki. Begin  relocation on signal "Motor."    Ammunition expenditure for the day is 3.5 units of fire,  including:    --1.1 for artillery preparation of the assault;    --1.5 for artillery support of the assault;    --0.9 for artillery accompaniment of the deep troop advance.    Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October.    The observation post of the 5th RAG at 1200 hours 17 October  is to be 1.5 km west of the ravine; the command post is to be at  the ravine at 0400 hours 18 October. The line of relocation is  the dairy farm, mound 3, and the single grove.    In the event the observation post and command post of the  5th  RAG are disabled, command and control of the group is to be  transferred to the commander of the 3d Artillery Battalion. The  signal for assumption of command and control is "Zvezdochet."    The commander of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is to  conduct commander's reconnaissance and organize cooperation  beginning at 1030 hours; the commander of the 5th RAG is to do  so beginning at 1230 hours 17 October. Departure for the fire  position area together with the commander of the 5th RAG is at  0945 hours 17 October from the starting point of Peski.  <H5>  Situation Assessment </H5>   At 0810 hours 17 October, at the command post of the 8th  Artillery Regiment the artillery battalion commander plotted the  necessary data about the enemy on his work map from the 5th RAG  commander's map, after which he left for the artillery  battalion's dispositions. During the course of movement and on  arrival at the battalion, he assessed the situation, worked up a  decision, and prepared a report for the commander of the 1st  Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment.    The Enemy. The 4th Brigade occupies a deliberate  defense, the forward-most edge of which runs along the eastern  slopes of Hill 90.3, the nameless height at the road, the dairy  farm, and further to the south.    In the zone of upcoming operations, motorized infantry  subunits reinforced by tanks are defending in the first  position. Immediately in front of the advance of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Battalion, two motorized infantry platoons are  defending on the forward edge, and behind them up to a platoon  deep. The defense area of the second-echelon company of the  battalion is assumed to be the single grove, the cutting on the  road, and pit four.    The brigade reserves' position has been prepared on a line  with the group of trees, the single house, and Zbori. Deep in  the defenses behind the second position in the vicinity of the  single grove, Belino, and "Figurnaya" grove, a tank group tank  battalion is located which may be used to conduct a  counterattack from the line of the precipice, Zbori in the  direction of mound three, and the road junction.    Company and platoon strong points have been prepared by  engineers and are prepared for all-around defense.    The dispositions of individual targets, particularly  antitank  weapons, in the strong points (targets 114 and 223) have not  been completely reconnoitered. The dispositions of reserves and  artillery, engineer preparation, and the nature of the terrain  makes it possible to believe that the 4th Brigade is  concentrating its main efforts on the axes: the grove, the dairy  farm and mound three, the single grove.    Conclusions. The enemy's defenses have been  prepared in advance, and at this time the dispositions of  weapons have not been disclosed fully enough. Available  reconnaissance information makes it possible to neutralize  assigned targets (strong points) with the battalion's  concentrated fire by overlapping the fire of the batteries. It  is necessary to focus the artillery battalion's reconnaissance  assets on clarifying the boundaries of the platoon strong points  and on follow-up reconnaissance of the dispositions of  individual targets, particularly antitank weapons in the strong  points (targets 114 and 223) and also between strong points.    Friendly Subunits. The 1st Motorized Rifle  Regiment is advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the  direction of Hill 88.0, the single house. During the course of  the fighting, it is assigned combat missions to defeat  first-echelon subunits of the battalion, repel counterattacks by  enemy brigade reserves, and break through the position of the  enemy brigade reserves on the move.    The artillery battalion is assigned to support the 1st  Motorized Rifle Battalion and is at full strength in personnel,  equipment, prime movers and motor transport, instruments,  communications equipment, and personal weapons. The artillery  battalion is tasked to neutralize two platoon strong points  during the artillery preparation of the assault--targets 114 and  66--for which 1.1 units of fire (1,188 shells) have been  allocated; during the artillery support of the assault, it is to  neutralize four platoon strong points--targets 114, 223, 444,  and 548--for which 0.85 units of fire (927 shells) have been  allocated, with a total of 1.5 units of fire (1,620 shells)  allocated for this period.    Conclusions. The artillery battalion will deliver  fire for 40 minutes of the artillery preparation and for 20  minutes of the artillery support of the assault (40 minutes + 20  minutes = one hour), and during this time each gun will expend  66 + 18 = 84 shells. According to the fire chart, the battalion  can carry out these missions using any of the propellant  charges. For convenience of fire control and calculation of  firing data, the second propellant charge is considered the  common charge.    In view of the quite limited time for preparing a large  amount of ammunition in conditions of darkness, prepare in  advance work areas at each battery fire position and distribute  personnel.    Refuel motor transport to established norms.    Terrain. In the zone of the upcoming offensive,  the terrain is semibroken. From the planned sites for deployment  of the observation posts it is possible to conduct observation  using optical reconnaissance devices to a depth of 2.5-3.5 km,  that is, to the depth of the first position. Areas of poor  visibility are created on individual sectors having heights;  therefore, it is necessary to use lateral observation posts.    Areas of fire position Nos two and three, planned for  relocation of the battalion during the course of the offensive,  can accommodate the batteries. The existing dirt road that  passes through the fire position area provides for rapid  movement of subunits. It is necessary to organize reconnaissance  of the terrain in the batteries' fire position areas for the  presence of mines.    Radiation and Chemical Situation. In previous  battles, the enemy did not use weapons of mass destruction, and  there is no information that he is preparing to use them.  However, the enemy may at any time switch to combat operations  using these weapons, particularly when our troops start moving  up from the staging areas. It is necessary to assign the  following tasks:    --for systematic conduct of radiation, chemical, and  bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: when preparing for  the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement,  and in the fire position area; in the course of the  offensive--on relocation routes and in new fire position areas;    --for carrying out measures to organize protection against  weapons of mass destruction, to check the availability and  working condition of protective gear, to prepare teams to  neutralize the effects of these weapons, and to conduct  radiological and chemical monitoring.  <H5>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision </H5>   At 0840 hours 17 October, at the headquarters the artillery  battalion commander announced his decision to the chief of  staff, deputy battalion commander for political affairs, and the  battery commanders:    "1. To support the companies of the 1st Battalion, 5th  Motorized Rifle Regiment, assign the following:    "--the 4th Battery is to support the right-flank company;  the  6th Battery is to support the left-flank company; and the 5th  Battery is to be the standby.    "2. Fire missions for the batteries and the order of their  accomplishment:    "--during the artillery preparation of the assault--50  minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07):    "--in the first shelling (15 minutes), neutralize target 114  with three overlapping batteries;    "--in the second shelling (10 minutes), destroy targets by  direct firing, batteries will not deliver fire;    "--in the third shelling (11 minutes), neutralize target 66  with three overlapping batteries;    "--in the fourth shelling (14 minutes), neutralize target  114  with three overlapping batteries.    "--during the artillery preparation of the assault (from  H-hour -:07): when breaking through the first position, with  successive fire concentration along two lines--number one is to  neutralize target 114 by two overlapping batteries and one  battery ready to hit newly detected targets; number two is to  neutralize target 223 with three overlapping batteries; be ready  to neutralize target 174 with concentrated fire by three  overlapping batteries and to deliver a deep fixed barrage  `Pikhta-2'";    "--neutralize target 444 (17 minutes) and target 548 (eight  minutes) with concentrated fire by three overlapping batteries.    "The established expenditure of shells for each target is to  be distributed among the batteries according to the number of  gun-mounts.    "3. Prepare the battery fire positions in accordance with  the  warning order.    "4. Deploy the artillery battalion and battery command and  observation posts by 1630 hours 17 October, and the artillery  battalion fire control post by 0430 hours 18 October. The  battery command and observation posts are to be positioned  together with those of the supported companies, and the  artillery battalion command and observation post together with  that of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment.    "5. Readiness for landline communications is 1700 hours 17  October.    "The commander of the 6th Battery is to assume command and  control of the artillery battalion in the event the battalion  command and observation post is disabled. The signal for  assuming command and control is `Zvezda.'"  <H3>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Instructions on Combat  Support </H3>   Protection Against Weapons of Mass Destruction.  "The enemy has not used weapons of mass destruction in previous  battles. However, he may at any time switch to combat operations  using them, particularly at the start and during the course of  movement of our troops from the staging area.    "Concentrate the main efforts of radiation, chemical, and  bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: during preparation  of the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement,  and in the fire position area; during the course of the  offensive--on relocation routes and in the new fire position  areas.    "The chief of staff is to clarify the location of the  decontamination station and the military technical equipment  depot and organize the replenishment or replacement of  unserviceable protective gear in the subunits. Create in the  battalion, ready at request, a team to neutralize the effects of  the use of weapons of mass destruction. It is to consist of one  platoon from each battery in two motor vehicles, a radiological  monitoring instructor with instruments, a paramedic, and an  automotive repair shop.    "Before 1800 hours 17 October battery commanders are to  organize a check on the availability and condition of the  individual protective gear of personnel. Shortages are to be  replenished, and unserviceable gear is to be replaced. Report  information on the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction  immediately, and report radiation doses received daily by 1800  hours.    "Each battery is to prepare a firefighting team, made up of  a  crew with firefighting equipment which is to be kept in motor  vehicles. Warning signals remain the same."    Scheduling of Fires. "By 0940 hours the chief of  staff is to allocate fire missions and designate each battery's  ammunition expenditure for each target, and prepare a table for  allocation of fire missions, which will be used to assign  missions to battery commanders on the terrain. To ensure the  concealed transition from artillery preparation to artillery  support of the assault, a single rate of fire on target 114 is  to be calculated in the firing data table. To do this, total the  assigned ammunition expenditure for each battery in the fourth  shelling and against the first successive fire concentration  line and divide it by the total time for delivering fire in  these shellings.    "Upon receipt of the excerpt from the fire plan of the 5th  RAG and the list of target coordinates, draw up a battalion fire  plan; upon receipt of the coordinates of the battery fire  positions, draw up a table of calculated firing data. Explain to  the senior battery officers the order of carrying out fire  missions for the periods of artillery preparation and support of  the assault and check the accuracy and timeliness of preparation  of calculated firing data tables in the batteries.    "Plan the relocation of the battalion simultaneously for all  subunits: the first relocation--after completion of successive  fire concentration against target 223--is to fire position area  number two (see map), ready to deliver successive fire  concentration against targets 444 and 548; the second  relocation--with arrival of subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle  Battalion to line Hill 75.0, mound three--is to fire position  area number three (see map). The route of relocation is the road  junction, the bridge, Borki (see map). Begin relocation at the  signal `Motor.'"    Preparation of Fire Control. "Have data on the  batteries and firing conditions at the battalion fire control  post by 1800 hours.    "Determine firing data by the method of deliberate  preparation of fire. Calculate corrections on lines 43-00 and  48-00 at ranges of 3.7 and 11 km using the second charge. By  2000 hours check the readiness of the fire control post and  computer operation, the correctness of calculating corrections,  and the construction of correction charts. Meteorological  messages for medium artillery will be transmitted by telephone  from meteorological stations numbers 14 and 25 at the beginning  of every even hour, beginning at 2000 hours 17 October, and  during the course of combat operations they will be transmitted  over radio. Radio operating data: call signs of the  meteorological stations are Meteor-14 and Meteor-25; main  frequency is 34.8 MHz; alternate frequency is 32.5 MHz.    "Control signals will be indicated in the excerpt from the  5th RAG fire plan.    "Arbitrary numbers of the command and observation posts for  input into the computer are: first post--for the battalion  command and observation post; fourth post--for the 4th Battery  command and observation post; fifth post--for the 5th Battery  command and observation post; sixth post--for the 6th Battery  command and observation post.    "Deploy bilateral observation as follows: the 4th Battery  command and observation post is the right post, and the  battalion command and observation post is the left post."    Political Work (for the deputy battalion commander  for political affairs). "Direct political work with personnel at  increasing combat effectiveness of subunits, strengthening the  political-moral state, and successful accomplishment of the  assigned mission; explaining the nature of the mission received  and the order of carrying it out; sound knowledge of established  signals and sequence of actions when these signals are given,  particularly at night and when weapons of mass destruction have  been used. Pay attention to careful preparation of combat  equipment, instruments, communications equipment, and  ammunition, and also to moral and psychological preparation of  soldiers for combat operations; mobilize personnel for decisive  and selfless actions during the offensive.    "To mobilize personnel, hold party and Komsomol meetings and  briefings of the party and Komsomol aktiv; conduct political  work with all categories of personnel, particularly with newly  arrived replacements. Submit the political work plan for the  period of preparing for and conducting combat operations to me  for approval by 0930 hours 17 October."  <H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>   Timely dissemination of fire missions to subordinate subunit  commanders and clarification of these missions on the terrain  ensures speed in preparation of accurate fire and reliability of  neutralizing targets. Therefore, the chief of staff begins  work planning the artillery battalion's combat operations with  scheduling of fires. He uses pre-prepared forms for speed in  making auxiliary calculations and drawing up combat documents.  He accomplishes scheduling of fires in the following sequence:    a) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for  artillery preparation of the assault (target numbers and size,  shell expenditure established by the 5th RAG Headquarters for  neutralizing each target) and records this in Table 8.    b) He determines the battalion's fire capabilities for this  period, taking into account the number of guns in the batteries.  In this case, they are expressed by the number of shells that  are allotted for carrying out the fire missions for each  shelling: 50 shells in the first (15 minutes) and 324 each in  the third (11 minutes) and fourth (14 minutes). He also records  these data in Table 8. In light of the fact that each battery  has the same number of guns (six each), their fire capabilities  are equal.    c) He allocates the fire missions among the batteries,  taking  into account the directions of the battalion commander. He  designates shell expenditure for batteries for each target  (taking into account the established shell expenditure) so that  it is a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Thus, in the first  shelling an expenditure of 540 shells is established to  neutralize target 114. According to the battalion commander's  decision, three overlapping batteries are to be used to  neutralize it. Fire will be delivered at three range settings  and one azimuth setting. In all, there will be 6 guns X 3 range  settings = 18 gun-mounts in each battery, and 18 X 3 = 54  gun-mounts in the battalion. Consequently, there are 540 : 54  = 10 shells for one gun-mount, and the shell expenditure for  each battery will be 10 X 18 = 180 shells.    A shell expenditure of 324 shells is established to  neutralize target 66 in the third shelling. Three overlapping  batteries are to be used to neutralize the target. Fire will be  delivered at three range settings and two azimuth settings. Each  battery will have 36 gun-mounts, and the battalion will have  108. Consequently, there will be 324 : 108 = 3 shells per  gun-mount. Shell expenditure for each battery will be 3 X 36 =  108 shells.    The results of the calculations are recorded in Table 8.    When distributing the established shell expenditure per  gun-mount for the target in each shelling for each battery,  there may be a shortage or excess of shells. In this case, the  total number of these shells, equal to half or more of the  number of gun mounts of one battery (from 9 to 18), is added to  one of the batteries, if there is a shortage, or subtracted, if  there is an excess. For example, an expenditure of 440 shells  has been established to destroy the target; 144 shells are  allocated to each battery, a total of 432 shells. The remainder  of eight shells, being less than half the number of gun mounts  of one battery, are not allocated additionally to any battery.    d) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for  the period of artillery support of the assault on the position  of first-echelon battalions, between the first and second  positions, and on the position of brigade reserves (target  numbers and size on each line, shell expenditure) and records  the results in Table 9. He checks to see that the shell  expenditure against target 114 on the first line of successive  fire concentration corresponds to the density of fire against  this target in the last shelling of artillery preparation of the  assault. This is necessary to ensure that the transition from  artillery preparation of the assault to artillery support of the  assault is unnoticed.    e) He allocates fire missions for the batteries for the  period of artillery support of the assault. He designates shell  expenditures against targets 223 and 548. In doing so, the shell  expenditure per gun-mount against the targets is given as a  fraction. The main criterion for designating shell expenditure  is that it be a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Let us  examine the allocation of shell expenditure against target 223.  The expenditure is established at 255 shells. Engagement of  the target is done at three range settings and one azimuth  setting. A battery has a total of 18 gun-mounts, and the  battalion has a total of 54. For each gun-mount there are 255:  54 = 4.7 shells. Hence, the shell expenditure for each battery  will be 4.7 X 18 = 85 shells. The multiple of 18 gun-mounts is  72 shells; therefore, the following shell expenditure is  allocated: 4th Battery--72 shells, 5th Battery--108 shells, and  6th Battery--72 shells, for a total of 252 shells.    The results of the calculations are entered in Table 8.    f) He reports to the artillery battalion commander on the  allocation of fire missions to the batteries for the period of  artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. One  copy of the table is given to the artillery battalion commander,  and the other is left at the battalion headquarters for drawing  up the fire plan.    Table 8.

It is planned to expend the remaining 684 shells during this period to neutralize newly reconnoitered targets.      Guided by the allocation of fire missions and the designated  shell expenditure for each target in the shellings, the chief of  staff tasks senior battery officers for preparation of  ammunition.    The fire mission allocation table enables the battalion  commander to allocate fire missions in a short time in the  absence of the chief of staff. This table is particularly  important when the batteries have different numbers of guns,  and, consequently, their different fire capabilities.    Practical experience shows that the battalion fire plan will  not always be drawn up by the time fire missions are to be  assigned. Therefore, the battalion commander uses the prepared  fire mission allocation table to assign missions.    At 1130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d  Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, received from the group staff  an excerpt of the fire plan (Table 9) and a list of target  coordinates (Table 10).

Attachment. List of target coordinates (compiled in format of Table 10, is not attached to fire plan).   Commander of 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, Maj (G. Vishnyakov)   Chief of Staff Capt (O. Lebedev)      The chief of staff plans the relocation of the battalion  based on instructions of the group staff and the battalion  commander in the following sequence: He notes lines on the work  map (see Figure 11) at the boundary the position of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Battalion subunits as of the time of completion  of successive fire concentration with the inscription "RN" (line  of beginning battalion relocation); also marks the battery fire  positions in the designated area; highlights the relocation  route and measures its length (4.5 km); calculates the time  required for relocation (11 minutes for leaving the fire  positions + 14 minutes for moving to new area + 23 minutes for  deployment into battle formation = 48 minutes total); determines  the distance the advancing subunits will cover from the line of  beginning the relocation at the given pace of 3 km/hr (2 km);  puts this distance on the work map and marks it with a line with  the inscription "RG" "S" + 48 minutes ("RG" being the battalion  readiness line, "S" being the relocation signal). This means  that the tank and motorized rifle subunits are expected to reach  this line by the time the battalion is ready to open fire from  the new fire positions.    The chief of staff plans the second relocation in the same  manner.  <H3>  Carrying Out Measures for Preparing Subunits of the 2d  Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, for Combat Operations </H3>   By 1300 hours 17 October, the battalion chief of staff has  drawn up a fire plan and plotted on the work map the available  information on the enemy, the forward edge of defense of  friendly subunits, the battalion's fire missions (according to  coordinates received from the group staff), the base line of  fire, and other data.    Carrying out the measures for preparing the battalion for  combat operations (see Table 7), at 1330 hours the chief of  staff began checking the operability of the computer in the  chief of staff's vehicle and the APK's in the senior battery  officers' vehicles, which he completed by 1400 hours. After  this, he checked the readiness of the weather station  instruments for combat work, checking the operation of sensors  for wind velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity.    On two guns in each battery he checked the sighting devices,  recoil devices, the operation of gun mechanisms, and also  documentation.    At 1800 hours the chief of staff heard a report by the motor  vehicle mechanic on the results of checking the condition of  artillery prime movers and motor vehicles (on the problems  detected and on their refueling), after which he gave  instructions on correcting the problems.    At 1820 hours the chief of staff assembled the battalion  plotters and checked the readiness of fire control instruments  for combat work. On his direction, the battery fire positions  and targets scheduled for artillery preparation and artillery  support of the assault were plotted on the fire control  instruments according to available coordinates, and topographic  data on these targets were calculated and recorded in the  calculated firing data tables.    Next the chief of staff calculated the rate of delivery of  fire for each battery by shellings of artillery preparation and  artillery support of the assault. Thus, the 4th Battery is  allotted an expenditure of 180 shells against target 114 in the  first shelling. Four shells of volley fire are allotted for each  battery for the first minute of the shelling (4X6=24 shells).  The remaining 156 shells (180-24) are expended in 14 minutes  (840 seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is  840:156=5 seconds per round.    When calculating the rate of fire against target 114 in the  last (fourth) shelling (14 minutes) and against the first  successive fire concentration line (3 minutes), the chief of  staff added up the expenditure of shells for each battery  separately (for example, the expenditure for the 6th Battery:  108+36=144 shells, and the time of delivering fire 14+3=17  minutes). Four shells of volley fire are allotted for the first  minute of the shelling (per battery--4X6=24 shells). The  remaining 120 shells (144-24) are expended in 16 minutes (960  seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is  960:120=8 seconds per round.    After receiving data on the enemy and friendly subunits from  the group staff, the chief of staff plotted them on the work map  (see Figure 11).  <H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>   At 0800 hours 17 October, the artillery reconnaissance group  arrived at the battalion fire position area. The chief of the  ARG planned the sequence of work (Figure 12) and, assembling the  group, assigned the mission:    "We have arrived at the battalion fire position area and are  located at the western edge of the brush; look at the map. I  will orient you... (he indicates the direction to one of the  sides of the horizon and shows from right to left local features  that can be seen, comparing their position with the map).    "The enemy is defending to the west at a distance of 2.5 km.    "Gun platoon commanders are to organize selection of fire  positions in the areas: 4th Battery--the near slopes of Hill  83.0; 6th Battery--at the single tree; 5th Battery--here, in the  vicinity of the brush. The site for the battalion fire control  post is in this same brush.    "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. The minimum  firing range is 2,500 meters.    "Begin work on selecting fire positions after conducting  radiation and chemical reconnaissance in this area and checking  the terrain for mines. The sequence for the check is: fire  positions of the 5th, 4th, and 6th batteries. Considering that  deployment of the batteries will take place at night, pay  attention to the selection of access routes to the fire  positions and natural cover for prime movers and motor vehicles.  At each fire position clear the field of fire and prepare  emplacements for guns, ammunition shelters, and slit trenches  for personnel. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable  objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform  engineer work at night and complete it by 0600 hours 18 October.  Work is to start after approval of the selected fire positions.    "Topogeodetic survey of the fire positions is to be done by  map using the navigation equipment of the senior battery  officer's vehicle; grid azimuths of the bearing to aiming points  are by the gyroscopic method. Topogeodetic survey is to be  checked by performing it again from different spot heights.    "Before 0930 hours today, the dosimeter operator-instructor  is to check the terrain in the planned fire position areas of  the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and on the routes between them  for the presence of radioactive and chemical contamination, and  report the results to me.    "Pvt Novikov is to use a mine detector to check the terrain  in the fire position areas of the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries  and on the routes between them for the presence of mines. Report  the results to me.    "The senior topogeodetic surveyor is to perform orientation  of the vehicle using a gyrocompass. Survey the positions from a  spot height--elevation from spot height 83.0, x =  19,975, y = 60,995; terminal point--road junction,  x = 19,305, y = 60,615."          Personnel of the artillery reconnaissance group began  carrying out the assigned tasks. After completion of work by the  dosimeter operator-instructor and the gun crew member with the  mine detector, the ARG chief heard their reports on the results  of reconnaissance, personally selected the 5th Battery fire  positions, and performed work in accordance with articles 70 and  71 of the manual for combat work of artillery fire subunits, and  also selected the site for the battalion fire control post. He  then distributed the 5th Battery personnel that arrived with him  to perform engineer work, taking one of the sergeants with him,  departed for the fire position of the 4th Battery fire position  and then the 6th Battery.    At the fire positions of the 4th and 6th Batteries, the ARG  commander heard reports from the platoon gun commanders on the  results of work in selecting fire positions and recorded the  coordinates of the fire positions. Here is a variant of the  report by a fire platoon commander of the 4th Battery:    "A fire position has been selected (he shows it on the  terrain). The location of the main gun and other guns is marked  by pegs; the base line is shown using landmarks; these are the  main, alternate, and night aiming points (he shows them on the  terrain). From the fire position it is possible to fire at  minimum range: on the base line--1,800 meters; with a deflection  shift of 3-00 to the right--1,700 meters; and with a deflection  shift of 3-00 to the left--2,100 meters. Radiation and chemical  reconnaissance of the fire position area has been conducted, and  the area has been checked for mines. No contamination or mines  were discovered. These are the locations of the observation  post, prime movers and motor vehicles, and access roads (he  shows them on the terrain). The chosen fire position makes it  possible to deploy the fire platoons at night without being  detected. Its coordinates are: x = 19,770,  y = 60,915, h = 80. The coordinates will  be updated after topogeodetic survey has been completed."    At 1045 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  and battery commanders arrived at the 5th Battery fire position.    The chief of the artillery reconnaissance group reported to  the battalion commander: "We are located at the western edge of  the brush (he shows him on the terrain and on the map). Ahead of  us is the unnamed height running to the west. On the right is  spot height 83.0...(he indicates the local features).    "The artillery reconnaissance group has selected the fire  positions: for the 4th Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill  83.0, coordinates x = 19,770, y = 60,915,  h = 80; for the 5th Battery--here, coordinates  x = 19,430, y = 61,680. h = 82;  for the 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the single tree,  coordinates x = 18,885, y = 61,050,  h = 80 (he points them out on the terrain).    "No contamination or mines were discovered in the fire  position area.    "The selected fire positions make it possible to fire at  assigned ranges and to accommodate all guns of the batteries;  natural cover has been selected to accommodate prime movers and  motor vehicles. Access roads are satisfactory. Topogeodetic  survey and engineer preparation of the fire positions are being  conducted.    "Taking into account the expected delivery of ammunition at  night, areas for unloading shells on the ground have been  selected 20-40 meters from each gun."    The battalion commander approved the ARG chief's report and  issued the following instructions:    For Local Security and Self-Defense. "The axis of  Hill 90.3 and Hill `Bob' is a likely avenue of tank approach.  Post an observation post in each battery for the period of  conducting engineer preparation of the fire positions. Check  personnel's knowledge of established warning signals. After  deployment of the fire platoons, in each battery assign missions  for combating tanks in the event of their breakthrough."    For Organizing Communications. "For the senior  signals officer. These are the approximate positions of the  battery and battalion command and observation posts, and the  group's observation post and command post...(he indicates them  on the map). The battery fire positions were indicated earlier.    "Ensure communications with the battery command and  observation post and fire platoons, by landline prior to  initiation of artillery preparation of the assault and by radio  after its initiation and during the course of the offensive.  Receive weather data on the meteorological information radio  net; warning signals are to be received and transmitted over all  communications channels. Readiness for landline communications  is at 2000 hours 17 October; readiness for radio communications  is at 0430 hours 18 October. Submit the radio and landline  communications diagram at 1800 hours 17 October."    The battalion commander ordered the battery commanders:  "Depart for your batteries to supervise work for preparation,  topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of the fire  positions; by 1300 hours check the organization and conduct of  reconnaissance from the battery observation posts and study the  terrain in the enemy dispositions; arrive at the battalion  command and observation post by 1430 hours, where the combat  order will be issued. I am departing for the battalion command  and observation post and then for the commander of the 5th RAG  to participate in commander's reconnaissance."    During the course of receiving the mission from the  battalion  commander, the intelligence officer plotted the necessary data  on the work map, after which he began planning reconnaissance.    During the planning, he determined the following:  reconnaissance missions for the subunits; zones of  reconnaissance for each battery; areas of special attention;  approximate locations of the battery and battalion command and  observation posts; the position of the radar, its sector of  surveillance, and area of special attention; the numbering of  targets for the subunits; and the procedure for and time of  submitting reconnaissance information.    At 0740 hours 17 October, the reconnaissance subunits of the  5th RAG arrived in the vicinity of the command and observation  post on the southeastern slopes of Hill 88.0. Having left the  reconnaissance subunits in the shelter, the battalion  intelligence officer participated in the work of the 5th RAG  intelligence officer to clarify the reconnaissance missions on  the terrain. As a result, the battalion intelligence officer  clarified: the code names of local features; reference points;  the position of the forward edge of the enemy defenses and the  most important objectives (targets); the forward edge of  friendly subunits; the area of the battalion command and  observation post; and the approximate position of the group  observation post. Here the artillery reconnaissance radar was  turned over to the battalion intelligence officer.    At 0750 hours 17 October, the battalion intelligence officer  assigned missions to the battery headquarters platoon commanders  and the senior radar officer:    "We are located at Hill 88.0. Ahead of us is a group of  yellow bushes--the line to the west. These are the code names of  local features and the reference points...(he indicates them on  the terrain).    "The enemy is defending with the forward edge running on the  following line...(he indicates it on the terrain).    "The battalion is tasked to conduct reconnaissance in the  following zone: on the right--Hill `Bob,' spot height 92.0; on  the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, mound 3. The zones  of reconnaissance for the batteries are: for the 4th Battery...,  for the 5th Battery..., for the 6th Battery... (he indicates  them on the terrain).    "Reconnaissance missions are: before 2100 hours 17 October,  determine the location of strong points, the presence of  artificial obstacles, particularly on the unnamed hill at the  road, in the vicinity of the brush, and at the road junction;  reconnoiter targets and determine their coordinates--fire  weapons (particularly antitank weapons), and also observation  posts of mortar platoons in the vicinity of the bushes, the  dairy farm, and the single grove.    "Select positions for the command and observation posts: 4th  Battery--at Hill `Bob'; 5th Battery and the battalion command  and observation post--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0; 6th  Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he indicates them  on the terrain).    "Select a position for the radar on the southern slopes of  Hill 88.0. Begin reconnaissance at 0830 hours 17 October.  Communications will be the landline. During the course of  combat, relocate jointly with the battalion command and  observation post ready for deployment at its halt points,  approximately in the vicinity of the road junction, 300 meters  east of the bridge. Signals are... (he informs them of the  signals).    "Target numbering is as follows: mortar batteries: 4th  Battery--20-22, 5th Battery--23-24, 6th Battery--25-26,  battalion command and observation post--27-30; the remaining  targets: 4th Battery--60-63, 5th Battery--64-67, 6th  Battery--68-71, battalion command and observation post--72-76,  and the radar site--71-80.    "Submit reconnaissance reports to the battalion command and  observation post immediately after detecting a target. Begin  checking the operation of reconnaissance instruments and  determine their individual corrections, after which you will  begin selecting locations for the command and observation posts  and conducting reconnaissance."    At 0930 hours 17 October, the intelligence officer of the 2d  Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the command and observation post  of the 1st Bn (on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0) located in  the combat formations of the defending 19th Motorized Rifle Regt  and reported to the battalion commander: "Sr Lt Mayorov,  intelligence officer of the 2d Bn, has arrived to receive  reconnaissance reports on the enemy."    The intelligence officer clarified the following on the  terrain: the forward edge of the enemy's defenses in the sector  of Hill 90.3, the dairy farm; the location and numbering of  defending subunits; the location and approximate boundaries of  reconnoitered platoon strong points; the location of individual  targets, minefields, and artificial obstacles; the line where  the position of brigade reserves was being prepared and the  dispositions of reserves; where and which artillery batteries  and mortar platoons had been reconnoitered; and the strength of  enemy subunits.    The intelligence officer received an excerpt from the  reconnaissance report register (Table 12) and a sketch plan of  targets (Figure 13).          At 1020 hours, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt,  arrived at the command and observation post, where he heard the  report by the intelligence officer on available reconnaissance  information:    "We are located on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he  indicates this on the map). Ahead is a group of yellow  bushes--the line to the west.    "These are the code names of local features and reference  points received from the 5th RAG intelligence officer and  additionally assigned by me... (he indicates them on the  terrain).    "The command and observation posts are deployed as follows:  the battalion command and observation post is here; the command  and observation posts for the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and  the position of the radar are as shown...

"The following reconnaissance information has been received  from the 1st Arty Bn:    "--The forward edge of the enemy's defenses runs along the  line: the eastern slopes of Hill 90.3, the hill at the  road--`Banan,' the nameless hill, and the dairy farm. Part of  the forces of two motorized infantry armored groups (2d Bn, 28th  Inf Regt, and 1st Bn, 13th Inf Regt) are defending on this  sector at the positions of the first echelon battalions. The  boundary between them is 300-350 meters south of Hill `Banan'  (he indicates this on the terrain). A company of the battalion's  second echelon is defending in the vicinity of the individual  grove, the cutting on the road, pit 4.    "The enemy suffered heavy losses in previous battles, and  the  strength of his subunits is 55-60 percent.    "Platoon strong points (see the sketch plan of targets,  Figure 13, and the reconnaissance report register, Table 12)  have been reconnoitered: there are two at the forward edge and  one in the rear.

Mayorov)      The artillery battalion commander assigned the intelligence  officer additional tasks: clarify the boundaries of the platoon  strong points; make final reconnaissance of the dispositions of  weapons, particularly antitank weapons, in and outside the  strong points.    At 1230 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  arrived at the location of the 5th RAG commander on the western  edge of brush "Melkiy" and, as a result of participating in his  commander's reconnaissance, clarified the following: the code  names of local features and reference points; the combat  formation of the enemy's 4th Brigade and the alignment of its  defense (disposition of enemy strong points, artillery, and  reserves and the possible axes of counterattack); the zone of  advance and combat missions of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regt,  fire missions of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, for the periods of  artillery preparation and support of the assault (the centers  and size of targets on the terrain), and the fire missions of  other artillery subunits in the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn's zone of  advance.    During the course of the group commander's update on the  procedure for cooperation, the artillery battalion commander  clarified the following: the artillery battalion's time of  movement and deployment to the fire position area, the order of  accomplishing fire missions during artillery preparation of the  assault, safety measures when tank and motorized rifle subunits  pass through the battalion's fire position area, the final  coordination line and how to deliver fire in the event the 1st  Motorized Rifle Bn is delayed in reaching this line, the  procedure for fire control during the course of artillery  support of the assault, the start and order of relocation of  command and observation posts and fire platoons, the order of  accomplishment of missions by the artillery battalion when  supporting commitment of the second echelon to battle and  repelling counterattacks by enemy reserves, the order of  assuming command and control of the group in the event the group  command and observation post is disabled, and control and  coordination signals.    During the course of the commander's reconnaissance, the  artillery battalion commander plotted on the work map data on  the enemy dispositions, fire missions, and other information.    At 1320 hours 17 October, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn,  8th Arty Regt, arrived at Hill 88.0 at the location of the  commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, and reported  to him:    "Comrade Major! Major Vishnyakov, commander of the 2d Arty  Bn, 8th Arty Regt, reporting.    "An artillery battalion of 152-mm D-1 howitzers comprised of  three six-gun batteries is assigned to support the 1st Bn, 5th  Motorized Rifle Regt. The artillery battalion is presently  located in the area... (he indicates it on the map) and is  preparing to carry out the assigned missions. It has 1.0 unit of  fire of ammunition and 0.7 fuelings of fuel. By 2100 hours 17  October, 2.5 units of fire will be delivered. By 1800 hours 17  October the motor transport will be refueled.    "In the artillery preparation of the assault, the battalion  is to neutralize two platoon strong points, targets 114 and 66.  The battalion's fire capabilities will be used fully during this  period. In the artillery support of the assault, the artillery  battalion is to support the battalion's offensive with a double  successive fire concentration; the artillery battalion is to  participate in the first group of artillery firing and  neutralize target 114 on the first line, on the signal 'Bars'  and target 223 on the second line, on the signal `Volk.'    "During development of the assault between the first and  second positions and when repelling possible counterattacks by  enemy brigade reserves, the artillery battalion is to be ready  to deliver, in depth, concentrated fire against target 174 and a  `Pikhta-2' fixed barrage. Upon breakthrough of the position of  brigade reserves, the assault is to be supported by a single  successive fire concentration; the artillery battalion is to  neutralize target 444 on the first line, on the signal `Rys' and  target 548 on the second line, on the signal `Shakal.'    "In addition to neutralizing these targets, during this  period the artillery battalion, taking into account the number  of rounds allotted, is capable of additionally neutralizing with  a density of 0.5 two platoon strong points or two artillery  batteries (two mortar platoons) or seven-eight single targets.    "The fire position area is: Hill 83.0, the single tree, the  brush (he indicates this on the map). The line of the command  and observation post is: Hill `Bob,' Hill 88.0 (he indicates  this on the terrain). The artillery battalion will be ready to  open fire at 0630 hours 18 October."    At 1330 hours, the commander of the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn  began conducting commander's reconnaissance, in which the  commanders of organic and attached subunits participated. During  the commander's reconnaissance, they studied the terrain on the  axis of the battalion's advance, the code names of local  features, reference points, the alignment of the enemy's  defenses (the outline of the forward edge, and the dispositions  of enemy strong points and the degree of their engineer  preparation, the positions of fire weapons, especially antitank  weapons, the position of other objectives, approaches to the  forward edge of the enemy's defenses, the presence and nature of  obstacles, possible lines of attack of enemy helicopters, and  axes of counterattacks by enemy reserves).    The following were updated: attack frontage, the direction  of  concentration of the main efforts, and the combat mission of the  battalion; what enemy fire weapons, control posts, and other  targets were to be destroyed by artillery fire from  indirect-fire positions and by fire from guns and tanks  allocated for direct firing; the fire positions of organic and  attached fire weapons; the location of passages in barriers and  across obstacles; the time for clearing them (setting them up);  and the direction of relocation of the battalion command and  observation post.    From the combat order issued by the commander of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Bn, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty  Regt, clarified the following:    1. Defending ahead of the offensive frontage of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Bn at positions of the first-echelon battalions  are two reinforced motorized infantry platoons of the motorized  infantry armor group of the 2d Bn, 28th Inf Regt, and two  motorized infantry platoons of the motorized infantry armored  group of the 1st Bn, 13th Inf Regt, with one platoon from each  of the motorized infantry armored groups on the forward edge and  one from each in the rear. The enemy defenses are being improved  over two days. During the course of the offensive by the 5th  Motorized Rifle Regt, a counterattack by the brigade reserve is  possible in the direction of mound 3, "Kruglaya" grove.    2. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn with reinforcements is to  destroy the defending enemy with an attack from the line of  march in the vicinity of Hill "Banan," (exc.) the dairy farm,  "Kruglaya" grove, and seize line (exc.) Hill 92.0, pit 4; the  subsequent mission is to develop the offensive, rout the enemy  brigade reserve in cooperation with adjacent battalions, and  seize the line the group of trees, mound 3; it is then to  advance in the direction of Borki, Peschanaya (not on the map).    3. Ahead of the offensive frontage of the 1st Motorized  Rifle  Bn, during the artillery preparation and artillery support of  the assault the artillery and other fire weapons are to  neutralize and destroy the fire weapons in the strong points and  outside them. The safety limit with the start of the assault  is... (he indicates it on the terrain).    On the right, the 3d Bn, 7th Motorized Rifle Regt, is to  destroy the enemy in its strong points on Hill 90.3 and advance  in the direction of the brush, Novoye.    The boundary with them is... (he indicates it on the map).    On the left, the 4th Motorized Rifle Company, 2d Motorized  Rifle Bn, is to destroy the enemy in its strong point south of  the dairy farm and advance in the direction of the northern  outskirts of Zbori, Hill "Figurnaya."    The boundary with the 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, is...  (he indicates it on the map).    Subunits of the 1st Bn, 19th Motorized Rifle Regt, are  defending in direct contact with the enemy on a line with Hill  "Bob," Gushchino.    4. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn, concentrating main efforts in  the direction of Hill 88.0, "Kruglaya" grove, Borki, and using  artillery fire and air strikes, with an attack from the line of  march by reinforced first-echelon companies dismounted is to  destroy enemy subunits at the position of first-echelon  battalions and seize this line; it is to develop the offensive  in the direction of the bridge, Borki, and in cooperation with  adjacent battalions defeat the enemy brigade reserves and seize  this line. The battalion's combat formation is in two echelons:  the 1st and 2d reinforced motorized rifle companies in the first  echelon, and the 3d Motorized Rifle Company in the second. The  attached tank company is to be used for cooperation with the  first-echelon companies. When repelling counterattacks by  brigade reserves, establish closer cooperation with the 2d  Motorized Rifle Bn and the regiment's antitank reserve.    5. The 1st Motorized Rifle Company with a rocket launcher  platoon and engineer platoon, in cooperation with the 1st Tank  Platoon, 1st Tank Company, is to attack from the line of march  and destroy the enemy in the strong points in the areas of Hill  "Banan" and the road junction and seize them; it is to further  advance in the direction of the road junction, the bridge. The  4th Battery is to provide support.    The 2d Motorized Rifle Company with an antitank platoon, two  squads from the engineer platoon, in cooperation with the 1st  Tank Company (minus a platoon), is to attack from the line of  march and destroy the enemy in its strong point 400 meters north  of the dairy farm and seize it; it is to further advance in the  direction of the brush, grove "Uzkaya." The 6th Battery is to  provide support.    The 3d Motorized Rifle Company is the battalion second  echelon and during the course of the offensive moves behind the  first echelon in the direction of Hill 88.0, grove "Kruglaya."  The point of commitment to battle is the bridge, the single  house. Upon commitment to battle, a mortar battery is to be  resubordinated to the company. To support the commitment to  battle, the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, is to be ready to neutralize  enemy fire weapons on the nameless hill in front of the line of  commitment to battle.    6. Ammunition expenditure for the day is: 1.5 units for fire  for small arms; 3.5 units of fire for artillery; and 2.5 units  of fire for antiaircraft weapons.    7. Readiness for the offensive is at 0530 hours 18 October.    8. The location of the command and observation post is:  During the move up--at the head of the column of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Company; with the start of the assault--on the  northern slopes of Hill 88.0; during the course of the offensive  it is to move in the direction of the brush, grove "Kruglaya,"  Borki.    Continuing work to organize the battle, the battalion  commander began organizing cooperation, for which he coordinated  the following matters:    (a) During the move up to the final coordination line and  conducting artillery preparation of the assault:    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "The battalion is to move from the assembly area to the line of  deployment into company columns over the route Vidino, Yelovoye,  Hill 77.8, Doni. Column alignment is to be: battalion  headquarters, the 1st Tank Company, the 1st, 2d and 3d motorized  rifle companies, and the supply platoon. Intervals between the  vehicles and subunits are to be 50 meters; speed of movement is  to be 25 km/hr.    "The battalion is to reach the line of deployment into  battalion columns (he indicates on the map) at H-hour -0:57. The  artillery preparation of the assault is to begin at this time,  and the battalion is to advance further under cover of artillery  fire and air strikes.    "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report its  configuration and fire missions."    Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The  duration of the artillery preparation of the assault is 50  minutes; its configuration is four shellings: the first will  last 15 minutes and is to destroy personnel and fire weapons in  the strong points on the forward edge of the enemy defenses; the  second will last 10 minutes and is to destroy targets by direct  fire; the third will last 11 minutes and is to destroy personnel  and fire weapons in strong points deep in the enemy defenses;  the fourth will last 14 minutes and is to destroy personnel and  fire weapons in strong points at the forward edge of the enemy  defenses."    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "The battalion is to reach the line for deployment into company  columns at H-hour -0:28, and the subunits are to proceed further  along the following routes: 1st Motorized Rifle Company..., 2d  Motorized Rifle Company..., 3d Motorized Rifle Company...(he  indicates them on the map). Upon reaching the line (exc.) the  single house, spot height 79.4, the 1st and 2d motorized rifle  companies are to operate by platoons.    "In the event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction or  delivers conventional fire, be prepared to negotiate the  contaminated zones or bypass the area under fire; the 3d  Motorized Rifle Company is to be ready to replace one of the  first-echelon companies that will suffer heavy losses.    "On reaching the line Hill `Bob,' the western slopes of Hill  88.0, the first-echelon companies are to merge and continue  movement behind the tanks at an accelerated pace in squad  columns. Reach the final coordination line at H-hour -0:07 (he  shows it on the terrain). The armored personnel carriers are to  advance in the intervals between the squads from cover to cover  and support the assault by friendly subunits.    "During artillery preparation of the assault, the regiment's  combat engineers are to use explosives to clear passages in the  obstacles, three for each first-echelon company, and mark them  with rectangular markers numbered: 1, 2, and 3 for the 1st  Motorized Rifle Company; 4, 5, and 6 for the 2d Motorized Rifle  Company. The battalion command and observation post is to deploy  on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0.    (b) During execution of the immediate mission:    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "A tank company is to advance from the final coordination line  to the passages in the minefields and cross them. Motorized  riflemen are to advance behind the tanks in squad columns. After  crossing the minefields, subunits are to deploy into an extended  line and, firing on the move, rush behind the tanks to the  forward edge. The order of actions of the armored personnel  carriers is: Half of them are to stop in front of the enemy  obstacles and support the subunits' attack with stationary fire;  the rest are to advance behind the motorized rifle subunits from  cover to cover.    "Artillery battalion commander, report on the beginning and  order of accomplishing artillery support of the assault."    Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery  support of the assault is to commence at H-hour -:07 and be  accomplished with a double successive fire concentration. Fire  is to be opened against the first line on the signal 'Bars' and  delivered forward of the attack frontage of the 1st Motorized  Rifle Bn against target 114--the strong point at the forward  edge of the enemy defenses. Fire is to be delivered  simultaneously against targets on the second line. To ensure an  undetected transition from artillery preparation of the assault  to artillery support of the assault, fire is to be delivered  against target 114 without changing settings, that is, it is to  be a continuation of artillery preparation of the assault. Fire  is to be delivered against this target until the tanks and  motorized riflemen reach the safety limit from our shellbursts.  I will clarify this line... (he indicates it on the terrain)."    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "After the tanks and motorized riflemen reach the safety limit,  a signal is to be given at the direction of the company  commanders--a series of red flares. After receiving this signal,  I will give the signal 'Volk' to shift fire to the second line.  This command will be transmitted to the commander of the 1st Bn,  8th Arty Regt, via the RAG commander.    "The battalions' fire against targets on the third line will  be requested through the RAG commander.    "The advance on the enemy in its strong points is to be  accomplished dismounted. The assets of antitank and rocket  launcher platoons are to be used more fully.    "After seizing the strong point located in `Kruglaya' grove,  the commander of the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is to dispatch a  combat reconnaissance patrol in the direction of pit 4, mound 3  to ascertain the composition and nature of actions of enemy  brigade reserves. If the enemy withdraws, continue the advance.    "Counterattacks by small enemy groups are to be repelled by  fire from all assets, without halting the advance.    "A counterattack by brigade reserves in the direction of  mound 3, 'Kruglaya' grove, should probably be expected after  seizing the first-echelon company strong points. Commander of  the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report what missions the battalion is  to carry out to repel counterattacks by brigade reserves."    Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "When  brigade reserves move up, the battalion will prepare  concentrated fire against target 174 (he indicates it on the  map); when the enemy goes over to a counterattack, the battalion  will prepare a `Pikhta-2' fixed barrage deep into the second  line."    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "To avoid excessive losses, first-echelon companies are to repel  the counterattack with stationary fire in cooperation with the  tank company and antitank reserve, which is to be deployed on a  line with the bridge and the brush. Antitank assets attached  to the companies are to move up to convenient positions, taking  into account the nature of the terrain.    "Depending on the results of the counterattack, the 3d  Motorized Rifle Company, the second echelon of the 1st Bn, 5th  Motorized Rifle Regt, will be committed to battle from the  planned line to deliver a strike against the flank of the  counterattacking enemy.    "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, what missions is the  battalion to carry out to support the commitment of the 3d  Motorized Rifle Company?"    Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The  battalion will prepare concentrated fire against target 67."    (c) During execution of the subsequent mission:    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt:  "After execution of the immediate mission, battalion subunits  are to continue the offensive. After commitment of the 3d  Motorized Rifle Company to battle, the 2d Motorized Rifle  Company is to be withdrawn to the reserve.    "The battalion is to break through the position of the  brigade reserves on the move.    "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report the order of  artillery support of the assault during breakthrough of the  brigade reserves' position."    Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery  support of the assault on the brigade reserves' position is to  be accomplished by successive fire concentration against two  lines. Fire is to be opened against the first line on signal  `Rys' after the battalion subunits reach a distance of  1,500-1,700 meters from the forward edge and will be delivered  until they reach the safety limit. Fire will then be shifted to  the second line on the signal 'Shakal' from the maneuver  battalion commander."    Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Bn:  "The signals are... (he announces them)."    During the course of participating in the maneuver battalion  commander's reconnaissance, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty  Regt, plotted on the work map enemy data, the maneuver  battalion's missions, and the line of commitment to battle of  the second echelon (3d Motorized Rifle Company).    At 1420 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  returned to the battalion command and observation post, where  the battery commanders had arrived. The artillery battalion  commander heard reports by the intelligence officer on the newly  reconnoitered targets and by the battery commanders on their  study of the terrain in the enemy's dispositions. The battalion  commander then clarified the code names of local features,  reference points, the disposition of the enemy's defenses, the  disposition of fire weapons in strong points (targets 114 and  223), the combat mission of the maneuver battalion, and the  artillery battalion's fire missions for artillery preparation  and support of the assault (the targets and their boundaries  across the front and in the rear).    At 1430 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  issued the combat order:    "1. The enemy is defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade  on a line with the forward edge running along the eastern slopes  of Hill 90.3, Hill 'Banan,' the dairy farm (he indicates this on  the terrain). Platoon strong points have been  reconnoitered--targets 114 and 223; the strong points are  equipped with fighting and communication trenches and weapon  emplacements; minefields have been set up in front of the  forward edge and in the intervals between strong points.    "Reserves of up to a motorized infantry battalion are  probably in the vicinity of... (he indicates on the map). Two  batteries of 155-mm howitzers are in the area of... (he  indicates on the map).    "2. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn with the 1st Tank Company and  a combat engineer platoon will advance on a front 300 meters  north of Hill `Banan,' (exc.) the dairy farm. The immediate  mission is to destroy enemy personnel and fire weapons in the  first-echelon company strong points in the area of Hill `Banan,'  (exc.) the dairy farm, `Kruglaya' grove, and seize the line  along Hill 92.0, pit 4; the subsequent mission is, in  cooperation with adjacent battalions, to rout the enemy brigade  reserve and seize the line along the group of trees, mound 3;  advance further in the direction of Borki, Peschanaya (not on  the map).    "The combat formation is in two echelons. The 1st Tank  Company in first, the 1st Motorized Rifle Company on the right,  and the 2d Motorized on the left; the 3d Motorized Rifle Company  in second echelon. The line of commitment to battle of the 3d  Motorized Rifle Company is the bridge, (exc.) the road.    "The 3d Bn, 7th Motorized Rifle Regt, is to advance on the  right. The boundary with it is the single house, (exc.) Hill  92.0, spot height 75.0.    "The 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, is to advance on the  left. The boundary with it is spot height 79.4, (exc.) the dairy  farm, pit 4, mound 3.    "Subunits of the 1st Bn, 19th Motorized Rifle Regt, are  defending in direct contact with the enemy.    "3. In the zone of advance of the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn,  targets 115, 223, and 333 are to be neutralized by assets of the  senior commander (he indicates the targets on the terrain).    "4. The 2d Arty Bn is to be a part of the 5th RAG and  support  the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn. Artillery support of the assault is  to be 50 minutes, from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07. There are to  be four shellings: the first will last--15 minutes; the  second--10 minutes; the third--11 minutes; and the fourth--14  minutes.    "The artillery battalion's fire position area is the  southern  slope of Hill 83.0, the single tree, and the brush.    "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00.    "Settings for firing for effect are to be determined by the  full preparation method.    "The artillery battalion is to move up to the fire position  area in the regimental column over route No 1 (he indicates on  the map).    "During the course of the battle, the artillery battalion is  to move at full strength to the new fire position area: (exc.)  Hill 92.0, (exc.) 'Kruglaya' grove, the brush. Relocation is to  commence after completion of fire against the second successive  fire concentration line (target 223). The route of relocation  is... (he indicates it on the map).    "5. My orders are:    "The 4th Battery is to support the 1st Motorized Rifle  Company; the 6th Battery is to support the 2d Motorized Rifle  Company; and the 5th Battery is to be the stand-by battery.    "During the period of artillery preparation of the assault,  neutralize the following: in the first shelling--target 114,  overlapping fire, expenditure of 180 rounds each; in the second  shelling--do not deliver fire; in the third shelling--target 66,  overlapping fire, expenditure of 108 rounds each; in the fourth  shelling--target 114, overlapping fire, expenditure of 108  rounds each.    "Artillery support of the assault is to be by dual  successive  fire concentration. The artillery battalion is to be part of the  first artillery group.    "The first line `Bars'--target 114, estimated duration of  fire is three minutes, and expenditure of 36 rounds each for the  4th and 6th batteries; second line `Volk'--target 223, estimated  duration of fire is 17 minutes, and expenditure of 72 rounds for  the 4th and 6th batteries and 108 rounds for the 5th Battery; at  H-hour -:03, the 5th Battery is to be ready to neutralize newly  reconnoitered targets.    "Support the commitment to battle of the second echelon--the  3d Motorized Rifle Company, be ready to deliver fire against  target 67.    "During artillery accompaniment of the offensive:    --"When developing the attack between the first and second  positions and when repelling possible counterattacks by enemy  brigade reserves, be ready to deliver concentrated fire against  target 174 and `Pikhta-2' fixed barrage fire;    --"When breaking through the brigade reserves' position with  an attack on the move, artillery support is to be accomplished  by a single successive fire concentration. The first line  `Rys'--target 444, estimated duration of fire is 17 minutes, and  expenditure of 144 rounds each for the 4th and 6th batteries and  126 rounds for the 5th Battery; the second line `Shakal'--target  548, estimated duration of fire is eight minutes, and  expenditure is 72 rounds each for the 4th and 5th batteries and  54 rounds for the 6th Battery. Be ready to neutralize newly  reconnoitered targets;    --"Support the commitment to battle of the regiment's second  echelon with a 12-minute shelling, ready to deliver fire against  target 601 with overlapping fire and expenditure of 36 rounds  each;    --"Repel the counterattack by enemy division reserves, ready  to deliver massed fire `Mars-1,' concentrated fire against  target 701, and fixed barrage fire `D.'    "Fire positions have been selected earlier. The locations of  command and observation posts are: 4th Battery--on Hill `Bob';  6th Battery--on the southern slope of Hill 88.0; 5th Battery and  the battalion command and observation posts--on the northern  slope of Hill 88.0; the radar position is on Hill 88.0.    "6. Ammunition expenditure for the day per gun is 210,  including: 66 for artillery preparation of the assault, 90 for  artillery support of the assault, and 54 for artillery  accompaniment.    "7. Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October.    "8. The artillery battalion command and observation post is  to be here at 1630 hours 17 October. The battalion fire control  post is to be near the 5th Battery fire position at 0430 hours  18 October. The direction of relocation of the battalion command  and observation post is: Hill 88.0, 'Kruglaya' grove, Borki.    "In the event the battalion command and observation post is  knocked out of action, the commander of the 6th Battery is to  assume command and control of the battalion until the chief of  staff arrives."    The battalion intelligence officer recorded the verbal  combat  order.    Next the battalion commander clarified the cooperation  procedures:    (a) For the moving up and deployment of the battalion:    "The artillery battalion is to move up from the staging area  under the direction of the chief of staff. During daylight  hours, study the access routes to the fire position area and the  area for sheltering the prime movers. By 0400 hours 18 October,  dispatch one sergeant from each battery to the road intersection  (he indicates it on the map) to meet the fire platoons. To  ensure safety in passing through the fire position area by tank  and motorized rifle subunits, post a soldier with flares on the  flanks of each battery's fire position. Lay out on the ground  ammunition to be expended during artillery preparation and  artillery support of the assault."    (b) For carrying out missions during artillery preparation  of  the assault:    "The laying of guns against target 114 and their loading are  to be accomplished on the command `Buran' (two-three minutes  before commencement of artillery preparation). Commence  artillery preparation on the command `Buran, fire.' On this same  command, radio operation is without restriction.    "In the event communications are disrupted, fire missions  are  to be carried out according to the times in the battalion's fire  plan.    "Passages in enemy obstacles are to be cleared by detonation  and marked by rectangular markers. The artillery battalion is to  use passage No 3 (he indicates on the terrain) for relocation.    "Companies are to deploy into combat formation between  H-hour  -:12 and H-hour -:09, reach the final coordination line at  H-hour -:07, and dismount. Battery commanders are to coordinate  a meeting with the commanders of supported companies and the  procedures for joint actions during the course of the offensive.    "During the transition from artillery preparation to  artillery support of the assault, do not permit pauses in the  delivery of fire."    (c) When carrying out missions during artillery support of  the assault:    "At H-hour -:07, on signal `Bars, fire,' the 4th and 6th  batteries are to continue to fire against target 114 at the same  rate as during artillery preparation of the assault. The 5th  Battery is to be ready to neutralize newly detected targets.  First-echelon companies, negotiating the obstacle passages, are  to reach the safety limit by H-hour -:04 (he shows it on the  terrain). At this moment the company and platoon commanders are  to give a signal with red flares. Stop on my command `Bars.' On  the command `Volk, fire,' the batteries are to shift fire to the  second successive fire concentration line against target 223.    "Taking advantage of the artillery fire, tank and motorized  rifle subunits are to attack and seize the enemy strong points.  The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th batteries  are to be relocated together with the company commanders.  Battery fire during the course of the relocation is to be  controlled during short halts.    "Fire platoons are to relocate to the new fire position area  on the signal `Motor.' The chief of staff is to dispatch an  artillery reconnaissance group under the command of the  commanders of the second fire platoons to select fire positions.    "Deploy into combat formation on the signal `Strela.'"    (d) For carrying out missions during artillery accompaniment  of the offensive in depth:    "When the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reaches the line  `Kruglaya' grove, pit 4, a counterattack by enemy brigade  reserves is possible from the direction of mound 3, `Kruglaya'  grove. The battalion is to repel the enemy counterattack in  cooperation with the 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt (the  adjacent unit on the left). The antitank reserve is to deploy on  a line from the bridge to the brush. To repel the counterattack,  the artillery battalion will prepare concentrated fire against  target 174, engaging the enemy during the move up and  deployment, and fixed barrage fire deep in `Pikhta-2,' firing  against the second line (he indicates it on the map). In the  event individual tanks or small groups of enemy motorized  infantry break through to the fire position, destroy them in  cooperation with the antitank reserve of the 5th Motorized Rifle  Regiment by direct fire and RPG's.    "Target designation signals and procedures are as follows...  (he clarifies them for the battery commanders). The signal for  assuming command and control of the battalion in the event the  battalion command and observation post is knocked out of  commission is `Zvezda.' The commander of the 6th Battery is to  have the necessary data on his work map for command and control  of the battalion."    At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  passed the following data to the battalion chief of staff:    --The artillery battalion's mission for supporting the  commitment to battle of the battalion second echelon (target 67,  x = 17,540, y = 53,320, h = 90,  frontage 250, depth 200, on-call fire);    --During the move up the artillery battalion column will be  met at the road intersection (1,962).    At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander  organizes reconnaissance of fire weapons in the strong  points--targets 114 and 223. Special attention is concentrated  on reconnaissance of all types of fire weapons in the platoon  stronghold--target 114.    The artillery battalion commander and intelligence officer  summarize the reconnaissance results received from the battery  commanders, plot the data on a large-scale field map, and  compare them with reconnaissance reports received from the 1st  Artillery Battalion of the 19th RAG. Observation in the  assigned sectors continues with the onset of darkness. Terrain  in the vicinity of the strong points is illuminated with  illumination rounds from the 1st Battery from the temporary fire  position to reconnoiter individual targets at night.  <H3>  Withdrawal and Deployment of the Artillery Battalion;  Checking Readiness </H3>   At 1900 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d Arty  Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the regimental headquarters at the  staging area, where he received instructions on the order of the  battalions move up to the fire position area.    Based on the instructions received at the regimental  headquarters and from the artillery battalion commander, the  chief of staff issued instructions to the battery senior  officers:    "The enemy is defending on the previous line. The artillery  battalion is to move up to the fire position area in regimental  column behind the 1st Arty Bn. The head of the column is to pass  the starting point--the western outskirts of Peski--at 0230  hours 18 October. Speed of movement is to be 20 km/hr. The  column alignment will be: 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries; the  administrative squad; the workshop. The head of the column is to  reach the edge of the grove along the road by 0210 hours. Only  parking lights are to be turned on during travel over the route.  Observers are to be designated on each vehicle. Individual  protective gear is to be at the ready. I will travel at the head  of the artillery battalion column.    "Range and azimuth settings are to be determined by the full  preparation method. Corrections are to be computed at grid  azimuths 43-00 and 48-00 at a range of three, seven, and 11 km  on the second charge. Computed weather corrections are to be  received from the fire control post, and computed corrections  charts are to be made. Coordinates of the fire positions are...  (he informs them of the coordinates). A table of calculated  range and azimuth settings is to be prepared in each battery by  2100 hours. Study the fire control signals."    By 2130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff had prepared a  table of calculated range and azimuth settings at the fire  control post using the fire control director and computer. By  this time tables were also prepared in the batteries.    At 0400 hours 18 October, the battalion arrived in the area  of the firing position, where they linked up with the chief of  the ARG and representatives of each of the batteries. The  battery occupied its own firing position.    At 0430 hours 18 October, the battalion commander arrived at  the fire control point, heard the Chief of Staff's report on  measures taken in the battalion in preparation for combat  operations, studied it, signed off on it and took the firing  table with him.    Next the commander and his deputy for political affairs  began  checking the readiness of the 4th and 6th batteries. They  checked the following: accuracy of lining up of guns on the  base line; preparation and distribution of apportionment of  ammunition by shellings at each gun; knowledge of fire missions  and the order of carrying them out by the senior battery  officers and gun commanders; the availability of firing data  sheets for the gun commanders and computed grid and azimuth  settings for the senior battery officer; the accuracy of  computing grid and azimuth settings; the operation of landline  communications and readiness of radios for operation; and the  degree of engineer preparation of the fire positions.

Computed data are figured for all targets indicated in the fire plan      The check of readiness of the 5th Battery was accomplished  by  the artillery battalion chief of staff.    At 0500 hours 18 October, the senior officer of the 5th  Battery made a calibration firing of a lot of propellant charges  with the artillery battalion's reference piece (the base piece  of the 5th Battery) from a temporary fire position of one of the  batteries of the 19th RAG using the ABS of his artillery  battalion and reported to the battalion chief of staff: "The  total muzzle velocity deviation of the rounds for the reference  piece is +1.2 percent for lot 5-86-79 and +1.3 percent for lot  5-85-73."    The chief of staff relayed these data to the battery  commanders for updating the computed settings.  <H5>  Artillery Battalion's Actions During Reconnaissance in Force </H5>   Reconnaissance in force is conducted on the decision of the  senior commander to clarify data on the grouping of the enemy  and his actions, to disclose the fire plan in the defense, to  verify the enemy's presence on the occupied positions in front  of our advance, and so forth. Prisoners, models of weapons,  and documents are captured during the course of reconnaissance  in force. It can be conducted both in the daytime and at night,  24 hours or several hours before the start of an offensive.  Based on experience of the Great Patriotic War, forces from a  company up to a battalion are assigned to conduct reconnaissance  in force, and one-two artillery (mortar) battalions are assigned  to provide fire support.    Reconnaissance in force usually begins following a 10- to  15-minute artillery shelling. If a shelling is not conducted,  artillery subunits are ready to open fire immediately.    The time for conducting reconnaissance in force is limited  and is about 20-40 minutes. During this time, all personnel of  the command and observation post conduct reconnaissance of the  enemy in the assigned zones and sectors, fix the location of  detected fire weapons, and update existing reconnaissance  information.    The information received is processed at the headquarters in  the shortest possible time and used to update planned fire  missions for artillery subunits for artillery preparation and  artillery support of the assault. Coordinates of targets  designated for neutralization may be updated, targets may be  canceled, or others may be designated.    The following is based on conditions of the above tactical  example.    At 0520 hours 18 October, the artillery battalion commander  arrived at the RAG commander's observation post, reported to him  on the battalion's readiness, and submitted the fire plan, which  the RAG commander approved.    He received instructions from the 5th RAG commander: "At  0640  hours 18 October, a motorized rifle company of the defending  battalion is to conduct reconnaissance in force in the direction  of Hill 88.0, `Kruglaya' grove. It is to use all assets to  reconnoiter and clarify the disposition of enemy fire weapons in  its strongholds--targets 114 and 115, and in the interval  between them. Report results."    The reconnaissance in force began following a five-minute  shelling by artillery from the 19th RAG. The company's assault,  which advanced 250-300 meters, was met with enemy submachinegun,  machinegun, antitank, and mortar fire. The company hit the dirt  and, subsequently, was withdrawn to the previous positions by  order of the senior commander.    During the course of the reconnaissance in force, the  coordinates were determined for an ATGM launcher, a tank, two  machineguns, the trench from which the submachinegun fire was  coming, and a mortar platoon. The artillery battalion  intelligence officer plotted this and earlier received  reconnaissance information on a large-scale field map and  reported to the artillery commander and the group intelligence  officer.    The artillery battalion commander and the artillery  battalion  intelligence officer analyzed the disposition of the enemy  weapons and came to the following conclusions. The enemy was  stubbornly defending the occupied positions. The strongholds  reconnoitered earlier were confirmed. The fire weapons were  positioned unevenly (Figure 14) in the platoon  stronghold--target 114. Therefore, to neutralize the stronghold  during artillery preparation of the assault, it was advisable to  allocate the target areas among the batteries in the following  manner: the 4th and 5th batteries would be given the right  portion of the target, with a frontage of 200 meters and a depth  of 160 meters; the 6th battery would be given the left portion  of the target, with a frontage of 130 meters and a depth of 130  meters.          The artillery battalion commander reported the conclusions  and decision for neutralizing target 114 to the commander of the  5th RAG, who approved this decision. The artillery battalion  commander issued the order: "Target 114 is to be neutralized  with the following allocation of target areas among the  batteries: 4th and 5th batteries--x = 19,470,  y = 58,520, frontage 200, depth 160; 6th  Battery--x = 19,305, y = 58,450, frontage  130, depth 130; shell expenditure is as previously established  for each battery during the first and fourth shellings. With the  start of the first shelling, the intelligence officer is to  report the deviation of the 6th Battery's first volley against  target 114."  <H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5> <H5>  Artillery Preparation and Artillery Support of the Assault </H5>   The advance by tank and motorized rifle subunits from the  staging area is preceded by their movement up and deployment  into combat formation. In order to ensure the simultaneous  arrival at the final coordination line at the designated time,  lines are designated for deployment into battalion, company, and  platoon columns, which are also passed at the established time.  The enemy may employ weapons of mass destruction, aviation, and  artillery during the movement up and deployment of our subunits.  The commander of an artillery battalion that ends up in an area  affected by weapons of mass destruction immediately clarifies  the status of the batteries and reconnaissance subunits, takes  steps to immediately restore the battalion's combat  effectiveness, and organizes the neutralization of the effects  of the enemy's employment of weapons of mass destruction.  Disrupted command and control is restored in the shortest  possible time in the battalion, and the battalion prepares to  engage enemy tactical nuclear and chemical offensive weapons,  artillery batteries, and command and control facilities. These  fire missions are assigned by the group commander or are carried  out by the artillery battalion commander on his own initiative.    Subunits are warned by means of a prearranged signal about  the use of retaliatory nuclear strikes against targets located  in the direct proximity of friendly forces. At this signal,  personnel of the command and observation posts of the battalion  and batteries take down the radio antennas, place instruments  under cover, and go into a shelter or take other protective  measures. After the nuclear strike has been delivered, personnel  take their places at the artillery battalion commander's order  and prepare instruments and radios for combat work.    On receipt of H-hour, the artillery battalion commander  converts the provisional time to astronomical time in the  battalion fire plan. The chief of staff and battery commanders  convert the time of delivering fire by shellings usually after  receiving the command to load against targets of the first  shelling.    The battalion opens fire at the prescribed time at the  command (signal) of the senior artillery commander (chief) and  carries out the fire missions in accordance with the fire plan.  The artillery battalion commander gives commands and prearranged  signals, observes the results of the fire, adjusts the fire, if  necessary, and monitors fulfillment of the missions by the  batteries, striving for effective engagement of the targets.  Scouts from the batteries and the artillery battalion monitor  the results of the fire in the assigned sectors and conduct  reconnaissance of new targets, particularly in the intervals  between strongholds. The artillery battalion commander, if fire  capabilities are available, tasks battery commanders to  neutralize newly reconnoitered targets or reports these targets  to the senior artillery commander (chief) and to the commander  of the supported battalion.    The following is under the conditions of the tactical  example  above.    The commander of the 5th RAG informed the commander of the  2d  Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, that "H-hour" was set at 0840 hours 18  October. The artillery battalion commander converted the time  for fire by shellings to astronomical time:    --first shelling (from H-hour -0:57 to -0:42)--from 0743 to  0758;    --second shelling (from H-hour -0:42 to -0:32)--from 0758 to  0808;    --third shelling (from H-hour -0:32 to -0:21)--from 0808 to  0819;    --fourth shelling (from H-hour -0:21 to -0:07)--from 0819 to  0833.    --the first successive fire concentration line (from H-hour  -0:07)--from 0833...    Attention should be directed to certain particular features  of fire control during the periods of artillery preparation and  artillery support of the assault. The great artillery density,  the intensity of fire by the pieces, the powerful sound effects  of guns firing and shells bursting, the dense clouds of dust and  smoke both in the fire position area and in the vicinity of the  targets, and the abundance of signals and commands being given  over the control nets--all these factors create considerable  difficulties in fire control and command and control of the  subunits during these periods. Therefore, cohesiveness of  subunits at all levels, thorough preparation of firing and fire  control, precise actions of all commanders, and interaction of  all forces and assets are the basis for stable command and  control and high effectiveness of artillery fire.    In the conditions of the tactical example, during the last  shelling, as was agreed upon earlier, the commander of the 1st  Motorized Rifle Battalion arrived in the vicinity of the  artillery battalion command and observation post to establish  personal contact with the artillery battalion commander. He  reported that the battalion was at that time moving up from the  line of deployment into platoon columns to the final  coordination line.    The artillery battalion commander informed the battalion  commander that the artillery battalion was continuing to  neutralize the platoon stronghols--target 114--and when the  first-echelon companies reached the final coordination line it  would shift to artillery support of the assault without changing  the rate of fire against target 114.    With the start of the assault, the artillery battalion  commander and battery commanders continuously monitored the  enemy's actions, the position of the advancing subunits, and the  signals of their commanders. On the signal of the commander of  the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, the artillery battalion  commander gave the command to shift fire from the first  successive fire concentration line to the second line, which he  reported to the commander of the 5th RAG, and jointly with the  battalion commander, and the commander of the 5th Battery began  relocating. The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th  batteries began relocating simultaneously.    At 0852 hours, during the course of relocating, the  commander  of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, and the commander of the 1st  Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, reached the enemy's first trench  in the vicinity of target 114. The first-echelon companies  fought to seize the platoon stronghold, target 223. A mortar  platoon was firing on the 2d Motorized Rifle Company from an  area 300 meters south of "Kruglaya" grove.    Subunit commanders must know that the most important  principle of combat is the continuous coordination of artillery,  tanks, and infantry, on which success of the assault depends.  Paramount importance was attached to this principle during the  Great Patriotic War.    Here are a few excerpts of articles from the newspaper  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA dated 30 June 1943 and 19 May 1944.[.sup]1[/]    ...In the Red Army's combat experience there are many  examples of exemplary, extremely thorough and precise  organization of such coordination. Suffice it to recall just the  recent fighting at the Sivash, at Perekop, and at Sevastopol,  where the efforts of large artillery masses, in the full sense  of the word, merged as one with the efforts of the infantry,  which ensured an unparalleled high rate of advance under the  most difficult conditions. Our troops possess rich and diverse  experience in coordinating artillery and infantry when breaking  through the enemy defenses. The task is to fully and  comprehensively take this experience into account, drawing the  necessary conclusions from it.    As is known, the success of an assault on the forward  edge depends primarily on how skillfully the infantry exploits  the results of artillery fire. Experience teaches, for example,  that the beginning of an assault by tanks and infantry after  conclusion of artillery preparation cannot be delayed in any  case. The basic rule of coordination of infantry and tanks with  artillery states: "If you want to achieve success in an  offensive, press right up close to the artillery fire (of  course, taking into account a safe distance from friendly shell  bursts) with each advance, and dash swiftly to assault enemy  fortifications following friendly artillery shell bursts."    When the artillery fires against enemy fortifications,  the enemy soldiers withdraw to bunkers or lie on the bottom of  emplacements. Duty observers remain at the exposed machinegun  and gun emplacements. It is during these moments that the enemy  is insufficiently prepared to repel our attack. If the attacking  lines manage to catch the enemy in the shelters, they will  probably gain victory with little bloodshed. If the attacking  lines are late or delay in rushing into the attack, the enemy  soldiers will jump out of the shelters and man the machineguns  and guns. Then the offensive may bog down.    It is difficult to eliminate the consequences of such  mistakes during combat. Artillery has to return its fire to the  forward edge, which is not so easy to do, particularly if the  plan does not call for this. Such shifting of fire is often  complicated by the spontaneous breaking of the attacking combat  formation line. In addition, having hit the ground under fire,  it is difficult for the infantry to get up simultaneously for a  repeat assault....    Thus, the most important tasks in continuous coordination of  artillery with infantry and tanks, at the start and in the  course of an assault are: first, eliminating (preventing) a  break in time between the end of the artillery preparation and  the start of the assault by tanks and infantry; second,  combining into a single whole artillery fire and the movement of  attacking forces, and fire must precede and support (accompany)  the movement.    Commanders of artillery battalions and batteries must  relocate the command and observation posts in a timely manner,  continuously conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, know the exact  location of supported companies and adjacent subunits, deliver  fire against targets until the attacking subunits reach the  safety line, and, depending on the method of artillery support  of the assault, shift fire at the request (signal) of the  battalion or regimental commander.    As friendly subunits advance deep into the enemy's defense,  their efforts are directed at carrying out the combat mission as  quickly as possible. In such conditions it is quite important to  preserve the earlier established coordination between all the  subunits participating in the combat.    We will show how coordination is maintained in combat based  on a specific example from the experience of the Great Patriotic  War.[.sup]2[/]    The rifle battalion, having two companies in the first  echelon, broke through the forward edge of the Nazi defense.  Supported by tanks and artillery battalion fire, it began to  develop the offensive into the enemy's rear. Following the  infantry, regimental mortars and guns neutralized enemy weapon  positions.    But then the right-flank company was halted by heavy  fire from three machineguns, and it hit the dirt. Th tank  platoon advancing in front of the company came under fire from  two Nazi guns from the flanks. Simultaneously, more than a  company of German infantry went over to a counterattack against  our left-flank company. Quite a difficult situation developed.  It was necessary to repel the counterattack, destroy the  machineguns, and neutralize the antitank guns.    Correctly assessing the situation of the left flank as  being the most threatened, the battalion commander sent  two-thirds of the tanks there to destroy the counterattacking  infantry, ordered the artillery battalion commander to carry out  a short battalion shelling against the infantry, and tasked the  remaining tanks to destroy the Nazi heavy machineguns. The  regimental guns and mortars were tasked to destroy the antitank  guns and support the tanks' maneuver.    The decision was executed in a short period of time.  Enemy resistance was broken, and our infantry's advance resumed.  This became possible as a result of establishing prearranged  control and target designation signals and as a result of the  artillery battalion commander being located next to the  battalion commander, which made it possible to request the  artillery battalion fire without delay.  <H3>  Artillery Accompaniment of the Troop Offensive in the  Enemy's Rear </H3>   After defeating the enemy's first-echelon subunits, our  subunits developed the offensive deep into the enemy's defense.  The enemy would do everything possible to restore the disrupted  defense, using the remnants of the defeated subunits to occupy  pre-prepared strongholds and advantageous positions.  Considerable intervals and gaps may appear in the enemy's combat  formations. Resistance by enemy subunits, and in a number of  cases by individual groups, will prove to be insufficiently  strong. Therefore, combat in the depth is characterized by  unevenness in the advance by tanks and motorized rifle subunits,  by abrupt and frequent changes in the situation, by actions by  battalions in combat and approach march formations, and by the  wide maneuver of subunits to bypass strong points. On the axis  where the enemy's defense has been neutralized by nuclear  weapons, friendly subunits will advance swiftly deep into,  reaching the flanks and rear of defending enemy subunits. Small  enemy groups may remain in the rear area of friendly subunits;  they are to be destroyed by approaching second echelons or  reserves.    The artillery battalion commander must maintain  communications with the maneuver battalion commander, and  battery commanders must do so with company commanders by  personal contact, which is a most important element of  maintaining coordination and continuous command and control of  subunits in combat. Timely relocation of command and observation  posts will make it possible to know the rapidly changing  situation, assign additional reconnaissance missions, neutralize  detected targets in a short period of time and with the least  expenditure of shells, and take steps for comprehensive support  of combat operations.    With the deployment of the artillery battalion command and  observation post (stopping of the command vehicle) at each new  location, the artillery battalion commander must clarify the  enemy position and the position and missions of the supported  battalion. He must report the location of the command and  observation post to the group commander, report the coordinates  of the command and observation post to the artillery battalion  staff (regimental fire control post) and the battery commanders,  clarify the location of the command and observation posts and  fire platoons of the batteries, determine on the terrain the  location of scheduled concentrated fire and fixed barrage fire,  and control fire when engaging newly reconnoitered targets.    In these conditions, the intelligence officer immediately  arranges to determine target coordinates and based on the  artillery battalion commander's instructions clarifies subunit  reconnaissance missions and assembles reconnaissance information.    The artillery battalion commander, with permission from the  maneuver battalion commander (if the artillery battalion is  attached) or the artillery group commander (if the artillery  battalion is supporting the maneuver battalion), gives the  signal for the artillery battalion to relocate to the new fire  position area.  <H5>  Commitment to Battle of the Second Echelon </H5>   The maneuver battalion's second echelon is committed to  battle to exploit the success achieved by the first echelon, to  expand the breakthrough to the flanks, to repel an enemy  counterattack, and sometimes also to replace a first-echelon  company (battalion) that has lost its combat effectiveness. It  cam be committed to battle in the intervals between companies or  from behind the flanks of one of the first-echelon companies.    The second-echelon company advances to the commitment line  in  approach march formation at maximum speed. On approaching the  commitment line it quickly deploys into combat formation, firing  from all types of guns, attacks the enemy on the move, and  carries out the assigned mission.    During commitment of the battalion second echelon, the  commander of the attached (supporting) artillery battalion  assigns (updates) the mission for reconnoitering the enemy  forward of the line of commitment of the second echelon,  attaches a battery to the company or assigns a battery to  support the second-echelon company, and indicates to the battery  commander the location and time of meeting with the company  commander. He assigns (updates) fire missions to the battery  commanders.    The commander of the battery attached to the second-echelon  company or assigned to support it during commitment to battle,  after receiving the mission from the artillery battalion  commander, moves up to the designated place to meet the company  commander, establishes personal contact with him, receives the  mission from him, and assigns (updates) the mission for  reconnoitering the enemy.    The commander of an artillery battalion attached to the  maneuver battalion, or assigned to support it during commitment  to battle, after receiving the mission from the senior artillery  commander (chief), updates the missions for reconnoitering the  enemy forward of the line of commitment, assigns the mission for  preparing battalion fire, establishes personal contact with the  maneuver battalion commander, and assigns batteries to support  the companies.    When time is limited for commitment of the second echelon to  battle, it is advisable to assign the stand-by battery to  support the company and the stand-by artillery battalion to  support the maneuver battalion.    The artillery battalion that earlier supported the offensive  of the first-echelon battalion may be assigned to support the  second-echelon battalion's commitment to battle. Organizing  fulfillment of the mission by this artillery battalion will  require more time, since some regrouping of the artillery  battalion's forces and assets will be required with a change in  axis.    Prior to commitment of the second echelon to battle, the  artillery battalion neutralizes enemy weapons usually with one  shelling, which should be long enough to make it possible to  carry out assigned missions and preclude (sharply reduce) the  effectiveness of fire from enemy antitank weapons when friendly  subunits move up to the commitment line.    Exercise experience shows that the artillery battalion  commander, particularly when performing duties as the artillery  group commander, often has to determine independently the  duration of the shelling and report it to the regimental  (battalion) commander.    The duration of the shelling may be determined by two  indicators:    --by the time needed to carry out assigned fire missions;    --by the time needed to cover the movement of the second  echelon from the line of effective enemy antitank fire to the  troop safety line.    The procedure for calculating according to the first  indicator is as follows:    --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of  enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of  the second echelon and on the flanks;    --determine the fire missions and assign the subunits for  carrying them out and the ammunition expenditure;    --determine the duration of the shelling according to the  rate of fire and ammunition expenditure for one piece.    The procedure for calculating according to the second  indicator is as follows:    --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of  enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of  the second echelon and on the flanks;    --clarify the line of commitment of the second echelon;    --assess the terrain and determine the line of effective  enemy antitank fire;    --determine the duration of the shelling according to the  formula:    T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V    where D is the distance to the line of effective enemy  antitank fire; L is the troop safety line; and V is the rate of  advance of the second echelon.          In the conditions shown in Figure 15 and at V = 15 km/hr:    T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V = (2300-400)/250 = about 8  minutes    The duration of the shelling is taken from one of the  largest  indicators. For example, 10 minutes is required to neutralize  strongholds and weapons at the position of brigade reserves, and  eight minutes is required to cover the advance of the regiment's  second echelon, taking into account the nature of the terrain.    Based on the larger indicator, the duration of the shelling  is taken as equal to 10 minutes.    Let us examine the actions of an artillery battalion in  supporting the commitment of a battalion's second echelon under  conditions of the tactical example.    The commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, together  with  the commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, located  500 meters east of the bridge, clarified the situation (see the  work map, Figure 11).    The 1st Motorized Rifle Company with a tank platoon,  advancing in the direction indicated, reached Upey Brook, where  it met organized enemy resistance. The company was advancing.  The commander of the 4th Battery reported: "I am 500 meters  north of the bridge. The battery is deploying at the new fire  positions. When ready, I will open fire on the ATGM launcher."    The 2d Motorized Rifle Company with a tank company (minus a  tank platoon) was waging combat in the area south of "Kruglaya"  grove. The commander of the 6th Battery reported: "I am 400  meters east of `Kruglaya' grove. The company is engaged in  difficult fighting."    The artillery battalion intelligence officer announced the  decision: "The 1st and 2d motorized rifle companies are to  continue carrying out assigned missions; the 3d Motorized Rifle  Company and the 1st Tank Company (minus a platoon) are to be  committed to battle from the line of the bridge, the brush in  the direction of the bridge, and `Kruglaya' grove to exploit the  success. A mortar battery is attached to the company. Readiness  is at 0910 hours. With commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle  Company, the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is moved into reserve.  The artillery battalion commander is to support the commitment  of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and neutralize the  reconnoitered enemy weapons."    The artillery battalion commander decided: Support the  commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and the 1st Tank  Company (minus a platoon) with concentrated fire by the 5th and  6th batteries, neutralizing personnel and weapons--target 68;  determine center coordinates using a rangefinder; prepare  azimuth and range settings at the fire control post; shelling  duration is to be seven minutes with a shell expenditure of  one-fifth the norm. The 4th Battery is to neutralize  reconnoitered ATGM launchers. He reported the decision to the  group commander and the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion commander.    In accordance with the decision made, the artillery  battalion  commander gave the command: "Visla," "Oka," Halt. Seven-minute  shelling. Load. Target 68, tanks and armored personnel  carriers [APC's]. Battalion: 36-85, 3,280, elevation 85.  Overlapping fire. Two settings of 300 by 100. Expenditure 144  per battery. This is "Neva."    After receiving the report on readiness of the batteries,  the  artillery commander reports this to the 1st Motorized Rifle  Battalion commander, on his signal gives the command to open  fire, and reports on mission accomplishment to the group  commander.    During the course of the shelling, the 3d Motorized Rifle  Company and the 1st Tank Company move up to the commitment line,  after which they go over to the attack. After completion of the  shelling, the artillery battalion (battery) supports the assault  and the subsequent actions of the second-echelon subunits with  concentrated fire and fire against single targets. The artillery  battalion (battery) may set up a smoke screen to decrease the  effectiveness of enemy antitank fire.  <H5>  Repelling Enemy Counterattacks </H5>   During combat deep in the enemy defense, subunits must be  constantly ready to repel counterattacks by enemy brigade and  divisional reserves. A motorized rifle battalion can repel a  counterattack by enemy forces of superior, equal, or lesser  strength.    When repelling a counterattack by small forces, such as a  motorized infantry company with tanks, battalion subunits defeat  them with fire and a swift moving attack.    When the main portion of enemy counterattacking forces  operate against an adjacent unit and a smaller portion operate  against one of the companies of the supported battalion, small  forces and assets are assigned to repel the counterattack. They  engage the enemy with stationary fire in cooperation with the  adjacent unit, and the battalion's main forces continue the  offensive.    When repelling a counterattack by an enemy equal in  strength,  the battalion uses part of its forces to engage the enemy with  fire from an advantageous line, and the rest of the forces  decisively attack the enemy's flank independently or in  cooperation with adjacent subunits.    A battalion repels a counterattack by enemy forces equal in  strength by fire from all weapons from an advantageous line in  cooperation with adjacent units.    When moving up for a counterattack, the enemy uses terrain  irregularities, darkness, and unfavorable weather conditions; it  also uses smoke screens for cover. In this connection, the  artillery battalion commander directs the efforts of battalion  and battery reconnaissance at disclosing enemy intentions and  the nature of his actions and at detecting the advance of his  reserves. To repel a counterattack, the artillery battalion  commander must clarify the decision of the supported battalion  commander and prepare the artillery battalion in a timely  manner. If the artillery battalion relocates to a different fire  position area, it must deploy immediately in the area in which  the command was received.    On detecting advancing enemy reserves (columns), the  artillery battalion commander reports to the senior artillery  commander (chief) and the commander of the supported battalion  (regiment) and engages the advancing enemy with concentrated  fire. As the enemy gets closer and his columns break down into  smaller columns, the artillery battalion commander tasks the  battery commanders to engage individual groups of tanks and  APC's. Subsequently, the artillery battalion repels the  counterattack by enemy tanks and infantry by a creeping or fixed  barrage in cooperation with the weapons of the companies and  battalion.    The Great Patriotic War provided numerous examples of  successful joint operation of rifle, tank, and artillery  subunits to repel enemy counterattacks. Here is one these  examples.[.sup]3[/]          In early September 1943, Nazi units being pursued by  our troops were withdrawing toward the Dnieper (Figure 16). They  offered stubborn resistance at intermediate positions.    The 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade seized the city of  Trostyanets, Sumy Oblast, on the move, intercepting the highways  over which enemy troop movement and supply was accomplished. The  artillery battalion of this brigade deployed into combat  formation east of Trostyanets, prepared concentrated and fixed  barrage fire against the roads leading to the city. Taking into  account the presence of isolated enemy tank and infantry  subunits in the rear of our units, the artillery battalion  commander took steps to organize a perimeter defense of the fire  positions.    With the onset of dawn, the enemy made an attempt to  retake the city. However, his counterattack was repelled by the  organized use of all weapons. Then the attempt to take the city  was repeated. Nine enemy tanks with infantry mounted broke  through from the flank and entered the rear area of the  motorized rifle battalion. There was a threat that they would  break through to the fire position area. These tanks were  detected in time by reconnaissance, and the artillery battalion  quickly prepared to repel their attack. Only two guns of the 2d  Battery, located camouflaged in a sunflower field to the right  of the other batteries, were ordered to open fire. Moving along  a hollow, the tanks approached the artillery battalion's  concealed fire positions. Two heavy Tiger tanks came out into  the open 600 meters from the 2d Battery guns. The gun crew of  Senior Sergeant Belyakov opened fire and knocked out one tank  with the second round. The second gun of Senior Sergeant  Miroshnik knocked out the other tank. The crew of the first tank  that was knocked out attempted to escape by running, but was  captured. An ober-lieutenant, the commander of an infantry  battalion, turned out to be among the prisoners. He gave  valuable information about the Nazis intentions. Having lost  two tanks and some infantry, the enemy halted the counterattack  and withdrew to the attack position.    In modern conditions, the enemy usually will counterattack  with forces of one or two tank-battalion tactical groups.  Movement forward of these forces will be accomplished at a fast  pace. Motorized infantry will follow on combat vehicles or  APC's. Deployment into combat formation and turning into a  counterattack are accomplished while on the move following an  artillery shelling and air strikes.    The capabilities of our troops for repelling counterattacks  have increased considerably. Aerial and ground reconnaissance  assets should be used for timely detection of the moving up and  deployment of the counterattacking enemy. This gives our  subunits an opportunity to prepare better to repel the  counterattack. Artillery subunits, if they have changed  position, deploy into combat formation, and fire (concentrated  fire, creeping barrage, or fixed barrage) is adjusted or  prepared for them.    The counterattack is repelled by the coordinated fire of  artillery, mortars, tanks, ATGM mounts, rocket launchers, and  IFV's (APC's). Additional subunits are sent to reinforce the  subunits on threatened sectors, and the antitank reserve is  moved up. Batteries deployed at indirect-fire positions prepare  to destroy enemy tanks in the event they break through into the  rear.  <H5>  Pursuit of the Enemy </H5>   Pursuit is an offensive action against a withdrawing enemy,  the purpose of which is to complete the route of the enemy and  prevent the enemy's organized transition to a defense on a  favorable line (intermediate defensive positions) in the rear.  It is characterized by swiftness and intensity of actions of the  participating subunits and units and a fight to reach the flanks  and rear of the withdrawing enemy.    Based on the experience of the Great Patriotic War, pursuit  may occur during forced withdrawal of the enemy as a result of  the successful development of an offensive by our troops or an  engagement, and also in the event of a planned withdrawal by the  enemy to avoid a strike or threat of encirclement.    A motorized rifle battalion, using high off-road capability,  swiftly outflanks the enemy along a parallel route, comes out on  the path of his withdrawal, and destroys him with a decisive  attack to the flank and rear in cooperation with adjacent  subunits.    When it is impossible to outflank the enemy along a parallel  route, the battalion destroys the covering-force subunits,  breaks through to the enemy main body, and attacks it on the  move. A battalion may pursue an enemy in combat or  approach-march formation. With a swift enemy withdrawal, pursuit  is accomplished in march formation with a reinforced advance  party sent out from the battalion.    During the withdrawal of the main body, the enemy assigns  forces and assets covering the main body to conduct delaying  actions. The enemy may use the following methods of delaying  action: counterattacks, ambushes, surprise raids, diversionary  attacks, and the holding of a prepared line with insignificant  forces, inflicting maximum losses on our subunits and thus  reducing the momentum of the pursuit.    The enemy subunits conducting the delaying actions will be  destroyed, as a rule, by the advance party. If these forces are  insufficient, the battalion will quickly deploy into combat  formation, attack and destroy on the move, and continue the  pursuit.    During pursuit, an artillery battalion, especially  self-propelled artillery, is attached to the first-echelon  motorized rifle battalion. The artillery battalion commander  dispatches an artillery reconnaissance subunit together with the  maneuver battalion's reconnaissance, assigns missions to the  batteries, and monitors timely displacement of the batteries.    Concentrated fire, barrage fire, and engagement of single  targets are the primary types of artillery battalion fire during  pursuit.    The mobile nature of combat actions and rapid, abrupt  changes  in the situation will cause frequent relocations and deployments  of batteries into combat formation. In these conditions, the  artillery battalion commander must maintain uninterrupted  cooperation between artillery and combined-arms subunits.  Missions will often be assigned to battery commanders based on  the map while in movement.    To reduce time, fire positions are usually occupied near  roads, despite the inconvenience of the terrain. Fire platoons  must constantly be ready to conduct direct fire. When carrying  out assigned missions, battery commanders must display clever  initiative to increase the effectiveness of engaging various  targets. In order to inflict the maximum losses on the enemy and  prevent the approach of his reserves, fire is prepared against  road junctions, chokepoints, crossings, bridges, and other  vulnerable objectives (targets).    We will show the actions of an artillery battalion during  pursuit based on experience of the Great Patriotic War (Figure  17).[.sup]4[/]          In August-September 1943, following stubborn fighting  in the vicinity of Kharkov, our troops were pursuing enemy units  withdrawing toward Poltava. Saddling the railroad, the enemy  sought to evacuate valuable property from Artemovka and  Kochubeyevka stations before the arrival of our troops. On the  morning of 18 September, the Nazi command authorities moved up  an infantry regiment with 13 tanks to this area, with the  mission of delaying our troops on this axis, if only for 24  hours.    An artillery battalion consisting of two howitzer  batteries and one gun battery was attached to a rifle regiment  that was pursuing the withdrawing enemy. On the morning of 18  September, the rifle regiment reached the vicinity of Pokrovka,  where it encountered stubborn enemy resistance on the line Hill  188.7, Pokrovka. The Nazis, with a strength of up to two  companies of infantry with tanks, twice counterattacked, trying  at any price to stop our advance. However, the counterattacks  were successfully repelled by the fire of the infantry and the  artillery battalion, resulting in great losses for the  enemy.    On the night of 18-19 September, our reconnaissance  ascertained the withdrawal of the enemy from the occupied line  in a southwesterly direction. Having organized reconnaissance  and security, the rifle regiment began pursuit of the enemy at  0400 hours 19 September along the route Pokrovka, Pashchenovks,  Surdovka, Stepanovka. The artillery battalion followed the  regiment on towing vehicles, leapfrogging by batteries, not  lagging more than 1-1.5 km behind the infantry, having its  mounted reconnaissance patrol in the advance party.    Despite the heavy fog, at 0800 hours 19 September the  artillery scouts detected an enemy column entering  Shevchenkovskiy Sovkhoz from the direction of Stepanovka. Our  rifle regiment immediately deployed and joined battle. The  artillery battalion also rapidly deployed into combat formation.  The observation post on Hill 180.6 and the forward observation  posts were moved up into the combat formations of the rifle  companies. The two howitzer batteries stopped at indirect-fire  positions in the vicinity of K. (a well), and the gun battery  took up a direct-fire position in the vicinity of Hill 180.6 in  the combat formations of the rifle companies. The artillery  battalion commander maintained communications with the battery  commanders and fire platoons by telephone and radio.    At readiness, the 5th and 6th batteries carried out a  five-minute shelling against the enemy in Shevchenkovskiy  Sovkhoz, where he was concentrating infantry and tanks. They  destroyed one enemy tank and some of his infantry. But soon the  Nazis attacked our infantry with a force of up to a battalion of  infantry with 12 tanks. The howitzer batteries immediately  opened fire, trying to cut off the enemy from the tanks. The gun  battery, allowing the tanks to approach to within 200-300  meters, opened direct fire against them. The 4th Battery  destroyed two tanks and knocked out one with the first shots.  The rest of the tanks could not withstand the fire of our guns  and began to withdraw, leaving the scattered infantry, who had  come under the fire of our guns and their own tanks, without  support. When our ground attack aircraft appeared in the air,  the enemy's panic increased even more.    Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the subunits  of our rifle regiment counterattacked and seized Shevchenkovskiy  Sovkhoz and Hill 164.8. In doing so, the guns of the 4th  Battery, located in the combat formations of the rifle  companies, delivered direct fire, supporting consolidation of  the occupied line. Our tanks arrived shortly thereafter. The  artillery battalion carried out a five-minute shelling against  the enemy trying to take up a defense north of Stepanovka. Our  subunits, supported by the fire of the artillery battalion, went  over to the attack and threw the enemy back to Stepanovka. On  this line the enemy lost another four tanks, eight machineguns,  and a large number of personnel and was forced to pull back. Our  infantry and tanks, supported by the fire of the artillery  battalion, continued the successful pursuit.    The artillery battalion successfully supported the  rifle regiment during pursuit of the enemy. Reconnaissance was  well organized, enabling the artillery battalion commander to  skillfully and rapidly deploy the artillery battalion and timely  support the regiment's subunits with fire throughout the  fighting. The artillery battalion commander's decision to use  the gun battery from direct-fire positions merits attention. All  batteries cooperated with the infantry, which ensured timeliness  and continuity of fire support and its effectiveness, which is  indicated by the considerable enemy losses (particularly in  tanks) and the minimal losses of our troops. Despite the  fast-moving nature of the combat actions, the artillery  battalion commander did not lose command and control of the  batteries, which was ensured by well-organized  communications.  <H5>  Forced Crossing of a Water Obstacle </H5>   Water obstacles are natural obstacles for advancing  subunits.  They are characterized by width; depth; current velocity; the  nature of the banks, bottom, and valley; the presence of fords  and water engineering structures; and also the weather  conditions and the time of the year.    Depending on the combat situation conditions, forced  crossings of water obstacles can be accomplished in a hasty  crossing or with deployment of the main body at the water  obstacle after additional preparation over short time periods.    A hasty crossing of water obstacles is the primary method.  It  is usually used during the course of successful development of  an offensive or pursuit in the depth of the defense, which is  confirmed by the experience of the Great Patriotic War. The use  of nuclear weapons in modern combat, the presence of amphibious  APC's, IFV's, and other combat equipment in the inventory of  combined-arms subunits, and also the use of assault-crossing  equipment--all this creates favorable conditions for hasty  crossing of water obstacles.    A slower crossing by the main body is conducted in those  instances when a hasty crossing cannot be made due to heavy  enemy resistance. Subunits conduct the necessary preparations  prior to the crossing.    In any method of forced crossing, artillery subunits cross  on  self-propelled assault crossing equipment, on ferries, over a  captured or launched bridge, or by fording, and self-propelled  artillery guns are floated across.    Prime movers, guns, and motor vehicles are usually loaded  aboard assault crossing equipment on the bank of the water  obstacle. The loading is supervised by gun, squad, and platoon  commanders, observing safety measures. During the loading they  follow the instructions of the assault crossing equipment  subunit commanders.    When fording a water obstacle, artillery subunit commanders  organize reconnaissance of the condition of the bottom and  determine possibilities of descending from the bank and emerging  on the opposite bank, the current velocity, and the depth of the  ford. In doing so, they take into account the maximum  permissible fording depth for a given type of transport  depending on the river's current velocity (Table 14). Mistakes  in determining the depth of the ford and the condition of the  bottom of the water obstacle can not only slow down but also  disrupt the crossing of artillery subunits. Reserve prime movers  with lines are assigned for pulling out or towing stuck weapons  and stalled vehicles and equipment or for assisting them in  getting out on the opposite bank.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 14.

Firing on the enemy, the artillery battalion supports the  approach of the forward detachment (advance guard) to the water  obstacle, their capture of water engineering structures,  bridges, and fords, the crossing of a water obstacle by  subunits, and the attack on the opposite bank.    The artillery battalion commander organizes combat actions  based on the mission received from the forward detachment  (advance guard) commander on the map during the approach to the  water obstacle. As a rule, the time for preparing the artillery  battalion to support the crossing is limited.    In clarifying the mission and estimating the situation, the  artillery battalion commander must understand the forward  detachment (advance guard) commander's concept and the artillery  battalion's mission; he must clarify the time, place, and means  of the artillery battalion's crossing, the nature of the water  obstacle, and the conditions of the terrain in front of the  obstacle and on the opposite bank; he must also take into  account other factors affecting the artillery battalion's  actions. As a result of this, the artillery battalion commander  plans reconnaissance missions, locations of command observation  posts and fire positions, and the fire missions for the  battalion and batteries from the map.    Then the artillery battalion commander organizes  reconnaissance of the enemy and the terrain, assigns fire  missions to the battery commanders, and determines the order and  place of their crossing. The artillery battalion deploys into  combat formation as it approaches the water obstacle.    A radar and helicopter crew attached to the artillery  battalion may be used for reconnaissance of enemy artillery and  mortar batteries.    The artillery battalion commander assigns missions to the  batteries by field instructions, personally or by radio. The  field instruction may indicate the latest information on the  enemy, the mission of the forward detachment (advance guard),  brief information on the water obstacle in the assault crossing  sector, battery fire missions, planned sites of command and  observation posts and fire positions, and also the base line of  fire. Assigned missions are updated and supplemented on arrival  at the water obstacle based on new reconnaissance information.    A portion of the guns or a full-strength battery may be  assigned for direct fire against targets on the opposite bank by  decision of the forward detachment (advance guard) commander.  Such a necessity is confirmed by experience of the Great  Patriotic War.    Artillery preparation of an assault crossing and attack is  usually accomplished by one shelling against enemy personnel and  weapons on the opposite bank, and also against his artillery and  mortar batteries. The duration of the shelling, as a rule, is  determined by the artillery battalion commander depending on the  scope of the fire missions, the width of the water obstacle, and  the range of enemy antitank weapons, taking into account the  nature of the terrain and the speed of crossing equipment for  covering this distance over land and on water during the  crossing. Tanks, guns, and other weapons deployed on the  friendly bank also participate in the shelling. The shelling  begins no later than when the first-echelon subunits reach the  limit of the zone of effective range of enemy antitank weapons.    During an assault crossing, the artillery battalion  neutralizes weapons impeding the crossing and observation posts  or blinds them with smoke projectiles, covers the flanks of  subunits that have crossed by laying smoke screens, and blocks  the approach of enemy reserves.    The artillery battalion supports the attack by subunits on  the opposite bank with concentrated fire or battery fire against  individual targets. It should be kept in mind that during  artillery support of an assault crossing and attack, fire is  delivered against targets located, as a rule, in the immediate  proximity of motorized rifle subunits. This circumstance  increases the responsibility of the artillery battalion  commander and battery commanders for accuracy in preparing fire  and for continuous fire control.    The artillery battalion (battery) forward observation post  may cross with forward subunits for continuous fire control.  Battery commanders cross to the opposite bank simultaneously  with the commanders of supported companies; the artillery  battalion commander crosses with the commander of the forward  detachment (advance guard).    The artillery battalion usually crosses to the opposite bank  by batteries on self-propelled assault crossing equipment, which  ensures continuous support of the subunits that have crossed  with fire from most of the batteries. The beginning of the  crossing of fire platoons is determined by friendly subunits'  capture of a line which will prevent the enemy from delivering  fire from small-arms and antitank weapons against assault  crossing equipment. Artillery subunits that are part of the main  body are also used, as they become ready to open fire, for  artillery preparation and support of the crossing and attack by  the forward detachment (advance guard).    Let us examine the organization of an artillery battalion's  actions during a hasty crossing of a water obstacle.  <H6>  Tactical Example 2 </H6>   Having routed the enemy in the forward defensive area, our  units were in pursuit toward the northwest.    The enemy was exerting efforts to halt the advance of our  units, hastily creating a defense on tactically advantageous  lines.    The 3d Motorized Rifle Bn with a tank company, an artillery  battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, and a subunit of  assault river-crossing equipment, comprising the advance guard,  was conducting parallel pursuit of the enemy along the route  Vishki, Doltsovo, Grebni (Figure 18), tasked to ensure unimpeded  movement of the main body over this route, destroy the enemy on  the approaches to Podleyka River, make a forced crossing of the  river in the sector "Krug" Grove, Zhodino, seize the line "Krug"  Grove, Lipki, Zhodino, and support the forced crossing of the  river by the main body.    By the start of the pursuit, the batteries had been  distributed to support the companies: 2d Battery in support of  the 8th Motorized Rifle Company; 3d Battery in support of the  9th Motorized Rifle Company.    The advance party (7th Motorized Rifle Company with a tank  platoon and the 1st Battery), destroying small groups of enemy  infantry (ambush parties) in its path, by 1630 hours on 25 July  had reached the bank of the Podleyka River, where it encountered  fire from three APC's and two ATGM's from the opposite bank. The  1st Battery deployed into combat formation and opened fire to  neutralize the detected targets. At this same time, the  artillery battalion's intelligence officer, with a group of  scouts, deployed the observation post, conducted surveillance of  the enemy in ROV-1 [area of special interest], and studied the  condition of the river and its banks.    At 1725 hours, the commander of the advance guard made the  decision to make a forced crossing of the Podleyka River and  assigned combat missions to the subunits, which called for the  8th and 9th motorized rifle companies, after the shelling, to  make a hasty crossing of Podleyka River, destroy the enemy on  the opposite bank, and carry out the battalion's assigned  mission. The 7th Motorized Rifle Company was to be the battalion  reserve; preparation of the companies for the forced crossing  was to be conducted at the places... (see map). An artillery  battalion, a mortar battery, the 7th Motorized Rifle Company  with direct fire from IFV's, and its attached tanks were to  participate in the shelling. The time for the crossing was to be  1800 hours on 25 July. An assault crossing point using six  amphibious carriers (PTS's) and a raft and a ferry crossing  point consisting of two tracked self-propelled ferries (GSP's)  were set up in the crossing sector.          In accordance with the decision of the advance guard  commander, while still approaching the water obstacle, the  artillery battalion commander had issued an order for the 2d and  3d Batteries to deploy into combat formation and for the ARSOM  [mortar detection artillery station] radar attached to the  artillery battalion to take up its position.    After arriving at Hill "Dynya," the artillery battalion  commander received a report from the battalion's intelligence  officer: "The withdrawing enemy units are taking up a hasty  defense 150-200 meters from the opposite bank. Three APC's, two  ATGM's, weapons in trenches, a mortar platoon beyond Hill 61.4,  and an observation post (he points it out on the terrain) have  been reconnoitered. Three tanks have been observed moving toward  Hill 53.7. The ATGM near the dark bushes has been neutralized by  fire from the 1st Battery. Reconnaissance continues."    The artillery battalion commander detailed the intelligence  officer's mission for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy  directly in the crossing sector and ordered him to assign by  radio the missions for reconnaissance of batteries: to the radar  chief--in ROV-1; to the crew of the attached helicopter--in  ROV-2.    When assessing the situation, the artillery commander  obtained detailed information on the water obstacle: it was  190-200 meters wide at the crossing sector, had a current  velocity of 0.8 meters per second, and was 5-6 meters deep.  There were individual marshy areas on the opposite bank. In  addition, he determined the safety limit from our shellbursts,  the duration of the shelling, and the artillery battalion's fire  capabilities.    The safety limit from our shellbursts was 400 meters at a  river width of 200 meters and with the closest targets 150-200  meters from the opposite bank. It ran near the water's edge on  our bank.    The duration of the shelling to cover the advance of  motorized rifle companies from the line of effective enemy  antitank fire on this terrain (2,200 meters) to the water line  (the safety limit) at a speed of 10 km per hour would be:    Time of shelling = (2200-400)/167 = 11 minutes    Taking into account losses, the artillery battalion had 16  self-propelled howitzers, 15 motor vehicles, and 0.8 basic loads  (1,024 rounds).    It was advisable to expend up to 0.4 basic loads (521  rounds)  in the shelling, taking into account the need to support  subunits on the opposite bank after their crossing. With an  expenditure of rounds of 0.5 the norm for each target, the  artillery battalion would be able to neutralize simultaneously  one towed-artillery battery (mortar platoon) and up to six  individual targets or a platoon stronghold on an area up to four  hectares and two individual targets.    The artillery battalion commander decided during the  11-minute shelling by the battalion and mortar battery to  neutralize target 31--personnel and weapons, with a frontage of  250 and a depth of 150; target 81--the mortar platoon; target  33--the observation post. The expenditure was to be 0.5 the  norm. The remaining targets were to be destroyed by IFV's and  tanks using direct fire.    During the course of artillery support of the assault  crossing and attack, with the arrival of the 8th and 9th  motorized rifle companies at the water line, they were to  continue to neutralize target 31 and be ready to neutralize  newly detected targets, particularly antitank targets.    To prevent a possible enemy counterattack and approach from  the direction of "Temnaya" Grove, Hill 53.7, a fixed barrage  "Akatsiya" was prepared.    The chief of staff was to accomplish allocation of targets.    The planned order of the artillery battalion's crossing was:  the command and observation posts of the batteries and the  artillery battalion on command vehicles--afloat simultaneously  with the vehicles of the commanders of supported subunits;  battery gun platoons--afloat in the following sequence--2d, 3d,  and 1st Batteries; the start of relocation--when the maneuver  battalion seizes the line of the bend in the highway, the single  house; subsequently--when the first battery to cross is ready to  open fire. The motor vehicles of the batteries and the artillery  battalion were to make the crossing on assault crossing  equipment. The chief of staff was to perform a calculation of  the crossing.    The fire position area after the crossing... (see map).    The artillery battalion commander reported to the maneuver  battalion commander the duration, start, and end of the  shelling, the targets to be neutralized by fire from  indirect-fire positions and by direct fire, and the planned  order of the crossing of the artillery battalion. He also  pointed out on the terrain the safety limit from our shellbursts.    The maneuver battalion commander approved the artillery  battalion commander's decision and pointed out to him that six  PTS's were to be assigned for the crossing of the artillery  battalion's motor transport at approximately H-hour + 0:30.    By this time, the chief of staff had reported to the  artillery battalion commander the allocation of targets for the  shelling (Table 15).    Table 15.

Attention. Record.  Shelling 11 minutes. Readiness at 1745 hours. `Volga' (1st  Battery). Target 33, an observation post: x=21,440,  y = 44,120, elevation 50, expenditure 72. `Kama'  (2d Battery). Target 81, a mortar platoon: x =  22,540, y = 43,540, elevation 50, expenditure 180.  `Dnepr' (3d Battery). Target 31, infantry under cover:  x = 21,320, y = 43,470, elevation 50,  expenditure 180. This is `Don.'"    The battalion commander updated the codenames of local  features and reference points for the company and attached  subunit commanders, indicated the sequence of subunit actions  during the river crossing, announced the signal for beginning  the shelling, and assigned missions to engage targets by direct  fire.    Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions,  the chief of staff plotted on the map the area of the new  observation posts on the opposite bank, marked each battery's  fire position, and began calculating the artillery battalion's  crossing in the following sequence:    1. When crossing the batteries' self-propelled howitzers  afloat:    --he determined the crossing sequence (according to the  artillery battalion commander's decision--the 2d, 3d, and 1st  Batteries).    --he determined the time for crossing the 2d Battery, which  consisted of the time for moving up to the river, preparing the  guns for the crossing, crossing the river, and preparing the  guns for firing and moving to the new fire position. He  determined the time for crossing the 3d Battery and then the 1st  Battery.    --he determined the total time for crossing the artillery  battalion with its continuous relocation (the next battery  begins crossing when the battery that crossed earlier is ready  for firing).    2. When crossing the artillery battalion's motor vehicles:    --he counted up the total number of motor vehicles to be  crossed: the 1st, 2d, and 3d Batteries--three each; the  artillery battalion headquarters and supply squad--six, for a  total of 15.    --he determined the capabilities of the allocated six PTS's  for crossing in one crossing: at a rate of one motor vehicle per  PTS, the capability was six motor vehicles.    --he determined the duration of one crossing according to  Table 16: the river was 200 meters wide, had a current of up to  1 meter per second, and a PTS required 10 minutes without a  trailer.    He determined the number of crossings and the time for  crossing each subunit (Table 17).    Table 16.

During the course of the Great Patriotic War, our units made  assault crossings of a large number of wide and narrow rivers  and canals. Despite the lack of the required amount of assault  river-crossing equipment at that time, hasty crossing of water  obstacles was employed quite extensively.    Crossing equipment often was made immediately before the  crossing using local materials, which considerably increased the  time for preparing the crossing. Characteristic features of a  hasty crossing are the lack of an organized defense on the  friendly bank; organization of the crossing in a relatively  short time period; capture of the opposite bank by a forward  detachment, advance guard, or first-echelon battalion, that is,  by small forces; and a stubborn, desperate struggle with the  enemy to hold the captured sector on the opposite bank until the  main forces have crossed.    In anticipation of a deliberate crossing, an artillery  battalion may operate as part of an artillery group (assigned to  support a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion) or be a  standby battalion. Sometimes it is attached to a first-echelon  battalion.    When preparing combat operations, the artillery battalion  commander must gain a clear understanding of the combat mission  of the combined-arms unit (subunit), the mission of the  artillery battalion, the time and order of crossing the  artillery battalion, the amount of assigned assault  river-crossing equipment, the order for moving subunits up to  the crossing, and the places for loading and unloading guns,  prime movers, and motor vehicles.    Additional reconnaissance missions prior to starting the  crossing may be: updating information about the water obstacle;  reconnaissance of the route of advance to the crossing and of  the terrain in the vicinity of the crossing.    When assigning missions, the artillery battalion commander  also indicates the following: the order of the crossing and the  battalion's forming-up place prior to the crossing; the order of  crossing of the artillery battalion and battery command and  observation posts; the places, time, and the sequence of  crossing gun platoons and the fire control post to the opposite  bank.    The timetable for the artillery battalion's crossing of a  water obstacle may come to the artillery battalion from the  group staff or be drawn up by the artillery battalion commander  or chief of staff in accordance with directions received.    The assault crossing of the water obstacle is preceded by  artillery preparation of the assault crossing and the attack. In  participating in the preparation, the artillery battalion  neutralizes personnel and weapons in strong points, antitank  weapons, command posts, artillery batteries, mortar platoons,  and other enemy targets on the opposite bank. First-echelon  subunits begin crossing the water obstacle at the designated  time (H-hour), with fire support from artillery and other  weapons, and occupy the section of terrain on the opposite bank.    The artillery battalion shifts from artillery preparation to  artillery support of the assault crossing and attack. The  command and observation posts of the batteries and artillery  battalion cross after the strongholds on the opposite bank have  been seized. The artillery battalion commander gives commands  (signals) for the crossing of gun platoons in accordance with  the crossing timetable.    The gun platoons that have crossed immediately deploy at  fire  positions in the designated area and, on the command of the  artillery battalion (battery) commander, open fire to engage  reconnoitered enemy targets. After all batteries have crossed,  the artillery battalion operate the same as it would when  advancing in normal conditions.  <H3>  Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various  Conditions </H3> <H5>  Operations at Night </H5>   Under today's conditions, combat operations will be  conducted  with unremitting intensity both day and night. The artillery  battalion commander and battery commanders have to consider the  effect of night on the actions of personnel, know the particular  features of combat operations of combined-arms and artillery  subunits, and take steps ensuring fulfillment of assigned  missions.    The night sharply reduces visibility, decreases the  effectiveness of all types of fire, and makes the maneuver of  forces and weapons more difficult. On the one hand, night  operations intensify the surprise factor, intensify the effect  on enemy morale, and improve conditions for camouflage against  ground and air surveillance. On the other hand, night operations  degrade the effectiveness of reconnaissance assets, reduce the  accuracy of fire, and make fire control more difficult.    Experience shows that a high degree of proficiency of  subunits, personnel training to perform their duties, and the  ability of platoon, battery, and artillery battalion commanders  to orient themselves quickly in the situation, and on the  terrain, and to control their subunits precisely, ensure  successful accomplishment of assigned night missions.    An offensive at night may begin with a breakthrough of enemy  defenses or be a continuation of daytime combat operations. The  maneuver battalion's combat formation may be aligned in one  echelon with assignment of a reserve, which moves a shorter  distance than during daylight. Artillery and mortar subunits are  attached to motorized rifle subunits to achieve greater  independence and coordination of actions. Weapons remaining  directly subordinate to the maneuver battalion commander proceed  behind the combat formations of first-echelon companies, in the  intervals, or on their flanks.    In addition to carrying out the usual missions for fire  engagement of the enemy, the artillery battalion (battery) in an  offensive at night performs missions of illumination support of  the operations of motorized rifle and tank subunits and  artillery fire, and missions for destroying or obscuring enemy  night-vision devices, illumination equipment, and weapons.    When performing illumination support missions, the artillery  battalion (battery) fires illumination rounds to illuminate the  terrain and targets and to place light markers (movement  orientation lights).    Preparations for an offensive at night are conducted during  daylight. The artillery battalion commander updates  reconnaissance missions for the batteries and moves the  observation posts closer to the enemy's defenses; assigns the  batteries missions for illuminating the terrain and targets,  setting up light markers (movement orientation lights), and  obscuring enemy observation posts and weapons; updates the  artillery battalion's (batteries') fire missions on the terrain  and determines the order of their execution; clarifies the  recognition symbols of friendly troops and the procedure for  cooperation with combined-arms subunits; disseminates to  subunits mutual recognition signals and signals denoting lines  reached by advancing subunits; if necessary, organizes the  selection of fire positions and command and observation post  locations and their surveys; updates the route and order of  relocation of batteries; allocates illumination ammunition and  supplies the batteries with illuminating and signaling devices;  and checks the serviceability of night-vision and illumination  devices.    The artillery battalion commander pays special attention to  preparing communications equipment and organizing reliable  communications during the offensive.    The command and observation posts of the artillery battalion  and batteries usually carry out the following measures to  prepare for conducting reconnaissance and fire control at night:  they select or set up manmade reference points that are visible  at night and determine grid azimuths (bearings); prepare  instrument illumination and flashlights for use by scouts and  radiotelephone operators; exercise light and sound discipline;  camouflage the observation post against enemy night-vision  devices; indicate to scouts the axes (sectors, objects)  requiring special attention; and assign additional missions for  local security.    The night reference points designated are usually local  features whose silhouettes have characteristic outlines and can  be seen against the night sky (for example, individual trees,  treelines, tall buildings, smokestacks, and so forth).    A man-made reference point (for example, a stake with  electric illumination pointing towards the command and  observation post) is set up no closer than 50 meters to check  the orientation of the instruments at the command and  observation post. In addition, it is advisable to set up stakes  painted white in the summer and black in the winter 7-10 meters  from the rangefinder to the right and left of the base line in  line with selected reference points for rapid target designation.    Conducting reconnaissance at night requires good training of  officers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and soldiers. Local  features observed when terrain is illuminated by illumination  devices differ substantially from those visible during the day.  As an illumination flare descends, shadows from the objects  appear which distort them even more. Dark local features and  terrain sectors (for example, marshes, bushes, and plowed  fields) appear smaller in size and more distant than they  actually are. Illuminated dry roads, rocks, hedges, wooden  fences, trench breastworks, barbed-wire entanglements,  sandhills, and other similar features are clearly seen. Tanks,  motor vehicles, and ATGM launchers can be observed through  binoculars at a distance of 2.5-3 km.    Primarily battlefield surveillance (SNAR) and  mortar-detection artillery (ARSOM) radars, sound-ranging  subunits, night-vision devices, and stopwatches are used for  reconnaissance of the enemy, adjustment of fire on targets  (registration points), and monitoring fire for effect.    Firing data are determined according to general rules. Fire  for effect is conducted for rebound effect or using shells with  time fuses.    The following measures are carried out to prepare gun  platoons for operations at night: angles of site are determined  when getting a fix on targets (registration points);  illuminating shells, smoke shells, and shells with a spotting  charge are distributed among the batteries, taking into account  the missions to be carried out; illumination is prepared for  sights, collimators, night aiming points, aiming circles, and  fire directors; the baseline of fire is staked out with luminous  stakes; steps are taken to observe light discipline; and local  security is reinforced.    Flashlights or kerosene lanterns with a vertical or  cruciform  slot for light in the direction of the fire position are used to  stake out the baseline of fire and to set up night aiming  points. Stakes without illumination also can be used to stake  out the baseline on moonlit nights.    When selecting primary and alternate aiming points, it is  necessary that they be no closer than 200 meters from the guns  and that the angle between them be at least 10-00. It is best to  prepare day aiming points for nighttime, since deflections on  targets remain unchanged in this case. If other aiming points  are to be prepared or if a collimator is to be used, the  deflections are recalculated.    Optical instruments and the glass of motor vehicle and prime  mover cabs are prepared to attenuate the effect of emissions  from a nuclear burst, and personnel wear special goggles.    To reinforce local security, additional sentry posts are set  up, patrolling is organized to reinforce local security, and an  alert gun crew and alert drivers are assigned.    Breakthrough of enemy defenses at night is usually  accomplished from a position of direct contact with the enemy.  The first-echelon battalion goes over to the attack, as a rule,  after artillery preparation of the attack or after the shelling.  Sometimes the offensive may begin without artillery preparation  of the attack in order to achieve surprise.    During artillery preparation of the attack, if called for by  the plan, a specially assigned battery (platoon, guns, mortars)  fire illumination or incendiary shells (mortar rounds) to  illuminate the terrain and targets, blind observation posts  (electrooptical devices) and weapons, and set fires in the area  occupied by the enemy. Electrooptical devices are blinded by the  burning of illuminating shell flare on the ground 100-150 meters  in front of the target being blinded.    During the course of the attack, the artillery battalion  commander relocates jointly with the commander of the maneuver  battalion being supported. The indicated axis of attack is  maintained according to the azimuth or reference points,  primarily by light markers which are set up by command of the  artillery battalion commander. The closest reference point is  designated in the area occupied by the enemy two-three km from  friendly subunits, and the rest are designated deep in the  enemy's defenses at the same distance from each other. When the  maneuver battalion comes to within 1.5-2 km of the reference  point, they cease fire with authorization of the maneuver  battalion commander and lift fire for setting up the next  reference point. When setting up reference points, fire is  delivered by platoon volleys or by series of deliberate fire of  a platoon (gun) at the rate of from two to five minutes.    Movement orientation lights are used, as a rule, for marking  boundaries and sometimes for more precise indication of the  direction of advance. Placement of the lights is accomplished  by simultaneous firing along two light markers which are  adjacent in depth.    Target designation at night is accomplished by tracer rounds  and signal flares and is clarified by personal contact between  the artillery battalion commander and the maneuver battalion  commander.    Registration fire and fire for effect at night are done  according to Gunnery and Fire Control Regulations and Procedures.    Fire positions for night firing are selected before the  start  of the offensive and as close as possible to the forward  subunits.    When fire positions are changed, it is advisable to relocate  most of the artillery battalion simultaneously. During the  movement, orientation is maintained according to well-visible  (prominent) local features, by compass, by movement orientation  lights, and using a course plotter.    During the transition from night to day operations, the  enemy  will strive to restore his troops' previous position by  counterattacks.    Taking this into account, the artillery battalion commander  must update information on the enemy and the position of  friendly forward subunits; assign additional missions for  reconnaissance of the enemy; update fire missions for the  batteries to cover the flanks and consolidate a captured line;  change fire positions; and replenish subunits' ammunition.    The artillery battalion commander may prepare barrage fire  in  advance to repel an enemy counterattack.    The experience of combat operations during the Great  Patriotic War showed that the hours of darkness contributed to  achieving surprise and reduced losses from enemy fire. However,  a night offensive required thorough preparation, which was  usually accomplished during daylight. Cooperation between  infantry and tanks was worked out with precision, and attention  was given to coordinating signals and methods of target  designation.    Artillery preparation of the attack during a night offensive  was not always conducted; however, artillery and mortars were  ready to open fire immediately against assigned targets. After  taking designated attack targets, rifle subunits would be ready  for the defense, particularly an antitank defense. To this end,  antitank weapons were attached to them, and reconnaissance of  the enemy and local security would be organized.  <H5>  Operations in the Mountains </H5>   Abrupt changes in the weather conditions, frequent fog, low  cloud cover, difficulty of orientation on the terrain,  insufficient or lack of convenient routes for motor transport  movement, steep ascents and descents, rocky soil, lack of  convenient places for fire positions, and other peculiarities of  mountainous terrain affect the operations of artillery subunits  in the mountains.    When organizing reconnaissance in the artillery battalion,  it  is necessary to study the surrounding terrain carefully and take  into account the nature of its relief. The command and  observation posts and observation posts of the artillery  battalion and batteries are located at different elevations,  dispersed laterally and staggered in depth for a better view of  the terrain. Lateral observation posts can be set up in the  location of adjacent subunits. Individual observation posts also  may be deployed behind fire positions. Cross-observation posts  should be deployed at approximately the same elevation.    Target designation in the mountains is performed by the  usual  method. However, an artillery panorama (Figure 19) is used for  convenience and ease of orientation on the terrain.          Fire positions are selected in mountain valleys, hollows,  gorges, on reverse hill slopes, in natural clearings, and in  other convenient places. Fire positions should not be selected  and artillery prime movers should not be positioned in dried-up  river beds or near shallow mountain rivers, since they may  suddenly turn into deep rivers and disrupt mission  accomplishment.    Batteries' gun platoons may be deployed either at one fire  position or by platoons at two fire positions. Sometimes two  batteries or the entire artillery battalion may be situated at  one site. Positioning of batteries at various elevations and  placing the guns in the batteries with considerable range and  height differences is typical for mountainous conditions.    When figuring computed data, the artillery battalion staff  takes into account the difference in elevation of battery fire  positions, and the SOB [senior battery officer] calculates and  makes corrections for the height difference of guns relative to  the base gun.    Fire positions in the mountains may be selected near roads.  This improves the artillery battalion's maneuverability and  creates the best conditions for conducting a topogeodetic survey  and delivering ammunition. However, such placement of gun  platoons increases the possibility of the enemy detecting them  and neutralizing them by artillery fire and air strikes.    An insufficiently developed topogeodetic network or the lack  of it makes it difficult to determine fire position coordinates  and command and observation post sites. In a number of cases, a  topogeodetic survey is performed using the conventional system  of coordinates.    Rocky and stony soils and steep slopes make engineer  preparation of fire positions and command and observation post  sites difficult. Taking these conditions into account, one  should make extensive use of existing natural cover and, when  possible, prepare slit trenches for personnel and gun  emplacements.    Radio is the primary means of communication in the  mountains.  However, the mountains create a screening effect, reducing the  range of communications. Therefore, radios are situated on the  slopes of the mountain facing the operator on the other end and  on mountain peaks; directional antennas also are used. If line  of sight between radios is difficult due to terrain conditions,  an intermediate radio is set up on the dominant elevation.    An offensive in the mountains is conducted primarily along  valleys, mountain ridges, and roads. Depending on the nature of  the mountainous terrain, the maneuver battalion may operate as  part of the regiment's main body or independently, apart from  the main body. Wide and close envelopment of the flanks of enemy  strongholds combined with a frontal attack are a maneuver  battalion's usual actions in the mountains. A maneuver  battalion, and sometimes even a company, may be designated as an  enveloping detachment to capture important objectives deep in  the enemy defenses.    When advancing along a narrow mountain valley, a maneuver  battalion first takes the adjacent elevations from which the  enemy is conducting flanking fire. A maneuver battalion captures  a mountain pass from the front on its own or in cooperation with  an enveloping detachment. The artillery battalion may be  attached to or support the maneuver battalion.    During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery  battalion may carry out missions involving simultaneous  engagement of several targets located on various altitude  levels. Each battery of the artillery battalion will most often  carry out missions independently, engaging individual observed  weapons in the open and under cover. Some of the artillery  battalion's guns move up to direct-fire positions to increase  fire effectiveness and conserve ammunition. Delivery of  effective fire involves certain difficulties in conditions of  mountainous terrain. The enemy is engaged on reverse hill  slopes, in ravines, and in hollows by fire from howitzer and  mortar batteries. Strongholds adjacent to roads and mountain  passes are neutralized with the greatest reliability.    Artillery support of the attack is conducted taking into  account the conditions of the enemy's defensive disposition.    When attacking an elevation with a multitiered disposition  of  weapons, the artillery battalion first neutralizes the weapons  in the lower tiers. When the attacking subunits approach the  elevation, the artillery battalion shifts fire to the targets in  the next tiers, particularly those delivering flanking fire.    Prior to attacking a stronghold with weapons disposed in a  single tier, the artillery battalion neutralizes them before the  attacking subunits reach the troop safety line, then shifts fire  against the targets located in the rear and on adjacent and  distant elevations, and also against the enemy as it builds up  for a counterattack.    The role of independent battery fire in the mountains is  increasing considerably. Timely and accurate battery fire  provides effective help to attacking subunits in capturing  roads, passes in gorges, mountain passes, and bridges. In this  regard, the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders  must display independence, resourcefulness, and initiative for  successful accomplishment of the assigned mission during an  offensive.    Experience of combat operations in the mountains shows that  to increase accuracy of fire against targets, two-three  registration points are set up at various levels, and fire is  shifted from the registration points, which helps to achieve  more effective target engagement. Adjustment of fire is  mandatory in these conditions.    Continuous cooperation in the mountains is achieved by the  joint location and relocation of the command and observation  posts of the maneuver battalion and artillery battalion and of  the companies and batteries. Observation posts are set up at a  distance from the artillery battalion and batteries in order to  support reconnaissance of the enemy and adjustment of fire. It  should be borne in mind that relocating command and observation  posts and observation posts will mean negotiating steep slopes,  which will require additional time. Considerable difficulties  will arise in orientation, topogeodetic survey, determination of  target coordinates, and fire control.    Advancing enemy reserves and withdrawing subunits are  engaged  by fire from the artillery battalion and batteries when they  cross mountain passes, gorges, and bridges, and when they  negotiate mountain rivers and other difficult places. For fire  control under these conditions, a forward observation post is  set up to direct the combat formations of motorized rifle  subunits, or an observation post is left on the predominant  elevation in the rear of friendly subunits. When necessary, a  forward observation post may be sent into the area occupied by  the enemy. Adjustment of fire can also be conducted from a  helicopter.    Battery relocation takes into account the continuous support  of the maneuver battalion's combat operations, in addition to  the nature of the terrain and the possibility of a rapid  relocation to new fire positions. Experience shows that  considerably more time will be spent on leaving the fire  position, moving gun platoons over a mountain road, and  deployment than when operating in conditions of average terrain.  Therefore, fire positions should be changed less frequently, and  fire should be delivered from positions occupied to maximum  ranges. Relocation in the zone of an adjacent unit's advance in  the mountains is permitted with authorization of the senior  commander. Safety precautions prescribed when traveling over  mountain roads are observed during the relocation.    With the start of an offensive or during the course of it,  an  artillery battalion (battery) may be assigned to support an  enveloping detachment. The intelligence officer (KVU  [headquarters platoon commander]) with necessary personnel and  reconnaissance and communications equipment is sent out with the  detachment commander.    Let us follow the instructive actions of an artillery  battalion in support of an enveloping detachment as part of a  reinforced rifle battalion in the mountains.[.sup]5[/]    On 20 September 1944, out troops were pursuing fascist  German units in mountainous woodland. The 4th Rifle Regt  approached the populated area of Bogoviny, located on an  important axis (Figure 20), and attacked it on the move.  Encountering strong fire resistance from the eastern outskirts,  the regiment was unsuccessful and withdrew to initial  positions.          To take the populated area with the fewest losses, it  was decided to dispatch an enveloping detachment--the reinforced  1st Bn, 4th Rifle Regt. Its mission was to go around Bogoviny  from the north on the night of 22/23 September, cut off the  highway running from Bogoviny to Zaychar, and at 0600 hours,  supported by the 2d Bn, 818th Artillery Regiment, attack and  destroy the enemy in Bogoviny.    In preparing for combat, the artillery battalion  commander encountered difficulties in selecting fire positions  in the mountains for the gun batteries (ZIS-3's). If the gun  platoons were deployed 2 km from the forward edge, the minimum  elevation would not allow firing on targets; if the fire  positions were selected five-six km away, the batteries would  not have enough cable to establish communications.    After assessing the situation, the artillery battalion  commander decided to advance the gun platoons to direct-fire  positions on a crest of hills two km from the forward edge of  the enemy's defenses and to deploy the howitzer battery on  reverse hill slopes.    Smoke pots were lit 250-300 meters ahead of the fire  positions, 10 minutes before the start of registration fire, to  conceal the disposition of gun platoons. The smoke screen was  maintained throughout the registration fire.    The command and observation posts of the gun batteries  were deployed on hills 500 meters east of Bogoviny. The  artillery battalion commander, together with the howitzer  battery commander, intelligence officer, and a group of scouts  with two radios, set off together with the maneuver battalion to  bypass Bogoviny.    By 0400 hours on 23 September the maneuver battalion  had bypassed the populated area, cut off the highway to Zaychar,  and taken up the attack position in the bushes 200 meters west  of Bogoviny. The enemy did not detect the maneuver  battalion.    After deploying his command and observation post  together with the maneuver battalion's command and observation  post, the artillery battalion commander conducted registration  fire. Target coordinates were determined using bilateral  observation. Registration fire was conducted with smoke shells  until bursts were brought to the line observer target.  Registration fire was completed by 0540 hours.    At 0630 hours, the artillery battalion conducted a  five-minute shelling against targets on the western outskirts of  Bogoviny. The infantry initiated the assault, seized the western  outskirts, and continued to advance. Seeing the threat of  encirclement, the enemy counterattacked the maneuver battalion  with up to two companies, but was beaten back by the artillery  battalion's fire and withdrew into the center of Bogoviny.    The artillery battalion's fire was shifted to the  center of the populated area. After a 10-minute shelling, our  infantry resumed the attack. Gathering the remnants of his  subunits, the enemy moved into a counterattack, supported by  three tanks and two APC's, in order to break out of  encirclement. However, the well-organized fire of our infantry  and artillery foiled this counterattack as well.    Using the reserves, the maneuver battalion commander  attacked the scattered enemy subunits and in the vicinity of the  school and church encircled and destroyed them. Only a small  group withdrew to the eastern outskirts of the populated area,  where it met with organized fire from the 4th and 5th Batteries  and was completely routed by the attack of the maneuver  battalion. In this battle, the maneuver battalion took 280  soldiers and officers prisoner and captured three tanks, two  mortar batteries, a 105-mm artillery battery, and much other  military equipment and property. The maneuver battalion  successfully accomplished its assigned mission and supported the  advance of our units toward the city of Zaychar.    In this battle, the artillery battalion commander  displayed creativeness in selecting fire positions for the gun  and howitzer batteries and in covering the registration fire  with a smoke screen.  <H5>  Operations in the Desert </H5>   Monotony of the level terrain, sharp temperature  fluctuations  during a 24-hour period, limited water sources, and frequent  sandstorms affect the combat operations of artillery in the  desert. High daytime temperatures can cause heat strokes in  personnel, and the bright daytime sun can cause eye ailments.    To prevent unfavorable effects on subunit personnel, they  are  provided with appropriate clothing, and observance of water  discipline is monitored. In addition, lengthy halts should be  avoided at locations of stagnant air heated by the sun.    The monotonous level nature of the terrain causes  considerable difficulties with orientation, target designation,  and determining distances and target coordinates. It also  complicates map usage and the topogeodetic survey. On the other  hand, such terrain permits effective use of aerial and radar  reconnaissance. Coordinates of observed targets are reliably  determined by using a baseless rangefinder and bilateral  observation.    As a rule, command and observation posts are deployed on the  slopes of sand dunes, in undergrowth, and in other convenient  spots. Fire positions should be selected between sand dunes and  hillocks, in ravines, and in dry riverbeds. They can be located  farther from the forward edge than in ordinary conditions.  Topographic survey vehicles and gyroscopic and astronomical  orientation should be used extensively in topographic survey of  sites for command and observation posts, observation posts, and  fire positions. In the absence of firm points in a geodetic  network, it can be accomplished in a conventional coordinate  system. Inputs of personnel and equipment for digging shelters  are reduced during engineer preparation of fire positions and  command and observation sites in sandy soil. However, sandy soil  requires additional reinforcement of slopes.    The locations of guns and artillery prime movers are  camouflaged by organic assets and also by using camouflage paint.    Reserves of water and fuel for preparing food and for other  needs are established when an artillery battalion operates in  waterless areas. It is advisable to have containers for water  storage and transportation in every subunit. Strict monitoring  of water use is established.    The sharp temperature fluctuations in a 24-hour period cause  changes in charge temperatures, which affects the accuracy of  fire. In this connection, ammunition should be protected against  the effect of direct sunlight, charge temperatures should be  checked more often, and corrections for these changes should be  made to computed firing data.    An offensive in the desert is usually conducted along the  most important individual axes, as a rule, without halt in  attack position, using broad maneuver for wide and close  envelopment of the enemy's exposed flanks and attacking from the  rear.    Hours of darkness are used most often for aggressive and  decisive operations. The maneuver battalion's combat formation  is aligned taking into account the possibility of conducting  independent operations.    In an offensive, an artillery battalion may operate as part  of an artillery group or be attached to a maneuver battalion  that makes up an enveloping detachment. Primarily self-propelled  artillery subunits are assigned to the enveloping detachment.    When preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion  commander clarifies from the commander of the supported  battalion and disseminates to all subunit commanders the azimuth  of the axis of the offensive and the procedure for designating  the position of forward subunits.    Before the start of the offensive, the artillery battalion  may participate in artillery preparation of the attack or  conduct a brief shelling, neutralizing enemy strongholds  (centers of defense), mortar platoons, artillery batteries,  command posts, and reserves.    During the course of the offensive, the advance of the  maneuver battalion's subunits may be uneven and in echelons;  therefore, enemy counterattacks against exposed flanks are  possible. The artillery battalion commander organizes  reconnaissance and, if an advancing enemy is detected, organizes  timely engagement of him.    When bypassing individual enemy strongholds, the artillery  battalion screens the flank of the advancing maneuver battalion,  neutralizing enemy weapons or blanketing them with smoke. The  artillery battalion may lay a smoke screen during commitment of  the maneuver battalion's (regiment's) second echelon to cover  its advance.    Organization of self-defense of gun platoons throughout the  offensive is a special concern of the senior battery officer  (gun platoon commander), since there is an increased possibility  of individual groups of tanks breaking through when conducting  desert combat. When relocating the command and observation post,  command and control of subunits is accomplished in the movement.  Gun platoons relocate along directions maintained by instruments  of the command vehicles.  <H5>  Operations in Northern Areas </H5>   The vast sections of tundra, forest tundra, and wooded  terrain and, in some sectors, mountainous terrain with a large  number of lakes, boulders, and rocky ground affect an artillery  battalion's combat operations in northern areas.    Frequent abundant snowfalls, blizzards, low temperatures,  and  deep snow cover hinder the artillery battalion's movement and  deployment, require systematic clearing of roads or laying of  cross-country routes, and make it necessary to supply motor  vehicles and prime movers with antifreeze and warming covers. If  the situation permits, guns are warmed up with individual rounds  at reduced charges in order to open fire in a timely manner.  Warm clothing and hot meals are provided to personnel to ensure  they are able to work and to prevent frostbite. Warming stations  are set up in the vicinity of the fire positions and command and  observation posts at the rate of one station per platoon.    The frozen ground hinders engineer preparation of fire  positions and sites for subunit command and observation posts.  When there is a deep snow cover, shelters, including gun  emplacements and command and observation post sites, are made  out of snow, and ice is frozen on their breastworks for strength.    Abundant snowfall and the long polar night make it difficult  to conduct artillery reconnaissance and adjustment of fire, and  also to use topographic maps for orientation. For camouflage,  the guns, prime movers, and other equipment are painted white,  and personnel are supplied with camouflage smocks. Gun  emplacements are camouflaged with organic camouflage nets.    Alert crews, scouts, and observers are relieved more often  in  the winter; they are given the opportunity and time to warm up.  Additional reserves of ammunition, fuels, and rations are  established in case of heavy snowdrifts.    In the summertime, the abundance of lakes, the presence of  vast swampy areas, and the huge number of mosquitoes and  blood-sucking flies cause considerable difficulties for  artillery operations.    Frequent ionospheric and geomagnetic disturbances adversely  affect the operation of radios, particularly HF radios. These  phenomena make it impossible to use an aiming circle. In these  cases, the orientation of instruments on celestial bodies and a  topographic survey of combat formation elements using the  topographic survey vehicle or a conventional coordinate system  should be widely used.    An offensive in northern areas is conducted along roads,  rivers, and other accessible axes. It usually begins from a  position of direct contact with the enemy; on terrain accessible  for subunit operations off the roads, it is accomplished without  halt in attack position.    An artillery battalion may be attached to or support a  first-echelon maneuver battalion or a maneuver battalion  attacking on an independent axis. In addition, an artillery  battalion (battery) of self-propelled artillery is attached to  an enveloping detachment.    In northern areas, an artillery battalion often will conduct  combat operations at night, which will require that additional  illumination and smoke rounds be allocated to it. Other measures  also must be conducted to ensure the best accomplishment of  missions at night.    Artillery preparation and support of advancing subunits are  usually conducted by concentrated fire and engagement of single  targets. When advancing on important axes, artillery support may  be accomplished by successive fire concentration.    When planning and preparing combat operations, the  difficulty  of the terrain both in the winter and summer should be taken  into account. Therefore, fire positions are usually selected  near roads and cross-country routes.    The long nights in the winter and the frequent fog in the  summer create favorable conditions for surprise offensive  operations and employment of enveloping detachments. In such  conditions, the artillery battalion must be ready to execute a  sudden adjustment of fire and maneuver of subunits.  Footnotes    1. Boyevoy opyt artillerii: Sbornik statey.

The Artillery Battalion in a Meeting Engagement </H5> <H5>  Artillery Battalion Missions </H5>   The high mobility and great shock force of subunits and  units  of modern armies, which are equipped with tanks, combat  vehicles, APC's, artillery, mortars, ATGM launchers, and other  weapons, as well as decisiveness in achieving assigned missions  give combat operations a mobile nature.    Combat operations will be accompanied by rapid changes in  the  situation, considerable gaps will arise between subunits and  units, and exposed flanks will appear as a result. Each side  will strive to defeat the opposition by using vigorous offensive  operations. Exploiting the results of nuclear strikes and the  fire of conventional weapons, attacking subunits will strive to  deliver attacks against exposed flanks in short periods of time  and break through into their rear.    An engagement may emerge under the most varied conditions.  It  is possible during a march, during exploitation, while repelling  enemy counterattacks on the move, and also in the defense when  our second echelons (reserves), advancing for a counterattack or  for occupying a favorable line, encounter the attacking enemy.    In anticipation of an encounter with the enemy, each side  attempts to preempt the other in opening artillery fire, moving  subunits to a favorable line, deployment, and shifting to the  offensive. Depending on the situation conditions and the  distance separating the sides, subunits may advance in battle,  approach march, or march formations. Sometimes part of the  forces may advance in battle or approach march formations, and  part in march formation.    The mission of artillery in a meeting engagement is to  preempt the enemy in deploying his artillery and opening fire,  and to achieve fire superiority, and thus enable our units to  deploy and seize the initiative.    In a march in anticipation of engagement, the artillery  battalion may operate as part of a forward detachment, an  advance guard, or the main body.    In a meeting engagement during pursuit of the enemy or in a  defensive maneuver, the artillery battalion may be a part of an  artillery group and support or be attached to a first-echelon  battalion. In this case, the artillery battalion may move in the  maneuver battalion's column, be deployed in battle formation, or  relocate from one fire position area to another at full strength  or with a part of the batteries.    The artillery battalion may carry out the following missions  in an engagement: block the advance of enemy columns and the  deployment of tanks and motorized infantry into battle  formation; screen the advance and deployment of friendly  motorized rifle and tank subunits and support their attack;  screen exposed flanks of subunits and repel enemy tank and  infantry attacks; block the enemy's withdrawal and consolidation  on favorable lines; and support combined-arms subunits when  consolidating captured lines.    When carrying out these missions, the artillery battalion  engages the enemy's offensive nuclear and chemical weapons; his  artillery and mortar batteries; approaching columns,  particularly at crossings, at chokepoints, and in other sectors.  The purpose is to hinder deployment of forces; tanks, personnel;  weapons, above all antitank weapons; electronic equipment; and  command posts. The artillery battalion achieves success in  carrying out assigned missions in such conditions by its correct  disposition in the march (approach march) formation of the  combined-arms unit or subunit, constant conducting of artillery  reconnaissance, organization of stable communications, rapid  deployment into battle formation, preparation of fire in short  time periods, and broad initiative and independence of subunit  commanders.    Fire missions are carried out by decision of the artillery  battalion commander, maneuver battalion commander, or senior  artillery commander (chief). Concentrated fire or engagement of  single targets is used to engage the enemy, and barrage fire is  used to repel attacks (counterattacks).    One of the typical features of an engagement is the lack of  a  long period of time to organize it. All work for organizing the  artillery battalion's combat operations will be carried out in  minimum time periods. The artillery battalion commander usually  assigns missions to battery commanders from the map and by brief  instructions and commands.  <H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5>   When an artillery battalion operates as part of a forward  detachment (advance guard), an engagement usually begins with a  clash between the advance party and forward enemy units. When it  encounters enemy reconnaissance and security subunits, the  advance party destroys them by fire and decisive actions on the  move and continues carrying out its assigned mission.    The commander of a battery that is part of an advance party  moves out with the commander of the advance party with part of  the headquarters platoon, while gun platoons headed by the  senior battery officer are located at the tail of the column  (Figure 21). For rapid deployment of the battery, the battery  commander conducts reconnaissance of the terrain continuously on  the route of movement, plans fire positions in succession, and  maintains continuous radio communications with the gun platoons.  The commander of the battery's headquarters platoon may proceed  with the forward patrol with reconnaissance and communications  equipment.          On encountering superior enemy forces or when the enemy has  preempted the advance party in deployment, the advance party  commander takes steps to occupy a favorable line, engages the  enemy with fire from all weapons, and ensures conditions for  deployment and commitment of the main body of the advance guard.  Motorized rifle company personnel dismount.    The battery deploys immediately into battle formation on  order of the advance party commander. The battery commander  indicates to the senior battery officer the fire position area  (on the map), the baseline of fire, the minimum range of fire,  and the location of the battery command and observation post.  Timeliness in opening fire by the battery is achieved and  continuous cooperation with the advance party is maintained by  deploying the battery command and observation post together with  the advance party commander's command and observation post and  by deploying the gun platoons at fire positions near the road  (route). The battery commander issues instructions to the  headquarters platoon commander for reconnoitering the advancing  enemy columns, their composition, and their direction and speed  of movement; for determining coordinates of enemy weapons ahead  of line of conduct of combat operations by the advance party and  commitment of the main body of the forward detachment (advance  guard); and for reconnoitering enemy observation posts and  artillery and mortar batteries.    The battery supports the advance party's combat at command  of  the battery commander or at the direction of the advance party  commander. Primarily, it neutralizes tanks and motorized  infantry attacking or deploying for an attack and posing the  greatest danger to the advance party.    As a rule, the battery fires against one or simultaneously  against two targets. When firing against two targets, the  battery commander may control one platoon, and the headquarters  platoon commander the other. The battery commander prepares  and conducts a fixed barrage to repel an enemy attack.    The battery commander informs the artillery battalion  commander when a meeting engagement is started, when the battery  deploys into battle formation, and when it opens fire.    Since the depth of the advance party column is  insignificant,  gun platoons will deploy a short distance from the advance party  battle formation. If there are exposed flanks, a breakthrough by  enemy tanks to the battery gun platoons is possible.    Tanks that have broken through are destroyed by direct fire.  To do this, the senior battery officer determines the likely  avenues of tank approach immediately after occupying the fire  positions and organizes observation, indicating to gun  commanders the sectors for firing on tanks and the line and  signal for opening fire on them.    In a number of cases, when an engagement begins, the  artillery battery may deploy at a direct-fire position to  destroy tanks, armored vehicles, antitank weapons, and other  important targets by direct fire. Organizing fire control of  guns (locations of radios and procedure for transmitting  commands and target designation) must be provided for in advance.    The experience of the Great Patriotic War also indicates  that  an artillery battalion may sometimes be deployed at full  strength.[.sup]1[/]    Thus, in the Battle of Stalingrad, the 8th Separate  Horse-Artillery Battalion was supporting the offensive led by a  guards cavalry regiment. At night on 22 November 1942, it was  successfully advancing in the operational rear of the enemy's  defense--a long, deep ravine on the line of march. The cavalry  regiment easily negotiated it and continued to move, while the  artillery battalion had great difficulty crossing this ravine  due to ice and did so only toward dawn. The regiment being  supported was already a considerable distance away, and the  artillery battalion continued moving in an independent column.  It soon approached a fork of two roads: an improved dirt road  and a field road. The artillery battalion commander halted the  column and sent out reconnaissance.    A halted column soon became visible 150-200 meters down  the improved road; initially it was taken to be the motor column  of our units. The artillery battalion continued moving over the  left field road. It was soon learned that the column on the  improved road was a fascist German column, which numbered 42  tanks and several dozen vehicles. Having seen the artillery  battalion, the fascists opened fire on it from all guns and  machineguns.    The artillery battalion immediately deployed along the  road and began direct fire on the enemy tanks. A fierce fight  ensued. In groups of four-six tanks each, the enemy began to  outflank the artillery battalion, simultaneously attacking the  artillery battalion with the bulk of the tanks. But four tanks  were set afire by the very first shells from guns of the 1st and  3d batteries. The rest of the tanks halted and opened fire.  Soon, two guns were destroyed and nine horses killed in the 3d  Battery. The fighting continued. Only one gunner remained at one  of the guns, but he continued to fight the tanks. Other  artillery units soon came to the battalion's aid and provided  considerable assistance to the artillery battalion. A total of  25 enemy tanks were knocked out, of which nine were set afire  and seven disabled by the artillery battalion, which suffered  minor losses.    With the start of deployment of the advance party for  combat,  the artillery battalion intelligence officer selects the site  for the battalion's command and observation post near the  command and observation post of the advance party commander,  stops the vehicle, sets up instruments, and organizes  reconnaissance of the enemy. He informs the artillery battalion  about his location and the latest information on the enemy.    When the advance party engages in combat, the forward  detachment (advance guard) commander moves up to the advance  party, assesses the situation, and, according to the results of  the combat, makes the decision to deploy the main body for a  meeting engagement and assigns missions to organic and attached  subunits.    Advancing with the forward detachment (advance guard)  commander, the artillery battalion commander receives from him  the mission on the move and in conditions of extremely limited  time must do the following: update the missions for  reconnaissance of the enemy; plan the artillery battalion's fire  position area; determine the fire missions (targets for  neutralization) in accordance with the forward detachment  (advance guard) commander's decision; issue instructions for  movement and deployment of the artillery battalion into battle  formation in the planned area; assign missions to the batteries;  and brief the procedures for their cooperation with supporting  combined-arms subunits.    In these conditions, the artillery battalion commander  usually assigns (briefs) missions to subordinates using brief  operational instructions, commands, and earlier established  signals both personally and over communications equipment. When  determining the fire missions for the batteries, the artillery  battalion commander takes into account the results of  reconnaissance from all assets. It is advisable to leave as the  fire mission a target (targets) reconnoitered by a given battery.    In the deployment instructions, the artillery battalion  commander gives information about the enemy (where he is located  and his actions), the areas (locations) of the battery fire  positions and command and observation posts, the baseline of  fire, the readiness time for opening fire, and the location of  the artillery battalion command and observation post. The  artillery battalion commander determines the locations of the  battery command and observation posts taking into account the  allocation of the batteries for supporting the motorized rifle  companies. The company and battery command and observation posts  are usually located on command vehicles (APC's, IFV's) and  should be arranged side by side. In a transient battle, they may  not be deployed on the ground.    After receiving from the battalion commander instructions  (command, signal) for deployment into battle formation, the  battery commander immediately gives the command (instruction) to  the senior battery officer to occupy the fire positions. The  battery commander moves to the designated area with the  headquarters platoon, deploys the command and observation post,  organizes reconnaissance, establishes personal contact with the  commander of the combined-arms subunit being supported, briefs  him on the mission, and opens fire on enemy tanks and antitank  weapons.    Preempting the enemy in deployment of batteries and opening  fire, the artillery battalion inflicts losses on the enemy even  before engagement, disrupts the planned deployment of enemy  subunits, and makes it possible for forward detachment (advance  guard) subunits to engage in an organized manner.    Skillfully using terrain folds and under cover of artillery  and mortar fire, the main body of the forward detachment  (advance guard) advances to the assigned line and deploys into  battle formation from the line of march (Figure 22) and,  supported by fire from the artillery battalion and mortar  subunits, boldly and decisively attack the enemy, striving to  split the enemy and destroy it in detail.          Taking into account the specific conditions, the attack may  be conducted on combat vehicles (APC's) or in a dismounted  formation.    Fire from the artillery battalion (battery) is used to  immediately neutralize observed targets whose fire is hindering  the attack of motorized rifle and tank subunits. The available  mobile reserves of shells are expended extremely economically.  The artillery battalion commander prepares a fixed barrage to  prevent the enemy from enveloping the flanks of the forward  detachment (advance guard).    Success in an engagement is ensured by precise, coordinated  actions of all subunits participating in the attack, skillful  command and control of them, and bravery and initiative of  personnel.    Here is one combat example.[.sup]2[/]    On 25 October 1944, our units had the mission of moving  to the Baltic Sea and cutting off the path of fascist German  units trying to break through from Latvia into Eastern Prussia.  The 2d Bn, 953d Rifle Regt with the 2d Bn, 793d Gun Arty Regt  made up the forward detachment and received the mission to  execute a march, seize the populated areas of Iyechukreks and  Miyemis, organize an all-around defense, and hold this area  until the main body of the division arrived (Figure 23).          After assessing the situation, the maneuver battalion  and artillery battalion commanders concluded that an encounter  with the enemy or a surprise enemy attack was possible during  the impending night march. In this connection, they took  measures to prepare the subunits for the march; reinforced  reconnaissance was sent out from the maneuver battalion and  artillery battalion on the route of movement; local security was  organized; column control signals were established; observers  were assigned in each subunit; and battery commanders had  continuous contact with the commanders of the supported  companies.    Maneuver battalion personnel traveled in vehicles, and  artillery battalion personnel in artillery prime movers. At  dawn, after passing Miyemis, reconnaissance reported that up to  a battalion of fascist German infantry and tanks was moving  along the Ignatkrogs-Miyemis highway.    The maneuver battalion commander immediately deployed  the companies, occupied a favorable line, and prepared the  subunits to repel an enemy attack with stationary fire.  Simultaneously, the artillery battalion deployed into battle  formation. The 4th and 5th Batteries took up direct-fire  positions, situating the guns to the right and left of the road.  The prime movers were moved to the nearest shelters. The 6th  Battery deployed at an indirect-fire position. The artillery  battalion headquarters established communications with the  batteries in a short time.    Fascist tanks and motorized infantry soon appeared on  the highway and on its shoulders. After they had crossed the  bridge and were in a broad clearing 400-500 meters from our  subunits, we opened surprise fire from two batteries and all  types of the maneuver battalion's weapons. The batteries'  first rounds set three tanks afire. The enemy was confused. Soon  the 4th Battery managed to knock out another tank; the rest of  the tanks turned back and took cover in the small brush. At this  time the 6th Battery, firing from indirect-fire positions,  destroyed a group of enemy submachinegunners trying to outflank  our subunits along a cutting. The initiative and preponderance  of forces were on the side of our subunits. The forward  detachment went over to the attack, destroyed up to a platoon of  submachinegunners, and captured 10 prisoners. The approaching  main body closed once and for all the exit for fascist German  units in this sector from Latvia to Eastern Prussia.    If the enemy has preempted the forward detachment in moving  to the designated line with superior forces and has preempted  the advance guard in deploying and conducting the attack, the  artillery battalion repels the enemy attacks in cooperation with  other weapons, prevents him from penetrating into the gaps  between companies, covers exposed flanks, and destroys by direct  fire enemy tanks and motorized infantry that have broken through  to the fire position area. Subsequently, the artillery battalion  uses its fire to cover the deployment and engagement of the  regiment's main body.    As a rule, an artillery battalion that is part of the main  body moves at the head of the main column and must be in  constant readiness for a rapid advance and immediate deployment  into battle formation to support the advance guard and cover the  deployment of and support the subunits of the main body during  their commitment. The artillery battalion commander receives  information about the enemy from the intelligence officer, who  proceeds with the advance guard. The artillery battalion  commander receives the mission for deployment from the map from  the senior artillery commander or from the commander of the  combined-arms unit to which the artillery battalion is attached.    An artillery battalion may be assigned to support a maneuver  battalion which is part of the main body, and batteries may be  assigned to support companies. In this case, the artillery  battalion commander establishes contact with the maneuver  battalion commander before reaching the main body's line of  commitment. Based on the mission received, the artillery  commander issues an instruction (prearranged signal) for  deployment into battle formation, tasks the intelligence officer  to select a location for the command and observation post, moves  with the commander of the supported maneuver battalion to a  designated place, hears the intelligence officer's report on  reconnoitered targets, determines and assigns missions for the  batteries, organizes artillery battalion fire control, and  briefs procedures for cooperation of batteries with the  supported tank or motorized rifle subunits.    Advancing at the head of the column of battery gun platoons,  the artillery battalion staff directs their deployment and the  conduct of the topogeodetic survey, sets up the battalion fire  control post, and organizes artillery battalion fire control.    Prior to the attack by the main body, the artillery  battalion  takes part in a shelling to neutralize personnel, weapons,  artillery batteries, and mortar platoons on the axis of attack.  The artillery battalion commander receives the mission for the  shelling from the senior artillery commander or the  combined-arms commander. The shelling begins and is conducted so  that its completion coincides with the arrival of our subunits  at the troop safety line. During the attack, the artillery  battalion uses concentrated fire and battery fire against single  targets to neutralize enemy personnel and weapons blocking  exploitation by the main body. As the combined-arms subunits  advance, the artillery battalion usually relocates by batteries  to ensure continuous support of the advancing subunits.    The artillery battalion's further actions will depend on the  success achieved by the main body during exploitation of the  engagement. If the enemy has begun a withdrawal, the artillery  battalion uses its fire to engage him on the withdrawal routes,  especially when he passes through such narrow spots as bridges,  crossings, defiles, and the like. If the enemy attempts to go  over to a defensive action, the artillery battalion engages  personnel and weapons on the line he occupies.  Footnotes    1.

Artillery Battalion in the Defense </H5> <H5>  Artillery Battalion Missions </H5>   The goal of a defense is to repel an offensive move by  superior enemy forces, hold important areas (positions), and  create conditions for going over to a decisive offensive action.    This goal can be achieved only as a result of the defending  subunits using a number of advantages over the attacking enemy.  These advantages may be: defensive disposition on the most  favorable lines; more effective use of weapons (creating a fire  plan) taking into account protective properties of the terrain  and preparation of the positions; creating shelters for  personnel; setting up a variety of artificial obstacles;  accomplishing camouflage protection; and also preparation of  maneuver of forces and weapons.    The goal of a defensive action can be achieved only through  the joint efforts of subunits of all branches of troops and  special troops.    Depending on the enemy's situation, the nature of his  actions, and the mission to be undertaken, the maneuver  battalion's defense may be in conditions of direct contact or  out of direct contact with the enemy. The defensive action may  be prepared in advance or organized during the course of combat.  Going over to the defense in conditions of direct contact with  the enemy is usually accomplished in limited time periods and,  as a rule, under pressure of enemy airstrikes, artillery fire,  and fire from other weapons. It can take place during the course  of an offensive action both on the main and secondary axes for  accomplishing missions of repelling attacks by superior enemy  forces, securing the flanks of advancing groupings,  consolidating captured lines and installations, and supporting a  disengagement and withdrawal in an unfavorable situation or in  the event of an unsuccessful outcome of an engagement. The  frontage of the area assigned to a maneuver battalion for  defense usually will be larger than the zone of advance.  Therefore, it will be necessary to receive terrain sectors from  adjacent subunits when going over to a defensive action within a  designated area and to carry out a regrouping of the maneuver  battalion's forces and weapons.    Subunits in the second echelon, when defending islands and  the seacoast, will usually go over to the defense out of direct  contact with the enemy.    A motorized rifle battalion may defend in the regiment's  first or second echelon. The maneuver battalion carries out its  assigned mission in coordination with adjacent subunits and with  their support.    An artillery battalion on the defensive engages the enemy by  fire in coordination with other weapons according to the  following missions: artillery interdiction of the advance and  deployment of enemy troops; artillery repelling of an enemy  attack; artillery support of defending troops in the rear; and  engagement of the enemy when conducting counterattacks. An  artillery battalion may also be used for artillery  counterpreparation fire.    When conducting artillery counterpreparation fire,  an artillery battalion (battery) carries out fire missions for  engaging assigned targets in accordance with the fire plan.  Targets for engagement may be offensive nuclear and chemical  weapons, artillery and mortar batteries, command posts, and  tanks and motorized infantry during their advance and  deployment, or when they have prepared for an attack from attack  positions. The artillery battalion may carry out assigned fire  missions from occupied fire positions or from fire positions  after executing a maneuver. After carrying out fire missions in  counterpreparation fire, the artillery battalion prepares to  repel the enemy's attack; if the enemy has executed a maneuver,  the battalion returns to the previous or newly assigned fire  position area.    In artillery interdiction of an advance and deployment  of enemy troops, the artillery battalion (battery) engages  offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery and mortar  batteries, air defense weapons, command posts, personnel, and  weapons and combat equipment located in columns or deploying at  positions.    The artillery battalion executes fire missions on commands  of  the senior artillery commander (chief) or on the artillery  battalion commander's initiative.    Timeliness in opening fire to engage columns is achieved by  advance preparation of fire against road junctions, bridges,  crossings, exits from populated areas, and other chokepoints on  probable routes of enemy advance and lines of probable  deployment into approach march formation.    An artillery battalion (battery) assigned for support or  attached to a maneuver battalion (company) that has been  assigned to operate in the security zone or to defend the  forward position engages advancing enemy columns beginning with  maximum range of fire. Together with weapons of the maneuver  battalion (company), the artillery battalion (battery) repels  the attack of forward enemy subunits, prevents their close or  deep envelopment of the position being held, and covers the  disengagement and withdrawal of subunits to the next position.    Artillery reconnaissance subunits with communications  equipment may be assigned to combat reconnaissance patrols of  the maneuver battalion operating in the security zone for  reconnoitering the approaching enemy and observing results of  artillery battalion (battery) fire on distant approaches.    Several fire position areas echeloned in the rear and along  maneuver routes are selected and prepared in advance for the  artillery battalion (battery) for the purpose of continuous  support of combined-arms subunits in the security zone. In these  cases, the artillery battalion (battery) usually carries out  missions in support of combined-arms subunits from temporary  fire positions.    In artillery repelling of an enemy attack, the  artillery battalion (battery) uses concentrated fire, engagement  of single targets, and creeping and fixed barrages to engage  tanks and other armored vehicles, put the battle formations of  enemy subunits in disarray, and create favorable conditions for  destroying the enemy by fire from antitank weapons. Ahead of the  forward edge of the defense, the artillery battalion (battery)  uses a fixed barrage to cut the infantry off from the tanks and  destroy it. As a rule, the artillery battalion (battery)  executes the fire missions from the primary fire positions on  commands of the senior artillery commander (chief), on  instructions from the commander of the supported combined-arms  subunit, and also on the artillery battalion (battery)  commander's initiative. Repelling an enemy attack at the  forward edge of the battle area is the most important mission of  artillery in a defensive action. Since the enemy will always try  to conceal his measures for preparing for an offensive, the  mission of repelling his attack may arise unexpectedly. In this  connection, a high degree of readiness is required of every  artillery subunit to ensure opening of fire in the shortest  possible time.    In artillery support of defending troops in the  rear, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire and  engagement of single targets to engage an enemy who has wedged  in, and it uses barrage fire to prevent the enemy from spreading  deep into the defense, to cover exposed flanks, and to  concentrate fire and efforts on destroying enemy tanks. The  artillery battalion (battery) carries out the fire missions from  primary and alternate fire positions. The artillery battalion  maneuvers to the alternate fire position area on the command or  by authority of the senior artillery commander (chief) or  combined-arms commander.    Fire engagement of the enemy when conducting a  counterattack is accomplished by the artillery battalion  (battery) during periods of artillery support of forward  movement of troops, artillery preparation of a counterattack,  and artillery support of a counterattack (Figure 24).          During the period of artillery support of the forward  movement of troops, the artillery battalion destroys and  neutralizes artillery and mortar batteries and other targets  that are capable of using their fire to impede the advance of  subunits for a counterattack. During artillery preparation of a  counterattack, the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes  enemy antitank and other weapons, tanks, and personnel on the  axis of the counterattack, as well as newly detected artillery  and mortar batteries. Artillery preparation of a counterattack  begins no later than when counterattacking subunits reach the  limit of the zone of effective enemy antitank fire and ends when  they reach the troop safety line. It may consist of one shelling.    During the period of artillery support of a counterattack,  the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes personnel and  weapons on the axis of the counterattack and on the flanks; in  so doing, it uses, as a rule, concentrated fire and engagement  of single targets.    After the counterattack has been conducted and the position  restored, the artillery battalion carries out fire missions to  consolidate the captured line.    The nature of the terrain, probable enemy actions, and the  fire capabilities of artillery subunits are taken into account  when preparing fire in a defense. Fire is prepared both against  specifically reconnoitered targets and against places it is  expected (assumed) the enemy will appear. Prepared fire is  updated as new reconnaissance data on the enemy are received.    The artillery battalion designates a primary and one or two  alternate fire position areas for carrying out fire missions in  a defensive action. In addition, a temporary fire position area  may be designated. In the primary area, at least two fire  positions are selected for each battery, which enables gun  platoons to execute a maneuver during combat. The fire positions  are selected primarily on likely avenues of tank approach so  that batteries can destroy enemy tanks with direct fire in the  event they penetrate deep into the defense. Approaches to the  fire positions may be covered by antitank mines. The fire  positions should make it possible to fire with large shifts from  the baseline and have an all-around field of direct fire.    Alternate fire position areas are designated on the flanks  of  the primary fire position area and in the depth of the defense.    Temporary battery fire positions are selected closer to the  forward edge of the defense, and beyond the forward edge of the  defense for supporting combined-arms subunits operating in the  security zone or defending the forward position.    Command and observation posts are deployed on the terrain  prior to the start of an enemy attack, and command vehicles are  placed in shelters. Lateral observation posts are usually  deployed in the artillery battalion to conduct reconnaissance of  the enemy on a broad front. Engineer preparation of sites for  command and observation posts and fire positions, as well as  preparation of routes for maneuver is of special importance in  the defense.    Gun platoons and command and observation (observation) posts  are staggered in depth and dispersed laterally to increase the  stability and survivability of the artillery battalion's battle  formation.    When going over to a defensive action in direct contact with  the enemy, an artillery battalion supporting a first-echelon  motorized rifle battalion must change occupied fire positions  after executing fire missions for consolidating a captured line  and covering a regrouping of combined-arms subunits. Depending  on the sequence of subsequent actions, batteries deploy at the  primary area or in the temporary fire position area.    Roving subunits (batteries, platoons) and guns (mortars,  combat vehicles) are used to mislead the enemy with respect to  the amount of artillery and its locations (fire positions). It  is advisable to assign subunits of self-propelled artillery as  roving subunits. The artillery battalion commander organizes the  actions of roving subunits based on instructions from the senior  artillery commander (chief).    A roving subunit is assigned a fire position area to show  the  presence of several batteries there. This subunit carries out  this mission by conducting a maneuver from one fire position to  another and by firing from them to neutralize the most important  targets (command posts, radars, artillery and mortar batteries,  ATGM launchers, and other weapons) and to shell crossings and  road junctions. A command and observation post of this battery  is designated for fire control of the roving subunit. To  increase survivability, the roving subunit should immediately  abandon the occupied fire position after finishing firing and  move to another position (or to a waiting area near another fire  position). The fire positions of roving subunits are prepared so  as to have all the elements of a battery deployed at a fire  position.  <H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>   The sequence and content of the work of the artillery  battalion commander and staff (battery commander) to prepare  combat operations depend on the conditions of changing to a  defensive action, the mission received, enemy operations, the  nature of the terrain, and the time available.    When going over to a defensive action in conditions of  direct  contact with the enemy, the artillery battalion, in accordance  with the mission received, may support the same maneuver  battalion with which it operated earlier, or it may be assigned  to support another battalion.    In the first instance, the artillery battalion is deployed  into battle formation, reconnaissance and command and control  have been organized, coordination is maintained (artillery  battalion and battery commanders are located together with  company and battalion commanders), fire has been prepared to  consolidate the line already achieved, and the terrain has been  studied. Further work for preparing combat operations of this  artillery battalion is considerably facilitated.    In the second instance, preparation of the artillery  battalion for combat operations will take place under more  difficult conditions. Based on the mission assigned by the  senior artillery commander (chief), the artillery battalion  commander should arrive in the new area and report to the  commander of the maneuver battalion to which the artillery  battalion is attached or which it is supporting, receive the  mission from him, carry out measures for organizing combat  operations in a short period of time, and move the artillery  battalion to the newly assigned area. All this work is  accomplished while the artillery battalion continues to support  the operations of the previous maneuver battalion. A variant  of the sequence of the artillery battalion commander's work to  prepare his battalion's combat operations in these conditions is  shown in Figure 25.          Consequently, the limited time for preparing combat  operations when changing to a defensive action, the need to  leave commanders at the command and observation posts to provide  fire control for batteries deployed into battle formation, and  consideration of other situation conditions require the  artillery battalion commander and chief of staff to have a  creative approach to determining measures for preparing the  artillery battalion's combat operations and the time sequence of  their execution.    The experience of field training exercises shows that a  maneuver battalion usually consolidates at the line it has  reached in that battle formation in which it attacked. It may  capture more favorable positions to improve its situation.  Holding and consolidating the occupied line, the maneuver  battalion's subunits may repel enemy attacks. Individual  subunits may be withdrawn to the rear to more favorable  positions. In supporting the maneuver battalion's combat, the  artillery battalion continuously conducts reconnaissance and  engages enemy infantry, tanks, antitank weapons, and other  targets. To consolidate the line that has been reached, the  artillery battalion commander must prepare concentrated fire to  engage the enemy at attack positions, barrage fire (fixed and  creeping) to repel his attacks, and also fire to engage the most  important targets. In these conditions, the artillery battalion  commander usually assigns missions to subunits from the map by  means of separate orders. Subsequently, as soon as the situation  permits, the artillery battalion commander participates in the  supported maneuver battalion commander's reconnaissance and  updates the missions to the batteries on the terrain.    The artillery battalion chief of staff provides substantial  assistance to the artillery battalion commander in conditions of  a limited time for preparing combat operations of gun platoons.    When going over to a defensive action out of direct contact  with the enemy, taking into account the distance and nature of  his actions, the defense may be prepared in a more planned  manner and, as a rule, with more time available. In such  conditions, the artillery battalion commander receives the  mission from the senior artillery commander (chief) and the  commander of the supported maneuver battalion usually directly  on the terrain during ground reconnaissance.    During subsequent work, the artillery battalion commander,  together with the battery commanders and staff officers, studies  in detail the terrain, code names of local features, and  reference points; the enemy's situation, possible avenues of  advance, and lines of deployment; the disposition of the defense  of the maneuver battalion (companies), concealed approaches to  strongholds and locations of artificial obstacles, and axes of  second-echelon counterattacks. He updates the artillery  battalion (batteries) fire missions and missions being carried  out by assets of the senior commander (chief) and other  artillery subunits, organizes the selection of command and  observation post sites and updates missions for reconnoitering  the enemy, and determines the extent and sequence of engineer  preparation.    As a rule, the operation order is issued in the area of  deployment of the command and observation post. Coordination  with combined-arms subunits and between batteries is worked out.    If the artillery battalion is located in the assembly area,  the artillery battalion withdraws the gun platoons to the  designated fire position area at the prescribed time and deploys  them into battle formation. In accordance the artillery  battalion commander's instructions, the chief of staff plans the  artillery battalion's combat operations; organizes  reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey and engineer preparation of  the primary, alternate, and temporary fire positions; checks the  timeliness of relocation of gun platoons to the designated fire  positions, their preparation for executing the assigned  missions, and organization of self-defense; arranges  determination of firing data, receipt of the weather service  message for medium artillery, and the operation of the attached  radar; and takes steps to replenish the batteries' ammunition  and other supplies.    Let us examine in a tactical example the work of the  artillery battalion commander and staff for preparing the  artillery battalion's combat operations when going over to a  defensive action in direct contact with the enemy.  <H6>  Tactical Example 3 </H6> <H5>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 26) </H5>   Having defeated the enemy in the primary defensive area, by  the end of the second day our units are continuing to push  foreward..          The 2d Bn, 8th Motorized Rifle Regt [MRR], with a tank  battalion (minus a tank company) and the 2d Bn, 5th Arty Regt,  advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the direction of  Zhuchki, Veshki, has the mission of routing enemy subunits  trying to organize a defense on the hills in front of Veshki and  seize Veshki.    At 1710 hours on 26 April, the battalion, operating in  approach march formation, encountered stubborn resistance from  withdrawing enemy subunits on the line of Hill 117.3, the  precipice. The first-echelon companies and tanks are deployed  into battle formation; they are conducting a firefight and are  not advancing.    The 2d Arty Bn is in march column. The artillery battalion  commander is located with the commander of the 2d Motorized  Rifle Bn [MRB], and the battery commanders are located with the  commanders of the supported companies (4th Btry with 4th  Motorized Rifle Co [MRC], 6th Btry with the 5th MRC), and the  5th Btry is the stand-by battery. The subunits have 0.8 units of  fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds. The subunits  suffered the following losses in previous fighting: 4th  Btry--two guns; 5th Btry--one gun.  <H5>  Repelling a Counterattack by Superior Enemy Forces </H5>   At 1920 hours on 26 April, based on the mission received,  the 2d MRB commander announced the decision, based on  intelligence from the 2d Arty Bn commander:    --reconnaissance of all types has established a  concentration  of major enemy reserves in the vicinity of Gusevo, which is 15  km northwest of Hill 117.3; a counterattack by them is expected  in the direction of Veshki, Zhuchki in two-three hours or at  dawn on 27 April;    --The 2d MRB with attached subunits as part of the regiment  is to consolidate on the line reached, organize fire from all  weapons, and repel a counterattack by superior enemy forces. The  battalion's battle formation is in single echelon: the 4th MRC  on the right, the 5th MRC on the left, and the 6th MRC in  reserve. The 2d Arty Bn is to deploy into battle formation and  prepare fire to repel the counterattack and cover the  battalion's right flank.    Subunits of the 15th MRR are consolidating on the right at a  distance of 2-2.5 km (not on diagram).    The 3d MRB is consolidating on the left, on a line along the  bushes (exc.) and the swamp, after destroying encircled enemy  subunits.    The antitank reserve is deploying on line... (see diagram).    Based on the 2d MRB commander's decision, the artillery  battalion commander gave the command for the artillery battalion  to deploy into battle formation. The artillery battalion  commander learned the following from the RAG commander's  instructions. To repel the enemy counterattack, prepare:  concentrated fire against target 80: x = 42,810,  y = 74,650; concentrated fire against target 82:  x = 43,640, y = 75,550; creeping barrage  "Giyena" and "Giyena-1": right x = 43,860,  y = 76,720; left x = 43,270, y  = 76,610; "Giyena-2": right x = 43,615, y  = 77,575; left x = 43,160, y = 77,310;  "Giyena-3": right x = 43,460, y = 78,170;  left x = 43,010, y = 77,840. Prepare fire  additionally on his own decision.    In the event of repelling the enemy counterattack at night,  be prepared to illuminate the line Hill 117.3, Hill "Vysokaya."    Readiness for fire is at 2000 hours on 26 April. By 2100  hours, 0.3 units of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds  and 0.1 units of fire of illumination rounds will be delivered  to the fire positions.    The 1st Arty Bn is to prepare fire in front of the 2d MRB:  concentrated fire against target 81: x = 42,280,  y = 74,310; concentrated fire against target 83:  x = 42,340, y = 75,670; creeping barrage  "Giyena-1, 2, and 3" on the left of the 2d Arty Bn's zone.    The artillery battalion made the following decision:    1. For support of the companies, leave the distribution of  batteries as before.    2. Involve all batteries to carry out fire missions assigned  by the RAG commander; prepare concentrated fire against targets  80 and 82 by batteries with overlapping fire; prepare fixed  barrage "Bereza" to repel a counterattack from the front and  fixed barrage "Akatsiya" and "Vishnya" to cover the flanks,  using all batteries for each of them; prepare concentrated fire  against target 71 on Hill 121.4 to engage the enemy at the  junction with the 3d MRB, using overlapping fire by the 5th and  6th Batteries; use the 2d Gun Platoon of the 5th Btry to carry  out the mission of illuminating the line Hill 117.3, Hill  "Vysokaya."    3. Assign battery commanders and the intelligence officer  missions for reconnoitering the enemy on the line reached and  for timely detection of the enemy's shift to a counterattack.    4. Assign the chief of staff missions: for preparing the  artillery battalion's fire; for organizing self-defense of gun  platoons in the event of a breakthrough by enemy tanks into the  fire position area and to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry  with the antitank reserve; for an even allocation of the  delivered ammunition among batteries and for giving the  illumination rounds to the 5th Btry.    5. Issue instructions for preparing subunits for night  operations.    In accordance with the decision made, the 2d Arty Bn  commander issued instructions to his subordinates and gave  commands.    During daylight on 26 April and that night, maneuver  battalion and artillery battalion subunits carried out measures  to prepare to repel a counterattack, conducted reconnaissance  and engineer preparation, and replenished ammunition. The  artillery battalion commander used periodic illumination of the  terrain for the purpose of reconnaissance.    Enemy aviation conducted reconnaissance of our troop  dispositions.    At 0530 hours on 27 April (at dawn), the enemy began an  artillery shelling, during which his tanks and armored personnel  vehicles continued to move up toward the forward edge.  Simultaneously, enemy aviation made bombing strikes against the  reserves (second echelons), headquarters, and other  installations of our troops.    The intelligence officer reported: "Reference point 4, right  30, up 6, tanks."    The 2d Arty Bn commander gave the command: "`Kamen,'  `Giyena-1' load," and 1.5 minutes later, "Fire."    Other artillery and mortar subunits opened fire on the left  and right. Simultaneously, the enemy continued to deliver  unabated artillery fire against the dispositions of our  motorized rifle and tank subunits.    The enemy tanks continued to move, and the artillery  battalion commander successively shifted fire from the first  creeping barrage line to the second, and then to the third line.    All the maneuver battalion's weapons, including tanks,  armored personnel vehicles, and ATGM's, joined battle to repel  the enemy counterattack. A stubborn battle began, and enemy  infantry dismounted. Six tanks are knocked out, and two of them  were burning.    By 0730 hours on 27 April, as a result of fierce fighting,  the enemy managed to penetrate into the dispositions of our  subunits (see Figure 26). The antitank reserve and the 6th Btry  entered the battle to destroy the enemy tanks by direct fire.    The 2d Arty Bn commander learned from information from the  2d  MRB commander that the enemy had penetrated 3-3.5 km deep into  the dispositions of the adjacent subunit on the left during the  counterattack. Up to a tank company with motorized infantry was  pushing the counterattack at the junction between the 2d MRB and  3d MRB, striving to break through to Dvoriki.    At 0820 hours on 27 April, following a seven-minute  shelling,  a counterattack is conducted by the regiment's second  echelon--the 1st MRB--from the line along Hill 118.4, the  crossroads in the direction of the crossroads and Hill 121.4 to  prevent their further advance and to destroy the enemy that had  penetrated.    The command came from the RAG commander: "`Kamen.'  Attention,  a seven-minute shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76,  sheltered infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155,  y = 78,140, elevation 121. 250 x 200. Expenditure  1/4 norm. This is `Viskoza.'"    The artillery battalion commander gave the command: "`Vesna'  (4th Btry), `Vichuga' (5th Btry). Attention, a seven-minute  shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76, sheltered  infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155, y =  78,140, elevation 121. Overlapping fire. 250 x 200, two  settings. Expenditure 126 per battery. This is `Kamen.'"    The artillery battalion opened fire at the prescribed time.  The 1st Arty Bn began to neutralize targets simultaneously. When  the shelling ended, the 1st MRB went over to a counterattack. A  stubborn firefight began. The 1st MRB began moving slowly in the  direction of Hill 121.4.    By 1020 hours subunits of the 1st MRB, supported by fire  from  the 1st and 2d artillery battalions, the regiment's antitank  reserve, and a mortar battery of the 2d MRB, were pressing the  enemy but were unable to seize Hill 121.4. Enemy resistance  increased, and the maneuver battalion was halted on the line it  had reached. As a result of the counterattack conducted by major  enemy forces and its being repelled by our forces, both sides  suffered heavy losses.    The artillery battalion commander received a report from the  chief of staff: "The 6th Btry knocked out three tanks and lost  two guns; the batteries each have 0.3 units of fire left."    The firefight on the occupied line continues.  <H5>  Organizing Combat Operations When Going Over to the Defense </H5>   At 1200 hours on 27 April, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn,  5th Arty Regt, learned from the mission assigned by the 2d MRB  commander (Figure 27): as a result of the counterattack by  superior forces, the enemy had penetrated into the dispositions  of our subunits on a number of sectors. In the area of our  adjacent unit on the right--the 9th MRR--the enemy was  continuing to conduct active combat operations. After a  regrouping of forces and assets, repeat attacks should be  expected. A concentration of new enemy reserves has been  detected 30-35 km to the west of Hill 117.3. Movement, 12-15 km  deep, of two columns of tanks, armored personnel vehicles, and  artillery into this area has been reconnoitered. An enemy attack  is possible on the morning of 28 April.          The 2d MRB with a tank battalion (minus a tank company) and  the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, as part of the regiment shifts to  defend the area of the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission  of preventing the enemy from breaking through in the directions  of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and Temnaya Grove, Zhuchki. The defense  area is to be occupied by 2200 hours on 27 April. Subunits of  the 1st MRB are to be replaced between 2100 and 2200 hours.  Readiness of the defense is at 0600 hours on 28 April.    The decision for the defense will be announced at 1300  hours.    The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to the defense on the right;  the 3d MRB goes over to the defense on the left. The boundaries  between them are... (see map, Figure 27).    At 1230 hours on 27 April, the 2d Arty Bn commander received  the 8th RAG commander's operation order, from which he learned:    --located in the first echelon, the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, is  going  over to the defense as part of the regiment;    --the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, is included as part of the  8th RAG and is assigned to support the 2d MRB, 8th MRR.    The artillery battalions missions are:    --during artillery interdiction of the advance and  deployment  of enemy troops, it is to engage the columns, ready to deliver  concentrated fire against targets 80, 82, and 84;    --during artillery repelling of the enemy attack, it is to  engage the attacking enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage  "Giyena-1, -2, and 3" and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage  "Akatsiya," "Bereza," "Klen," and "Osina";    --during artillery support of the defending troops in the  rear, engage the enemy who has penetrated and be ready to  deliver concentrated fire against targets 92 and 93 and fixed  barrage "Pikhta";    --fire engagement of the enemy during a counterattack of the  8th MRR second echelon--10-minute shelling, ready to deliver  concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93.    The primary fire position area is: the bushes, Hill 112.2,  "Sapog" Grove; the alternate fire position area is... (see map);  the temporary fire position for one battery is at its own  discretion.    The baseline of fire is grid azimuth 53-00. Readiness to  open  fire from the primary fire position area is 2330 hours on 27  April.    Ammunition expenditure for the day of fighting is: 0.2 units  of fire before the enemy goes over to the attack; 2.2 units of  fire after the enemy goes over to the attack. This includes 0.3  for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of  enemy troops, 0.7 for artillery repelling of the enemy attack,  0.7 for artillery support of the defending troops in the rear,  and 0.5 for fire engagement of the enemy during the  counterattack.    By 2300 hours on 27 April, 1.4 units of fire will be  delivered to each battery's fire position; the rest of the  rounds will be delivered by 0600 hours on 28 April. Opening of  fire from the primary fire positions prior to the start of the  enemy attack is by authorization of the group commander.    The artillery battalion commander plotted the artillery  battalion's fire missions on the work map, after which he  learned from the 2d MRB commander's decision: the 2d MRB in the  defense is concentrating primary efforts on the Veshki, Zhuchki  axis. Stability of the battalion defense area depends on holding  the line from Hill 118.4, to the crossroads, to Zhuchki.    The maneuver battalion's battle formation is in two  echelons:  the 4th and 5th MRC's in the first echelon; the 6th MRC in the  second echelon. It is to have a tank company and mortar battery  in direct subordination. Three company strongholds, antitank  weapon positions, and a mortar battery fire position are to be  created in the defense area.    Fire of organic and attached weapons is to be used to engage  the enemy during his advance and deployment from the axes of  Veshki, Hill 118.4 and "Temnaya" Grove, Zhuchki. Artillery and  mortar subunits are to prepare concentrated fire and a creeping  barrage for this purpose. When engaging the attacking enemy,  artillery and mortar subunits are to prepare a fixed barrage and  motorized rifle companies are to prepare sectors of concentrated  fire on the following axes: Hill 117.3, Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4,  Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4, Dvoriki. Antitank fire is to be prepared  on these same axes. The fire of all artillery subunits,  motorized rifle companies, and antitank weapons is to be used to  engage the enemy in the event he penetrates into the defense  area.    The combat missions of the subunits are:    --the 4th MRC with a tank platoon is to defend the  stronghold  (see map) and prevent a breakthrough of enemy motorized infantry  and tanks in the direction of Hill 117.3, and Hill 118.4.    The maneuver battalion's right flank is to be secured by  fire  from a motorized rifle platoon and by company machineguns.    The 5th MRC with a tank company (minus a tank platoon) is to  defend the stronghold (see map) and prevent a breakthrough of  enemy motorized infantry and tanks in the direction of "Temnaya"  Grove, Zhuchki.    The gap with the 3d MRB is to be secured by fire from the  motorized rifle platoon.    The 6th MRC is the second echelon and is to defend the  stronghold (see map). It is to be ready to reinforce the defense  on the axis Hill 121.4, Zhuchki and to conduct a counterattack  from line (exc.) Hill 118.4, (exc.) Zhuchki in the direction of  the bushes, Hill 121.4.    The tank company is in direct subordination. It is to be  positioned in the vicinity of the crossroads and be ready to  reinforce the antitank fire of the first-echelon companies from  the disposition area and from the line of fire positions--500  meters north of the crossroads.    The 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, and the mortar battery are to  interdict the enemy advance and deployment from the direction of  Veshki, Zhuchki; engage the attacking enemy and in coordination  with fire of companies and antitank weapons repel the attack by  enemy motorized infantry and tanks; secure by fire the gap with  the 1st MRB, 9th MRR; engage the enemy who has penetrated into  the defense; and support the counterattack by the 6th MRC.    After clarifying the mission received, the artillery  battalion commander determined the measures that had to be  carried out immediately:    --give instructions: to the chief of staff--for preparing  and  dispatching an artillery reconnaissance group to select fire  positions in the new area and about his arrival at the artillery  battalion command and observation post; to the intelligence  officer--on determining on the terrain the location of targets  assigned to the artillery battalion;    --outline (personally) the fire positions for each battery  in  the primary and alternate areas and the temporary fire position  for one battery.    Next the artillery battalion commander calculated the time  available for preparing the artillery battalion for combat  operations (Table 18).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 18.

The base fireline is grid  azimuth 53-00. Perform topogeodetic survey according to the map  by 1900 hours 27 April. Assign the mission to the artillery  reconnaissance group personally. Arrive at the artillery  battalion command and observation post by 1530 hours. To the  intelligence officer--determine according to available  coordinates the position on the terrain of the concentrated  fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage being prepared."    At 1350 hours, the artillery battalion commander issued  instruction to the battery commanders: "From positions occupied,  subunits of the 2d MRB are to prepare to repel repeat enemy  counterattacks. The batteries are to be ready to open fire  immediately against the prepared concentrated fire and fixed  barrage sectors. Arrive at the artillery battalion command and  observation post by 1630 hours 27 April to be briefed on the  mission. Headquarters platoon commanders are charged with  command and control of batteries during this period."  <H5>  Situation Assessment </H5>   The enemy, as a result of a counterattack by  superior forces, was pressing our subunits in a number of  sectors. The enemy continues to conduct active combat  operations. After a regrouping, using the forces and assets  located in direct contact (after the counterattack) and  concentrated in the rear, the enemy is capable of going over to  the attack on the morning of 28 April.    In the time available, it is necessary to plan and prepare  artillery battalion fire to repel the enemy attack, organize and  conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, perform engineer  preparation of the fire positions and command and observation  post sites, organize local security and self-defense, and  replenish subunits' ammunition.    The main tasks of reconnaissance are: timely detection of  the  start of the regrouping of the enemy located in direct contact;  determination of battery coordinates; and detection of the enemy  moving up from the rear.    Friendly Subunits. The 2d MRB, 8th MRR, with a  tank company is moving to a defensive action in the regiment's  first echelon on the important likelihood of a tank approach.  The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons. To occupy  the strongholds assigned to the companies, a regrouping will be  made that must be covered by the artillery battalion's fire, for  which the earlier prepared fire will be used.    Adjacent Units. The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to  the defense on the right. The 3d MRB, 8th MRR, goes over to the  defense on the left. The artillery battalion prepares fixed  barrage "Akatsiya" to cover the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR.  It is necessary to task the 4th Btry commander to conduct  reconnaissance in this gap.    A counterattack by the 8th MRB second echelon is planned in  the direction of Sapog Grove, Mound 3, and it is planned to  deploy the antitank reserve immediately on two lines. It is  necessary to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry gun platoons  with the antitank reserve for destroying enemy tanks in the  event they break through into the fire position area and to  update on the terrain the concentrated fire being prepared  against targets 91, 92, and 93 to support the counterattack by  the regiment's second echelon.    Status of the Artillery Battalion. The artillery  battalion is battleworthy. However, the existing losses (two  guns in the 4th Btry, one in the 5th Btry, and two in the 6th  Btry) reduce the artillery battalion's fire capabilities  considerably. It is necessary to requisition replacements for  the guns lost.    Keep the previous batteries in support of the 4th and 5th  MRC's and have the 5th Btry as standby. The artillery  battalion's fire capabilities are shown in Table 19.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 19.

Preparation of  the battalion for combat operations is to be accomplished  according to the time breakdown.    The terrain in the battalion defense area and the  fire positions is accessible for enemy tank attacks. It is  necessary to prepare gun platoons to destroy enemy tanks that  have broken through deep into the defense and also to make the  best use of the terrain's protective features.    The distance between the primary and alternate fire position  areas is 2.5 km; each battery will require 35-40 minutes to  maneuver.    Hill 121.4 is the dominant elevation on this terrain in the  enemy's dispositions; it provides a view of the dispositions of  our subunits to Zhuchki. Steps must be taken for thorough  camouflage. Prepare illumination of the line Hill 117.3, Hill  121.4 for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy at night.    Each battery is to have 0.25 units of fire. Delivery of at  least 1.0 unit of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds  and 50-70 illuminating rounds must be arranged as quickly as  possible. Existing ammunition is to be expended by authority of  the artillery battalion commander or chief of staff.  <H5>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision </H5>   1. Assign the 4th Btry to support the 4th MRC, 6th Btry to  support the 5th MRC, and the 5th Btry as standby.    2. Battery fire missions:    --during artillery interdiction of the advance and  deployment  of enemy troops, batteries as part of the artillery battalion  are to engage the columns, ready to deliver concentrated fire  against targets 80, 82, and 84;    --during artillery repelling of an enemy attack, batteries  as  part of the artillery battalion are to engage the attacking  enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage "Giyena-1, -2, and -3"  and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage "Akatsiya," "Bereza,"  "Klen," and "Osina" (other than 4th Btry);    --during artillery support of the defending troops in the  rear, batteries as part of the artillery battalion are to engage  the enemy who has penetrated, ready to deliver concentrated fire  against targets 92 and 93 and fixed barrage "Pikhta"; to secure  the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, use fixed barrage "Akatsiya"  and prepare concentrated fire against target 85, and use the 4th  and 5th batteries;    --batteries as part of the artillery battalion and  independently are to engage the enemy during the counterattack  by the second echelon of the 8th MRR, ready for a 10-minute  shelling by concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93;    --for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy and repelling  surprise enemy attacks at night, prepare from the temporary fire  position periodic illumination of the terrain in the areas:  "Svet-1"-- x = 43,250, y = 77,800, 800 x  800; "Svet-2"-- x = 41,500, y = 77,850,  1,500 x 800.    3. Fire position areas are those assigned earlier.    Have command and observation posts as follows: for the  artillery battalion and 5th Btry--on Hill Malaya by 2030 hours  27 April; for 4th and 5th batteries--together with command and  observation posts of supported companies by 2100 hours 27 April.  Deploy the fire control post in the primary fire position area  of the 5th Btry. The 5th Btry's command and observation post is  tasked with surveillance of the gap between the 2d MRB, 8th MRR,  and the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, and calling in and adjusting fixed  barrage "Akatsiya" and concentrated fire against target 85. The  command and observation posts of the artillery battalion and  batteries are to relocate simultaneously with the relocation of  the maneuver battalion and company commanders.    The gun platoons are to relocate as follows: the 4th  Btry--to  the primary area between 2200 and 2330 hours; the 6th Btry--to  the primary area between 2230 and 2300 hours; and the 5th  Btry--to the temporary fire position between 2300 and 2330 hours  27 April.    The procedure and signal for assuming command and control of  the artillery battalion in the event the command and observation  post is knocked out (until the chief of staff arrives) are as  established earlier.    The chief of staff arrived at the artillery battalion  command  and observation post at 1515 hours 27 April and reported to the  artillery battalion commander that the artillery reconnaissance  group for reconnaissance of fire positions had been dispatched  on time, a requisition had been made for replacing the five guns  lost and for delivery of ammunition, and an excerpt from the 8th  RAG's fire plan had been received.    The artillery battalion commander studied the excerpt from  the 8th RAG's fire plan, briefed the chief of staff on the  mission received, informed him of his decision, and gave the  following instructions:    "Draw up a fire plan for the artillery battalion by 1630  hours. Update the intelligence officer on the targets on the  terrain. I am departing on commanders' reconnaissance with the  commander of the 2d MRB. You are to remain in my place."  <H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>   The artillery battalion commander participated in  commander's  reconnaissance with the maneuver battalion commander between  1530 and 1630 hours. Prior to the start of the reconnaissance,  he reported the strength, situation, status, and state of supply  of the artillery battalion, the missions received from the  artillery group commander for preparing fire (pointed them out  on the terrain); supplementary fires prepared; the established  ammunition expenditure (0.2 units of fire per day before the  enemy goes over to the attack and 2.2 when the enemy goes over  to the attack); the artillery battalion's fire capabilities  (reports the content of Table 19); the primary, alternate, and  temporary fire position areas (points them out on the map); the  command and observation post sites: the artillery battalion  command and observation post--by 2030 hours 27 April together  with the command and observation post of the maneuver battalion  on this hill (Hill "Fasol"), the battery command and observation  posts--by 2100 hours 27 April together with commanders of the  supported companies; gun platoons of the 5th and 6th Batteries  relocate to the primary fire position area between 2200 and 2300  hours and gun platoons of the 4th Btry to the temporary fire  position between 2300 and 2330 hours 27 April. Readiness to open  fire from the new fire positions is 2330 hours 27 April.    When organizing coordination, the maneuver battalion  commander and the artillery battalion commander coordinated the  actions of the companies with the artillery batteries and other  weapons for engaging the enemy during the advance and deployment  of his troops, during the repelling of his attack, and during  support of the defending subunits in the depth. The  commanders' attention was directed to clarifying the lines for  opening fire by the subunits of ATGM's, tanks, armored personnel  vehicles, grenade launchers, and other antitank weapons and also  sectors of concentrated fire on the most important axes, fire  missions for covering exposed flanks and gaps between  strongholds, and coordinating the actions of subunits to destroy  the enemy penetrating the battalion defense area.    Methods of target designation and warning, control, and  coordination signals were agreed upon.    The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders  arrived at the southern slopes of Hill Fasol at 1630 hours 27  April. The chief of staff briefed the artillery battalion  commander on the allocation of fire missions to the batteries.  The artillery battalion commander conducted orientation on the  terrain and then issued the combat order.    "1. The enemy has penetrated into the dispositions of our  subunits on a number of sectors and is conducting active combat  operations. Repeat enemy attacks should be expected after a  regrouping of forces and assets.    "According to reconnaissance data, the enemy is  concentrating  reserves 30-35 km west of Hill 117.3. It is possible the enemy  may go over to the attack on the morning of 28 April.    "2. The 2d MRB is going over to the defense of the area of  the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission of preventing an  enemy breakthrough in the directions of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and  `Temnaya' Grove, Zhuchki. The battalion is concentrating its  main efforts on holding the area of Hill 118.4, the crossroads,  Zhuchki.    "The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons: in  first echelon is the 4th MRC on the right and the 5th MRC on the  left; the 6th MRC is in second the echelon. Companies are  occupying the strongholds between 2100 and 2200 27 April.    "The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, is going over to the defense on the  right; the boundary with it is...

"7. Readiness for opening fire from the primary fire  position  area and the temporary fire position is 2300 hours 28 April.    "8. The artillery battalion command and observation post is  joined with the 2d MRB command and observation post on Hill  Fasol from 2030 hours 27 April. The artillery battalion fire  control post is at the fire position area of the 5th Btry from  2230 hours 27 April.    "The procedure and signal for assuming command and control  of  the artillery battalion in the event its command and observation  post and fire control post are knocked out of action are as  established earlier."    Then the artillery battalion commander updates certain  coordination matters:    "The companies occupy the strongholds between 2100 and 2200  27 April. The batteries cover them during this time from the  occupied fire positions. To repel a surprise enemy attack, the  batteries are to have the following fixed barrages laid: 4th  Btry--`Akatsiya'; 5th Btry--`Bereza'; 6th Btry--`Vishnya.'    "After the batteries occupy the primary fire positions, they  are to open fire from them prior to the start of an enemy attack  only by my authority.    "The enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction is possible  before going over to the attack. In batteries subjected to the  effects of nuclear weapons, immediately organize assistance for  victims, mop up the after-effects of the nuclear strike, and  restore combat effectiveness, for which each battery is to have  15-man rescue teams headed by gun platoon commanders.    "The warning signal for an immediate threat and the  beginning  of employment of weapons of mass destruction by the enemy is  `Kometa.' On this signal, personnel and instruments in batteries  not carrying out fire missions are to take shelter in  emplacements and bunkers.    "When conducting reconnaissance, continuously observe  antitank minefields in front of the forward edge. Immediately  report to me if you detect lanes being cleared in them.    "Repel the enemy attack with a fixed barrage. Open fire on  my  command, and independently, and do so with maximum intensity.  Prior to the start of the enemy attack, especially at night, the  battery guns at the primary fire positions are to be laid on the  prearranged fixed barrage.    "Prepare gun platoons for firing against tanks that might  break through into the fire position area. Instructions on  organizing self-defense of gun platoons will be given to the  senior battery officers by the chief of staff.    "Maneuver within the primary and to the alternate fire  position area only on my command (signal `Lafet'). Relocate the  command and observation post on signal `Kompas.' Warning signals  are those previously established."    Organizing combat support, the artillery battalion commander  issues reconnaissance instructions:    "Conduct reconnaissance as follows: 4th Btry--in the  following zone: on the right--the northern slopes of Hill  118.4, the northern slopes of Hill 117.3; on the left--the  southern slopes of Hill 118.4, the road with the bushes; 6th  Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the crossroads, the  northern slopes of Hill 121.4; on the left--the road with the  trees; the artillery battalion command and observation post and  the 5th Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the southern  slopes of Hill 118.4, the hollow with the bushes; on the  left--the crossroads, Hill 121.4.    "Reconnaissance missions: disclose the fire positions of  artillery and mortar batteries in the vicinity of the bridge,  Hill Vysokaya, and the hill with three trees; ascertain the time  of concentration of the main enemy grouping in front of the 2d  MRB defense area, its forces, and the axis of attack;  reconnoiter the disposition of command posts on line Hill 117.3,  Hill 121.4.    "An additional reconnaissance zone is assigned to the 4th  Btry command and observation post to the right of Hill 118.4 and  the ravine for observing the gap between the 1st MRB, 9th MRR,  and the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, and for calling in fixed barrage  `Akatsiya.'"    The artillery battalion commander also issued instructions  for protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage,  engineer preparation of the fire positions, and others.  <H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>   Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions  and  the excerpt from the group fire plan, the chief of staff began  planning the combat operations.    Fire Planning. The chief of staff plots on the map  the targets and the artillery battalion's battle formation:  command and observation post and observation post sites, primary  battery fire positions, alternate and temporary fire positions,  and prepared (planned) sites for the command and observation  posts in case they relocate. He allocates fire missions among  batteries. In so doing, he assigns several batteries to engage  the most important targets. He draws up the fire plan (Table 20)  and a list of target coordinates.    Maneuver Planning. He plots on the map (then  updates on the terrain) the primary and alternate routes for  relocating batteries to the alternate fire position area;  calculates the time for the relocation (total time for leaving  the occupied fire positions, relocating, and deploying at the  new fire position); designates (announces the signal established  by the artillery battalion commander) the relocation signal; and  reflects the results of the calculations on the map.    By direction of the chief of staff and senior battery  officers, the plotters calculate firing data for the planned  targets and enter the results in the computed firing data table.  Experience shows that computed data are calculated for the  primary fire positions, and only topographic data are determined  for the remaining fire positions. The chief of staff compares  firing data calculated in the artillery battalion with the  batteries' data.    Table 20. Fire Plan of 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, in the Defense.

The 5th Btry commander assigns platoon and controls its fire.   2. Maneuver signal with indication of number of new fire position is "Pereyezd."   Commander, 2d Bn, 5th Arty Regt, Maj (A. Vinogradov)   Chief of Staff, Capt (N. Suslov)      "Gun platoons of the 5th and 6th batteries destroy enemy  tanks breaking through to the fire position area over the road  from the direction of Zhuchki; tanks breaking through from the  direction of the ravine and the 4th Btry fire position are  destroyed by 4th Btry gun platoons in coordination with the  antitank reserve, which is preparing deployment line No  3--Nizhkiy Bushes toward two trees; if the tanks break through  on the left from the direction of Dvoriki, Zhuchki, they are  destroyed by the 6th Btry gun platoons.    "The senior officer of the 4th Btry is to coordinate actions  of the gun platoons with the antitank reserve commander during  his work on deployment line No 3. Each battery is to organize  local security and self-defense at the fire position on  instructions from the battery senior officers. Terrain sectors  for mining are to be plotted. The self-defense plan is to be  worked out by 2400 hours. Personnel training is to be conducted  between 0130 and 0150 hours, during which time the crews  practice actions for self-defense."    At 2045 hours 27 April, the chief of staff received the  excerpt from the 8th RAG fire plan for the artillery battalion's  participation in counterpreparation (Table 21).    Simultaneously, the following combat instruction was  received  from the 8th RAG Headquarters: "For the period 0030 to 2300  hours 28 April, assign a roving platoon from the battery  deployed at the temporary fire position. The platoon is to  deliver fire from the fire positions abandoned by the 4th, 5th,  and 6th Batteries. Carry out one to two fire missions from each  fire position, neutralizing targets reconnoitered by the  artillery battalion. Ammunition expenditure is 110  fragmentation-HE rounds and 15 illuminating rounds. Equip the  fire positions with mockup guns by 0600 hours 28 April. The  operation plan for the roving platoon is to be submitted for  approval by 2330 hours 27 April."    The chief of staff studies the documents received, briefs  the  artillery battalion commander on them, and updates the planning  of combat operations. For this he plots the targets on the map  and draws up a fire plan for artillery counterpreparation (Table  22); he gives instructions to the plotters for calculating  target firing data.    In planning the operations of the roving subunit, he  designates a roving platoon from the 5th Btry, notes the time of  firing and fire position numbers, determines the targets for  neutralization and the type of registration, designates the  ammunition expenditure, and draws up a plan of operations for  the roving platoon (Table 23).[.sup]1[/] After receiving the  documents drawn up by the chief of staff, the artillery  battalion commander has them approved by the group commander and  based on them assigns missions to the battery commanders.  <H3>  Maintaining the Artillery Battalion's Readiness To Repel  Enemy Attacks </H3>   Both combined-arms and artillery subunits that have gone  over  to the defense in direct contact with the enemy will make  maximum use of every opportunity for improving the positions  occupied, equipping shelters, making a detailed study of the  terrain, establishing alternate positions, and carrying out  other measures in the interests of the defense. In doing so, the  subunits must be ready to repel a surprise enemy attack at any  moment.    The artillery battalion's readiness to repel an attack is  expressed in its ability to open scheduled or unscheduled fire  in a timely manner against attacking enemy tanks and motorized  infantry, artillery, and mortar batteries, mop up in an  organized manner the after-effects of the use of nuclear weapons  by the enemy, and execute the necessary maneuver of fire and  subunits.    To maintain the readiness of subunits, the artillery  battalion commander determines specific measures and issues  instructions to subordinate commanders. These measures include:  conducting continuous reconnaissance; designating alert officers  and scouts from the battery and artillery battalion command and  observation posts in addition to observation posts; designating  alert platoons (crews) in battery gun platoons; laying battery  guns for barrage fire on the most important axis; precisely  organized self-defense of gun platoons and constant training of  personnel in actions in response to warning signals; maintaining  equipment, motor transport, and instruments in working order and  preparing ammunition for firing; maintaining stable  communications; systematic updating of firing data in response  to changes in firing conditions; locating off-duty personnel in  prepared shelters near the guns; conducting classes and  political-educational work with personnel; and also checking the  readiness of subunits.    The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders are  constantly a part of the the command and observation posts in  addtion to observation posts; listen to subordinates on the  results of reconnaissance; and personally observe the enemy day  and night. They increase observation with the onset of darkness,  at dawn, in fog, and in bad weather, assigning additional scouts.    Fire from roving artillery subunits is widely used to  mislead  the enemy concerning the number and location of our artillery.    In today's conditions, it is advisable to assign  self-propelled artillery subunits as roving subunits. The  experience of the Great Patriotic War confirms that roving  subunits should fire not against enemy positions in general but  against reliably reconnoitered targets in order to inflict the  necessary damage on them. We will use an example to show  this.[.sup]2[/]    On 26 March 1944, our troops had advanced to the  vicinity of Pascani after making an assault crossing of the  Siret River, and here they were stopped by organized enemy fire  from a previously prepared defense line. After an unsuccessful  attempt to break through the enemy defense, they were ordered to  go over to the defense temporarily.    The 2d Bn, 676th Arty Regt, was supporting a battalion  of the 694th Rifle Regt. The terrain was open and marshy in  places in our defense sector, which made it difficult to select  fire positions for the artillery. The only convenient place for  firing positions was the northern outskirts of Pascani, which is  where the primary fire positions of the 4th and 6th batteries  were selected, and the 5th Btry was moved up for direct  firing.    Two dummy fire positions were prepared for each battery  in order to mislead the fascists as to the actual location of  the primary fire positions. These positions as well as the  primary positions were prepared by engineers. Gun mockups were  set up at each position. One gun was to fire from each dummy  position, so one of the gun emplacements was equipped with a  reliable overhead cover to protect the crew and gun from being  hit during an enemy artillery shelling if there was no time for  the gun to leave the position after firing.    The artillery battalion commander received the  operation plan for the roving guns from regimental headquarters.  It called for assigning one gun each from the 4th and 6th  batteries and gave the targets to be neutralized and the time  for firing. Two of the four dummy fire positions had concealed  approaches; therefore, fire was delivered from them only in the  daytime and only at night from the remaining two. These fire  positions also supported the regiment's reconnaissance groups  operating at night.    The guns moved to another position after firing from  the dummy position. The enemy opened heavy fire against the  dummy positions, wasting a large number of shells.  <H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5> <H5>  Supporting the Maneuver Battalion at a Forward Position </H5>   Combat operations to hold a forward position may begin with  repelling an enemy attack from attack positions from direct  contact or with destruction of approaching reconnaissance and  forward enemy subunits moving up from the rear in the absence of  contact.    The maneuver battalion organizes the defense at a forward  position with individual company and platoon strongholds  prepared for all-around defense and intercepting the most likely  avenues of an enemy attack. A developed system of artificial  obstacles is created. The intervals and often even gaps in the  battle formations of the maneuver battalion's subunits are  covered by fire from tanks, combat vehicles, and other weapons,  ambushes are organized, and obstacles and barriers are erected.    The fire of an artillery battalion attached to or assigned  to  support a maneuver battalion is prepared on a general basis.  Battery command and observation posts are deployed together with  the commanders of the supporting companies, and the artillery  battalion command and observation post is deployed with the  maneuver battalion commander. Battery gun platoons deploy, as  a rule, at temporary fire positions prepared usually between the  first and forward positions.    The artillery battalion assigns one of the batteries to  repel  an attack by small enemy forces. The battery destroys the most  important targets or repels the attack with barrage fire.    An attack by larger enemy forces following a brief artillery  shelling should be expected to capture the forward position in  order to move to the forward edge of our defense. The enemy  attack is repelled by fire from all the maneuver battalion's  forces and assets. Before the enemy goes over to the attack, the  artillery battalion engages reconnoitered targets with  concentrated fire and fire against single targets. When the  enemy goes over to the attack, it is repelled by barrage fire.    The enemy who has penetrated to the forward position is  destroyed by fire of subunits from the flanks, by the artillery  battalion's concentrated fire, and by battery fire against  single targets. Approaching enemy reserves in addition to his  artillery and mortar batteries are neutralized by the senior  commander's artillery.    The maneuver battalion leaves the forward position in an  organized manner and only by authority of the senior commander.  It is covered by fire of the attached (supporting) artillery  battalion.    As a rule, gun platoons maneuver to the primary fire  position  area in succession on the command (signal) of the artillery  battalion commander; this creates conditions for continuous  engagement of the enemy.    The battery command and observation posts in addition to  observation posts relocate to their designated locations at the  first positions simultaneously with the maneuver of the gun  platoons and supported companies. The artillery battalion  command and observation post does so with the maneuver battalion  command and observation post. The artillery battalion commander  organizes uninterrupted fire control. In doing so, the commander  accomplishes fire on the move.    After the gun platoons move to the primary fire position  area  and the battery and artillery battalion command and observation  posts deploy at the first position, the artillery battalion may  be assigned to support the first-echelon maneuver battalion or  as the stand-by for the artillery group commander  <H5>  Supporting a First-Echelon Maneuver Battalion </H5>   The combat of a first-echelon maneuver battalion usually  begins with repelling attacks by forward enemy subunits. The  enemy's main body will move up and prepare for attack under  cover of these subunits. The attack by the enemy's main body may  begin from the positions occupied in direct contact or on the  move with an advance from the depth.    Enemy reconnaissance in force is possible prior to the  attack  by the main body. The attempt to conduct reconnaissance in force  is repelled by fire from the assigned assets of the defending  subunits and artillery from temporary fire positions.    According to the plan of the senior commander (chief), the  artillery battalion may take part in the artillery  counterpreparation.    The shift of the enemy's main body to the attack is usually  preceded by a powerful softening-up of our defense, including  nuclear and chemical strikes, artillery fire, air strikes, and  use of incendiary weapons.    On a signal warning of the immediate threat of the enemy  using nuclear weapons, personnel of artillery subunits cover  optical instruments and head for prepared shelters. After the  blast wave passes, personnel leave the shelters and take up  their positions. If necessary, the artillery battalion commander  organizes the mop-up of the after-effects of the enemy's use of  weapons of mass destruction and restoration of the artillery  battalion's combat effectiveness. Subunit commanders monitor  enemy actions and on the command of the senior commander or on  their own initiative neutralize the enemy's offensive nuclear  and chemical weapons, artillery batteries, tanks deploying for  the attack, and motorized infantry (infantry).    Barrage fire is additionally prepared and, by decision of  the  senior commander, the antitank reserve and other subunits are  moved up to cover the area against which the enemy has made a  nuclear strike.    All weapons of the maneuver battalion and attached subunits  take part in repelling the enemy attack.    The artillery battalion uses barrage fire to engage tanks  and  other armored vehicles, break up the battle formations of enemy  subunits, cut off motorized infantry from the tanks, and force  them to dismount. As a result, favorable conditions are created  for destroying both armored enemy targets and his exposed  personnel and weapons. If necessary, barrage fire is shifted for  a short time to repel the attack on adjacent sectors. The  artillery commander concentrates the fire of the entire  artillery battalion or of most of the batteries on the most  threatening part of the attacking enemy, particularly on the  axis where the nuclear strike was made. He reports on enemy  actions and the mission being carried out by the artillery  battalion to the senior artillery commander (chief).    The battle to hold strongholds at the forward edge is waged  with maximum intensity.    The enemy may penetrate into the maneuver battalion's  defense  on individual sectors. In these conditions, stubborn holding of  strongholds is of great importance, and control of artillery  battalion and battery fire is considerably more complicated.  Individual command and observation posts may be knocked out of  action, and others will be forced to move to new locations or  end up encircled with subunits. In these conditions, realistic  consideration of the existing capabilities, precisely worked out  procedures for battery commanders to assume command and control  of the artillery battalion, a high degree of organization by  commanders, and brevity and preciseness of instructions being  issued can ensure uninterrupted command and control of the  artillery battalion.    In case the enemy breaks through into the depth of the  defense, the maneuver battalion's second-echelon company must  inflict decisive damage on him from the occupied prepared line  and halt his further advance. Under favorable situation  conditions, the enemy who has penetrated is destroyed by a  counterattack.    We will show an artillery battalion's actions for repelling  attacks in the defense by using a combat example from the Great  Patriotic War.[.sup]3[/]    The artillery battalion commanded by Hero of the Soviet  Union Senior Lieutenant Berezovskiy was supporting the offensive  of a rifle regiment, which on 9 January 1944 had seized Tsybulev  (Figure 28), but was halted by stubborn enemy resistance on the  line along Polonskiy Farmstead and Vladislavchik.          Repeated attempts to break through the enemy's defense  on this line were unsuccessful, and the regiment went over to  the defense. The artillery battalion deployed at indirect-fire  positions and prepared fire to repel enemy attacks. Having  reconnaissance data showing that the enemy was concentrating a  considerable number of tanks on this sector of the front and was  preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion commander  organized an antitank defense of the fire positions, paying  special attention to the likely avenue of tank approach of  Polonskiy Farmstead--Tsybulev. By 16 January, the artillery  battalion had completed antitank preparation of the fire  positions and was ready to repel enemy attacks.    At 1200 hours 20 January, the Nazis attacked our  positions with up to a battalion of infantry with 50 tanks and  seized the Sovkhoz imeni 1-go Travnya, but were thrown back to  the starting position by a counterattack of our subunits  supported by the artillery battalion and did not undertake any  attacks for several days.    At 0900 hours 25 January, up to 50 enemy tanks and 25  armored personnel carriers began an offensive from the vicinity  of Polonskiy Farmstead on Tsybulev following a heavy airstrike  (seven raids by 30-50 aircraft each). When the enemy tanks  reached the vicinity of Hill 252.2, the artillery battalion  delivered a heavy shelling against them from indirect-fire  positions. As a result, two tanks and two armored personnel  carriers were knocked out and the battle formation of the  attacking forces was broken up. One group of 20 tanks and 13  armored personnel carriers turned toward Sharnopyl, and another  group of 30 tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers tried to  break through along a hollow to Tsybulev.    Taking advantage of the enemy confusion, the 6th Btry  allowed the tanks to approach to a distance of 600 meters and  opened direct fire. The first rounds knocked out three tanks  and two armored personnel carriers, and then another two tanks  and two armored personnel carriers.    Having encountered such withering fire from the  battery, the fascists began to bypass it on the left, but came  under heavy flanking fire by the 5th Btry, which knocked out  four more tanks and two armored personnel carriers by direct  fire. The enemy began to withdraw, but lost another tank to fire  from the 6th Battery in doing so.    During the course of this battle, infantry and  submachine gunners tried to penetrate to the battery's fire  position, but these attempts were foiled by well-organized  small-arms fire.    Thus, the enemy's path to Tsybulev was blocked thanks  to the skilled and courageous actions of personnel of all  batteries. In this battle, the enemy lost 10 tanks, 6 armored  personnel carriers, and up to 160 soldiers and officers to fire  from the artillery battalion.  <H5>  Supporting a Second-Echelon Maneuver Battalion </H5>   When conducting a counterattack, an artillery battalion may  be assigned to support a second-echelon maneuver battalion or be  attached to it. After receiving the mission from the senior  artillery commander (chief), the artillery commander assigns  missions to the battery commanders, updates missions for  reconnoitering the enemy ahead of the counterattack line, moves  the command and observation post to a new line if necessary,  establishes personal contact with the maneuver battalion  commander, and prepares the artillery battalion to execute the  fire missions received. The artillery battalion uses  concentrated fire and fire against single targets to cover the  advance and deployment of second-echelon subunits, neutralizing  primarily artillery and mortar batteries, as well as enemy  antitank weapons, tanks, personnel, and weapons on the axis of  the counterattack. The shelling begins no later than when the  second-echelon subunits reach the limit of the zone of effective  fire of enemy antitank weapons and concludes when the subunits  reach the troop safety line. The duration of the shelling is  determined the same way as during commitment of the regiment's  second echelon in an offensive action.    When the companies reach the final coordination line for the  counterattack, battery commanders establish personal contact  with company commanders and subsequently relocate with them,  carrying out assigned missions. The counterattacking subunits  are supported by battery fire against single targets or by  concentrated fire against the most important targets.    After conducting the counterattack and restoring the  situation, the artillery battalion commander assigns a mission  for preparing fire to consolidate the line that had been  reached; he organizes a change in fire positions, their engineer  preparation, and replenishment of ammunition and prepares the  artillery battalion to repel repeat enemy attacks.    During the course of the defensive battle, the enemy will  use  a large number of tanks on the important axes. The possibility  of individual groups breaking through to the artillery  battalion's fire position area is not ruled out. Therefore, it  is necessary to prepare the gun platoons deployed at  indirect-fire positions to destroy the tanks that break through.  Combat against tanks requires a great deal of courage, valor,  coolness, and self-control of personnel. This is evidenced by  numerous examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic War.    Success in combating enemy tanks is achieved by proper  selection of the fire position and disposition of guns there,  timely mining of the terrain on likely avenues of tank approach,  posting observers and sentry posts, a high degree of training of  personnel knowing the vulnerable spots of tanks and firing  rules, and interchangeability of crew members.    Here is one combat example.[.sup]4[/]    On 10 March 1944, our units had made a forced crossing  of the Siret River and, as a result of stubborn resistance by  superior enemy forces on the west bank of the river, received  the order to consolidate on the line they had reached.    The 1st Battalion, 203d Gds Heavy Howitzer Regiment was  supporting a rifle battalion. Simultaneously with executing fire  missions, the artillery battalion was working hard to prepare  fire positions and command and observation post sites. There  were foxholes in front of the fire positions for soldiers armed  with antitank rifles and grenades. The battery command and  observation posts in addition to observation posts were  colocated with the commanders of the supported companies. The  artillery battalion headquarters were deployed in the vicinity  of the 1st Btry fire position.    On 13 March, after powerful artillery and air  preparation, the enemy went over to the attack with forces of  two infantry regiments supported by 20 tanks and 12  self-propelled artillery guns. On 13 and 14 March, the enemy  managed to press our rifle subunits; as a result, the gun  platoons of all batteries were left without their cover.    The artillery battalion commander organized a defense  of the command and observation post, and the chief of staff was  ordered to organize a self-defense of the gun platoons. Terrain  illumination posts were set up in case of a night attack by  enemy tanks.    At 0900 hours 15 March, up to two infantry battalions  with 15 tanks and five self-propelled guns, supported by  artillery fire and airstrikes, attacked our subunits again. Our  artillerymen approached to within 250-300 meters of the tanks  and suddenly opened fire. After knocking out two tanks, the 3d  Btry gun platoons were shelled by the self-propelled guns that  were moving behind the tanks. Two guns in the battery took  direct hits and were knocked out of commission.    During this same time, the 2d Btry guns knocked out one  tank and one self-propelled gun. As a result, the fascist tanks  turned back.    At 1130 hours, the fascists undertook a second attack.  By this time the 3d Btry had two guns (one gun had been taken  from the 1st Btry).    The tanks approached to within 300-400 meters of the  fire positions. The 2d Btry knocked out one tank. All ammunition  was expended in the 3d Btry, and the crews suffered heavy losses  from fire from the self-propelled guns. A gunner, Private  Peshkov, was at one of this battery's guns; he set fire to a  Ferdinand self-propelled gun with the last accurate round. The  rest of the tanks and self-propelled guns turned back and  withdrew to the staging area. The valorous gunner Gds Private  Peshkov died the death of the brave in this uneven battle.    At 1800 hours, the fascists again undertook an attack  with infantry and tanks, supported by fire from an armored  train. The situation was becoming critical. In such conditions,  the artillery battalion commander, Captain Vrashev, rallied his  personnel for a counterattack. The enemy was thrown back from  the fire positions. The artillery battalion commander died a  hero's death in hand-to-hand combat.    On 16 March, the fascists undertook several more  attacks with small forces, which were successfully beaten back  by artillery, machinegun, and rifle fire.    Thus, fighting courageously, over the course of three  days the artillery battalion repelled the onslaught of a  numerically superior enemy, inflicted heavy losses in personnel  and equipment on him, and did not give up the occupied positions  to the enemy.  <H5>  Actions When Defending a Seacoast </H5>   Defense of a seacoast is usually accomplished to prevent the  landing of enemy amphibious or airborne assault forces on the  coast and to hold (protect) important coastal installations. In  the event of an enemy landing, defending units must destroy the  enemy on the shore or push him out to sea.    A defense on a seacoast is based on holding the most  important sectors (area) on axes of a likely landing of enemy  assault forces. Subunits and units must ensure a high degree of  activeness and stability, dispersal and concealed dispositions,  protection against weapons of mass destruction, and also a broad  maneuver of forces and assets along the coast and from the rear.    The main efforts are concentrated on firmly holding the  coast, road junctions, commanding heights, and other  installations that make it possible to break up an enemy assault  force and destroy it in detail. Observation and patrolling are  organized and artificial obstacles are set up on remote axes.    The forward edge of the defense should be located at a  minimum distance from the water's edge, and on a low shore may  reach into the depth to a more favorable line. Various obstacles  are set up and antitank weapons are positioned in places  accessible for a landing by amphibious tanks and infantry  fighting vehicles.    Depending on the completeness of information on a probable  enemy assault landing, a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion  may occupy an assigned defense area or be ready to occupy it. In  the latter case, work is continuously done to improve the  engineer preparation of the area (Figure 29).          An important role in defending a seacoast belongs to  artillery, since it is able to inflict damage on an enemy  assault force at maximum ranges and during the approach to the  shore. It can also engage an amphibious assault during the  landing and fighting on the shore.    When defending a seacoast, an artillery battalion may be  assigned to support a combined-arms unit (subunit) or be  attached to it. A battery from the artillery battalion is  usually assigned to support a combined-arms subunit.    Artillery subunits may carry out the following missions:  prevent enemy reconnaissance of coastal waters and the shore,  minesweeping, mineclearing, and removal of antiassault-landing  obstacles; engage ships, transports, amphibious tanks, and other  armored vehicles when they are approaching the shore; inflict  damage on enemy airborne assault forces and forward units,  preventing their landing on the coast; destroy tanks, motorized  infantry, and artillery and mortar batteries that have landed on  the shore; cover gaps between units (subunits) and their flanks;  inflict damage on the enemy when conducting second-echelon  (reserve) counterattacks; prevent the approach and landing of  subsequent waves of an assault force and the approach of ships  supplying the assault force.    The artillery battalion uses concentrated fire to engage  ships and transports, personnel, and weapons in the area of  loading, assembly, and forming of the assault waves. An attached  surface search radar or a laser rangefinder is used to  reconnoiter targets and adjust fire.    During movement toward the shore, the assault waves are  engaged by a creeping barrage. It is prepared, taking into  account the direction of the channel, the presence of shoals,  reefs, and minefields, and the suitability of the coastline for  an assault landing. The first (far) line is designated up to  eight km from the shore, and the last line is designated at the  direct-fire weapons' commence fire line.    Timely opening of fire is ensured by fixing the movement of  the assault force using surface search radar. The leader in this  area is informed of the polar coordinates of the centers of the  lines from the radar's position and the average flight time of  the rounds along each line. In the absence of radar, the lead  assault-landing craft are fixed using a laser rangefinder by  determining the front of the target and the deviation of the  direction of its movement from the center of the creeping  barrage line toward which it is moving. Fixing of the target is  repeated periodically, and firing commences when the target  approaches the creeping barrage line, making general adjustments  for all batteries if necessary.    Amphibious tanks, armored personnel carriers, and  assault-landing craft that make it out of the impact area at the  final creeping barrage line are engaged by direct fire.    When the assault force approaches the shore, it is engaged  by  a fixed barrage, which is prepared against the water's edge or  against the land close to the shore if the forward edge of the  defense is away from the shore.    Concentrated fire by the artillery battalion is prepared in  case the enemy lands on the shore; concentrated fire and a fixed  barrage are prepared to prevent the enemy from spreading into  the rear and the flanks. In addition, concentrated fire is  prepared to support counterattacks.    The actions of the artillery battalion (batteries) when  defending a seacoast are based on a broad maneuver of fire and  subunits. Therefore, the artillery battalion prepares two and  sometimes three creeping barrage zones and alternate battery  fire positions, and one or two fire position alternate areas for  maneuver.    The artillery battalion deploys into battle formation on the  likely axis of an enemy assault landing.    Temporary fire positions are prepared and occupied for  delivering fire to prevent reconnaissance, minesweeping, and  mineclearing of the coastal waters by enemy ships and also to  prevent the landing of enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups  on the shore. Most often, one battery may be deployed from the  artillery battalion.    The artillery battalion and battery command and observation  posts and observation posts are deployed at locations that  ensure sufficient range of surveillance of the sea and  coastline, particularly on the likely axis of an enemy assault  landing. It is advisable to position the posts on high ground  and have reliable shelters. The desire to see as far as possible  should not result in positioning command and observation posts  and observation posts on lighthouses, churches, factory  smokestacks, or tall buildings, since the enemy will quickly  detect and destroy them.    If the terrain on the shore is mountainous, the command and  observation posts are staggered in elevation, which ensures  stability of observation and a view of all sectors of the land  and sea over a long distance. Naturally, the higher the  elevation of the observation post is above sea level the greater  the horizontal range of visibility. This relationship is shown  in Table 24.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 24.

The command and observation  post should not be positioned close to the water's edge due to  the fact that this area will be subjected to the heaviest fire,  which can result in a rapid loss of command and control.    The following features must be taken into account when  organizing and conducting reconnaissance of the enemy: speed is  required when processing and relaying the results of observation  when enemy ships are detected, for slowness in commencing fire  will give the enemy the opportunity to carry out the mission and  move out to sea with impunity. Reconnaissance subunit personnel  and officers must be able to determine the type, class, and  number of ships and the nature of their actions, and the  distance to them. The lack of local features at sea that can be  used as reference points make target designation extremely  difficult when conducting reconnaissance and fire control of  subunits.    Taking these features into account, artificial reference  points (rafts, buoys, and barrels) are set up at sea, ensuring  their fixed location. Their location is checked by instruments.    The basic reconnaissance missions when defending a seacoast  are: timely detection of enemy ships during their movement  toward the coast; determining the direction of movement of enemy  assault-landing craft and landing forces and the approach of  subsequent waves of the assault landing force.    Forward and lateral observation posts should be deployed  more  fully when organizing reconnaissance. If there are small islands  on the near approaches from the sea, these posts should be  positioned there.    The primary fire position area is usually designated based  on  the requirement of making maximum utilization of the firing  range to destroy the enemy assault force on the water. However,  this should not be to the detriment of the stability of battery  dispositions in the event the enemy penetrates our defense. A  situation cannot be permitted in which the batteries would be  forced to abandon the fire positions if the enemy penetrates our  defense slightly.    The artillery battalion's combat operations are organized in  conditions of a lack of direct contact with the enemy, which  ensures more complete resolution of coordination matters,  detailed study of the terrain, and the most favorable  positioning of the battle formation of subunits.    The sequence of the artillery battalion (battery)  commander's  work after receipt of the mission in each specific case will  depend on the situation conditions and the time available. The  work will usually be conducted in the same way as when  organizing a defense in normal conditions.    However, there are a number of particular features in the  work of commanders.    When estimating the situation, the artillery battalion  (battery) commander must, first of all, study the nature of the  seacoast, namely: the outline of the coastline, the depth of  the coastal zone of the sea, the presence of underwater  obstacles, the nature of flood and ebb tides, the condition of  the seabed at the shore, and possible avenues of approach of  enemy assault landing forces. When assessing the terrain in  friendly troop dispositions, the commanders study and determine  favorable and convenient spots for deploying command and  observation posts and observation posts, fire position areas,  the presence and condition of roads and bridges in case of a  maneuver by the artillery battalion's subunits, the nature and  condition of the ground, and the conditions for camouflage of  the fire positions and command and observation posts.    To carefully study the nature of the coast and to update the  missions received, the artillery battalion commander conducts  ground reconnaissance, during which he studies, in addition to  other things, the outline of the coastline and its changes  during flood and ebb tides, the outline of the forward area of  the defense, the locations of artificial obstacles in the sea  and underwater obstacles, the condition of the seabed near  shore, and possible avenues of approach and landing sectors of  enemy assault landing forces. He also determines measures for  repelling the enemy at night and in conditions of reduced  visibility (fog, the use of smoke by the enemy, and so forth).    The artillery battalion usually assigns fire missions to the  subunits in a verbal combat order according to the following  tactical tasks: interdicting the advance and deployment of the  assault force; repelling the landing of an assault force and the  capture of a bridgehead; supporting defending subunits; and  supporting a counterattack.    The success of repelling an assault force depends to a  considerable extent on its timely detection. Therefore, all  reconnaissance efforts, including the artillery battalion's  reconnaissance, are aimed at ascertaining the approach of an  enemy assault force in the deployment areas and also at  determining the sectors of coastal waters that the enemy is  preparing to clear of obstacles.    In order to achieve surprise, the assault force usually will  approach the landing area at night. Under cover of darkness, the  troops are transferred from transports to the assault-landing  craft. Simultaneously, passages will be cleared in the  minefields, and landing areas will be reconnoitered by  reconnaissance groups (landing from individual ships, craft, and  submarines).    If the enemy prepares an assault landing from a coast  divided  by a relatively narrow strait, he crosses the water obstacle on  assault-landing craft and makes the landing from them without  transferring.    The assault landing is preceded by artillery and air  preparation, under the cover of which the enemy assault-landing  craft will approach the shore. As the enemy reaches the  effective range of artillery fire, the artillery battalion  commander reports this to the senior commander (chief) and opens  fire. Using fire prepared in advance, or according to newly  received data, the artillery battalion uses primarily  concentrated fire to engage the transports and assault-landing  craft. Assault waves heading toward the shore are engaged by a  creeping barrage.    The artillery battalion commander must strive to see that  the  battalion's fire inflicts maximum losses on the enemy on the  water before he lands on shore. This is advantageous because  minimal time and ammunition are expended. For example, an  assault-landing craft carrying up to a platoon of infantry can  be sunk by the fire from one 57- to 85- mm gun by direct fire  with an average expenditure of 10-15 rounds in two=three  minutes. Concentrated fire from a 122-mm howitzer battery can  sink a barge in a comparatively short period of time from an  indirect-fire position, destroying up to a company of tanks, up  to a company of motorized infantry, or one to two artillery  batteries.    Clearly, a considerably larger amount of artillery, and  significantly more ammunition would be required to destroy the  same forces and weapons after they have landed on the beach.    As the assault force approaches the beach, the defense's  volume and intensity of fire increase, and more weapons enter  into battle in succession. Batteries and ATGM subunits  delivering direct fire destroy assault-landing craft, amphibious  tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles.    When the enemy closes to within 400-500 meters, all weapons  fire with maximum intensity. The artillery battalion puts up a  fixed barrage on the axis of concentration of the enemy's main  efforts.    Defending subunits used fire from all weapons to destroy the  most vulnerable portion of the enemy assault force and prevent  it from landing on the beach.    If the enemy manages to land on the beach, the artillery  battalion uses its fire to destroy him, prevent him from  spreading into the depth and toward the flanks, and also  prevents subsequent waves from landing.    Taking into account the diversity of the fire missions the  artillery battalion has to carry out, independent fire by  batteries takes on very great importance.    If the enemy uses superior forces to capture part of the  coast, he is destroyed by a second-echelon (reserve)  counterattack. Prior to the counterattack, the artillery  battalion uses concentrated fire or battery fire against single  targets to neutralize enemy weapons and personnel on the axis of  the counterattack and during the counterattack supports the  advance of the counterattacking subunits.    If the counterattack by our subunits results in pinning down  the enemy to the beach, the artillery battalion uses  concentrated fire to engage approaching waves of the assault  force, prepares barrage fire to consolidate the line achieved,  and assists adjacent units when necessary.    If the counterattack is unsuccessful, the artillery  battalion  commander uses barrage fire to prevent expansion of the landing  sector and concentrated fire to engage the forces that have  landed. He creates favorable conditions for repeat and  subsequent counterattacks by our forces.  <H3>  Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various  Conditions </H3> <H5>  Night Operations </H5>   During a night defense, the artillery battalion (battery)  must be at constant readiness to fire to repel a surprise enemy  attack. Therefore, as night approaches, the artillery commander  must plan and carry out additional measures which would  contribute to the best execution of the assigned missions. Such  measures may be: preparing command and observation posts and  fire positions for night operations; determining the procedures  for using night-vision devices and radar, if one has been  attached; updating the sequence of operations by combined-arms  subunits in repelling an enemy attack and the order of executing  fire missions by the artillery battalion (battery); assigning  missions to subunits for illuminating the terrain and targets  and engaging enemy illuminating equipment and night-vision  devices; moving up the artillery battalion's (battery's) forward  observation post closer to the forward edge of the defense;  organizing a check of the operability of night-vision and  illumination devices; reinforcing local security; informing  personnel of the identification markings of friendly combat  equipment; determining measures to ensure subunit safety from  the effects of thermal radiation from a nuclear burst;  distributing illuminating ammunition; and supplying subunits  with illumination and signal devices.    To carry out the planned measures, the artillery battalion  commander issues the necessary instructions while there is still  light. If necessary, he assigns forces and assets and arranges  to monitor the preparation of subunits.    When preparing the command and observation post for night  operation, manmade reference points (visible at night) are set  up; the orientation of instruments is checked; readings are  taken on reference points; angles of site are determined for the  most important targets and reference points and directions to  them are staked out; instruments are prepared for night  operations; and blacking out of light sources is checked.    The duty of scouts, officers, and radiotelephone operators  with communications equipment is established at observation  posts with the onset of darkness.    During preparations for night operations at battery fire  positions, night aiming points (collimators) are set up;  illuminating rounds and devices for illuminating approaches to  the fire positions for self-defense are prepared; guns are aimed  at the most critical sector of barrage fire ahead of the forward  edge of the defense; ammunition, instruments, and sighting  equipment are prepared for night operations; and blacking out of  light sources is checked. Alert crews or crew members at the  guns are assigned in each battery.    The artillery battalion commander usually moves up one of  the  batteries to the temporary fire position to carry out individual  fire missions at night. Reconnaissance and preparation of this  position are usually accomplished during the day.    Barrage fire sectors prepared on the most important axis may  be registered, and firing data may be updated on a regular basis.  <H5>  Operations in the Mountains </H5>   A maneuver battalion's defense in the mountains is  structured  by creating company and individual platoon strongholds to hold  dominant heights, passes, and other important terrain sectors.  Reconnaissance and patrolling are accomplished, ambushes are set  up, and obstacles are erected in the gaps between strongholds.    An artillery battalion assigned to support or attached to a  maneuver battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy on  approaches to the forward edge of the defense, on the flanks and  in gaps between strongholds, in passes, in gorges and  chokepoints, and at convenient crossings over rivers and canyons.    To destroy the enemy who has penetrated into the defense,  concentrated fire and barrage fire are prepared against road  junctions, approaches to commanding heights, places that can be  used by the enemy to bypass the defense area, and also terrain  sectors where the landing of an enemy helicopter assault force  is possible.    The difficult mountainous terrain in many places may hinder  the preparation and delivery of a fixed barrage by the entire  artillery battalion. In such conditions, the role of fire,  separately, by each battery increases considerably.    The artillery battalion's command and observation posts, in  addition to observation posts, are staggered in depth and  positioned in different tiers, ensuring reconnaissance of the  enemy throughout the assigned zone, observation of concealed  approaches to the forward edge of the defense, and timely  request for fire from the artillery battalion. Much attention is  given to the deployment of forward and lateral observation posts  in the artillery battalion and batteries. A diagram of dead  ground is drawn up from the location of each command and  observation post, in addition to observation posts.    The possibility of a broader maneuver of fire and firing  over  hillcrests is taken into account when selecting fire positions.  Fire positions may be selected in sectors of adjacent units by  authority of the senior chief.    Part of the artillery battalion's guns may be assigned for  direct fire to cover approaches to dominant heights.    When preparing the fire positions, gun emplacements and  shelters are made primarily in a semisunken or banked-up manner  using rocks, sandbags, and other material.    In organizing combat operations in the mountains, special  attention is given to conducting reconnaissance on the flanks  and detecting enveloping enemy detachments. A surprise enemy  attack from the flank or rear of the defense area can  considerably weaken the position of the defending subunits. A  detected enveloping detachment is engaged by concentrated fire  from the artillery battalion or by battery fire in coordination  with other weapons of the maneuver battalion.  <H5>  Operations in the Desert </H5>   A maneuver battalion usually takes up a defense in the  desert  on the most likely axis of enemy operations. The gaps between  battalion defense areas, as a rule, are greater than in normal  conditions.    The battalion defense area and company strongholds are  prepared for all-around defense. Fire lines are prepared and  ambushes and obstacles are set up in the gaps between  strongholds.    To engage the enemy, an artillery battalion prepares  concentrated fire against areas of possible concentration of  personnel and weapons in populated points and oases, near water  sources, and also against routes of movement (envelopment) and  deployment lines. It prepares barrage fire to repel an enemy  attack in front of the forward edge of the defense and in gaps  between strongholds.    Good field of view and fire conditions and the possibility  for artillery subunits to move off-road, except for areas of  quicksand and wet salt marshes, on the one hand, allow extensive  maneuver of fire and subunits. On the other hand, they require  thorough camouflage and the setting up of artificial reference  points and hinder engineer preparation of command and  observation posts in addition to observation posts. Batteries  maneuver to alternate fire positions over routes reconnoitered  in advance and marked with visible markers.    Constant readiness of gun platoons for all-around tank  defense acquires utmost importance in desert conditions.    Frequent sand and dust storms demand that special attention  be given to caring for armament and combat equipment. In  organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander  must provide for creating stores of ammunition, fuel, and water,  and monitor their consumption, in addition to observing water  discipline. Special attention is given to performing sanitation  and hygienic measures.  <H5>  Operations in Northern Areas </H5>   Natural conditions, the nature of the terrain (the presence  of hills, mountains, a large number of marshes, lakes, rivers,  and other difficult terrain sectors), and, in addition, the deep  snow cover in the winter have a significant effect on organizing  defense in northern areas. A defense in northern areas is  organized on axes accessible for an enemy attack by preparing  individual company and platoon strongholds for all-around  defense.    Artillery subunits (battalion, battery) are usually attached  to motorized rifle subunits defending in the first echelon. An  artillery battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy in  concentrated areas (against populated points, sparse forests,  and other sheltered areas), in attack positions, and on near  approaches to the defense in the gaps between strongholds and on  exposed flanks.    When organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion  commander must take into account the features of the summer and  winter periods of the northern area and determine the necessary  measures for maintaining the artillery battalion subunits at a  high degree of combat readiness. Thus, in the winter it is  necessary to carry out such measures as more frequent updating  of firing data; warming up guns by firing single rounds with  reduced charges; preparing equipment and combat equipment for  operation in conditions of low temperatures, deep snow cover,  and bad roads; setting up warming points for personnel;  preparing subunits to carry out fire missions during a snowfall  (blizzard or snowstorm); clearing shelters and emplacements  after a heavy snowfall; assigning an alert battery; and  reinforcing local security during the polar night and during a  lengthy blizzard (snowstorm).    To engage the enemy when there is a heavy snow cover, it is  advisable to fire shells with time fuses.    A defense on a broad front and in difficult terrain  conditions requires the artillery battalion commander to have  thorough camouflage and a rational location of command and  observation posts for the purpose of reliable command and  control and the possibility of maneuvering fire toward the  flanks to counter deep and close envelopments by the enemy.    The experience of creating mobile reconnaissance groups has  proved itself in combat. Such groups were created in each  artillery battalion and battery. The artillery battalion  intelligence officer usually tasked the group to conduct  reconnaissance or follow-up reconnaissance of targets. Its  actions were coordinated with the commander of the rifle subunit  on whose sector the mission was being carried out.  Footnotes    1. The artillery battalion may receive the roving subunit  operation plan in final form from the artillery group  headquarters.    2.

The Artillery Battalion on the March </H5> <H5>  March Fundamentals </H5>   The highly mobile nature of modern combat will make it  necessary to move units and subunits, which will be  accomplished, as a rule, in difficult conditions. Massed use of  air support, incendiary weapons, and especially nuclear weapons  will result in the destruction of railroad junctions, stations,  bridges, and ports (wharfs), and significantly impede  transportation of all types. Therefore, the march may prove to  be the primary method of movement.    A march is the organized movement of subunits in columns  over  roads and cross-country routes with the purpose of arriving at a  designated area or line in a timely manner.    As a rule, an artillery battalion executes a march as part  of  a march column of an artillery or combined-arms unit (subunit);  a battery does so as part of a march column of an artillery  battalion or combined-arms subunit. In some cases, an artillery  battalion may execute a march as an independent column over a  separate route.    To achieve secrecy and reduce losses, it is advisable to  execute a march at night or in other conditions of limited  visibility (rain, fog, low cloud cover, or snowfall). The combat  situation conditions also may require a march to be executed in  the daytime. In this case, the subunits move at high speeds, the  intervals between vehicles are increased, and column security is  reinforced.    Depending on the mission and situation conditions, an  artillery battalion may execute a march in anticipation of an  engagement, or without the threat of encountering the enemy  toward the front, from the front to the rear, or along the front.    A march in anticipation of engagement is executed, as a  rule,  in conditions of pressure by enemy air support or the enemy's  use of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, when organizing a  march, provisions are made primarily for ensuring the artillery  battalion's constant combat readiness for rapid deployment into  battle formation and opening surprise and accurate fire. In the  conditions, the artillery battalion may be attached to a  maneuver battalion assigned to an advance guard (forward  detachment) or be directly subordinate to the regiment  commander. Above all, self-propelled artillery subunits are  attached to the advance guard or forward detachment. The  maneuver battalion commander determines the place of an  artillery battalion attached to a maneuver battalion. Usually,  the artillery battalion moves at the tail of its column; the  artillery battalion commander, having communications equipment,  proceeds with the maneuver battalion commander.    A battery in anticipation of engagement executes a march as  part of an advance (flank, rear) party, in the advance guard, or  as part of the artillery battalion column.    The place of an artillery battalion executing a march as  part  of its own unit is determined by decision of the unit commander.  In doing so, the artillery battalion commander proceeds at the  head of the artillery battalion column; the battery commanders  proceed at the head of their columns. The chief of staff usually  proceeds at the head of the artillery battalion column.    When executing a march as an independent column, a patrol  squad is sent out for local security to the distance of visual  contact. The patrol squad is provided communications equipment  and is sent out ahead and, if necessary, to the rear and flanks  of the column.    As a rule, an artillery battalion usually executes a march  in  its own unit column when there is no threat of encountering the  enemy.    The senior commander usually establishes the length of the  day's march and the average speed of movement. This depends on  the mission assigned, the training of the drivers, the type of  transports, the technical condition of these vehicles and  artillery equipment, and also on road conditions, the season of  the year, the time of day, and the weather. An average speed of  up to 20 km/hour at night and 25-30 km/hour in the daytime is  possible for a mixed column (tracked and wheeled vehicles) when  executing a march in conditions of flat or semibroken terrain.  The average speed may be the same for the entire march. It will  be higher than average when traveling over highways and improved  roads and lower when traveling over dirt roads, field (forest)  roads, bridges, fords, and when crossing areas of massive  destruction and obstructions.    The speed will be lower when executing a march in the  mountains, during the season of bad roads, during heavy  snowfall, fog, and rain, and also over dusty roads during dry  weather. Experience shows that the speed is 10-15 km/hour for  motor vehicles and up to 10 km/hour for tracked prime movers  when executing a march in the mountains and in areas with  ascents and descents of 10 degrees or more.    The cross-country capability of motor vehicles and primary  artillery movers is increased by providing them with off-road  equipment, using prepared mats and brushwood, and using  engineering equipment to lay paths over deep snow.    In all cases, the march must be executed at the maximum  speed  possible in the given conditions.    An artillery battalion usually executes a march in one  column. The intervals between subunits in the artillery  battalion column and also between prime movers and vehicles  depend on the speed of movement and visibility conditions and  can range from 25 to 50 meters. The higher the speed, the  greater the interval. The intervals increase when traveling on  sharp ascents and descents over dusty roads and ice; they  decrease when traveling at night.    When organizing a march, the artillery battalion is given a  starting point, control points, and the time for crossing them  to ensure the march starts on time and to regulate the speed of  movement. Halts and day (night) rest halts are designated to  inspect the vehicles and guns, perform maintenance on them, and  to feed and rest personnel.    Prime movers and vehicles of the batteries are positioned in  a herringbone pattern when possible (Figure 30) in the  disposition area and in the day (night) rest halt area to ensure  that the column forms up quickly and starts in a timely manner.      <H5>    March Organization </H5>   An artillery battalion's march is organized by the artillery  battalion commander based on the operation order or operational  instruction received from the senior commander (chief).    The commander of an artillery battalion attached to a  maneuver battalion must report to the maneuver battalion  commander at the designated time, report on the status and  capabilities of the artillery battalion, and receive the mission  from him. The sequence of the artillery battalion's work in  organizing the march is shown in Figure 31.          When clarifying the mission and assessing the situation, the  artillery battalion commander must firmly understand where and  by what time the artillery battalion is to arrive, the length of  the march, how much time is allocated for the march and under  what conditions it is being executed, the artillery battalion's  place in the march column, and the missions at the line of  possible deployment when entering into battle or on arrival in  the new area. In addition, the artillery battalion commander  studies the route (from a map or aerial photography, taking into  account data from reconnaissance of the route, if it was  conducted) and lines of possible deployment. He plans the fire  position areas and command and observation post locations on  these lines. A work map is prepared for command and control of  the artillery battalion.    The artillery battalion commander then plans measures for  preparing the artillery battalion for the march: dispatching an  artillery reconnaissance group; preparing personnel, prime  movers, motor vehicles, equipment, and instruments; replenishing  supplies; and other measures. He also issues appropriate  directions and instructions.    When executing a march in the column of an artillery or  combined-arms unit, reconnaissance of the route and traffic  control service on the route are organized by forces and assets  of the senior commander.    In an artillery battalion executing a march in the column of  the advance guard, artillery reconnaissance subunits move  forward with the advance party under the direction of the  artillery battalion intelligence officer; the artillery  reconnaissance group follows the advance party.    When organizing a march in anticipation of engagement, the  artillery battalion commander determines the following in his  decision: the distribution of batteries to reinforce  combined-arms subunits; the alignment of the artillery battalion  column; the order of deployment and battery missions when  engaging; and organization of command and control on the march  and when engaging.    When the artillery battalion executes a march as an  independent column over a separate route, the artillery  battalion commander will usually be assigned an assembly area  and an arrival time. The artillery battalion staff makes a march  timetable and plots the artillery battalion's position, route,  and assembly area on the map. It plans the starting point and  control points; determines the length of the route by measuring  the distance from the starting point to the far boundary of the  assembly area increasing the distance by 5-15 percent, taking  into account the nature of the terrain on the route (ascents,  descents, bends in roads) and the scale of the map. The staff  then breaks the route into 10-km segments, plans halts and their  duration, determines the alignment of the march column, and  calculates the length of the column by multiplying the total  number of motor vehicles and artillery primary movers with guns  by the established interval between them (the length of the gun  plus primary mover is included in the interval). It determines  the speed of the the artillery battalion column at various  sectors of the route and calculates the time for crossing the  starting point and control points, calculates the time for the  column to form up at the starting point and for the column to  form up at the assembly area, with the speed being one-half to  three-fourths the average speed on the route, and then  determines the time for the march, unless indicated by the  senior commander.    Prior to executing the march, the artillery battalion  commander issues an operation order in which he indicates the  following.    In the first paragraph--information about the enemy.    In the second paragraph--the mission of the combined-arms  subunit (unit).    In the third paragraph--the mission of adjacent units.    In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the artillery  battalion (battery), the route of movement, the place in the  march formation of the combined-arms (artillery) units or  subunits, the assembly area (rest area) or fire position area  (deployment line), the time of arrival there and what actions to  be ready for, the starting point, control points and time for  crossing them, the place and time of halts, column alignment,  speed of movement, intervals between vehicles, and procedures  for using the navigation equipment of command vehicles.    In the fifth paragraph--after the words "I order," the  artillery battalion commander assigns the missions:    --for artillery reconnaissance subunits: composition,  mission, destination, time of passing the starting point,  procedures for maintaining contact, and procedures for using the  navigation equipment of the mobile reconnaissance station.    --for the artillery reconnaissance group: composition and  its  chief, missions, destination, time and place for joining the  advance party or advance guard column.    --for a battery assigned to the advance party: the mission  and time and place for joining the advance party column.    --for batteries proceeding in the artillery battalion  column:  the mission, place in the column, and order of deployment on  lines of possible encounter with the enemy.    In the sixth paragraph--locations and procedures for  refueling vehicles during the march and, in addition, ammunition  expenditure in anticipation of engagement.    In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for the march.    In the eighth paragraph--observation and communications  procedures during the march and the location of the artillery  battalion (battery) commander, staff, and deputies in the column.    A necessary element in the artillery battalion commander's  work in preparing for the march is assisting subunits and  checking their readiness.    Subunit commanders, drivers, and mechanics inspect the  artillery primary movers and motor vehicles prior to the march.  They check levels of fuel, lubricants, water (antifreeze); the  serviceability of control, illumination, and signaling  mechanisms; the presence and attachment of off-road equipment  and firefighting equipment. They also check the serviceability  of the running gear and brake systems of the guns, and the  proficiency of preparing guns and ammunition for firing.    In the subunits, they also check the availability and  serviceability of individual protective gear; the presence of  canvas covers, stores of water, emergency food rations, and  small-arms ammunition on the motor vehicles (prime movers); the  serviceability of communications equipment and instruments and  their stowage in the vehicles. They ensure that observers are  supplied with chemical and radiation reconnaissance instruments,  and that radio operators are provided radio operating data. They  also check personnel knowledge of warning signals, and make sure  that officers have work maps and keep them up to date.    The check of subunit readiness should be more thorough prior  to a night march. The artillery battalion's mechanic inspects in  detail the serviceability of engine instruments. The drivers  clean dust from the headlights, clearance lights, brake lights,  and convoy lights. Light bulbs that have burned out are replaced  in the illumination and signaling devices.    The technical maintenance echelon may consist of a motor  vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop and one or two  spare prime movers.    Let us use a tactical example to follow the work of the  artillery battalion commander and staff in organizing a march.  <H6>  Tactical Example 4 </H6> <H5>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 32) </H5>   An artillery battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers,  having executed a 300-km march as part of the 17th Motorized  Rifle Regiment, was located in the area of Konty, Hill 127.0,  Vertichi by 0800 hours 5 May. The combat equipment and motor  vehicles were concealed, and local security, self-defense, and  chemical and radiation reconnaissance had been organized.    The artillery battalion commander learned from information  from the regiment chief of staff that our troops were waging  defensive battles 120-130 km to the west.          During the day of 5 May, slit trenches for shelter were dug,  camouflage work was performed, the condition of the combat  equipment and motor vehicles was checked, detected malfunctions  were corrected, and refueling was accomplished. The personnel  had a six-hour rest.    At 1830 hours on 5 May, the artillery commander was summoned  to the 17th MRR headquarters, where together with the commanders  of the 1st MRB and the tank battalion he received the mission:    "1. Having gone over to the attack with superior forces, the  enemy has penetrated our defenses and is threatening to break  through them. His forward subunits have reached the line along  Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of Orekhovo.  Enemy air support is conducting reconnaissance of our positions  and making strikes against them and rear installations. The  enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km  south of Orekhovo.    "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles with the enemy  and have halted his advance with counterattacks in a number of  sectors. Air support is making bomb and missile strikes against  the enemy, and in coordination with air defense assets is  covering our troops against enemy airstrikes.    "3. The 17th MRR, making up the reserve of the higher  commander, has been given the mission to execute a march over  the route along Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and by 0700  hours on 6 May to occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo,  Liski and prevent an enemy breakthrough in the direction of  Tolmachi, Bekovo.    "4. The regiment's advance guard is the 1st MRB with a tank  company, the 1st Arty Bn, an antiaircraft artillery battery, and  a combat engineer platoon. It is to execute a march over the  regiment's route with the mission of ensuring unimpeded movement  of the regiment and by 0600 hours 6 on May occupy the area of  Hill 137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove and organize  a fire plan and support deployment of the regiment's main body.    "The head of the column is to pass the starting point--the  bridge across Bystryy Brook--at 2230 hours on 5 May. It is to  pass phase line No. 1--the western outskirts of Detki--at 0240  hours 6 May. There is to be a one-hour halt, 0130-0230 hours, on  6 May."    The commander of the 1st MRB informed the artillery  battalion  commander that with the limited time for organizing the march,  he would hear his report in 30 minutes at the regimental  headquarters, after which he would announce his decision. The  artillery battalion commander issued instructions by telephone,  summoning the commanders to the artillery battalion headquarters  by 1940 hours, made a timetable for preparing for the march  (Table 25), and began assessing the situation.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 25.

There  are 11 hours until the advance guard is to reach this line, with  three hours of daylight. In this time the enemy, advancing at a  speed of 1.5-2 km/hour, can advance to a depth of 17-22 km and  capture this line.    Our units are waging stubborn battles, trying to prevent the  enemy from advancing into the rear. The enemy's superiority in  forces and assets should be taken into account.    Therefore, the following is possible when the advance guard  reaches the area it is to defend:    --occupy this area under difficult conditions of pressure  from enemy weapons and airstrikes.    --an encounter with the enemy in an engagement, which is  possible at a line 5-7 km east of Orekhovo.    For the artillery battalion to be ready for an encounter  with  the enemy, it is necessary:    --to issue instructions on the sequence of actions by  personnel during an enemy air raid and for organizing local  security on the march.    --to check the readiness of individual protective gear in  case the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; plan  concentrated fire and barrage fire to engage the enemy when the  advance guard is defending the assigned line.    The artillery battalion is battleworthy. The technical  condition of the combat equipment and motor vehicles and the  availability of supplies make it possible to execute the march  successfully, deploy for battle from the line of march, and  carry out the assigned missions.    The terrain on the route is semibroken with groves and  forest, which helps to conceal movement.    The route should be divided into two parts according to the  condition of the road cover: 77 km is hard-surface road, which  supports movement at a speed of 25 km/hour; 43 km is dirt road,  making it possible to travel at a speed of 15 km/hour.    The road network is developed, which is conducive to quickly  finding routes for bypassing zones of probable contamination,  areas of destruction, and pockets of fire. Populated points  having brick structures may be used as strongholds both by the  enemy and our troops.    Bridges on the route enable all types of combat equipment to  move.    The terrain is accessible for tanks on the line of probable  encounter and in the area designated for defense. It is  advisable to select fire positions in the areas... (he indicates  them on the map). Command and observation posts are to be with  the battalion commander and company posts.    The wooded area which the column will cross is a fire  hazard.  In addition, it is favorable for operations by enemy sabotage  and reconnaissance groups. When approaching this area, it is  necessary to increase observation and column security and bring  personnel to the ready for actions.    Heavy rains are possible.    The march is being executed during hours of darkness, which  ensures concealed movement and reduces the possibility of enemy  airstrikes. Direct the attention of drivers and all personnel to  night march discipline--the intervals between vehicles are  reduced.    The advance guard is to reach the line of probable encounter  with the enemy or the area for taking up the defense at dawn.  This is advantageous for orientation, battlefield surveillance,  rapid deployment, and more effective use of all weapons to  inflict maximum losses on the enemy.    Here is the artillery battalion commander's report to the  1st  MRB commander.    "Comrade Major! The artillery battalion has seventeen 122-mm  self-propelled howitzers in its inventory. It is located in the  area of Konty, Hill 127.0, Vertichi (4 km from regimental  headquarters). It is battle worthy. Ammunition supplies are 1.25  units of fire; fuel supplies are available for one refueling.    "With the available guns and ammunition, the artillery  battalion is able to do the following:    "--when defending the occupied area: when the enemy  approaches, it can use concentrated fire to neutralize two to  three targets (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when  repelling an enemy attack, it can prepare a creeping barrage on  two or three lines and a fixed barrage on one or two lines  (expenditure of 0.3-0.5 units of fire) and engage 10-12 single  targets (expenditure of 0.4 units of fire). The artillery  battalion is preparing fire... (he indicates on the map).    "--in an engagement: it can use concentrated fire to  neutralize two or three sectors of the enemy deploying for  battle (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when repelling an  enemy attack and covering the flanks, it can prepare a fixed  barrage on two or three lines (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of  fire) and engage 12-16 single targets (expenditure of 0.5-0.7  units of fire).    "I propose allocating the batteries as follows for  supporting  the companies: 1st Btry--1st MRC, 3d Btry--2d or 3d MRC, and  have the 2d Btry as standby.    "Assign the mortar battery to support one of the companies  when the maneuver battalion is operating in one echelon. On the  march, the battery commanders are to proceed with the commanders  of the supported companies; the commander of the standby battery  and I will proceed with you."  <H5>  Decision of the Advance Guard Commander </H5>   The advance guard is to be aligned as follows for executing  the march: advance party, main body (headquarters, combat  engineer platoon, ATGM platoon, tank company, minus a tank  platoon, antiaircraft artillery battery, 2d MRC, 3d MRC, mortar  battery, artillery battalion, minus 1st Btry), logistical  subunits, technical maintenance echelon, and a scout car from  the 3d MRC.    Speed of movement: from the starting point to Detki (77  km)--25 km/hour; from Detki to Orekhovo (43 km)--15 km/hour.  Intervals between vehicles and subunits--25 meters.    Strikes by enemy aircraft and helicopters are to be repelled  by all antiaircraft weapons.    March security of the advance party--1st MRC with a tank  platoon, a combat engineer squad, and 1st Btry--executes the  march over the route of the advance guard. Its mission is to  prevent the enemy from penetrating to the main body. It is to  travel at a distance of five km from the head of the main body  and pass the starting point at 2215 hours 5 May.    If the advance party encounters small enemy subunits, it is  to destroy them on the move. If it encounters superior enemy  forces in the vicinity of Orekhovo, it is to take up an  advantageous line and use stationary fire to support the  deployment of the maneuver battalion's main body from its left  flank.    When occupying the assigned defense area, the maneuver  battalion battle formation is in one echelon: the 2d MRC on the  right, the 1st MRC in the center, and the 3d MRC (minus a  motorized rifle platoon) on the left; the reserve is the 3d  Motorized Rifle Platoon of the 3d MRC.    I approve the planned fire missions.    The artillery battalion is to proceed as part of the advance  guard column and pass the starting point at 2240 hours.    On the march, I am at the head of the main body's column; if  the enemy is encountered, I leave for the advance party.  Communications during movement is by radio using short  prearranged signals; during an engagement, communications are by  radio, unrestricted using the coded map.    Control signals: "Aldan" 222--crossing starting point;  "Irtysh" 555--passing control point No. 1; "Sherenga"  800--deploy into battle formation; "Shkval"--request for fire.    At 1945 hours, the artillery battalion commander returned to  the artillery battalion headquarters, issued instructions for  march preparation, and worked on the work map with the chief of  staff (Figure 32).    The subunit commanders arrived at 2100 hours. The artillery  battalion commander issues the operation order for the march.    "1. The enemy, located 120-130 km from us to the west, has  gone over to the attack with superior forces and penetrated the  defenses of our units. His forward subunits have reached the  line along Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of  Orekhovo (indicates it on the map). Enemy air support is  conducting reconnaissance of our troop dispositions and making  bombing strikes against them and on rear installations. The  enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km  south of Orekhovo.    "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles and have halted  the enemy advance by counterattacks on a number of sectors.    "The 17th MRR has been tasked to execute a march over the  route Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and, by 0700 hours 6 May,  occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo, Liski and prevent  the enemy from breaking through in the direction of Tolmachi,  Bekovo.    "The 1st MRB with a tank company, the 1st Arty Bn, an  antiaircraft artillery battery, and a combat engineer  platoon--the regiment's advance guard--is executing a march over  the regiment's route with the mission of ensuring its unimpeded  movement and, by 0600 hours 6 May, is to occupy the area of Hill  137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove, organize a fire  plan, and support deployment of the regiment's main body.    "3. There are no adjacent units on the right or left.    "4. The artillery battalion is executing a march in the  advance guard's column over the 17th MRR's route behind the  mortar battery. Its mission is to arrive at the area assigned to  the advance guard for defense by 0600 hours 6 May, deploy into  battle formation, and support subunit operations to hold this  area. The fire position area is... (he indicates on map), and  the command and observation posts are to be together with the  commanders of the supported subunits. Be ready to deliver  concentrated fire against targets 31 and 32, creeping barrage  `Rys-1 and -2,' and fixed barrage `Grusha' and `Iva.'    "A meeting engagement should be expected if the enemy is  encountered when approaching Orekhovo.    "The artillery battalion is to pass the starting point--the  bridge across Bystryy Brook--with the head of the column at 2230  hours 5 May and control point No. 1--the western outskirts of  Detki--at 0240 hours 6 May. There is one halt, from 0130 to 0230  hours 6 May.    "Alignment of the artillery battalion column is:  headquarters, 1st Btry, 2d Btry, 3d Btry, supply section, and  motor vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop.    "The navigation equipment on the command vehicles is to be  turned on at the halt.    "5. I order:    "--artillery reconnaissance subunits--reconnaissance squads  of the artillery battalion and 2d Btry under the guidance of the  intelligence officer are to proceed in the advance party column  behind the 1st Btry commander's vehicle with the mission of  conducting reconnaissance of the route. If the enemy is  encountered on the approach to Orekhovo, ascertain its forces,  assets, and intentions, and determine the coordinates of  reconnoitered weapons. When the advance guard occupies the  defense area, select locations for the command and observation  posts, determine on the terrain the location of concentrated  fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage fires being prepared,  and organize reconnaissance in the subunits. Pass the starting  point at 2215 hours. Communicate by radio using established  signals.    "--1st Btry, assigned as part of the advance party, is to  move at the tail of the column; the battery commander and the  headquarters platoon are to move with the advance party  commander. Upon encountering the enemy and during deployment,  the missions are to use fire to destroy enemy personnel and  weapons; when the maneuver battalion is occupying the defense  area, carry out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion  and independently, and continue to support the 1st MRC.    "--during deployment of the main body of the advance guard,  the 2d and 3d Batteries are to be ready to neutralize enemy  personnel and weapons; while occupying the defense area, carry  out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion and  independently. The 2d Btry is the standby battery; and the 3d  Btry is to support the 2d MRC on the march and proceed with the  company commander.    "6. Ammunition expenditure in the event of an engagement or  when defending the assigned area is 1.0 unit of fire, and the  rest is for a fixed barrage.    "7. The 1st Btry is to leave for the starting point at 2200  hours and join the advance party column at 2215 hours; form the  artillery battalion column at 2220 hours; the head of the column  is at the artillery battalion headquarters.    "8. Each subunit is to assign observers for the ground  enemy,  the air, and signals.    "Communicate only by signals over the radio on the march.    "The commander of the 2d Btry and I will proceed with the  commander of the advance guard at the head of the artillery  battalion column.    "The deputy is the chief of staff and 1st Btry commander.    "Control signals are: `Aldan' 222 crossing starting point;  `Irtysh' 555--passing control point No. 1; `Sherenga'  800--deploy into battle formation; `Shkval'--request for fire,  indicating the target number; and warning signals are as  previously established."    Next the artillery battalion commander gave instructions for  comprehensive support of the combat operations.  <H5>  March Execution </H5>   The artillery battalion commander forms up the column and  moves it from the occupied area so as to occupy his place in the  march column of the combined-arms (artillery) unit in a timely  manner and pass the starting point at the designated time.  Experience in exercises shows that the average time required for  moving from the position and out into march column is up to 10  minutes for a battery and up to 20 minutes for an artillery  battalion.    The established order must be observed when executing a  march. Guns and primary movers (motor vehicles) in the column  must travel only on the right side of the road. The left side is  left free for passing or for oncoming traffic. The established  speed and intervals are constantly observed during the march.  Vehicles or subunits leave the column and pass vehicles moving  ahead of them only with authorization of the senior commander.    If a driver is forced to stop, he turns on his right turn  signal and moves off the road or stops on the shoulder without  blocking those behind him. The malfunction is corrected by the  driver or, if necessary, by the workshop of the technical  maintenance echelon. After correcting the trouble, the driver  continues on without passing those ahead in the column. Vehicles  that have lagged behind take up their position in the column  only at the halt.    The artillery battalion commander controls the subunits on  the march with the aid of mobile and signal equipment. When  executing a march in anticipation of engagement, each battery  designates radios to operate in the receive mode only.    Contact is maintained by radio with the artillery  reconnaissance group commander and intelligence officer.    On the march, the artillery battalion commander, chief of  staff, battery commanders, and platoon commanders personally  track the movement route and compare it with the map, keep track  of signals from march security, monitor subunit actions, and  control the subunits. Orientation on the route, particularly at  night, is facilitated by advance measurement and recording on  the map the distances between prominent landmarks: road  intersections, populated points, rivers, grade crossings,  bridges, individual structures, and so forth. The recorded  distances are compared with speedometer readings during the  march. The topographic survey navigation equipment is turned on  by decision of the artillery battalion commander in difficult  march conditions.    The artillery battalion passes chokepoints (defiles),  bridges, crossings, and populated points without stopping. This  reduces the possibility of the column being hit by airstrikes  and nuclear weapons.    Warnings about the approach of enemy aircraft during the  march are received from the senior commander (chief) and from  observers in the columns. Depending on the terrain conditions,  subunits act by decision of the artillery battalion commander  during an air raid. If there is good cover and camouflage, the  column may stop or continue moving at an increased speed and  with greater intervals between vehicles; personnel prepare to  fire on low-flying targets.    If the enemy uses incendiary weapons, the subunit columns  withdraw from the area of fire on decision of the artillery  battalion commander and immediately begin extinguishing burning  vehicles and assisting personnel, after which the columns  continue movement.    When there is a warning about the enemy's use of chemical  weapons against the artillery battalion column, personnel  located in the vehicle bodies don gas masks and protective  capes, and personnel in the cabs and covered vehicles don only  gas masks. The column exits the zone of contamination and on  command of the artillery battalion commander stops to perform  partial decontamination of the equipment, if necessary, and also  gear, uniforms, and footwear.    If the enemy uses nuclear weapons, the degree of damage and  actions to eliminate the after-effects will vary in each  specific case. The artillery battalion commander and staff  assess the situation in a minimum amount of time and organize  rescue work and restoration of combat effectiveness. First,  those subunits that have the fewest losses are identified. They  are used to assist other subunits. After restoring command and  control, the artillery battalion commander withdraws the  subunits from the casualty area and organizes partial  decontamination of weapons, equipment, gear, and uniforms,  medical aid to personnel, and partial radioactive  decontamination and evacuation of casualties to the nearest  medical aid stations.    On the march the artillery battalion must be constantly  ready  to repel an attack by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups.  Attacks by them are most likely when passing difficult sectors  of the route.    At areas of halts, the column stops on the right shoulder of  the road with intervals between vehicles as established by the  commander, but not less than 10 meters. All personnel, except  for the observers and radiotelephone operations of alert  communications equipment, dismount from the vehicles and  position themselves to the right of the road. Drivers and  mechanics inspect the vehicles, and gun commanders inspect the  guns. Subunit commanders are briefed by the drivers and gun  commanders on the condition of the weapons and vehicles,  organize political work, brief all personnel on the latest  information about the enemy, and update the assigned mission.    Maintaining constant readiness for immediate deployment is  one of the primary tasks of artillery subunit commanders for  ensuring successful actions during a surprise encounter with the  enemy.    The Great Patriotic War has provided numerous examples of  skilled actions by artillerymen during a march when encountering  with the enemy.    Proper organization of march security and reconnaissance,  preciseness, speed, and decisiveness made it possible to inflict  maximum losses on the enemy.    Here is one example.[.sup]1[/]    In the spring of 1943, our troops temporarily went over  to the defense west of Lisichansk. A partial regrouping of  forces was made to the right flank of one of the armies in order  to prevent a possible enemy counterstrike in the direction of  Lisichansk. Among other units, a two-battery artillery battalion  participated in this regrouping. On the morning of 4 March, it  moved as a column together with the supported rifle regiment  from Aleksandrovka to Lisichansk via Zheltoye and  Lopasekino.    Since there was limited time for the march, the  artillery battalion had to execute the march not only at night  but also during the day. On the march, the artillery battalion  lagged behind the rifle regiment, which went on ahead in motor  vehicles, and lost contact with it. At 1000 hours,  reconnaissance ascertained that the enemy was trying to capture  Lopasekino, located on the artillery battalion's route of  movement. It was soon learned that more than a battalion of  enemy infantry, supported by an artillery battery and mortar  battery, had captured Lopasekino in order to block the movement  of our troops over the road along the left bank of the Severnyy  Donets River.    After receiving this information, the artillery  battalion commander, Senior Lieutenant Shosshes, ordered the  battalion to deploy from the column into battle formation at  open fire positions for direct fire against the enemy infantry  at Lopasekino and the batteries on the west bank of the Severnyy  Donets River.    The 7th Btry (commanded by Senior Lieutenant Odintsov)  deployed and quickly opened accurate fire, inflicting heavy  losses on the enemy. The 8th Btry (commanded by Senior  Lieutenant Rusanov) opened fire on the enemy mortar battery and  neutralized it.    The enemy artillery battery was not able to open fire  until 30 minutes after the battle had begun. But its guns were  soon neutralized, and the infantry ended up without support.    Suffering heavy losses and unable to withstand the  withering fire of our batteries, the enemy infantry began to  withdraw toward the river in disorder. But after receiving  reinforcements moved there on six motor vehicles, the enemy  halted the withdrawal and even attacked our batteries'  positions.  <H5>  Features of a March in Various Conditions </H5>   A march in the mountains is organized taking into  account the route profile. Speed of movement on ascents,  descents, and in other difficult sectors may decrease, and the  intervals between vehicles may increase to limits ensuring  traffic safety.    When preparing for a march, special attention is given to  careful inspection of the running gear, brakes, and control  mechanisms. Motor vehicles and primary movers with enhanced  off-road capability and equipped with winches are distributed  evenly throughout the column. Each vehicle is supplies with  cables (tow lines) and also chocks for braking in the event of a  forced stop on an ascent or descent. It should be taken into  account that engine power drops as the elevation above sea level  increases.    A team with a primary mover may be posted on sectors with  sharp ascents and descents to assist motor vehicles and primary  movers with guns.    As a rule, subunits negotiate passes, gorges, mountain  passages, and canyons without stopping and at the maximum  possible speed. In the event individual vehicles are forced to  stop due to a technical malfunction, they are moved to where  they will not impede movement of the column. Personnel dismount  when crossing dangerous road sectors.    Stopping the column below or above precipices or on sharp  ascents or descents should be avoided.    Halts are designated at convenient spots for stopping the  column, usually on level sectors of the road. Places for halts  must not be designated on dry riverbeds or on steep slopes. It  is desirable to designate long halts in front of long ascents  and near sources of water. In this case, subunits are  positioned along the roads or in sheltered places near them.    A march in the desert requires thorough  preparation of equipment for travel in conditions of high  temperatures, lack of roads, sandy terrain, and lack of water.    In organizing the march, the artillery battalion commander  must study the route, determine methods for marking it on the  terrain, determine procedures for using navigation equipment,  provide subunits with the necessary supplies of water and fuel,  and provide for measures to protect personnel against heatstroke.    It is necessary to have a store of poles, brushwood mats, or  flexible metal netting to increase the off-road capability of  motor vehicles and primary movers. When executing a march during  the rainy season, terrain sectors with quicksand and salt  marshes should be bypassed. Rubbing parts must be inspected,  cleaned, and lubricated more often in the desert, and  lubricating oils must be changed more frequently. To preclude  heatstrokes and sunstrokes in personnel, halts should not be  made in closed areas with hot, stagnant air. During the hot part  of the day, water discipline must be strictly observed in the  subunits. Locations of halts and rests should be selected near  sources of water.    Movement may be halted when executing a march during  sandstorms, which make orientation difficult. Vehicles stop at  reduced intervals. It is forbidden to leave single vehicles  alone along the route.    A march in the winter is characterized by a  significant drop in the average speed, increased fuel  consumption, and increased engine wear. Snowdrifts and low air  temperatures require a well-conceived organization of the march,  thorough preparation of equipment and armament, and training of  the drivers. It is advisable to have prime movers with mounted  equipment at the head of the column to increase off-road  capability.    In a blizzard or snowstorm, when visibility drops sharply,  the lead vehicles of each subunit travel with their headlights  on, and the drivers of the vehicles behind them orient  themselves on the clearance lights of those ahead.    In northern regions, movement may be halted in a  heavy snowstorm by decision of the commander of the  combined-arms unit (subunit) or the senior artillery commander.  In these conditions, subunit commanders must set up warming  stations for personnel, post perimeter security, and prohibit  lone movement by personnel and vehicles.    An artillery battalion's march off the road may occur when  executing an enveloping maneuver in the combined-arms unit  (battalion) column in order to move to the enemy's rear area and  cut off his withdrawal route. Experience of the Great  Patriotic War showed the great difficult of off-road movement in  the Arctic region, in Karelia, in the mountainous areas of the  Caucasus and Carpathians in the winter, and also over the  roadless terrain of the Far East.    The abundance of steep upgrades and downgrades, swampy  terrain sectors, lakes and rivers, and undergrowth of small  forests required our troops to be thoroughly prepared, have  great courage, and tireless determination in achieving the  missions of the march.    Preparing for a march in the winter and in the northern  regions requires particularly thorough study, reconnaissance,  and assessment of the possibility of travel over the planned  route.    Taking into account the specific conditions, commanders at  all levels and all personnel must demonstrate broad, intelligent  initiative for overcoming the difficulties that arise on a march  in the winter and during the season of bad roads. Here is one  example from the experience of the Great Patriotic  War.[.sup]2[/]    On 6 November 1944, our troops, advancing from the area  of Kandalaksha, broke through the Nazi defenses on the northern  slopes of hills covering the Alakurti-Kuoloyarvi rail sector  (beyond the Arctic Circle), over which the enemy was withdrawing  his troops into northern Finland. During their retreat, the  Nazis blew up bridges and crossings, mined defiles, concentrated  the fire of their artillery against our forward subunits, and  made airstrikes against them. All this impeded the advance by  our troops and slowed down the rate of advance.    An artillery battalion consisting of two gun batteries  and one howitzer battery was supporting a pursuit detachment of  one of the rifle regiments advancing on this axis. Due to the  heavy enemy resistance in the area west of Alakurti Station, the  pursuit detachment and the artillery battalion were given the  mission to execute a flanking maneuver along the northern bank  of the Tenni-Ioki River, come out into the enemy's rear in the  vicinity of Kotala, and cut off his withdrawal route to the  west.    The artillery battalion had to execute the 100-km march  maneuver in five days in roadless conditions in the Arctic  tundra in the winter. About six hours were allotted to the  battalion to prepare for the march. However, it successfully  prepared for the upcoming march, since its personnel were well  trained and experienced in combat operations in the Arctic.    After receiving the mission, the artillery battalion  commander briefed all officers, thoroughly studied the route of  movement on the map, determined the location and order of  movement of the subunits as part of the pursuit detachment, and  established communications with the detachment commander.    On 13 November, the artillery battalion departed on the  planned route following the detachment. One rifle platoon was  assigned to each battery commander in the event of a surprise  encounter with the enemy. The artillery battalion commander  proceeded with the detachment commander at the head of his  column. A team of "navigators" was assigned from the artillery  battalion to ensure nonstop movement in the absence of  large-scale maps. The team's duties included: selecting lines of  march, marking the route, and setting up markers for bypassing  impassable sectors.    A team of sappers followed immediately behind the  "navigators." They cleared difficult sectors and helped  battery personnel pull the guns.    On ascents and descents of 40 degrees or more, the guns  were raised or lowered using pulley blocks. When crossing swampy  sectors, they were moved by hand. The guns were brought across  mountain rivers using steel cables and pulley blocks. Despite  all the difficulties of the march, the artillery battalion and  pursuit detachment reached the area of Kotala at the designated  time, where the withdrawal of enemy units was expected.    The rifle subunits immediately deployed into battle  formation with the front to the east, and the artillery  battalion prepared to open fire against enemy columns in case  they tried to pass through Kotala. The artillery battalion  commander moved the gun batteries up to positions for opening  direct fire.    The howitzer battery occupied an indirect-fire  position, ready to engage enemy columns on the approach to  Kotala.    The subunits of the detachment and artillery battalion  deployed into battle formation secretly to ensure surprise.  Special attention was given to reconnaissance of the approaches  to Kotala on the part of the enemy. Each gun crew was tasked to  organize a perimeter defense. As subsequent events showed, all  these measures were fully justified. The appearance of our  subunits, reinforced by artillery, deep in the enemy's rear was  totally unexpected for the enemy.    At 0500 hours 18 November, detachment security reported  the approach of a large enemy column (up to 3.5 km long). When  the head of the column approached to within point-blank range of  the line occupied by our subunits, it was met with organized  artillery and infantry fire. The column was defeated in a  brief engagement. Our subunits firmly held an important area in  the enemy's rear on the path of his withdrawal, which ensured  the successful advance by our main body. The guns that were  moved up for direct fire played the main role in defeating the  enemy.  Footnotes    1. Taktika artillerii v boyevykh primerakh, pp  50-52.    2. Ibid., pp 70-72.

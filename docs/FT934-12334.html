			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo The relationship between Volvo and Renault was originally conceived as an equal partnership, so the irritation of some of Volvo's small shareholders at getting a mere 35 per cent of the merged company is understandable. The intervening three years may have seen Volvo's position deteriorate, but the benefits of cost cutting and krona devaluation are just starting to show. Meanwhile, Renault is hurtling headlong into the continental car pile up. Volvo's management may argue that Renault's recent poor profit figures should not determine the shape of the merger, but at least part of Volvo's misfortune is equally short term. For all their ire, Volvo's small shareholders are unlikely to force better terms. This far, Volvo has had the better of the deal, since it has reaped Renault's economies of scale in car component sourcing. Nor, given the astronomical cost of model development, is it credible for Volvo to continue alone forever. The merger is Volvo's least bad alternative. Whether the expanded group can be made to work is, however, another question. Most of the planned cost savings would have been achieved without merger. Now they must be carried through at the same time as the organisations are combined and pruned. There is justified suspicion that deeper cuts and more rationalisation will follow if Renault-Volvo is to avoid dis-economies of scale. Handling that integration is a real management challenge, and the history of automotive mergers from British Leyland through Fiat Lancia to Peugeot Talbot can hardly encourage the newlyweds.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / More data points to stable spending Figures from Barclaycard seem to confirm the picture of consumers shrugging off last month's tax and National Insurance increases to resume a stable pattern of spending. The statistics reinforce the pattern apparently emerging of a return to consistent levels of spending following a slight dip immediately after people received the first monthly pay packets showing the greater deductions. On April 26 the amount processed by Barclaycard stood at 120 per cent of the amount processed on the equivalent day in 1993. The cumulative total for the period since then, comparing it with the equivalent number of days in 1993, dropped back to 106 per cent by May 6. Since then, however, the cumulative total for the period has remained steady at about 109 per cent as the period covered has extended to cover each of the past 10 or so days. The amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given day reflect spending in the day or so immediately before. While the percentage increase in turnover of about 9 per cent is greater than the 6 per cent to 8 per cent increase in weekly turnover which set the pattern after the tax increases were announced in the November Budget, it is still somewhat lower than the equivalent figures for last summer. Those suggested that expenditure using Barclaycard - which has the largest share of the UK credit-card market - was running at about 12 per cent higher than during the same months in 1992.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles on weak June jobs report Wall Street US SHARE prices tumbled across the board yesterday in the wake of a surprisingly weak June employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.57 at 3,483.97. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended 3.14 lower at 445.88, while the Amex composite finished down 0.60 at 435.27, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.88 at 704.47. Trading volume on the NYSE was relatively light ahead of the long holiday weekend and totalled 214m shares. Prices dropped from the opening, as investors registered their unhappiness with the June jobs data. Although the rise in the national unemployment rate, from 6.9 per cent to 7.0 per cent, had been expected, the meagre increase of 13,000 in non-farm payrolls - the key component of the report - was a big disappointment. Analysts had forecast that payrolls would rise between 100,000 and 150,000. Although the April and May payroll numbers were revised upwards, a fact which slightly blunted the negative impact of the June figures, the data provided further evidence that the US economy is growing extremely slowly, and that the condition of the labour market is far from healthy. At least Treasury prices drew strength from the jobs figures, with the benchmark 30-year bond rising by a quarter of a point to 105 15/16 , and the yield dropping to 6.66 per cent. The rise in bonds helped restrict the losses in equities, although the Dow took a relatively big hit as leading cyclicals stocks ran into early selling. Among the declining cyclicals, Aluminum Company of America slipped Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 , International Paper Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 64 1/2 , Caterpillar Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 and Georgia-Pacific Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 . Drug stocks were also under fire. Pfizer dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/8 , Merck fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 and Schering-Plough gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 67 3/8 . IBM dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in busy trading on reports that the company will take a Dollars 2bn charge in the second quarter to pay for workforce reductions. General Electric bucked the market trend, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 95 1/2 after the company predicted record earnings for the second quarter, and said that it would be taking a charge to cover accounting changes. TJX tumbled Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 in volume of 1.9m shares after broking house First Manhattan downgraded the retail group's stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Canada TORONTO closed firmer in moderate trading, as gold stocks soared in response to the surge in world gold prices. According to preliminary figures, the composite index closed at 3,997.72, up 31.35 points, or 0.79%, from Wednesday's close. The market was closed on Thursday for Canada Day. The index's overall gain for the holiday-shortened week was about 6 points. Volume was 62.9m shares, down from Wednesday's 78.6m.</p>

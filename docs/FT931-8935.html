			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Relatives to claim on income plans RELATIVES of the victims of home income plans will be allowed to continue to claim compensation even after the death of a victim, the High Court ruled yesterday. Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to elderly people as a way of releasing income from their homes. The schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. The value of these bonds fell as the stock market performed poorly and mortgage rates rose. Elderly people were pushed into debt and, as house prices fell, some lost their homes. In cases where the risks of the schemes were not explained victims can receive compensation from the Investors Compensation Scheme to a maximum of Pounds 48,000. Barnett Sampson, solicitors, which represents 450 home income plan cases, sought a judicial review of the ICS's stipulation that a claim ceased when the victim died. The High Court ruled yesterday that the 'personal representative' of a deceased person can bring or continue a claim on their behalf. But the Court ruled against the claimants on other points. Barnett Sampson argued that the ICS should not deduct from compensation any money claimants spent in the mistaken belief they were spending profit on investment rather than capital - a couple might not have spent money on a holiday if they had known it would be eating into their capital.</p>

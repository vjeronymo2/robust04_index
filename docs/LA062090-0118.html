			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CABLE TV, NBC HOLD TALKS ON SATELLITE PLAN;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE PRINCIPALS ARE HUDDLING OVER THE CONGRESSIONAL FATE OF THE SKY  CABLE PROJECT.  </P> <P> The cable television industry and NBC are engaged in last-minute,  behind-the-scenes maneuvering to affect congressional action on a bill that  could help determine the success or failure of the $1.3-billion Sky Cable  project.  </P> <P> Sky Cable is a joint venture among NBC, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Hughes  Communications Inc. and Cablevision Systems Corp. It seeks to launch a  108-channel, satellite-based direct broadcast system in the United States by  1993 and thus take a commanding position in the next generation of television.  </P> <P> NBC and News Corp. would contribute their programming expertise -- News Corp.  owns the Fox television network and 20th Century Fox movie studio -- while  Hughes would provide the satellite technology. Cablevision, one of the largest  owners of local cable systems in the country, is also a partner with NBC in  various cable TV networks. Viewers would receive the programs through small  antennae about the size of a dinner plate.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would toughen  regulation of the cable TV industry. Among the elements in the bill that the  cable industry opposes is a provision barring cable program services, such as  HBO and ESPN, from being sold only to local cable TV systems.  </P> <P> Such a provision is a victory for NBC, which lobbied heavily for the bill to  require cable programmers to sell to competitors, including DBS systems such as  Sky Cable. NBC believes that local cable systems are seeking to keep popular  cable program services off Sky Cable and other potential satellite networks.  </P> <P> In the latest maneuvering, Tele-Communications Inc. Chief Executive John C.  Malone sent a letter Monday to NBC President Robert C. Wright requesting that  the network negotiate with TCI to allow it to carry NBC programming on some of  TCI's local cable systems where NBC currently does not have an affiliate.  </P> <P> Malone said it was TCI's goal to increase the amount of local news and sports  programming in markets not served by NBC affiliates and sought to affiliate  some of its rural cable systems with the network. The idea is highly unusual,  and NBC is expected to turn down the request because it would strain relations  with affiliates, who already suspect that the network is looking for  alternatives to distribute its programming.  </P> <P> But if NBC declines to negotiate with TCI, then many in the industry expect TCI  to use the issue in its lobbying efforts, pointing up the contradiction that  NBC wants exclusive agreements with its affiliates but not between cable  programmers and local system operators.  </P> <P> Local cable systems, the majority of which are owned or affiliated with large  "multiple system operators" such as TCI or Time Warner's American Telephone  &amp; Communications, are opposed to the measure because they fear that  satellite systems could replace cable as the country's leading purveyor of  television programs. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes  indicated last week that he might favor non-exclusive deals for small  competitors to cable, but not for the "Generals -- General Electric or General  Motors." (GM owns Hughes Communications.)  </P> <P> Both NBC President Robert C. Wright and News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert  Murdoch have recently lobbied lawmakers in Washington about the new cable  reregulation bill. Next week the bill moves to the House telecommunications  subcommittee for approval.  </P> <P> Robert Thompson, vice president of government relations for TCI, said the  company has long been looking for ways to finance "hometown TV" in cities and  towns where there are no local network affiliates. He said TCI's plan would use  the revenues it generated from local advertising sales on the NBC channel to  support a local news operation.  </P> <P> NBC was sent the letter, Thompson said, because it is the No. 1 ranked network,  but he acknowledged that other issues were involved as well. "NBC has ratings  which are 10 times in excess of the most popular cable network, but for timing  purposes this is probably as good a time as any since they have indicated they  are soft on the exclusivity issue."  </P></p>

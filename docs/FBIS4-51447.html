			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Fang </F> Jin (2455 3866)]    [Text] Waves of laughter drifted from the  chandelier-lighted Bafangyuan building of the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse in Beijing tonight when Vice Premier Qian Qichen  threw a party to entertain the third batch of advisers on Hong  Kong affairs and newly appointed members of the Preliminary  Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [SAR].    At the party, Qian Qichen proposed a toast wishing a smooth  transition for Hong Kong will have a smooth transition and  long-term prosperity and stability in the future, which was  warmly echoed by the guests.    Qian Qichen said that he was very pleased to see so many new  and old friends joining the ranks and files of advisers on Hong  Kong affairs and members of the Preliminary Working Committee  for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR. He said:  Only three years remain until Hong Kong makes its transition.  Generally speaking, the current situation in Hong Kong is  fairly good. This can mainly be attributed to the reform and  opening as well as to the sustained and stable economic  development on the mainland which enables Hong Kong to maintain  a strong momentum for its economic growth. What is especially  encouraging is the fact that as 1 July 1997 is approaching, more  and more Hong Kong residents are conscientiously joining the  contingent of people who want to maintain Hong Kong's stability  and prosperity and promote a smooth transition by Hong Kong.  With a great sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, they pay  attention to and participate in affairs relating to the  organization of the Hong Kong SAR and the realization of a  smooth transition in Hong Kong. This is a sense of  responsibility and participation becoming to the masters of Hong  Kong. This is also a prelude to the successful realization of  the goal that "Hong Kong be governed by Hong Kong residents."    While talking about the cooperation between China and  Britain, Qian Qichen said: Although the Sino-British  negotiations on the Hong Kong elections in 1994 and 1995 broke  down, we still hope to maintain cooperation with the British  side in other respects. However, cooperation is bilateral. We  can not mainly entrust our hopes for a smooth transition of Hong  Kong and its long-term stability and prosperity on cooperation  by Britain. More importantly, it is necessary to  conscientiously carry out a series of correct principles and  policies of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong, whose  future is guaranteed by the Basic Law. We should depend on the  active participation of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents  and the support of people across the country. As long as we  base our tasks on a foundation like this one, we will be  completely able to resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong on  schedule and to achieve the goal of a stable transition in Hong  Kong.    Attending the banquet were Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei, Lu Ping,  Zhou  Nan, and other leading cadres.</p>

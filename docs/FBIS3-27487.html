			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Mainland China Plans </F> to Open Its Gold Market to the Outside World"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 16 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--When  Shanghai and Guangzhou actively seek central government approval  for setting up gold exchanges, the relevant department in China  plans to offer tenders to foreign firms for exploring gold mines  in various areas on the mainland. According to information that  we have received, Beijing has already established a special  office to oversee the organization and coordination of importing  overseas funds and technology to develop gold resources. As of  this moment, more than 10 companies from the countries and  regions such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, and  Australia have expressed interest.    In recent years, along with the improvement in the people's  living standard, more and more people have begun to pay  attention to fashion and appearance, so gold jewelry has become  popular in various areas on the mainland. Shanghai has many  gold jewelry shops and has become an important gold market; like  Guangzhou and Shenzhen, it has already proposed the  establishment of a standardized gold exchange. In the 1930's,  Shanghai was the largest gold trading center in the Far East,  and its transaction volume ranked it third in the world, just  behind London and New York. After the 1950's, for various  reasons, Shanghai's gold market ceased operating, but since  1982, when the mainland restored internal sales of gold jewelry,  the number of gold jewelry shops in Shanghai rose to over 250.  In 1992, Shanghai sold 15 tonnes of gold jewelry, and the money  involved was about 1.7 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over  1991; in the first half of 1993, it sold 14.5 tonnes of gold  jewelry (the volume of sales in the whole country was 250  tonnes), and the money involved was 1.87 billion yuan, ranking  Shanghai first in the country in terms of sales volume and  making it the largest gold market in China.    For the past four decades, however, gold production  activities and operations in China has always been under  centralized state control, and the People's Bank of China has  set the buying and selling prices of gold and has monopolized  purchase activities and operations. Judging from the year of  the lowest purchase price of gold on the mainland in the past  decade, the price was less than 50 percent of the gold price in  the international community, but the bank's selling price was  30-40 percent higher than the international gold price. The  distorted gold price on the mainland has led to an increase in  the industrial production cost of gold, as well as a decrease in  returns; thus, gold mines and factories have lost money year  after year and the problems of gold smuggling and the drain on  gold resources have become quite serious. Because the black  market price of gold is 120-140 yuan per gram, the amount of  gold smuggled in accounts for two-thirds of the nongovernmental  output of gold in the whole country, whereas the gold purchased  by the state accounts for less than one-third of the output in  the nongovernmental sector.    For example, in the first half of 1993, due to the state's  low purchasing price for gold as well as the effect of black  market gold transactions, the state's purchased volume of gold  dropped sharply, representing a 57 percent decrease from the  same period in 1992.    In order to revitalize the gold market on the mainland, last  August the People's Bank of China once again announced an  adjustment of the purchase price for gold, basing it on the  price of gold in London. Customers may use yuan, which is  calculated according to the exchange rate at the foreign  exchange swap center at any specific moment, to pay for gold  jewelry. At the same time, the purchase price of gold was  increased from 54 yuan per gram to 96 yuan per gram; the  corresponding dealer price of gold was increased to 107.68 yuan  per gram, and it was made clear that the price would be flexibly  adjusted in the future according to changes in the international  price of gold and the exchange rate of the yuan. As a result,  the gold output volume in the second half of the year rebounded,  and annual output increased 7.5 percent over that of 1992.    China has not officially announced its gold output, which  has  only been revealed by newspapers and magazines. Over the past  14 years, output has increased five times, among which the gold  excavation volume in the nongovernmental sector was 400,000  liang [one liang equals 50 grams] last year. People believe that  the output of state-run gold mines should exceed this number.  At present, the government's gold reserve is 400 tonnes, and  the gold volume in the nongovernmental sector also comes close  to 400 tonnes; thus, it suffices to form a gold market with some  scale. According to information we have received, in recent  years, the southern parts of Shandong Peninsula have discovered  26 gold mines, which have commercial exploration potential. If  advanced technology can be brought in from the United States,  Canada, and South Africa, gold production on the mainland has  great prospects. Guangzhou and Shanghai are fighting for the  establishment of gold exchanges, to carry out gold futures  trading, and this will promote convergence of the mainland's  gold market with the international gold market, so that  gradually the gold price will be commercialized, and the market  will be internationalized.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Redress for a grievance - How some employees gained access to pension funds As the Goode Committee continues its review of pensions law in the light of the Robert Maxwell affair, the ability of pension fund members to pursue their grievances through the courts received a considerable boost last week. The High Court confirmed an order giving members of two funds run by Melton Medes, an unquoted Nottingham-based conglomerate, the right to use pension fund monies to pay their legal costs so as to enable them to continue their action against the pension funds' trustees, Mr Nathu Ram Puri, the Melton Medes chairman, and Mr James Philpotts, its chief executive. This is the first time such an order has been made by the courts. It provides a very important means of safeguarding the rights of the members of pension funds that are controlled by their employers, according to Mr Sean Hand, a partner of the solicitors acting for the pension fund members, Dibb Lupton Broomhead. Allowing pension fund members to use the fund to finance legal action against the trustees 'could go a long way to meeting the greatest inadequacy of current pension scheme regulation, namely, the inability of beneficiaries to obtain redress for their grievances', he says. Company law went through a similar process over the right of minority shareholders to be indemnified by the company against the costs of any legal action brought on its behalf, he says. That right was enshrined in statute law by the 1980 Companies Act. 'Maybe it is time that pension fund members were given a similar statutory right to be indemnified by their funds. The Goode Committee should take note,' he adds. The Melton Medes saga began in 1986 when Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough), two paper mills previously owned by the Imperial Group, were sold to a subsidiary of Melton Medes. Shortly after the sale went through, the new trustees of the funds, Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts, sanctioned a Pounds 4m loan from the two funds to the parent company at an interest rate of only 2 per cent. The loan was secured by a second charge on freehold properties of the Robert Fletcher mills which had already been charged to Lloyd's Bank. When employees discovered that pension fund money had been used to finance an inadequately secured loan to Melton Medes at an uncommercial rate of interest, they became very concerned about possible losses to the fund. But their concern turned to alarm when the loan was repaid, not in cash, but in a transfer of shares from Melton Medes in two small quoted companies, Delaney Group and Marling Industries, in which Mr Puri's companies had large stakes. Indeed, Mr Puri was chairman of and had a controlling interest in Delaney. Since the transfer, the shares in both companies have plummeted by more than half. In March 1992, the plaintiffs, seven members of the pension funds, decided to sue for breach of trust both in relation to the Pounds 4m loan and the transfer of the shares. The launch of the main action was followed four months later by a second action seeking disclosure of certain documents to the plaintiffs as beneficiaries of the funds, the appointment of judicial trustees, and an order to prevent further dissipation of the funds, pending the hearing of the main action. Both actions were originally funded by the plaintiffs' union, the Graphical Paper and Media Union (GPMU). But when it became apparent that the costs of a long, drawn-out court battle would be too great to expect other members of the union to fund, the GPMU withdrew. In January this year the plaintiffs applied to Mr Justice Vinelott for an order that the costs of the actions should be paid out of the pension funds, at least until the defendants had handed over the documents requested and they had had time to inspect them. Mr Justice Vinelott was originally against granting such an order on the basis that it might be possible for the two sides to reach a compromise on the appointment of new trustees who could then take up the members' grievances. In March, however, the position was further complicated by the launch of a parallel action against Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts by the Securities and Investments Board, alleging breach of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation's rules in relation to the original Pounds 4m loan. Negotiation between the two sides failed. Mr Justice Vinelott confirmed in a judgment given last week that he would grant the plaintiffs the pre-emptive costs order and appoint Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Ipe Jacob, partners in accountants Robson Rhodes, as judicial trustees of the funds. The judge said that what the plaintiffs were seeking was an order that as representative beneficiaries, they should be entitled to pursue the claims on behalf of the trust estate and be entitled to the same order to which they would have been entitled if they had been trustees acting with the authority of the court. There is clear authority, he said, for the courts to allow trustees who wish to protect themselves from possible personal liability for the costs of prosecuting or defending proceedings to fund those proceedings at the expense of their trust funds. Mr Justice Vinelott then drew a distinction between conventional trust funds and pension funds. 'In the case of a pension fund, unlike a conventional trust fund, the beneficiaries have themselves contributed both in cash and in service to the employer,' he said. 'They are entitled to be satisfied that the trust fund to which they have contributed is administered in a way which reflects their legitimate expectations by trustees in which they have full confidence.' This is a new and very important statement of the law, according to Mr Hand. 'It appears to be heading towards saying pension fund trustees must be accountable to their beneficiaries,' he said. The judge then went on to say that he intended to grant the plaintiff's application for the appointment of judicial trustees because it was unjust in the context of a pension fund, that the administration of funds to which members had contributed and which required the continual exercise of discretion, 'should be left in the hands of persons in whose fairness and probity the beneficiaries no longer have confidence'. The uniqueness of this decision lies not so much in the costs order itself, says Mr Hand, but in the mechanism the judge used to resolve the problem - combining the granting of the costs order with the appointment of judicial trustees. In a conventional trust, this type of order would be impossible, he adds. The court would never remove existing trustees and substitute judicial trustees until the substantive case had been argued. But the judge made it clear that different principles should apply in the case of pension funds. Mr Hand said the main action could now go ahead.</p>

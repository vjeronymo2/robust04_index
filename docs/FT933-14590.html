			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Italy to contain budget deficit with spending cuts THE Ciampi government intends to hold down the 1994 budget deficit to L150,000bn (Pounds 64.4bn) through swingeing spending cuts and only limited extra revenue from taxes. The combined effect of these measures will be to save L32,000bn on previous projections. Officials involved in the preparation of the budget estimate that without this, the rise in the public sector deficit would push the figure beyond L180,000bn. As much as two-thirds of the L32,000bn will come from spending cuts, affecting both current expenditure and investment. The 1993 budget was obliged to find L93,000bn to hold the deficit to L145,000bn - L150,000bn, but the emphasis then was on a bigger tax take, while spending tended to be frozen rather than cut. In contrast, officials involved in the preparation of the 1994 budget say fiscal pressure will be lowered 1.4 per cent next year. With the public unhappy at having to pay out unprecedented quantities of money this year in various taxes, a further tightening of the fiscal net risks being unproductive. As a result, the emphasis will be on improving the efficiency of tax collection and simplifying the way in which taxes are paid. On top of an across-the-board cut of 3 per cent in each ministry's spending, the government is looking at the health, welfare and education budgets for additional savings. Considerable savings can be achieved through a freeze on job creation especially in teaching where the education ministry has continued to recruit extra teachers despite a stagnant population. In health, reforms introduced in the 1993 budget are only just being felt and the ministry's L100,000bn budget has overrun by L14,000bn. Yesterday, one of Italy's research institutes claimed there were at least L11,000bn worth of unproductive expenditure in the health budget. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister and former Bank of Italy governor, will explain the budget to parliament on Thursday. It is the first time in the post-war era that a budget for the coming year has been prepared so quickly. Normally, the budget is not presented until close to the obligatory cut-off date of September 30. But the current plan was outlined by Mr Giuliano Amato, the previous prime minister, and pursued by Mr Ciampi to underline Italy's commitment both to tackle the country's budget deficit, which has reached over 10.5 per cent of GDP, and begin to cut the level of debt, equivalent to nearly 110 per cent of GDP. The macro-economic projections for the next three years showed 1994 growth of 1.6 per cent rising to 2.5 per cent by 1996.</p>

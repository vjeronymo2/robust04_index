			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Ski resort bristles with Serb menace: Laura Silber visits a Bosnian stronghold THE people of Pale in Bosnia can tell you how Serbs and Moslems lived alongside each other in peace before war began in April last year. They remember those times, but now they speak the language of war - of military victory and of their contempt for their Moslem adversaries. Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold just 10 miles above the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, was once a prosperous ski resort, hosting the 1984 Winter Olympics. Now it is overrun with soldiers and refugees, and is the makeshift headquarters of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state. Every home is surrounded by stacks of wood in preparation for the harsh Bosnian winter, as townspeople tend their gardens. Flocks of sheep wander through the village streets crowded with men in khaki uniforms. Serb artillery guns are positioned just outside the town nestled in picturesque mountain peaks dotted with wooden chalets and fields filled with livestock. 'The only solution is to defeat the Moslems militarily,' said 40-year-old Mrs Biljana Rajic, a hairdresser, showing no trace of regret as she speaks of her former countrymen. Many of the townspeople show impatience and contempt for their Moslem adversaries. They blame the Moslems for the 18 months of destruction and war. They name Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, as the main obstacle to peace. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Marko Subotic, remained defiant: 'We are not going to make new territorial concessions that Izetbegovic is seeking. He is only trying to stop the peace process by demanding access to the Adriatic or more land.' Some accuse Mr Izetbegovic of orchestrating revenge against their new Serb state. Mr Ljubomir Klacar, a 59-year-old labourer, said: 'They want access to the sea only to smuggle in weapons.' Serb nationalists in Pale yesterday warned that the Moslems faced total military defeat if they rejected the proposed tri-partite division of Bosnia into ethnic mini-states. Mr Izetbegovic, they said, would have to endorse the plan put forward by international mediators or lose everything. Mr Bozidar Kostovic, a former trade clerk turned fighter, said: 'Serbs have already ceded 20 per cent (of Bosnia). The Moslems hold 10 per cent but are refusing to agree to the plan which gives them 30 per cent.' 'A solution will be reached only when the Moslems lose what they hold now. Then they will talk.' Even after the cancellation of yesterday's meeting in Sarajevo to sign an agreement on Bosnia's division, Mr Slavisa Rakovic, senior adviser to the Bosnian Serb state, remained optimistic the plan would soon be endorsed. Although he admitted the partition might unleash a further exodus of refugees, Mr Rakovic said: 'If there is a successful settlement here, I don't see any possibility of the war spreading.' Although he called Mr Izetbegovic the main 'loser', he dismissed Bosnian objections that, under the peace plan, their landlocked republic would be doomed, wedged between hostile Serb and Croat states.</p>

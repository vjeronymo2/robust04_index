			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Nationalists lead in Scottish poll The Scottish National party is narrowly ahead of Labour in Monklands East, scene of the by-election to choose a successor to John Smith, according to an opinion poll published by the Scottish Daily Express yesterday. Defeat on June 30 would be a blow for Labour, but the party dismissed the poll, saying that the sample size of 401 was too small to be reliable. The poll, by Market Research Scotland, put the SNP at 42 per cent, Labour at 38.7 per cent, the Conservatives at 2.2 per cent, the Liberal Democrats at 1.2 per cent and others at 1.5 per cent. At the general election Labour gained 61.2 per cent of the vote, the SNP 18 per cent, the Conservatives 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 4.6 per cent. Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader said: 'The poll confirms what we are finding on the doorsteps. There is a mood of change in Monklands East and this by-election is now a tight two-horse race.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, described it as a 'Mickey Mouse poll which ought to be believed only by Donald Ducks'.</p>

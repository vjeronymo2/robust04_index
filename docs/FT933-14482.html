			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The value of clean water PURER DRINKING water, cleaner rivers and less polluted beaches have clear attractions. But what is the price of delivering them? Too high, according to Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the economic regulator of Britain's water industry. Meeting European Community environmental commitments agreed by the government since the industry was privatised in 1989 will lead to an extra Pounds 1.5bn a year in capital investment over the next five years, on top of the Pounds 3.5bn currently being spent. Additional commitments under discussion could increase the cost by a further Pounds 1bn a year. For the average customer, the full programme would mean an extra Pounds 54 a year on bills between 1995 and the end of the century. Customers would not be prepared to put up with such increases, thinks Mr Byatt. The government should therefore renegotiate EC directives on sewage treatment and drinking water quality. Mr Byatt's argument has been challenged by the National Rivers Authority, the industry's environmental regulator. It says Britain's water charges are low by comparison with the rest of Europe, bills would not need to rise by as much as Ofwat suggests because of the scope for efficiency improvements and customers would be willing to pay for better standards. It is difficult to know for certain how much customers would be prepared to pay for higher quality in an industry where they have no opportunity to shop around. But the bulk of the evidence suggests that too much attention has been paid to standards and not enough to costs. Customer surveys show that in most parts of the country there is limited willingness to pay much more for additional improvements. Moreover, a raft of complaints to Ofwat and politicians about the cost of current bills suggests there would be stiff resistance to higher charges. Nor is there much evidence that better standards would improve public health. Mr Byatt argues that the new sewage measures would mean that a town with a population of 10,000 produced the pollution equivalent to 27 pigs, while the drinking water provisions would result in pollution equivalent to one aspirin in an Olympic-size swimming pool. Pointing out that these are EC standards to which Britain is already commited, as the NRA does, is not a sufficient counter-argument. The huge sums involved mean this is a sufficiently important issue for EC governments to re-think the regulations. Moreover, given the current stress on subsidiarity, this surely is an example of regulation which should be dealt with at the national level. Mr Byatt yesterday asked the government to make its mind up whether it wants higher standards or higher prices. This puts ministers in a tight corner. If standards are relaxed, they will be lambasted by the green lobby; if they are maintained, customers may complain. Ofwat has made an impressive case. It demands a political response.</p>

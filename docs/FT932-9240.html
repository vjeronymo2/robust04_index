			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mystery bidder gets in contact with HunterPrint HUNTERPRINT, the specialist printer, revealed yesterday that it had been contacted by an unidentified potential bidder for the group. The sharp rise in the share price this week prompted the board to issue a statement yesterday and bring forward the announcement of HunterPrint's interim results by a week. In the statement Mr Jeoff Samson, chairman, said the company had been contacted by third parties, but that the contacts were at a preliminary stage and 'may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company.' HunterPrint's share price had risen from 64p at the end of last week to 75p at the close on Wednesday. It gained another 5p yesterday to close at 80p, valuing the group at Pounds 46.3m. Mr Samson, who together with Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, pushed through a refinancing package including a Pounds 20m rights issue late last year, said the board had been advised to make the statement following the share price increase. For the six months to end-March HunterPrint showed a turnround in profitability following the restructuring. The group returned profits of Pounds 330,000 pre-tax compared with a Pounds 3.85m loss in the year-ago period. Sales fell by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 28.8m) reflecting the continuing difficult trading conditions in the group's sector of the printing industry. Nevertheless, a Pounds 2.3m loss on ordinary activities before interest was turned into a Pounds 909,000 profit in the latest six months and net interest charges fell from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 579,000 reflecting the improved state of the balance sheet following the refinancing and rescue rights issue  - HunterPrint's second in two years. The first involved Sir Ian MacGregor, who was ousted as chairman in August. Mr Samson said the greater financial stability and strength had enabled the group to increase its customer base and generate additional orders from existing clients. Contract orders at the group's Corby printing site now account for 50 per cent of the workload compared with 39 per cent 12 months ago. However, Mr Samson said the markets served by the Corby site  - newspapers, publishing and direct mail  - showed no signs that 1993 would produce better prices. The spot market remained very competitive and margins on spot work continued to be under pressure. Similarly, the Hardy Business Forms subsidiary continued to experience difficult market conditions, but managed to return to 'modest' profitability in the first half.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  affirmed that Israel should return the occupied Arab land in  return for a just, lasting peace. Israel should also  acknowledge the legitimate Palestinian rights and abide by the  UN Security Council Resolution 242 based on the principles of  land for peace and justice for peace, Musa added.    Musa said the return of the Arab land, the solution of  regional problems, and the end of the Israeli occupation of the  West Bank and Gaza would produce a new situation with Israel.    In a statement delivered before the Consultative Council's  session led by Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi today, Musa stressed the  need to implement all the provisions of Resolution 242 for the  sake of reaching a peaceful settlement based on the  land-for-peace principle. This would also mean land and justice  in return for peace, he added.    Musa pointed out that when this happens, we will discuss the  economic situation, such as the Middle East market or economic  cooperation. He said that Israel's place in this market depends  upon the return of the Arabs' legitimate rights.    In his statement, the foreign minister said there can be no  Arab solidarity without Egypt. He added: We always consult  with the Arab brothers when we adopt any political stance. Musa  noted: We always propose policies but we impose policies on no  one. We must hold consultations before adopting any fateful  decision, stressing that Egypt's role is known and valued.    The foreign minister said he will raise the issue of  pan-Arab  security at the Arab League ministerial council meeting on  Saturday. He said Arab positions still diverge and there are  serious threats from inside and outside the Arab world. He  pointed out that Egypt is trying to ensure comprehensive  pan-Arab security.    In his statement to the Consultative Council, the foreign  minister said that the concept of pan-Arab security needs  redrafting to be in line with the projected international  changes. He said the concept of pan-Arab security must be  broader than simply a bloc against any external aggression. He  noted that the overall view of this issue must be wider and  comprehensive.    'Amr Musa stressed that solidarity, cooperation, and accord  represent the pillars of this security. It can never be  established on enmity, Musa added. He highlighted President  Mubarak's efforts to contain Libya's crisis with the West and  end the events in Yemen and Somalia.    Commenting on the obstacles facing the creation of pan-Arab  security, Musa said the biggest obstacle lies within the Arab  system. He noted that foreign forces are impeding the return of  Arab solidarity. He said that only Arab strength can overcome  such obstacles.    Musa affirmed that Egypt does not accept the separation of  north Sudan from the south. We can never accept that; this is a  clear pan-Arab stance, he said.    Touching on relations with Iraq, Musa said: We differed with  Iraq because of its violation of international, regional, and  Arab rules and its aggression against Kuwait. The situation can  only be rectified by returning to basics. Iraq must accept  Kuwait's independence and respect its sovereignty instead of  viewing it as the 19th governorate.    Musa pointed out that Iraq's conduct distorted the  collective  Arab system and created an Arab and international problem, from  which we are still suffering. We must agree upon a cure on a  clear-cut basis. The starting point should be Iraq's acceptance  of Kuwait's independence and sovereignty and implementation of  the UN Security Council resolutions, he stressed.    Proceeding to relations with Iran, Minister Musa affirmed  that Iran is a fraternal non-Arab state the policy of which we  disagree with on particular details. Iran is a Middle Eastern  state that has borders with Arab countries. Discussing the  regional situation requires talking to Iran as much as it  requires talking with Egypt. But it is not part of Arab security  or the Arab situation.    Touching on the Turkish position, the foreign minister  pointed out that Turkey's position is different from Iran's,  because ties with Turkey are good. The Turkish policy and  conduct are linked with its cooperation, friendship, and  relations with the Arab world, he said, adding: We cannot place  Turkey on the same footing with other states that have problems  with the Arab world.    The foreign minister reiterated that the Arab League's role  can't be ignored or excluded, even if we find fault with its  conduct. The Arab League is a mirror reflecting the Arab  situation, he remarked, and its role is to discuss the actual  situation. We officially asked the League to discuss the issue  of pan-Arab security and an important study has been prepared in  this connection, he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS FALL TO RIVERSIDE IN LAST BID FOR PLAYOFFS, 68-62  </P> <P> When the season began, no one really figured that Cal State Dominguez Hills,  with three freshmen starters, would be battling for a playoff spot in its final  game.  </P> <P> So it was an accomplishment for the 10-17 Toros to take the floor Saturday  night, needing a victory and a little help up the road at Cal State Los Angeles  to advance to post-season play in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills got the help it needed: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo defeated L.A.,  86-68. But the Toros forgot to take care of things on their court, stumbling  against senior-laden UC Riverside, 68-62.  </P> <P> The Toros finished 6-8 and in sixth place in the CCAA. Bakersfield, Riverside,  San Luis Obispo and L.A. advance to the conference tournament next weekend in  Bakersfield.  </P> <P> The Toros simply waited too long to make a run, and when they finally did, a  questionable charging call against guard Robert Barksdale with 1:15 left  nullified a basket that would have cut Riverside's lead to five points.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills took a 10-4 lead with 14:49 left in the first half, but from  there it was all Riverside. In the next 11 minutes, the Highlanders outscored  the Toros, 26-10.  </P> <P> Chris Ceballos, who had 20 points for the game, spurred the Riverside burst.  </P> <P> Perhaps the Toros had weak legs after Friday night's physical 72-65 victory  over Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Riverside opened a 46-35 lead with 14 minutes remaining, but Dominguez Hills,  thanks to four free throws by freshman guard Raymond Bennett, cut it to 48-43  with 10:48.  </P> <P> Senior guard Reggie Howard put the game solidly in the Highlanders' favor. With  9:45 to go he put Riverside up, 50-43 with a basket, then extended the lead to  10 points on a three-point basket at the 8:57 mark. A minute and a half later  he dished off to guard Marcellus Smith for a lay-in and a 55-43 lead.  </P></p>

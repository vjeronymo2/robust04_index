			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sandoz in Dollars 300m deal with US research body SANDOZ, the Swiss pharmaceutical and chemicals group, is to contribute at least Dollars 300m to Scripps Research Institute of the US over the next 14 years as part of a basic research alliance. In return, Sandoz is to receive first rights to develop medical discoveries of Scripps, a non-profit institute based in California which specialises in immunology, nervous system disorders and cardiovascular research. The deal reflects a continuing shift in Sandoz's research strategy from concentration in internal laboratories in Basle to external alliances. Last year, Sandoz committed itself to spending up to Dollars 100m over 10 years in oncology research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and invested Dollars 392m in a 60 per cent stake in SyStemix, a Californian biotechnology company. Sandoz will begin contributing to Scripps Research Institute gradually, as joint research projects are agreed over the next four years. Mr Marc Moret, chairman of Sandoz, said the agreement would enable Sandoz to lift basic research capability by about a quarter.</p>

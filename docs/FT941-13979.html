			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Selective Assets beats benchmark Selective Assets Trust, managed by Ivory &amp; Sime to seek long-term capital growth, lifted its net asset value per share by 31 per cent, from 155.95p to 203.76p, over the 1993 year. The FT-SE-A All-Share Index, the trust's benchmark, improved 23.3 per cent over the same period. Mr Gordon Neilly, a director at I&amp;S, attributed the performance to the trust's exposure to Asian and other emerging markets, and smaller capitalisation growth stocks in North American and the UK. Net revenue improved to Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 805,000), equivalent to earnings of 3.72p (2.78p). The single distribution for the year goes up from 1.2p to 1.45p.</p>

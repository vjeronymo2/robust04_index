			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Drug sector asked for costs data The government is asking the pharmaceuticals industry to publish cost comparisons of different medicines and other treatments such as operations. This means that doctors can take economic factors into account when prescribing. The intention is to study the 'long-term cost consequences of treatments for the same condition,' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said yesterday. Guidelines on how the work should be conducted are published this morning by the health department. 'This is a voluntary approach,' said Mrs Bottomley. 'Drugs companies will do the work, and there will be pressure from (drugs) purchasers and prescribers for this information.' The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry was involved in the joint working party with the government which drew up the guidelines. Dr John Griffin, the ABPI's director, said the studies 'will offer NHS purchasers and prescribers recognised high quality information about the cost effectiveness of medicines'. The initiative is in line with developments in some other countries. In the US, such economic assessments have become part of the drug industry's marketing armoury. In Australia, drugs companies are required to submit an economic analysis to healthcare regulators alongside the clinical trials results. Mrs Bottomley said that no decision had yet been taken about whether today's guidelines would eventually be policed by the Medicines Control Agency, as is the case with clinical trials results. The ABPI said it would be opposed to the introduction of such an economic 'hurdle' to the existing drugs regulatory processes. The guidelines go further than the Australian rules by the possibility of including the effect on wider society. Would, for example, spending on sick pay be cut by the use of better - if costlier - medicines that helped patients recover more quickly? Mr Adrian Towse, director of the drugs-industry financed Office of Health Economics, said that the guidelines would come into effect immediately. Under the guidelines 'any doctor will be able to demand the full (economic) study from a pharmaceuticals company making a claim about the cost-effectiveness of one of its products,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Newspapers are insisting there are still many holes  in the investigation into Luis Donaldo Colosio's slaying. It  has been said that two men may have killed Colosio. The bullets  that killed PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been fired by two  attackers, Mario Aburto Martinez and Jose Antonio Sanchez  Ortega, because paraffin tests conducted on both men turned out  positive. Tijuana Judicial Police Commander Jorge Alvarez  Barrieri made this announcement.    However, the Attorney General's Office has stated that Mario  Aburto Martinez is the only assassin and that he has confessed  to firing two shots. The press also reported that 17 people at  one time or another had owned the gun with which Colosio was  killed on the tragic evening of 23 March in Tijuana, Baja  California.    There has also been speculation about statements made by  Mario Aburto Martinez after he was arrested following Colosio's  killing. According to Jose Luis Perez Canchola, Baja California  human rights ombudsman who was present during the questioning,  it is very unlikely the killer acted alone. It was also said  that Mario Aburto Martinez is refusing to answer questions  concerning which armed groups he may have belonged to, or  whether he acted alone or whether the attack was part of a  conspiracy.    I must remind listeners that these are not official  statements by the Attorney General's Office. I am just  reporting what has been said aside from official statements from  the Attorney General's Office.    It has been reported that Mario Aburto Martinez said in his  deposition that he purchased the .38-caliber gun in California  to injure Luis Donaldo Colosio, to attract the media's  attention, and to explain his pacifist ideas before the national  and international press, as well as to disclose information he  has on armed groups in different areas of Mexico. None of the  aforementioned statements is official.    It was also mentioned that Mario Aburto Martinez may have  belonged to a political group. His girlfriend said he spent  four weeks in Chiapas. It was also confirmed that he was  influenced by the sect known as the Jehovah's Witnesses. It has  also been learned that residents of Zamora, Michoacan, have been  angered by this situation, because Zamora, Michoacan, is the  hometown of Mario Aburto Martinez, who has confessed to having  fired on and killing Luis Donaldo Colosio.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Reagan and Bush 'knew of Iran-Contra plot' An independent investigation into the Iran-Contra conspiracy says former President Ronald Reagan 'set the stage' for illegal activities but 'found no credible evidence' that he violated any criminal statute. Mr Lawrence Walsh, the special counsel appointed to examine the Iran-Contra affair, said in his final report that Mr Reagan had 'knowingly participated or at least acquiesced in' a cover-up after the conspiracy came to light. Iran-Contra, the worst scandal of the Reagan presidency, was a plot led by Colonel Oliver North, a member of the White House National Security Council staff, to sell arms to Iran in an attempt to bring Iranian influence to bear on the terrorist groups holding US hostages in Lebanon. At the same time the scheme diverted money to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in defiance of a congressional ban on such aid. Mr Walsh said former President George Bush, while he was Mr Reagan's vice-president, was also fully aware of Iranian arms sales, 'contrary to his public pronouncements', but again found no evidence that he broke any law. The Iran-Contra investigation has been ridiculed by Republicans for its Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.6m) cost, seven-year duration and meagre results. Lawyers representing some of the main participants have criticised many aspects of Mr Walsh's investigation, and had tried in vain to persuade the appeals court which oversees the independent counsel to eliminate large portions of his report. In a statement yesterday, Mr Reagan called the report 'little more than a self-administered pat on the back and a vehicle for baseless accusations that (Mr Walsh) could never have proved in court'. Although 11 of the Iran-Contra conspirators were convicted, the two most significant convictions, of Colonel North and Admiral John Poindexter, his superior at the White House, were overturned on the grounds that they had earlier obtained immunity in exchange for testifying to Congress. Others, including Mr Caspar Weinberger, former defence secretary, and Mr Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, were pardoned by Mr Bush shortly before he left office last year. Only one Iran-Contra defendant served any time in prison. In a press conference yesterday Mr Walsh said many of those who took part in the 1985-86 conspiracy had high motives, including Mr Reagan. 'He may have been wilful but he thought he was serving his country in what he did,' Mr Walsh said. He was less forgiving of Mr Bush. 'I think President Bush will always have to answer for his pardons. That was a most unjustifiable act,' Mr Walsh said. However, the report's impact might have been greater had Mr Bush won the 1992 election. As it is, the only conspirator still prominent in politics is Mr North, who is seeking a seat in the Senate. The report concludes that the sale of arms to Iran violated declared US policy and may have violated the Arms Export Control Act, while the provision of support for the Contras violated the Boland amendment banning aid to military activities in Nicaragua.</p>

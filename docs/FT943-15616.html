			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Reservists set to serve abroad The Ministry of Defence is to clear the way for reservists to serve alongside regular forces overseas as part of its restructuring of the armed forces. It emerged at Westminster yesterday that ministers are planning to make more flexible use of reserve troops in frontline operations. The news was warmly greeted by backbench Tory MPs. However, optimism over the move was tempered by fears that next week's cuts will include the closure of the naval dockyard at Rosyth in Scotland. The cabinet will take a final decision on the package next Thursday. However, some Tory backbenchers were surprised that this ratification would be made just hours before the package is due to be revealed to the Commons. There was uncertainty over whether the MoD had persuaded the Treasury that it should keep the savings above the Pounds 750m which it is required to make in its 1994-95 budget. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is understood to be confident that he will be able to announce spending cuts well in excess of those required by the Treasury without further reducing the armed forces' fighting strength. It was also understood that the Treasury could still be trying to persuade the MoD that it must provide redundancy payments for the 25,000 servicemen and women who are due to lose their jobs in the review. Defence officials are anxious to get a Treasury assurance that it will not seek more cuts in the forthcoming Public Expenditure Survey. The move to allow part-time volunteers will require legislation. It aims to bolster front-line capability at a time when Tory backbenchers are concerned about the impact of a fall in defence expenditure.</p>

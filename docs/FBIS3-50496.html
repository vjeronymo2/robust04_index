According to a Mexican television station, the rebel group  issued a communique this morning. In the communique, the group  proclaims itself a guerrilla movement and declares war on the  Mexican Army, which it challenges to fight in the mountainous  area of the southern state of Chiapas. So far, there are no  reports of any casualties, but the rebels have closed off the  entries and exits of those three towns.</p>

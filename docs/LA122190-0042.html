			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / LASER BIN: 'RHYTHMSTICK' HAS JAZZ'S BEST  </P> <P> "Rhythmstick" (CTI). High definition, letterbox format. Multitrack digital  audio. $40.  </P> <P> "Rhythmstick" features Dizzy Gillespie, Art Farmer, Tito Puente and 15 other  international jazz all-stars in the first in a series of audio-visual projects  from CTI. The company, which in the '70s and '80s presented such artists as Bob  James and Freddie Hubbard, has been revitalized under the direction of its  founder, jazz producer Creed Taylor.  </P> <P> Backed by the Japanese Seibu Saison Group, CTI plans to release a number of  jazz projects that, like this one, will be available on laser discs as well as  VHS and theatrical formats.  </P> <P> "Rhythmstick," with 1,125 lines of horizontal resolution per frame (at 30  frames per second) has a look approaching 35mm film (despite the American TV  limitation of 525 scan lines). Filmed at Rudy Van Gelder's New Jersey studio,  the disc features gorgeously colorful performance segments of Gillespie,  Farmer, Puente, Bob Berg, Flora Purim, Airto Moriera and others in action.  Contrasting with the crystal-clear playing portions are several black-and-white  conversational interludes with some of the participants.  </P> <P> This is a first-rate project, and Taylor and his crew, if they maintain this  quality level in future productions, will be setting a standard that will be  hard to beat.  </P> <P> The corresponding "Rhythmstick" CD (CTI) obviously focuses entirely on the  music. Gillespie is spotlighted and plays particularly well on Latin-rhythm  pieces, especially Michel Camilo's "Caribe" and Benny Golson's romping  "Palisades in Blue."  </P> <P> However, the scene-stealer here is altoist Phil Woods, who plays with a fire  and fury that is virtually unquenchable. His work on "Friday Night at the  Cadillac Club" and "Nana" sizzles, a classic example of the contemporary  viability of the be-bop style.  </P> <P> Other high points include Flora Purim's soaring vocals on Tonino Horta's lovely  ballad "Waiting for Angela" and tenor saxophonist Bob Berg's surprisingly  powerful mainstream drive in his few appearances.

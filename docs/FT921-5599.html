			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Shetland opposes separate self-rule SHETLANDERS have little interest in seeking separate independence from Britain if Scotland were to become independent, Mr Edward Thomason, convener of Shetland Islands council, said yesterday. The question has become significant because an independent Shetland could, along with an independent Orkney, lay claim to a large part of the North Sea oil and gas fields. If England also drove a hard bargain, a Scottish government could have less than 10 per cent of North Sea oil revenues. The airing of the Shetland question comes in the latest North Sea oil report by County NatWest WoodMac, the broker. It says the maximum North Sea oil revenues Scotland could expect over the next five years would be Pounds 17bn, at this year's prices, out of a total Pounds 18bn. This assumes that the border between the English and Scottish sectors was drawn due east from Berwick-on-Tweed. If the direction of the land border between England and Scotland was continued into the sea and if Shetland and Orkney took their share of the oilfields then Scottish revenue could be as little as Pounds 1.5bn. Some 65 per cent of Scottish business leaders want no change in constitutional arrangements, according to a survey by Euram Consulting, the executive recruitment agency. Of the 35 per cent of replies from 515 questionnaires, 23 per cent wanted a form of Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers to replace the existing regional councils, 2 per cent wanted a tax-raising assembly on top of the regional councils and 6 per cent wanted total independence.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ For a company which dwells on the long-term nature of its investments, RTZ has proved a dab hand at some Hanson-style asset-shuffling following last month's acquisition of Nerco. Having paid Dollars 470m for the business plus the assumption of Dollars 692m of debt, RTZ will now realise almost Dollars 600m from selling Nerco's peripheral gold, oil and gas assets. That leaves RTZ with a cheap and cheerful coal business which should benefit from the nascent US recovery. Moreover, Nerco's debt was part funded by the vendor. The rest can be easily restructured given RTZ's strong credit rating. The scale and speed of the disposals remove any lingering worries about the financial burden imposed by the Nerco purchase. The asset sales will cut gearing from 63 per cent to 45 per cent, strengthening RTZ's financial flexibility as recovery shimmers on the horizon. All that is needed to complete RTZ's run of fortune is a firm upswing in metals. That, though, may prove elusive while European and Japanese markets remain depressed and US demand patchy. High inventory levels have also built slack into the system, suggesting prices may not firm greatly until the second half of 1994. Strong currency gains resulting from sterling's devaluation and the resilience of demand in south-east Asia will tide RTZ over this year. If and when worldwide economic recovery arrives, RTZ's appeal as a diversified play on the metals cycle can only magnify.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Hiroaki Kanazawa] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, Indonesia, 7 May -- A corporate consortium,  composed of Sumitomo Corporation, NEC, and the major Indonesian  firm Funpus [as transliterated], received an order for a  444,100-circuit digital switching system from the Indonesian  National Telecommunications Company (TELCOM). The value of the  order was about 10 billion yen. For the Sumitomo consortium,  this will be the second order of this nature following a  350,000-circuit system contract signed in 1991. Indonesia is  endeavoring to attain an early resolution to the shortage of  communication circuits and Sumitomo hopes to receive additional  orders.    The equipment will be delivered by NEC and installation will  begin in July of this year by NEC Nusantara Communications, a  joint venture formed by NEC, Sumitomo and a local Indonesian  corporate organization called Pimantara Group. The equipment  will be installed over a two-year period on Java and Kalimantan  islands.    Indonesia has about 3 million telephone circuits, providing  for less than two telephones per 100 population. The government  considers the construction of a more adequate communication  network as being essential to encouraging foreign investment in  the country and plans on installing 5 million new circuits in  the five-year period following fiscal year 1994. Until the  1980's, Siemens of Germany had a monopoly on the Indonesian  telephone switching market, but has since been joined by AT&amp;T  and NEC, providing for representation by three makers.</p>

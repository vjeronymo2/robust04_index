			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Bonn anguish at call to curb CIS export backing THE German government will be advised tomorrow to impose a DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) limit on all new export credit guarantees to the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), constituting 7 per cent of applications currently in the pipeline. The decision, understood to be backed by the finance and economics ministries, must be taken against a background of chronic trade payment problems for the ex-Soviet republics, and rising German exposure there. Bonn faces an agonising choice because an export credit guarantee curb would hit east German exporters pressed by the upheaval of German unification. The recommendation follows high-level talks between the two ministries, confronted with statistics from Hermes, the German export credit guarantee agency, showing a DM70bn backlog in applications for insurance to the former Soviet republics. Hermes' current exposure to the former Soviet republics is about DM29bn, the finance ministry said yesterday. On top of that figure, untied German government credits of some DM11bn are outstanding, bringing government-backed credit exposure to over DM40bn. These figures still represent only part of the full German exposure, showing the urgency of a full cabinet decision on future Hermes cover. Approval has been given in principle for contracts totalling another DM23bn, finance ministry officials say, though they hope most will not take place. On top of that potential exposure of DM63bn comes a backlog in applications of over DM70bn, against an estimated backlog last December of DM25bn. The finance ministry said yesterday: 'All applications will have to be rigorously examined. The length of the queue shows why a decision is so urgent.' Another limit on granting export credits is the requirement that they all earn a counterpart guarantee from the ex-Soviet side: it is uncertain if the new republican external trade agencies will have the foreign exchange to give such guarantees in the coming months. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, favours a strict limit on Hermes credits for the coming year; his figure of DM5bn seems likely to be approved. But it is uncertain if the special Hermes arrangements for eastern German exporters will be continued. Customers in the former Soviet Union were able to buy east German goods without 15-20 per cent downpayments, but the scheme expired in January.</p>

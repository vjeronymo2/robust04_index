			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALE CONTRACEPTION A NEGLECTED SCIENCE;  </P> <P> SCIENCE: DESPITE PROMISING STUDIES, AN EFFECTIVE VERSION OF THE PILL FOR MEN IS  STILL A GLEAM IN A RESEARCHER'S EYE.  </P> <P> Once a week Bill, a social researcher for the state of Washington, drops into  his doctor's office in the Seattle area. He receives a 200-milligram shot of  testosterone enanthate (TE), a synthetic version of the male sex hormone now  being tested as a contraceptive. The procedure is, quite literally, a pain in  the behind, but Bill doesn't mind. A little soreness is a small price to pay,  compared with the frustration he's endured using conventional methods.  </P> <P> Bill's wife used to take the Pill but gave it up because of concerns about the  side effects, and because of the cost. She tried using the contraceptive  sponge, which failed and led to a pregnancy. Then Bill started using condoms.  </P> <P> Both in their 20s, Bill and Mary have two children. Although they decided they  didn't want any more, a vasectomy was out of the question. Faced with dwindling  options, Bill became a pioneer on the frontier of reproductive biology.  </P> <P> Bill and Mary are volunteers in a program conducted by the researchers at the  University of Washington as part of a World Health Organization study involving  more than 300 couples worldwide. For the past year he and 10 other men have  relied on weekly injections of TE, which lowers sperm production, as their sole  means of contraception. None of their spouses has become pregnant.  </P> <P> The program is a promising development in a quest many scientists regard as, at  best, quixotic: the search for a male version of the Pill.  </P> <P> Other potential male contraceptive drugs are being studied at several research  centers around the world. Because the dosages are potent enough to damage the  liver if taken orally, the so-called "male pill" is being developed as a series  of shots or implants designed to be long-lasting. Few of the projects have  reached the clinical-trial stage, and all of the drugs are years away from  practical development.  </P> <P> The need for more acceptable and reliable forms of birth control is critical,  according to a report released last winter by a prestigious panel of scientists  and policy makers assembled by the National Research Council and the National  Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. Half of the estimated 1.5 million  abortions performed in the United States each year are the result of  contraceptive failure.  </P> <P> Oral contraceptives remain the most popular form of reversible birth control  among fertile, sexually active women, but up to two-thirds of those at risk for  unwanted pregnancy can't or won't take the Pill. For their part, men have  traditionally had three less-than-ideal options: vasectomy, condoms or  "whatever she's using."  </P> <P> Despite advances in microsurgery and better vasectomy techniques, the chances  of restoring fertility remain slim in a male who has had a vasectomy. Condoms,  quite apart from their lack of aesthetic appeal, have an actual failure rate of  12 percent or more in the first year of use. The failure rate of diaphragms,  sponges and spermicides is even greater.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, a viable male contraceptive won't be available for at least a  decade. Questions remain about the effectiveness of drugs that appear to lower  sperm production, as well as their long-term health risks. Yet many researchers  insist the most formidable roadblocks aren't medical but social, economic and  political.  </P> <P> No fundamentally new form of contraception has reached the American consumer in  almost 30 years. In the past decade the number of private U.S. companies  researching new types of contraception has dropped from 17 to one, and the  United States now trails in the field behind European countries, where women  have several options -- including progestin implants or injections, an  abortifacient and a new generation of IUD's. But even in Europe, male  contraception is a neglected science.  </P> <P> Scientists have known for decades that it's possible to manipulate male  fertility with drugs in much the same way the Pill prevents women from  ovulating. Translating that knowledge into trouble-free contraception is  another matter. It's easier to target one egg a month than to suspend the daily  production of millions of spermatozoa -- unless, of course, the goal is to shut  the factory altogether.  </P></p>

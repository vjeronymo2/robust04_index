			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Arrivederci, Coop, and thanks for the thrills you gave us that made a sixth man  No. 1 in our hearts . . .  </P> <P> With every European signing, the NBA comes closer to international expansion. .  . .  </P> <P> The Lakers reportedly would like to trade Byron Scott and A.C. Green to the  Indiana Pacers for Reggie Miller. . . .  </P> <P> Best credential new Yankee general partner Robert Nederlander brings to the job  is a last name that isn't Steinbrenner. . . .  </P> <P> Ken Howell was traded by the Dodgers after the 1988 season, but the stitching  on the back of Jay Howell's jersey still identifies him as "J. Howell." . . .  </P> <P> Late date: The Mets were leading the Dodgers, 1-0, in the second inning  Wednesday on ESPN when this "update" was flashed on the bottom of the screen:  "Los Angeles 0, New York 0, 1st inning." . . .  </P> <P> Rated by the Angels as can't-miss prospects in their farm system are  24-year-old right-handed pitcher Scott Lewis with Edmonton of the Pacific Coast  League and 21-year-old outfielder Tim Salmon with Midland of the Texas League.  . . .  </P> <P> One reason Mike Scott of the Houston Astros is a losing pitcher after winning  20 games last season is that he has added a gopher ball to his repertoire. . .  .  </P> <P> The Kansas City Royals finally are playing up to their capabilities, but their  magic number remains 1991. . . .  </P> <P> The San Francisco Giants badly need a return to form by Steve Bedrosian. . . .  </P> <P> Ever notice how often catchers set up with their glove as a target outside the  strike zone? . . .  </P> <P> The National League is crazy if it doesn't expand to Denver, which could draw  as many as 3 million fans its first season. . . .  </P> <P> I like the one-word description of a home run by ESPN's Dan Patrick: "Gone."  </P> <P> .. .  </P> <P> Tim McCarver's play-by-play work on the Mets' telecasts is nearly as good as  his commentary. . . .  </P> <P> Baseball is a lot kinder to brawlers than the NBA, which would have suspended  those New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies who got off with measly fines. .  . .  </P> <P> The Raiders' second-round draft choice, Aaron Wallace, the quick defensive end  who set the Texas A&amp;M career sack record with 42, has three in his first  two exhibition games. . . .  </P> <P> If Heisman Trophy runner-up Anthony Thompson from Indiana sits out the season,  it will be nothing new for a Cardinal draft choice. Remember Kelly Stouffer? .  . .  </P> <P> NFL games lasted an average of 3 hours 11 minutes last year. The exhibitions  last weekend averaged 2:52. . . .  </P> <P> Why is it that pro football is the only sport where most trades involve draft  choices and rarely are player-for-player? . . .  </P> <P> The exhibition football season is under way and baseball is heading into the  stretch drive, so which Los Angeles team is having a media luncheon next  Thursday? The Kings. Ready or not, they open camp in three weeks. . . .  </P> <P> Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney says he has the best running back in the nation  in Aaron Craver, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound tailback who began his career at El  Camino College after not playing at Compton High. . . .  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith on the speed of freshman Curtis Conway: "He runs a 4.4,  an easy 4.4." . . .  </P> <P> Best view of the rising Los Angeles skyline is from the Dodger Stadium parking  lot. . . .  </P> <P> Sorry, but I don't think the signing of Greg Kite will turn the Orlando Magic  around. . . .  </P> <P> For the Record: Vinnie Johnson is an unrestricted free agent, meaning the  Detroit Pistons cannot automatically keep him by matching another team's offer.  . . .  </P> <P> There's an enormous difference between first and second place in the Virginia  Slims of Los Angeles. The winner Sunday at the Manhattan Country Club will earn  $70,000, the loser $28,000. . . .  </P> <P> And remember when they used to play doubles merely for fun? The L.A.  championship team will split $21,000. . . .  </P> <P> Biggest fan at the tournament this week has been Wilt Chamberlain. . . .  </P> <P> What an eventful couple of weeks for Malivai Washington, the 103rd ranked men's  player in the world. He lost to Stefan Edberg in the first round in Los Angeles  and then upset Ivan Lendl in the second round in New Haven, Conn. . . .  </P> <P> The Anaheim economy won't be hurt by the Disneyland Pigskin Classic Aug. 26.  Colorado and Tennessee each expect to bring 6,000 fans with them. . . .  </P> <P> If the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation goes through with its threat to cancel  exhibitions in the United States, few tears will be shed by NHL teams. Crowds  were sparse for the Soviet-NHL exhibitions last season. . . .  </P> <P> The first annual Rolex Award goes to the NCAA for penalizing the University of  Colorado because it signed a football recruit nine minutes too early.  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BPB Cheek is often quietly admired, but BPB's chutzpah verges on the irritating. Having tapped shareholders for Pounds 125m in June 1991, the company cut its interim dividend last November - about as soon as it could without blushing scarlet. At the time the board waived convention and refused to clarify its intentions on the full year payment, settling instead for an upbeat trading statement. Since then the shares have rallied by a third, a rise which made possible yesterday's convertible bond issue on favourable terms. The accompanying reduction in the full year dividend was, of course, in line with the interim cut. There is nothing technically wrong with this, but bruised shareholders may feel that the BPB board has played the man rather than the ball. It is not as though the profits outlook is sufficiently sparkling for shareholders to assume the dividend will be on the way back up soon. BPB's competitor Knauf still has 50 per cent of its UK capacity lying idle. Any uptick in the UK housing market is unlikely to lead to higher prices, while continental markets continue to deteriorate. Companies in such tight spots should, perhaps, be a little less careless about shareholder sentiment.</p>

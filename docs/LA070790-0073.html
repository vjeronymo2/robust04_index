			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE VICTIM'S HUSBAND HAS A MISSION  </P> <P> The husband of a woman killed in last week's fiercely destructive brush fire  said Friday he is trying to raise money for a foundation dedicated to teaching  the public about fire safety.  </P> <P> Michael Gurka said he hopes the memory of his wife, Andrea Lang Gurka -- the  only person to die in the Santa Barbara blaze -- will live on through the  Phoenix Center, a proposed clearinghouse for information on topics ranging from  building fire-retardant homes to preventing soil erosion after fires.  </P> <P> Gurka, 36, said he has approached private investors as well as political and  religious leaders in the community for support of the center, which he  estimates will cost about $100,000 to establish. He intends to discuss plans  for the project today during a fire-relief telethon in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to find some meaning in this," said Gurka, dark circles of fatigue  underlining his eyes. "If we can educate people about fire, then potential  human life won't be lost."  </P> <P> Andrea Lang Gurka, 37, died sometime after 6 p.m. on June 27 as she tried to  flee the fire roaring toward the Gurkas' house at the bottom of a canyon in the  1700 block of San Marcos Pass Road.  </P> <P> Michael Gurka, an architectural and landscape consultant, said his wife saw the  approaching flames and called him at his Montecito office to discuss possible  escape routes. Her car had broken down the day before, he said.  </P> <P> The couple decided she should try to get a ride with neighbors, or run out on  foot. If that failed they agreed that Andrea Gurka, who had lost mobility from  two sprained ankles in the past year, would take shelter in the lowest, coolest  area possible -- a dry creek bed that ran close to their house.  </P> <P> Michael Gurka said his wife called back within minutes to say she could not  reach any neighbors, and he started a desperate drive home through streets  clogged with traffic.  </P> <P> By the time he got there, police barricades were up, he said.  </P> <P> He alerted authorities to his wife's predicament. The next day, he searched the  ruins of the house and made the rounds of evacuation shelters.  </P> <P> That night, Gurka filed a missing person report. A search team sent by the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department found her body at 9:30 a.m. Friday,  June 29, in the creek bed about 75 yards from the house, Deputy Tim Gracey  said.  </P> <P> "I'm trying not to concentrate on what could have been," Michael Gurka said,  closing his eyes and furrowing his forehead. "I've been advised not to blame  myself, and I'm working on that now."  </P> <P> The Gurkas met in 1976 in New York City, where they were teachers at a private  school. They married two years later and soon moved to California to live  closer to nature, Gurka said.  </P> <P> The Santa Barbara home in which they had lived since 1985 is now a pile of  charred rubble. Also consumed by the fire were about 1,000 watercolors painted  by Andrea Gurka and two dozen unpublished children's books she had written.  </P> <P> Gurka, described by relatives as a kind and energetic woman, grew up in New  York, appearing with her mother, actress Doe Lang, on soap operas as a child.  She attended the New York High School of Performing Arts and studied at the  American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco as a teen-ager.  </P> <P> But her true love was art, Michael Gurka said. He said she worked as a  free-lance illustrator for the New York Times from 1977-78 and for the Los  Angeles Times between 1980 and 1982.  </P> <P> More recently, Gurka spent her days painting fanciful watercolors of the wild  animals that she fed every day.  </P> <P> Michael Gurka said he and his wife had decided to put their relationship before  their careers.  </P> <P> "I really, really loved my wife," he said. "I can't see not structuring my life  in dedication for what she stood for."  </P></p>

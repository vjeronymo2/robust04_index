			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELAPAN correspondent Ales Lipay: "Dollars for </F> Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Krawchanka has  confirmed in an interview with BELAPAN that the issue of  compensation for uranium recovered from nuclear warheads  transferred from Belarus to Russia remains in the "process of  negotiations," in which five states are participating.    When the media, noted P. Krawchanka, report that such  compensation will total $12 billion, I laugh at such  dilettantism. This is a sum which must be divided between four  CIS countries. However, it will not be paid at one time, but  rather over the course of several years. Today, it is even hard  to say when the United States will begin to buy the uranium from  Russia, added the minister.</p>

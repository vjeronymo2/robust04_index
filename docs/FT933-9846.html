			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Japan's bureaucrats fear new division of labour: Officials are concerned the new coalition will usurp their role as policy formers IN Kasumigaseki, the district in central Tokyo where Japan's ministries are concentrated, brave assurances from bureaucrats that it will be business as usual are pitted against concern that the cosy relationship they have enjoyed with politicians for nearly 40 years is over. Business leaders, meanwhile, appear unable to keep up with the swift changes in the political landscape. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the leading industrial association, Keidanren, the largest employers' federation, continues to express support for the outgoing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) even after it lost its majority in the lower house in the national election last month. Although Mr Hiraiwa belatedly expressed his respect for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, for his enthusiasm in reforming Japanese politics, the business establishment has not been able to hide its concern that the crumbling of the old order robs it of its raison d'etre. The bureaucrats' concern centres on the possibility that the fundamental division of labour between politicians and the bureaucracy may be coming to an end. Under the LDP, politicians were more or less happy to let bureaucrats form policy in consultation with industry. Once they had decided on a policy line they would lobby the necessary LDP politicians whose role was to ensure that the policy was legislated. The system functioned on a cosy triangular relationship in which industry provided bureaucrats with comfortable jobs when they retired in exchange for advancing their interests, while politicians provided the assurance that those policies would be legislated in exchange for votes. The collapse of this relationship between bureaucrats, industry and politicians means that policy is likely to be more openly debated. But bureaucrats fear there could be a shift in the relationship and that politicians will increasingly usurp their role as policy formers. Unlike LDP politicians, the relatively young members of the Japan New party or the New Harbinger party are not dependent on industry groups for votes and are unlikely to be as susceptible to lobbying by the bureaucrats. Depending on the assertiveness of a new cabinet minister, the role of bureaucrats could be reduced to making proposals rather than forming policy. In the past it has been largely up to the bureaucrats to decide on policy matters, with the LDP merely rubber-stamping their actions. Lobbying will become much more difficult. The large number of coalition members who will need convincing about particular policy decisions will in itself complicate communication with politicians, bureaucrats fear. This could lead to long delays in the implementation of policies. Life is also likely to become more difficult for bureaucrats involved in policy matters which coalition members have publicly opposed. The SDP, for example, has made opposition to the 3 per cent consumption tax introduced in 1989 a party platform. It also opposes nuclear energy, the military's participation in the UN's peacekeeping operations and a proposed reform of the national pension scheme, making bureaucrats tremble at the thought of finding themselves under a minister from that particular party. However, not all bureaucrats are worried that life under the new government will differ much from life with the LDP. Decisions will be collective, as they always have been, and important issues will still involve politicians, bureaucrats, the media and the industries concerned, says one bureaucrat. Key members of the coalition are former LDP members with whom bureaucrats have had close ties. The ministries are also counting on the links they have formed with the main opposition parties, such as the SDP, which is now the largest group in the coalition. 'A lot of the relationships that were developed with the LDP were also developed with the opposition,' says one trade ministry official. 'Most of the legislation proposed by the Miti (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) has been passed unanimously with the exception of the Communist party.' Mr Taiichi Sakaiya, a novelist and commentator who began his career at Miti, points out that the SDP has not been as free from bureaucratic influence as it might first seem. 'Politicians are, as it were, the subcontractors of the bureaucrats,' Mr Sakaiya wrote in a recent column in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading national newspaper. 'The opposition parties, such as the SDP, are not unaffected by this relationship. (They) always oppose budget proposals but when they are subject to lobbying by the ministries they suddenly give up their resistance.' Some bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance hope the influence of policy group members who act as advisers to the ministries will be reduced, making way for much-needed changes in funding priorities. Business leaders are also uncertain about life under the new government. On the surface, most business leaders express optimism that the new government will introduce reforms in the relationship between politics and business. The practice of collecting political donations through the Keidanren, for example, which puts pressure on businesses to donate funds has been widely criticised. But beneath their seemingly calm acceptance of the changes they face, business leaders are having to identify a new role. Keidanren, in particular, whose influence over the LDP stemmed from its huge political donations to the party, cannot easily switch loyalties, while its role as a channel for political funds could be removed if the practice is reformed. While bureaucrats and businessmen contemplate the long-term implications of working with a coalition government, they face the short term difficulty of not knowing where to concentrate their loyalties. A poll taken by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper showed that 54 per cent of bureaucrats surveyed believed there would be another election in any case early next year. Given that the new coalition government might not last long, bureaucrats are wary of focusing their lobbying efforts on politicians who may be in office only for the next few months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE COALITION BREAKS DOWN. . .AND WHY IT COULD BREAK UP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Sadao Yamahana 70 seats Traditional party of opposition, now thrust into government for the   first time since 1947-48 to the discomfort of leftist ideologues in   its ranks who would prefer to be called, as it still is in Japanese,   the Japan Socialist Party. Largest group in the coalition in spite of being the biggest loser in   the election, with its Diet representation almost halved and at its   lowest ever. Has moderated its stance in recent years but remains out of step with   its new partners on almost every issue. Beholden to interests of   public sector unions on administrative reforms and of farmers on rice   imports. Anti-nuclear and pacifist, distrusts Washington and shuns   Seoul.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN RENEWAL PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Tsutomu Hata 55 seats Set up in June be defectors who brought down the ruling Liberal   Democratic party in a no-confidence motion because of its failure to   enact political reform. Ex-finance minister Hata has been moving towards the centre but   co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP powerbroker, plays a more   shadowy role. In contrast to the SDP, the JRP is conservative on defence issues and   has indicated the need for value added tax to be increased -   consumption tax in Japan is currently levied at only 3 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CLEAN GOVERNMENT PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Koshiro Ishida 51 seats Linked to the Buddhist Doka Gakkai movement, the source of much of its   money, but is formally independent. In the 30 years of its life has had consistent electoral support of   around 10 per cent, and added seats this time in spite of the   plethora of new parties from which to choose. Has both pro-military and pacifist elements within its ranks, and   many policies are nebulous. Open to a full merger of coalition forces to create a two-party   system. Leader Ishida is said to be close to JRP's Ozawa.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN NEW PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Morihiro Hosokawa 35 seats The new prime minister founded his party in mid-1992 out of disgust   with the stasis engendered by the bureaucracy and its cosy, often   corrupt links with big business and politicians in the LDP, of which   he was formerly a member. Wants more power devolved to Japan's regions, and will be conscious of   Japan's image abroad. Intitally called for a liberalisation of the   country's closed market for rice but has backed away in the face of   resistance from other coalition members. Nearly all its Diet members are first-timers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Keigo Ouchi 15 seats Offshoot of the Socialists in 1960 which gravitated towards the LDP   but shied away from its corrupt image this time. Had suggested immediately after the election that it might still join   LDP in alternative coalition, and its loyalty to new ruling may be   suspect. Funded largely by private sector unions, and is keen on administrative   reform. Policies lack clarity but tend to be conservative, particulary of   defence.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW HARBINGER PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Masayoshi Takemura 13 seats Another LDP splinter group which sheared off this June and gained a net   three seats in the election. Has bonded increasingly closely with the JNP, and the two may merge. Both are wary of the strength in the coalition wielded by the JRP,   particularly the Ozawa influence. NHP has urged establishing a   coalition consensus on economic, defence and foreign policy,   recognising that a government will have to deal with these as well as   political reform, however short its life. Open about need to increase indirect taxation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Party leader: Satsuki Eda 4 seats Has sought to grow by poaching reformists from the SDP, some members   of which have linked with Eda and allies in a political study group. Other members now lean towards the JNP and NHP, and party may urge   a unification of all seven. Too small to trouble the overall arithmetic of the coalition unless   other walk out. Leader Eda is suspicious of Ozawa's LDP past.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

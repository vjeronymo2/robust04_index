			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Bonds: New issues go forward despite turbulent trading conditions THE European Investment Bank and the Kingdom of Spain both ventured out in turbulent markets to launch large issues yesterday, only to find that investors' attention was on other matters - such as whether and when an ERM realignment would come. The European Investment Bank's Y50bn, five-year deal was its first since the Italian government abolished its withholding tax exemption for multilateral agencies, and so a test for the market's appetite for the EIB. According to one bank, the yield on the bonds - brought at 13 basis points above the seven-year Japanese government bond No 104 - was only 8 basis points higher than that talked about last week, before the tax change. However, this may give little indication of the overall extra cost that the EIB and other agencies - and the entities to which they lend - will have to pay as a result of the tax change. The yen is not a currency bought heavily by Italian investors: a greater test will come when the EIB next attempts to borrow in a higher-yielding currency such as the lira, peseta or Ecu. Despite reports that the issue had been well-priced, and that many banks had succeeded in placing their portion of the issue, the bonds traded as much as 50 basis points down during the afternoon on the general malaise in the markets. Morgan Stanley, one of the joint leads, bid 98.80 for the bonds to put a floor under the price, compared with an issue price of 92.32 - and found itself forced to buy up Y10bn of the issue, to add to the Y18bn it said it had already placed. The Kingdom of Spain's Dollars 1.5bn issue, to be priced today, caused greater concern among underwriters, with several questioning the wisdom of bringing the deal so close to the French referendum on Sunday. The issue had already been delayed in the hope of some stability returning to the markets  -only to shift its launch into the most turbulent point of the week so far. At an indicated range of 42-45 basis points over Treasuries, the bonds were regarded as fairly priced. The issue compares with a yield of 32 basis points above Treasuries offered recently by the Council of Europe  - an AA1 borrower, compared to the AA2 Kingdom of Spain. About a third of the bonds were reported to have been sold in Europe, leaving a substantial part still to be placed. The fate of the transaction could echo that of the Dollars 2bn deal for Ontario, launched earlier in the week. After an indicated spread of 46-48 basis points, the bonds were launched at 48 and were trading yesterday at 54 basis points above Treasuries.</p>

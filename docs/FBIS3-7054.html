The article says:    Since the proclamation of the Republic the Namibian people  have striven to build a new life, valiantly overcoming trials  and difficulties that cropped up in their way.    Pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy, the Namibian  Government is strengthening relations with many countries of the  world and member states of the organization of African unity and  fighting against imperialism and racism.    The Korean and the Namibian people established friendly  bonds  on the road of the common struggle for independence against  imperialism.    Especially, the friendly and cooperative relations between  the two countries have further developed since the establishment  of diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level on March 22, 1990.    Believing that the relations between the two peoples will  grow stronger and develop in different fields on the basis of  the idea of independence, peace and friendship, the Korean  people wish the Namibian people greater success in their  strivings for the development and prosperity of the country.</p>

Insofar as a  number of delegations of the United Nations, Council on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe, and other  international organizations have confirmed that the situation in  Estonia is entirely in conformance with international human  rights standards, the press release states, the question arises:  Who is concealing the truth--international organizations or the  political figure who has repeatedly proclaimed Estonia to be  part of the Russian sphere of interest, the so-called near  abroad? The laws of the Estonian Republic allow everyone to  obtain Estonian citizenship, regardless of ethnicity. But the  minister's statements, as noted by the Estonian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, contain a positive aspect (concerning a  reference to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). This instills the  hope that the Russian minister of foreign affairs will be able  to take the next step and admit that the Baltic countries were  occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940.    Estonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Juri Luik, in turn,  did  not ignore the interview given by Andrey Kozyrev to the American  weekly NEWSWEEK and published in the 14 February issue. In  response to the NEWSWEEK correspondent's question as to whether  the minister truly meant in an address to Russian diplomats that  troops should not be withdrawn from the Baltic countries, Luik  believes that Kozyrev did not provide a clear answer. I would be  quite happy to see Mr. Kozyrev find the opportunity to answer  this question once again, this time more precisely, the Estonian  minister stated.    With regard to the Estonian demarche, it is useful to  publish  Andrey Kozyrev's utterances verbatim. In conversation with  journalists on 8 February, the minister stated the following:  "Approximately a third of the populace is set apart by virtue of  ethnicity. We are talking about Russian-speaking  people--Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, and even  Finns--who are denied the right of citizenship. They want to  acquire such citizenship but are denied it for one reason  only--ethnicity. If this is not `ethnic cleansing,' then what  is?" (Here and henceforth we quote INTERFAX). In Kozyrev's  opinion, in certain instances, in Bosnia and Herzegovina for  example, "ethnic cleansing" is manifest in the form of criminal  violence, in other instances--in the form of denial of civil  rights, the right of citizenship in particular, for large  population groups. "If anywhere people are called `occupiers'  and `noncitizens,' they begin to conduct themselves accordingly.  The result is instability," the minister stated. He then cited  another example of encroachment on the rights of  Russian-speaking people: "In the former USSR, everyone had a  military obligation. There was no exception for Estonians or  Latvians--they too served in the Soviet Army. But now they want  to remove from Estonia and Latvia not all former servicemen in  the Soviet Army, only the Russian-speaking ones. It is evident  that the basis of the demand to remove servicemen comprises not  a political, but rather an ethnic principle." In the minister's  words, attempts to take out crimes of the Stalinist regime on  simple people constitute political stupidity." "I admit the  crimes of the Stalinist regime, but one must not forget that  these were committed by political authorities--Stalin on the one  hand, and Hitler on the other--that concluded the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Attempts 45 years later to take it out  on thousands of simple people for the commission of these crimes  and use the principle of ethnicity in doing so--are  intolerable." "The world must turn its attention to this  inhumane and potentially dangerous situation," Kozyrev concluded.    There can be no doubt but that the minister's words are  harsh  to say the least, and possibly "inaccurate," but to categorize  them as slander means closing one's eyes to the true state of  affairs. Which is in fact what the prestigious Western  structures and organizations whose views are being cited by the  Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are doing. These groups  include, for example, the American human rights organization  Freedom House, which published its regular report for 1993  encompassing 190 countries and 63 territories. The section  pertaining to "countries that are not free" lists Bosnia and  Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan,  Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The author of the  report categorizes the following countries as "partially free":  Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Georgia,  Belarus, Armenia, Romania, Macedonia, Slovakia, and Latvia. The  experts proclaimed Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania, and Estonia to be "free." When  compared with last year's report with respect to the Baltic  countries, it is Estonia that received an "upgrade," moving out  of the category "partially free" to "free." We must point out  that the situation of the Russian-speaking population was  precisely the key criterion in last year's report, in  particular, "the measures to restrict citizenship and the denial  of citizenship to Russian-speaking inhabitants." We must presume  that the Russians in Estonia will be happy to hear that they are  living today in a country that is completely free.    P.S. INTERFAX reported yesterday that Estonian President  Lennart Meri demanded an explanation from Aleksandr Trofimov,  Russian Federation ambassador to Tallinn, in connection with the  statements of Russian officials. A report distributed to the  press Wednesday evening by the Chancellery of the Estonian head  of state cites the words of Mikhail Demurin, official  representative of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. According to the press release, Demurin stated that "in  the establishment of international relations, the use of  diplomatic means alone is insufficient." The document also  mentions that in his recent interview with NEWSWEEK, Russian  Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev accused  Latvia of intent to deport Russians, and he "threatened conflict  with the Latvian Republic." The document emphasizes that "the  actual situation in Estonia has nothing in common with the  picture certain extremist-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are  attempting to draw, and this fact is without a doubt well known  to the officials who are formulating Russia's foreign policy."</p>

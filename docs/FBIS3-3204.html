			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The United States  should renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status to  ensure maintenance of trade and investment ties between the  states and China, vice-chairman of the Amoco Corporation General  Office said at a press conference here this afternoon.    Lawrason D. Thomas, who is attending the China Petroleum  Investment Conference held here today and tomorrow, added that  Sino-U.S. relations are, from the viewpoint of global strategy,  a parallel partnership.    He believed that human rights and trade should not be linked  together, hoping that the U.S. and Chinese Governments could  solve the problem of human rights and trade through talks.    On Amoco's attitude toward the renewal of China's MFN  trading  status and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Thomas said that his company is making  efforts toward these two goals. He himself has already  discussed the issue with some administrative officials of the  United States.    Thomas said that he had a discussion last Thursday [10  March]  with three U.S. senators in Washington on the same issue.    "Different people think of human rights in different ways.  My suggestion is that we have people from both sides, the  United States and China, sit down and discuss the issue and find  areas of common agreement," Thomas stressed.    For those who have poor knowledge about China, Thomas  suggested that they come and see China with their own eyes.  "Seeing China firsthand is a lot different from reading about  it in the newspaper," he said, adding that many people change  their minds after coming to China.    C. Patrick Chu, president of the Amoco Orient Company, told  the press conference that he had met with dozens of visiting  U.S. senators and over 20 U.S. Congressmen in Beijing to discuss  the MFN trade issue with them.    Chu hoped that the human rights issue could be separated  from  trade and China's MFN trading status renewed. Both in  Washington and Beijing, Amoco is making efforts to this end.</p>

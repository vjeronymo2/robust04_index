			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Islam clouds Pakistan investor hopes: Concerns over the religious prohibition on interest payments THE FUTURE of Pakistan's banking system is being decided in the courts, and the credibility of the government's push to attract foreign investment will depend on the response. Within Pakistan, businessmen and politicians are relaxed; they argue that in practical terms the prohibition of interest payments on loans would have little impact. Overseas investors, however, are nervous. There is every chance that it will turn out to be a non-issue, resolved by introducing a broadly acceptable alternative system. But while the government pays homage to the fundamentalist political wing in refusing to confront the realities of Islamic banking, the cloud of uncertainty will remain. The debate revolves around the term riba. It is not defined in the Koran and is variously interpreted as either usury or interest; this interpretation is of crucial importance, since riba is prohibited under Islamic law. The dispute has already put back one of the world's largest power projects, Hab River, by more than six months because the overseas bankers required special guarantees before they would lend in such uncertain circumstances. Foreign investors have said that economic 'Islamisation', along with law and order, are their primary concerns. So far, these appear to have offset the attractive investment package the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif has created for foreign investors. In November last year, the federal Shariat Court ruled that interest was 'repugnant to the injunctions of Islam'. The court hearing had come soon after the expiry of a ban by the religious court on the examination of fiscal law and banking practice. To a country with a national debt of Dollars 25bn, this is of serious concern; taken to its logical conclusion, the government's debt arrangements would be un-Islamic, and the debt therefore should immediately be repaid, which, of course, it could not be. It is apparent that the government is satisfied with the status quo. Local banking already operates under a non-interest arrangement, with interest-based loans and deposits being replaced with a system of mark-up or profit-and-loss sharing schemes. Under the mark-up system, a borrower sells goods to the bank and these are then sold back at a marked-up price, which is paid back over a fixed period. Compound interest or mark-up is not permitted, since the key to riba is that money should not carry any intrinsic time value. Under the profit-and-loss schemes, depositors participate in the performance of the banking operation, rather than getting a fixed return. In theory, they could lose money, but in practice it is possible for depositors to get a good idea of the likely return on their capital. The Shariat Court ruling was critical of mark-up and of all forms of interest-bearing loans, regardless of their justification. Pakistan is a big issuer of fixed-interest bonds. The Shariat Court is subordinate to the Supreme Court, which gives scope for appeal. The finance minister was apparently anxious to do so, but came across a serious obstacle: the fact that his government had been elected under an Islamic banner. In June 1991, the Sharif government passed its own 'Act for the Enforcement of Shariah' which undertook to 'Islamise' the economy and eliminate riba. The government did the next best thing, and persuaded the banks to appeal 'independently'. Then in June, it launched its own appeal. The attorney general argued at the same time that the prohibition of interest would lead to an economic collapse. The business community awaits a date for the appeal to be processed, but it is assuming this will be postponed for a long time. Under the government's Shariat Act, a commission was appointed to set out an alternative economic system which could operate under Islamic principles. No time was set, and it is likely the government will wait for a recommendation before tackling the courts, although, in theory, it is not up to the government when the court hearing is to take place. In the meantime, the government has undertaken that the Shariat Act will not affect the validity of any existing financial obligations to foreign institutions or governments. These will be recognised until the new system evolves. But there are grey areas. It is not made clear whether the guarantees apply to any loans that were made after the Shariat Act was made law. In addition, lawyers have argued that loan defaulters could defend their actions against the banks on the basis that the contract was not in accordance with Islamic law. Even mark-up could be challenged, since the Shariat Court said this was against the injunctions of Islam. But the government seems content to allay concerns with the statement that nothing will change unless a satisfactory alternative is developed. One local industrialist said he was confident a rational system would evolve, but only over a long period. 'They will probably just change the names and the only difference will be that borrowers end up paying more,' he said.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Court orders VW to stop recruiting Opel executives VOLKSWAGEN was yesterday threatened with fines and a possible prison sentence for one of its executives if it continued trying to recruit senior managers from rival carmaker Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors. Opel won a temporary injunction in a Frankfurt court yesterday barring its loss-making competitor from 'systematically recruiting or attempting to recruit Opel and General Motors employees'. The order, issued by three judges, followed Thursday's public accusations from Opel that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former head of GM's worldwide purchasing operation who joined VW last month, had been directly involved in a systematic attempt to 'poach' more than 40 of Opel's German procurement managers by offering to double their salaries. The injunction threatened VW with fines of up to DM500,000 (Dollars 315,000) and Mr Lopez with up to six months' jail. A spokesman for VW could not comment last night because the order had not yet been received. But the company had been advised it had 'acted legally', he said. Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, said last night he had resorted to legal remedies because his company needed to be protected. 'It was difficult to decide whether to demand that they stop, or to simply protect ourselves,' he added. 'Had he (Mr Lopez) got all the people he called here, he would have hurt us really badly,' Mr Herman said. VW's tactics, understood already to have attracted almost 20 people from Opel and from GM in Detroit in three months, are threatening the industry's usually close inter-company relationships as car makers face a 10 per cent fall in Europe-wide demand and 20 per cent fall in Germany. Mr Herman wrote earlier this week to all German motor makers, politicians and the industry association protesting about VW's actions. 'How can I sit there with Mr Piech (the VW chairman) when he is trying to destroy my company from within?' he asked. VW, which earlier this week announced a DM1.25bn first-quarter loss, hired Mr Lopez from GM to use his renowned skills as a procurement director in a bid to imitate Opel's successful cost-cutting programme.</p>

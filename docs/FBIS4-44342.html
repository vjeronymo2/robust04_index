			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adnan Gerger: "The Set-3 Operation in Ankara"] </F>   [Excerpts] Ankara--Security units have impounded 14  Kalashnikov rifles and 18 other firearms in an operation in  Ankara. The officials have ascertained that the arms were  secretly brought into Turkey from Iraq. Acting on information,  the police organization has taken wide-scale measures against  possible terrorist activities in Ankara and Istanbul. The  police units in the two cities have been placed on a state of  alert.    Officials of the police department on smuggling and illegal  arms in Ankara received information that preparations were made  to smuggle arms into Turkey some time ago. They investigated  the matter and established that the attempt to smuggle arms into  Turkey had international connections. The police organization  then launched a secret operation, which was code named as  "Set-3." [passage omitted]    The case was relentlessly pursued by officials for 10 days.  It ended in the Yenimahalle quarter of Ankara. Two persons  arrived in Ankara yesterday in a car loaded with arms. They  drove to the Yenimahalle quarter of the city. However,  something went wrong with their appointment and they tried to  drive away. That was when the "Set-3" officials arrested them.  The police discovered 14 Kalashnikov rifles and 18 automatic  handguns, most of which were 9 mm, in secret compartments of  their car.    The scope of the operation broadened and the police in  Ankara  were alerted after the impounding of the Kalashnikov rifles and  handguns. The teams of the General Directorate of Police  Smuggling and Intelligence Department, Antiterrorist Department,  and Intelligence Department participated in the operations. The  two suspects, whose names have not been disclosed, refrained  from giving detailed information on their activities during  their first interrogation. However, the officials have  established that the sale of the arms took place in Saudi  Arabia. They were then smuggled into Turkey from Iraq.    The police officials are trying to establish whether or not  the two suspects are linked with the Workers Party of Kurdistan  or the IBDA-C [Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front]. Meanwhile,  considering the possibility that the arms have been smuggled  into Turkey for terrorist activities either in Ankara or  Istanbul, they have launched operations against many suspected  cell houses.</p>

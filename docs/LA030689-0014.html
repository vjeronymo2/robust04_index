			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CRITICALLY BURNED AFTER METALLIC BALLOONS CAUSE POWER LINE TO EXPLODE  </P> <P> Floating metallic balloons hit a power line in South Los Angeles, causing the  line to short circuit and fall on an area resident, who was critically injured,  police said.  </P> <P> Carlos Olivio, 47, suffered third-degree burns after the 4,800-volt line was  brushed by at least one of the helium-filled balloons and fell about 3:15 p.m.  </P> <P> "Like a shotgun blast, the line exploded, then shattered and fell on the  resident and wrapped around his legs," Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ted Spicer said.  </P> <P> A neighbor, Jose Randy, saw Olivio and "in great jeopardy to himself" used a  wooden broom to untangle the man from the live wire, Spicer said. "If it wasn't  for Mr. Randy's quick thinking and actions, the man would have definitely been  dead on the spot."  </P> <P> Spicer said the balloons possibly drifted into the 2200 block of Ellendale  Avenue from nearby festivities for the Los Angeles Marathon. He said  helium-filled metallic balloons have been outlawed in other cities because they  pose a safety hazard, but have not been banned in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Olivio was reported in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center late  Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN CHIEF AWARDED $100,000 GRANT  </P> <P> The president of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks was one of  five college presidents nationwide who has received grants of $100,000 from a  private philanthropic foundation based in Florida.  </P> <P> President Jerry H. Miller received one of the first Knight Foundation  Presidential Discretionary Grants, given to leaders of small liberal arts  colleges.  </P> <P> The money may be spent at Cal Lutheran at his discretion.  </P> <P> Miller and other recipients were not aware that they were being considered for  the award and each received checks on Monday, the day the announcements were  made, said foundation spokeswoman Virginia Henke.  </P> <P> "It came as quite a surprise," Miller said. "We are pleased beyond measure and  see this as an acknowledgment of the progress that Cal Lutheran is making."  </P> <P> Miller said he is considering using the grant for faculty programs, including  research; for student programs; and for applying for matching grants from other  foundations.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran was chosen for its use of computers and other technology  throughout its curriculum, especially in courses where they are not normally  used, such as French, English, history and drama.  </P> <P> The other recipients were Clark-Atlanta University in Atlanta and Johnson C.  Smith University in Charlotte, N.C., both recognized for service to black  students; Ohio Dominican College in Columbus, for addressing the needs of women  and adults, and Sinte Gleska College in Rosebud, S.D., for service to Native  American students and tribal education.

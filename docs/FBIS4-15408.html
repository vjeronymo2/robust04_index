			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vyacheslav Bantin (ITAR-TASS) report in the "Forecast" </F> column: "Boris Fedorov: The Cabinet Has a Chance To Complete  Financial Stabilization. The ex-Minister Is Ready To Rejoin the  Government"]    [Text] Former finance minister Boris Fedorov in an  interview with ITAR-TASS stated that thanks to a fall in the  rate of inflation down to 9.8 percent in February and 8 percent  in March, the government now has a unique chance to complete  successfully the many-month efforts toward financial  stabilization. "The cabinet of ministers has the possibility to  use the emerging results of the policy conducted by the previous  government," the State Duma deputy noted. "It is worrying,  however, that in the last three and a half months the Viktor  Chernomyrdin government has not undertaken a single step that  could be described as reformist."    If the current government continues such a stance, in the  next few weeks a retreat from the economic gains achieved will  become inevitable, Boris Fedorov believes. According to him,  the first sign of this will be the extension of large financial  subsidies to state enterprises, in particular the upcoming  appropriation in April of approximately 3 trillion rubles to  enterprises in the agricultural sector. Such a move, the former  Russian Federation finance minister pointed out, will thwart the  existing possibility to carry though in Russia "the most  painless financial stabilization in world history."    Confirming his prediction that by the end of the year the  rate of the dollar could rise to 10,000 rubles, Boris Fedorov  expressed the opinion that Viktor Chernomyrdin's government will  be able to "last" only until this fall unless it moves from  passive policy to an active course for reform. "If by that time  the cabinet of ministers does not undertake real actions, the  government will at best be reformed," the former Russian finance  minister said. He expressed readiness to rejoin the government  "if the requisite powers are granted" to him.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> 'PURSUIT OF MARVELOUS' EXPLORES MIND OF SURREALIST  </P> <P> A flavorful blend of mysticism, physics, psychology and social commentary  surrounds "Pursuit of the Marvelous" at the Laguna Art Museum. The exhibit  offers a sampling of paintings and prints by three surrealists from foreign  parts who all touched down for long or short spells in California during the  1940s: American expatriate Charles Howard and Englishmen Stanley William Hayter  and Gordon Onslow Ford.  </P> <P> San Francisco was a temporary base for Howard, a summertime hangout for Hayter,  and an adopted home for Onslow Ford. As lecturers, exhibitors and colleagues of  local artists, the trio apparently helped to invigorate an art scene that was  in the process of throwing off its allegiance to realist painting and beginning  a brief love affair with abstraction.  </P> <P> But, oddly enough -- except for some preliminary remarks in the catalogue by  associate curator Susan Anderson -- the California context remains shadowy. The  show, which includes work from the 1930s, '40s and early '50s, does not dwell  on the question of whether the change of scene made any impact on the three  artists' work, and it includes no examples of their legacy in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> On the positive side, the exhibit offers a glimpse of the output of three  mystically inclined individualists, at least two of whom -- Howard and Onslow  Ford -- still have significant claims on our attention.  </P> <P> Howard was born in 1899 in New Jersey to a family of artists and architects who  resettled in Berkeley when he was an infant. In his early 30s he married a  British painter and moved to London, where the tense pre-war climate gave his  work a new sense of foreboding. He spent the war years in the Bay Area, putting  in a stint as a muralist for the Works Progress Administration, exhibiting  widely and lecturing at the California School of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> A buddy of mobile artist Alexander Calder, Howard was also intrigued by making  abstract forms move in space; a critic once called his work "dynamic  architecture." But his mature paintings, dating from his years in London, also  reflect unresolved tensions between chaos and order, between the mystical  energy of natural forces and the limpid clarity of intellectual theory.  </P> <P> Howard's delicate compositions consist primarily of flat and subtly modeled  curving forms jiggered into pinpoint balances. His "architectural" finesse  lends an air of tension and mutability -- an urgency -- to shapes that might  look whimsical in another context.  </P> <P> In "Generation" (1940), crisp orange, brown and white shapes simultaneously  suggest natural imagery, organic matter viewed under the microscope and the  tools of a chemistry lab. "The First Hypothesis" (1946) has more Orwellian  overtones, with its web of fine, nervous line, its contrasts of blood red with  buttoned-up gray and white, and the two huge leaf or blade forms that almost  touch, enclosed within a vaguely mechanical, pulleylike framework.  </P> <P> Onslow Ford left England for the artist's life in Paris in 1936, when he was in  his early 20s, and became a member of the official surrealist group. Under his  and Chilean artist Matta's influence, a new wave of surrealists rejected the  type of "dream" imagery associated with Salvador Dali's figurative work in  favor of abstract explorations of the cosmic unknown.  </P> <P> In 1948, after he had resigned from the group and sojourned in New York and  Mexico, Onslow Ford settled in San Francisco. There, his interests came to  embrace Zen Buddhism, Japanese calligraphy and the notion of art as a way of  meditation. In 1951, he and fellow painters Lee Mullican and Wolfgang Paalen  formed the Dynaton group, dedicated to locating rhythms and forms suggestive of  the great cosmic beyond.  </P> <P> Floating through the luminous spaces of his pre-San Francisco paintings was an  eccentric but orderly landscape of concentric circles, angular floating planes,  grid lines, light beams and blobs of protoplasm -- in his view, an image of  "the secrets contained in the universe of the human mind."  </P> <P> In some paintings, rhythmic patterns of dots aerate the canvas in a visionary  way. "Migrators with Birds" (1944) is somewhat reminiscent of Australian  aboriginal art: Overlapping flat shapes of pale color are laced with tightly  marshaled patterns of daubs, dots and wavy lines, as if to demarcate paths  taken through sacred territories.  </P> <P> Onslow Ford's California paintings in the exhibit are markedly bigger and  baggier, with imagery veiled behind irregular "vertical blinds" of broken  color. The artist believed such works actively promoted a meditative experience  for the viewer.  </P> <P> Serious-minded as it was, this effort is harder to appreciate. In the next  decade, the "light and space" artists would figure out how to evoke meditative  states without interposing the static of specific imagery.  </P> <P> Hayter, who was born in 1901 to a family of artists, studied chemistry and  geology before concentrating wholeheartedly on art. Printmaking was his passion  and challenge. In Paris in the 1920s he founded a print workshop where he  developed several innovative processes and became intrigued by the subconscious  investigations of the surrealists. San Francisco lured him only briefly, in  1940 and 1948, for teaching gigs.  </P> <P> Hayter's big goal was to merge "the unconscious element from which inspiration  comes, and extremely rational control of the methods of execution." Using  clashing, acid-toned colors (considered bizarre at the time), deliberately  ambiguous superimposed images, and intricate webs of line, Hayter aimed to fuse  the concepts of space and time. Viewers who entered the energized fabric of his  prints were to find themselves peering into their "own internal reality."  </P> <P> Although his evident fascination with women in extremis might give rise to pop  psych queries about his relations with the opposite sex, most of Hayter's works  in the exhibit seem ingrown and precious, too fussily concerned with technique  to register on an emotional plane. The major exception is his painting,  "Ophelia," from 1948, in which fiercely ricocheting thick black line and  radiating bursts of red and yellow create a terrifying mask of a face twisted  by madness.  </P> <P>  "Pursuit of the Marvelous: Stanley William Hayter, Charles Howard, Gordon  Onslow Ford" (part of the Festival of Britain, an arts festival and retail  promotion) remains through Jan. 13 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive,  Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.  Admission is $2 general, $1 seniors and students, free for children under 12.  (714) 494-6531.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council,  Valeriy Manilov, suggested that the next meeting of the Security  Council planned for May was likely to focus on issues concerning  the Russian borders.    He said at a press conference today that this was one of the  priorities when ensuring Russia's security.    The second important problem was the Russian brain drain, he  emphasized. Manilov stressed that the Security Council was  trying to solve the problem by non-standard ways with the  participation of all interested organizations.    Manilov suggested that threats to Russia could stem from the  economic problems, inter-ethnic relations within the Russian  Federation and possible social-economic collisions due to the  growing unemployment.    Manilov announced that the Russian Security Council had  recommended that all the interested departments work on problems  concerning Russia joining the NATO Partnership for Peace  program. This analysis and specific proposals on the issue are  expected to be submitted to the Security Council in June.    The issue on the joint U.S.-Russian military exercise in the  Southern Urals (the Totsk training ground) was also carefully  worked on. Manilov said when discussing this both moral and  economic factors must be taken into consideration.    Manilov said the Security Council was preparing radical  proposals on the Black Sea Fleet issue to prevent it becoming a  real danger. "I think the Russian and Ukrainian presidents will  adopt mechanisms for making the final decision on this issue in  the interests of the two countries and their peoples," Manilov  emphasized.</p>

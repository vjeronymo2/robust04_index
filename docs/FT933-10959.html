			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead ON THURSDAY both Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum report their second quarter results. Shell is expected to show a healthy rise in current cost net income from Pounds 516m to about Pounds 760m. Results will have benefited from a weaker pound, stronger natural gas prices in the US, cost-cutting and solid performances from non-OECD countries. The biggest question now hangs over the dividend payment, which will not be announced until September 18. This time last year BP announced a dividend cut and Pounds 835m of post tax exceptional restructuring provisions. For the latest quarter analysts are looking for replacement cost net income of Pounds 240m with a dividend of 2.1p. Abbey National is expected to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 315m after bad debt provisions of some Pounds 160m when it reports its interim results on Monday. It is expected to be hit by provisions on French operations, but show strong mortgage lending in the first half. On Tuesday National Westminster is expected to show profits in the range of Pounds 280m to Pounds 350m with a strong performance anticipated from treasury and capital markets. The bank is likely to cover its interim dividend for the first time since 1989. Midland, whose parent bank HSBC Holdings reports on August 31, is expected to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 200m on Wednesday, while Barclays is expected to show recovery from losses last year to pre-tax profit of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 170m. The interims from Reed Elsevier, the international publishing and information group on Thursday are the first combined results since the merger of Reed International and the Dutch publishers Elsevier took effect at the beginning of the year. That and a change of year end has made analysts wary of forecasts but James Capel is looking for combined pre-tax profits of Pounds 287m compared with Pounds 247m last year.</p>

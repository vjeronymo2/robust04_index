			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DURHAM DANCING;  </P> <P> EVERY YEAR, THIS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY TOWN SHAKES OFF ITS SUMMERTIME SLEEPINESS  TO BECOME THE 'U.S. DEPARTMENT OF MODERN DANCE'  </P> <P> When American Dance Festival executive director Charles Reinhart called Twyla  Tharp to inform her that she had been selected for this year's $25,000 Samuel  H. Scripps/ American Dance Festival Award for lifetime achievement, she  replied: "Can't you just send me the check? Do I have to come down?"  </P> <P> The response can be attributed in part to Tharp's cheeky nature, but it also  spotlights the off-the-beaten-track location of this major festival.  </P> <P> Each summer, hundreds of strikingly attractive young people, the women often in  leotard tops and hair pinned up in chignons, roll into town. Their arrival was  once described as "the invasion of the posture people," a reference to their  carriage, erect to the point of exaggeration.  </P> <P> The students come for classes, the audiences for performances by major  companies. This year's American Masters Plus series included Paul Taylor, Laura  Dean, Eiko and Koma, Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Erick Hawkins, Doug  Varone and Trisha Brown and concludes next weekend with Pilobolus.  </P> <P> For six weeks, Durham becomes what Dance magazine calls the "U.S. Department of  Modern Dance." Because of the Duke  </P> <P> Medical Center and related health-care industries, the city of 100,000 now  calls itself the "City of Medicine," although it is perhaps better known as the  home of the minor-league baseball team immortalized in the film "Bull Durham."  </P> <P> When the dancers hit town, the area just off East Campus shakes off the summer  somnolence that once enveloped Durham: The Regulator Bookshop sells more dance  books, magazines and out-of-town papers; the Ninth St. Bakery sells more  croissants and, most nights, it's nearly impossible to squeeze into  Franchesca's gelato parlor.  </P> <P> A new generation -- '60s-era Duke students who decided they liked Durham enough  to settle in, or to come back to after graduate school -- has begun taking over  the city's political and economic leadership. Many, like Lex Alexander, owner  of a health-food supermarket, have become actively involved in promoting and  supporting the festival. Alexander serves on the board of a local support  group, hosting cast parties and arranging for dancers to eat at the home of  local residents, and organizes audiences for special performances.  </P> <P> "These artists increase the fabric of this community so much," said Alexander,  who each year puts the festival's poster image and schedule on his store's  grocery bags. "At a time when the university is closing down (for the summer),  you get this resurgence of energy, this wonderful influx of people, from all  over this country and the world that are coming to this town to be involved in  this dance happening."  </P> <P> Tonight, when Tharp receives the award -- just before a square dance in a  70-year-old, once-condemned gymnasium on the Duke University campus -- the  contrast with the first such award will be obvious.  </P> <P> That year, 1981, the curtain went up on Duke's 1,500-seat Page Auditorium,  revealing grande dame Martha Graham -- seated alone in her red "Chinese Empress  chair," lit by a single spot on the otherwise darkened stage -- waiting for  former First Lady and Graham dancer Betty Ford to present the award.  </P> <P> "It's what both of them wanted," explained festival director Charles Reinhart.  "And I think that's the point. What does the artist want, and that's what we  try to do. The generation gap -- it explains it very easily -- it's right  there."  </P> <P> But Reinhart doesn't see the award to the 49-year-old Tharp as indicative of a  complete changing of the guard in modern dance. "I don't think that the baton  has been passed to the younger generation totally," he said. "There are people  older than Twyla who will be getting the award. I think this was the year that  Twyla seemed to be on the minds of more of our people than other times, and I  think there's certainly a body of work that justifies it."  </P> <P> The Scripps/ADF winners bracketed by Tharp and Graham include most, if not all,  of the pioneers of American modern dance: Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Hanya  Holm, Alwin Nikolais, Katherine Dunham, Alvin Ailey, Erick Hawkins and -- named  posthumously -- Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Jose Limon. These names are  intertwined with the genesis of the American Dance Festival, which traces its  origins to the summer of 1934 and the founding of the Bennington School of  Dance in Bennington, Vt.  </P> <P> Building on the work of the trio many consider the first generation of modern  dance -- Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn -- Graham and her  contemporaries went to Vermont each summer until 1942 (with one detour to Mills  College in Oakland), to teach, learn and create dances in a free-spirited  atmosphere. After a six-year hiatus, many of the same people reconstituted  themselves as the American Dance Festival on the campus of Connecticut College  in New London, Conn. During the next 29 years, the festival became more  institutionalized, according to a published history written by New York Times  dance critic Jack Anderson.  </P> <P> But in 1977, Connecticut College got a new president who wanted to charge the  festival rent for the first time, and the New London City Council turned down a  request for $7,500 in community development funds. Attendance at the evening  performances was flagging as well, according to Anderson, despite train  connections to New York City and the proximity to Connecticut shore vacation  homes of metropolitan residents.  </P> <P> Reinhart got the message and went shopping for a new home, narrowing the choice  to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the University of Wisconsin at  Milwaukee, and Duke. At the urging of a handful of local dance lovers, Terry  Sanford, then Duke's president (and former North Carolina governor and future  U.S. senator) successfully wooed the festival, in part with the promise of a  $1-million endowment from the Durham-based Liggett Group.  </P> <P> The festival's contribution to American modern dance is considerable. Reinhart  </P> <P> points to more than 300 festival premieres, including Graham's "Diversion of  Angels" (1948), Limon's "The Moor's Pavane" (1949), Merce Cunningham's  "Summerspace" (1958), Taylor's "Aureole" (1962), Tharp's "Sorrow Floats"  (1984), Bella Lewitzky's "Pietas" (1971), "Five" (1974) and "Greening" (1976).  Alvin Ailey's "Masekela Langage" (1969), Tharp's "Medley" (1969) and Pilobolus'  "Untitled" (1975) and "Molly's Not Dead" (1978) -- the last premiering in  Durham -- were also commissioned by the festival. Another Taylor premiere  commissioned by the ADF, "Profiles," was broadcast on public television live  from Durham in 1979 -- the first-ever live PBS broadcast of a new dance work.  </P> <P> Most of Duke's Georgian East Campus, where the festival is headquartered, is  taken over by early June.  </P> <P> In coming to clean and leafy green Durham, the trade-off was the heat and  humidity. Most days by mid-morning, even the best-conditioned,  best-proportioned and most lithe of bodies are shiny with sweat and  flushed-faced.  </P> <P> "I don't mind the humidity," said Stephanie Butler, of Dana Point. "I like to  sweat." The 23-year-old CalArts dance major said she came to Durham because she  wanted an intensive program for the summer and "the ADF seemed like the best  thing." Halfway through the program, she found it "much more rigorous than  anything I've done. . . . It opens up a whole new world of what dance could  be."  </P> <P> In addition to the 300 students -- mostly female and most aged 18 to  thirtysomething -- on campus for the complete $1,000, six-week study sessions,  there are shorter seminars for critics, dance therapists, teachers and  international choreographers. Classes in technique, repertory and choreography  occupy most of the indoor open space on the campus, including dormitory  parlors. One jazz class takes over part of the cafeteria, covering the floor  with a mat. Several weeks ago the class was working through routines,  accompanied by a small tape machine playing "Vogue" -- by 1978 festival alumna  Madonna.  </P> <P> The gym where the Tharp presentation is scheduled was occupied each afternoon  for most of the festival by choreographer Donald McKayle's classes. McKayle,  who now teaches at UC Irvine, attended the first American Dance Festival in New  London in 1948 as a member of the New Dance Group at the age of 18.  </P> <P> "It was a very awesome summer for me as young artist," he said, recalling his  first meeting with Martha Graham. While his students find the current festival  "very nurturing," McKayle said, sometimes it "becomes an overload, almost," and  there is a tendency to "overextend themselves physically."  </P> <P> For many of the students and visiting choreographers and dancers from abroad,  the festival is their most intensive exposure to dance. In addition to classes  during the day, they are given tickets to two evening performances a week.  Promising students spotted by faculty members in class are often steered to  auditions held by companies performing at the festival. Whether the gathering  is international choreographers, dancers, critics or teachers, discussions  invariably touch on emotions, politics and aesthetics, as well as  </P> <P> movement and technique, often in eclectic and unpredictable ways. David Hochoy,  a faculty member, explained to one small group his transition from being a  Graham dancer to a rehearsal director, and the role of the festival: "It's very  hard to go to all of a sudden go from being out there to being behind the  scenes. . . . This is a very intensive teaching process. . . . It made me  change my consciousness."  </P> <P> Glenna Batson, a faculty member specializing in dance and movement therapy,  observed in the same session that "sometimes I think the worst thing that  happened to dance was aerobics. . . ."  </P> <P> ". . . and MTV," Hochoy chimed in.  </P> <P> "In all the concern with fitness," Batson asked, "what happened to art?"  </P> <P> As with most artistic undertakings this season, the battle over the National  Endowment for the Arts has hung heavily over the American Dance Festival. The  governmental funding issue is not an academic one for the festival, which,  since coming to Durham, has received more than $1.5 million -- including  $88,000 this year -- from the NEA, according to associate director (and  Charles' wife) Stephanie Reinhart. (With an annual budget of nearly $2 million,  the festival has been running a deficit of between $100,000-$200,000 in recent  years.)  </P> <P> The festival was concerned with artistic freedom well before the current NEA  crisis. In both form and content, its dances have touched some of society's hot  buttons. Rarely has a season gone by without fully or partially nude dancers of  both sexes. The themes of many others have portrayed rape, adultery, violence  and other challenges to traditional values.  </P> <P> Charles Reinhart has been extremely outspoken and active on the NEA front,  challenging and ridiculing the anti-obscenity guidelines successfully proposed  by North Carolina's senior U.S. senator, Jesse Helms.  </P> <P> Reinhart says he agrees with Los Angeles' Bella Lewitzky, who has compared the  assault on the arts to the McCarthy era, and who recently announced she would  refuse NEA funding rather than sign the current endowment guidelines. Reinhart  said he doesn't know what he will do if the guidelines are continued -- he  signed Helms-worded guidelines this year -- but he was clearly in a fighting  mood, outraged by the recent denial of grants to four performance artists.  </P> <P> When the ADF season began in early June, Reinhart began giving speeches at  performances and made sure the lobbies were stocked with printed materials on  the issue. He also helped organize a rally on the Duke campus -- featuring the  Cleo Parker Robinson Company -- scheduled the day after President Bush visited  the state to raise a million dollars for Helms' reelection campaign.  </P> <P> The state's other senator, Democrat Terry Sanford, who was so instrumental in  bringing the festival to Durham and who is on its board, has been oddly quiet  on the issue of the NEA -- something Reinhart finds troubling in light of the  campaign of former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, Helms' underdog Democratic  challenger.  </P> <P> Reinhart said he wouldn't be surprised to see Gantt run a close race with  Helms. "With Gantt running this time, and clearly stating his views, instead of  trying to move closer to Helms -- on pro-choice, on the arts, etc. -- that  maybe, just maybe. . . ."  </P> <P> If there is an artistic rap these days on the festival, it is that Reinhart has  his favorites, whom he invites back regularly, and that the festival no longer  is at the cutting edge of modern dance or its cousin, performance art. But in  his history, Anderson maintains that once the festival settled in at  Connecticut College, it was never that innovative.  </P> <P> From the start, the most popular of the festival's near-regulars has been the  acrobatic Pilobolus, and their various offspring: Crowsnest, Momix, Martha  Clarke and, this season, Peter Pucci Plus. Some of the other artists  particularly associated with the Durham years include Paul Taylor, Laura Dean  and Eiko and Koma -- the latter appearing more than half a dozen times,  occasionally nude.  </P> <P> "As far as artists are concerned," Reinhart said, "we have to go with the  artists we believe in. . . . It is my firm belief, whether it's Merce  Cunningham or Eiko and Koma or Laura Dean or Erick Hawkins, that audiences will  build for them. We've proved that in 13 years. In the early years, they were  walking out for all those names."  </P> <P> Now, most of their performances this year have sold out or come close to it,  Reinhart said.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of our audiences. They respond to real talent," he said. "Their  openness to new things is much greater now than in the early years. . . . Our  box office does well for Eiko and Koma, (which) is not something you serve as a  first course, but it's a course that you may never forget. . . . If you believe  in something, and you repeat it, the audiences will come."  </P> <P> There has been some grumbling that this year's schedule leans too heavily on  familiar artists performing familiar dances. Taylor, for example, offered  "Arden Court," "Runes" and "Esplanade" -- all quite familiar to Durham  audiences by now. In response, Reinhart says that newcomers to dance and to the  area should also have an opportunity to enjoy the classics.  </P> <P> There are other criticisms. One is that no strong local companies -- apart from  the North Carolina Dance Theater, affiliated with the North Carolina School of  the Arts -- have taken root in the area, and an early program for area  choreographers has lapsed. Another is that, for the remaining 46 weeks of the  year, when the festival is not in town, dance does not draw nearly as strong  audiences or attention in the media.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that no new American dance star or company has emerged from the  festival in recent years, Reinhart points to its move into the international  area.  </P> <P> Modern dance, which Reinhart pairs with jazz as "a basically indigenous  American art form," is now "exploding all over the world," he said. After the  festival closes next Sunday, he and 40 other staff members and dancers,  including the Doug Varone Dance Company and the Dayton Contemporary Dance  Company, are off for a two-week "mini-American Dance Festival" in South Korea.  Two similar sessions were held in Japan in 1984 and 1986, the latter featuring  a Laura Dean premiere. Next year, the ADF plans a similar performance tour to  India. This year, after Korea, the group will attend the first graduation of a  dance program they helped establish in Canton, China.  </P> <P> Numerous dancers, choreographers and companies from abroad have been invited to  Durham to study and perform since 1978. Interestingly, the dances presented by  the festival from the developed world outside the United States -- Europe and  Japan in particular -- often speak in the international language of modern  dance, and are less strongly reflective of their national cultures. Thus,  following an earlier visit to Japan, Reinhart gave American audiences their  first good look at Japanese Butoh ("dark soul") in 1982. By contrast, dancers  from the Third World -- Indonesia, Africa, India and the Philippines -- more  frequently have integrated traditional native forms and melded them with modern  techniques.  </P> <P> For example, Leonid Lebedev, the ballet master of the Mussorgsky Theater in  Leningrad, is one of those who hopes to set up a modern dance wing at his  conservatory -- returning modern dance to Russia 70 years after Isadora Duncan  performed for the Red Army. At one session of dancers from around the world,  involving simultaneous translations in at least six languages, the Russian  choreographer  </P> <P> described the informal atmosphere and the dynamic interaction between artists  as "the glorious system of teaching dance here. I'm amazed by the organization  here. I feel like a person. People treat me like a person."  </P> <P> The American Dance Festival has evolved since 1978, both organizationally and  artistically. As it became more comfortable on the campus, the festival moved  its year-round headquarters south from New York in 1983. When major companies  do three-night runs, they now perform the same program each night, which  Reinhart says is to accommodate local critics and to take advantage of good  word of mouth, as well as to cut production costs. It also has the effect of  limiting the repertory. This year, the North Carolina Symphony is accompanying  most of the performances at Page Auditorium, replacing taped music, a practice  Reinhart hopes to continue. Durham has also changed considerably, becoming  increasingly multicultural, thanks to the concentration of colleges and  universities in nearby Raleigh and Chapel Hill, and the Research Triangle Park.  When the festival arrived, tobacco and textiles were still economic factors,  but in the years since, a new economy has been built almost literally on the  ashes of the old. Today, the red brick shells that once housed cotton mills and  cigarette factories have been leveled or gentrified into shopping centers,  apartments, condominiums and offices. The courtyard of one such upscale  shopping mall, Brightleaf Square, is the setting for annual street opera,  beginning in 1985 with "Carmen," an appropriate choice for a former tobacco  warehouse.  </P> <P> Perhaps with the Connecticut College experience in mind, Reinhart would like to  have a permanent home for the American Dance Festival. The Liggett Group moved  its headquarters from Durham to New Jersey several years after the festival  came, and the promised $1-million endowment never materialized, although  Liggett has been a generous festival supporter.  </P> <P> Reinhart has long hoped that downtown redevelopment, proceeding in fits and  starts and focused on the few remaining tobacco factories and warehouses, may  one day provide the festival with permanent, expanded facilities. Performance  facilities on East Campus are taxed to the limit and some are even more  uncomfortable than necessary, inasmuch as the dancers won't work in an  air-conditioned environment. Administratively, there is a lot to be desired as  well: To get to Reinhart's East Campus office, you have to pass through a  bathroom.  </P></p>

The 45-day comment period on the draft environmental impact statement closed on March 28, 1994. We now anticipate that the notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement will be published in the May 6th issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . It appears, however, that decisions may have to be made before June 5, 1994, the earliest a decision could be issued consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental impact statement_the process for which has to date fully involved the public and included an on-site ``public information meeting''_explores alternatives to reduce the gull hazard to aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport. During each of the past three years beginning in mid-May the potential for gull-aircraft interactions has tended to increase dramatically. We reasonably expect that the potential for gull-aircraft interactions will reach an unacceptable level before June 5, 1994. Thus, a reduction of the required 30-day period between notification of availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance of the records of decision by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, lead agency in the EIS process, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a cooperating agency in the EIS process, is hereby requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If additional information is needed or you have questions concerning this matter, please call me at (301) 436&hyph;8565. Thank you for your consideration of this request. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carl Bausch, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Director, Environmental Analysis and Documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

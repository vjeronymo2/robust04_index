			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the administration of the Russian  president Sergey Filatov has not seen yet the presidential  decree relieving Deputy Prime-Minister Sergey Shakhray of the  duties of the minister for nationalities and regional policy.  In an interview with Interfax he said he was told that such a  document exists.    "I know nothing about the reasons for the decision, if it  was  made," Filatov said. According to his personal viewpoint, the  prevailing tendency now is not to let deputy prime-ministers  have ministerial portfolios. The sphere which Shakhray is in  charge is an especially striking example of the usefulness of  this tendency, Filatov said.</p>

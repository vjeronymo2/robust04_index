			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (2): Platform for historic ambitions - France aspires to a key role in the refashioning of Europe EVER SINCE World War Two the French have been at odds with the Americans. Throughout the Cold War they were at odds with them over the confrontation with the Soviet Union. Today the Cold War is over, but the French are again at odds with the Americans, this time over the architecture of Western Europe. The antagonists are the same but the difference is that now the French have picked an argument where the odds are stacked in their favour. Picking a foreign policy argument has long been a national addiction of the French. They have a romantic view that history gives them a right and a vocation to exercise their influence on the rest of the world. France, they say, is a nuclear power. France is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. France, in short, is an important country. For most of the post-war era, this extravagant effort of national self-assertion was at variance with practical reality, in terms both of France's own strength and of the readiness of the rest of the world to be impressed. Nevertheless, France was able to take advantage of the lethal menace of the Soviet Union, on the one side, and the solidity of all the other members of the Atlantic Alliance, on the other, to claim for herself a unique status of moral independence, as a gratuitous defiance of the domination of the two super-powers. It was a conspicuous gesture of protest at the leadership of the Americans, but the French could not change the the essential characteristics of the international constellation, and their example did not make converts. On the contrary, France's claim to stand aside from the rest of the alliance merely caused constant friction. At moments of supreme emergency, from the Cuba crisis of 1962 to the Euro-missile crisis of 1983, France lined up loyally with the Americans. As soon as the tensions subsided, France once more reclaimed the right to a role of national individuality, but could not make any dent on the reality of American leadership. What has dented American leadership is the earthquake of events in Eastern Europe which has followed the collapse of the Soviet system. But this earthquake, and the trauma of the Gulf War, have also deeply shaken many of the most basic assumptions of the previous foreign policy, not just of France but of all Western countries. In addition, the French have had the special problem of coming to terms with the fact that their previous ambitions were themselves often based on self-deception. The first of these self-deceptions was the deeply-rooted idea that France has a special role and can wield a special influence in the Arab world. In Lebanon, the French persuaded themselves that they had a civilising mission to guarantee the dominance of the Christian community; with Iraq the French believed they had forged a strategic alliance with a friendly state which would play a key role in the stability of the Gulf. The slow realisation that Lebanon is a Syrian, and not a French fiefdom, and the violent revelation that France had no influence whatever on Iraqi expansionism, have both been painful awakenings. The second self-deception was the idea that France would always have special political strengths with which to dominate the Germans. France's former enemy was economically more powerful, but it was divided and politically enfeebled, whereas France was a nuclear power, a notional victor from World War Two, and the proud possessor of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. This illusion of political superiority was rudely shattered by the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, and the unification of the two Germanies. All at once, Germany regained its full sovereignty and France lost its claim to the special status of a former conquering power. All at once, it became more difficult to define the advantages conferred on France by the possession of nuclear weapons. The third illusion is that France is a strong military power in conventional terms. The constant modernisation of France's nuclear triad was only achieved at the expense of its conventional forces. These had appeared entirely adequate for minor adventures in former colonies in Africa; they were revealed to be humiliatingly inadequate for the war in the Gulf. Yet, if the end of the Cold War down-graded the value of a strategic nuclear arsenal, it was likely to place a larger premium on effective conventional forces. French responses to the whirlwind of recent history have often seemed petulant, displaced or anachronistic. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, President Mitterrand continued to proliferate diplomatic initiatives, even though there appeared no reason to expect a diplomatic solution. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Mitterrand appeared to hope that German unification could be delayed, and manifestly did not welcome its implications when he could not prevent it. So long as there was any chance that President Mikhail Gorbachev could retain his ascendancy over the Soviet Union, President Mitterrand was less than welcoming to President Boris Yeltsin. Yet, when the conspirators mounted their abortive coup against Mr Gorbachev, President Mitterrand appeared altogether too ready to accept it as a fait accompli. In view of these fairly spectacular foreign policy fluffs, some people claimed that President Mitterrand had lost his once-famed power of political judgment. Such a sweeping verdict is almost certainly misplaced, but his reflexes may well have been betrayed by his age. In the case of German unification, the key fact was generational: few Frenchmen of the age of Francois Mitterrand would instinctively welcome the full restoration of German sovereignty, even though for conscientious political reasons he had spent all of his presidency forging close political links with Germany. In the case of the abortive Moscow coup, President Mitterrand's essential judgment does not seem significantly different from that of other Western leaders. The key distinction was in the temperature of his commentary: in public he chose to comment on the coup in cold terms, whereas others adopted a vocabulary of heated condemnation. His was the choice of an old man. In contrast with the instability of events and the uncertainty of French responses, the single most constant theme in Francois Mitterrand's foreign policy has been the commitment to the development of European integration, and it has proved a constant stabiliser. France has always been in the forefront of the debate over the future of Community development, but in the 1960s and 1970s the French attitude to Europe was often at best ambiguous. Under the presidency of President Mitterrand, however, almost all the old ambivalence has been cast aside, and in tandem with Germany, France has become the power-house of a new drive for European integration. Their joint drive gathered extra momentum in response to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of Germany. In 1989, the Community was already launched in the direction of Economic and Monetary Union. In 1990, France (and Germany) demanded a further strengthening of the integration process, with a parallel negotiation on Political Union; by the end of 1991 these two negotiations culminated in the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. If the political ambitions of this treaty are fulfilled, it will endow the Community with far-reaching ambitions for a common foreign and security policy, leading one day perhaps to a common defence policy. The Community would thus itself become a world player on the international stage, in competition with the other major powers. But the pursuit of these long-term ambitions for Europe is a direct challenge to the established hierarchy of power in the world, and it is setting France on a collision course with its more traditionally-minded allies, starting with the US. So far the conflict between the two sides has been uncertain and ambiguous. All the Western allies, including the French, have continued to protest that Nato's role, and the American military presence in Europe, remain as essential as ever. Yet, by definition, the disintegration of the Soviet enemy places an unavoidable question mark over the future purpose of the Western alliance. That question mark is only underlined when the Americans seek to invent new peace-keeping roles for Nato which are not provided for in the Atlantic Treaty, in a transparent effort to prop up its uncertain credibility. But these declarations of allegiance to Nato have not dissuaded the French (and the Germans) from pressing ahead with plans to endow Europe with the power of political, and perhaps one day military, action. In the wake of the Gulf War the countries of Western Europe proposed to strengthen their military cooperation in the long-dormant Western European Union; the US State Department immediately issued an intemperate protest at what it saw as a direct challenge to the role of Nato. Yet the new Nato strategy agreed at the Rome summit in November 1991 included approving references to the role of specifically European forces. This year, France and Germany announced the setting up of a joint corps as the kernel of a future European army. American officials again protested that the new unit would weaken Nato, and could only be employed with Nato's permission. The paradox of these American protests is that the French drive for a more integrated Europe must eventually lead them to abandon their traditional claim to a separate and independent defence policy. As it is, the French have endorsed the merit of integrated military forces, both in principle at the Nato summit, and in practice in the project for a Franco-German corps. The long-term objective of a European defence policy clearly implies a French readiness to subordinate their national defence to the common European interest. What the French have not endorsed, of course, is the general principle that Europe's defence should be subordinated to the judgment and the interests of America. This issue is likely to sustain the friction between France and America, at least until the US accepts the idea that Europe's interests are separate and may well be different.</p>

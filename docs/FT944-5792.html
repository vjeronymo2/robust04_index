			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): Concept slow to catch on  -Germany / Andrew Fisher on the uphill struggle for institutions Persuading owners of German companies to part with control so that managers can purchase a shareholding and take over has been an uphill struggle for banks and finance houses keen to promote management buy-outs. Until recently, the concept of the buy-out (and the buy-in) made slow progress in a country which puts industrial performance far ahead of financial innovation. But MBOs are steadily gaining ground, even though they are never likely to be as commonly accepted as in the UK or the US. One reason is the lack of so-called exit possibilities. Because of the slow pace of new issues on the German stock market and the reluctance of many companies to go through the listing process, it is hard for those financing MBOs to make a profit through share flotations. 'It's a real shortcoming for the German financial scene that it still has an underdeveloped stock market,' says Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, head of 3i Deutschland. On the transaction side, however, the trend has certainly become more buoyant. 'A lot has happened in the past few years,' says Thomas Krenz of Schroders and Partner in Germany, part of Schroder Ventures of the UK. 'Compared with 1989 or 1990, the market has become much stronger and more active.' Not only have German banks dropped their initial scepticism over this form of financing, but there are also now more foreign institutions with promising deals available, such as Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. 'The market will get better in the long term,' adds Mr Krenz, 'but I don't think a buy-out culture will develop as it has done in the UK.' Also encouraged by recent trends, but more positive about the outlook in coming years, is Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen. 'This year, 3i has had its best result in Germany so far,' he says. In the first 10 months of 1994, 3i (part of the 3i group of the UK) has carried out 14 buy-outs compared with nine in the same period of last year. Next year, he expects 3i to do more deals and forecasts the total number of MBO deals will expand by some 30 per cent annually over the longer term. The 3i deals cover companies with turnover ranging between DM15m and DM260m, the value of the transactions being from DM10m to DM120m. 'Businessmen are seeing that management buy-outs and buy-ins are quite normal now and a normal part of the mergers and acquisitions market. Now, they don't simply say they will sell to another company.' More companies are now coming to 3i on their own initiative - 'the word has got around that MBOs can be an attractive solution'. Along with this greater readiness to consider the idea has come more openness about letting deals be known. 'Previously, the problem was that companies did not want to have them publicised,' adds Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen. 'This year, we've done a lot of very, very interesting transactions and some of the companies want them publicised.' This gradual dropping by sellers of their reticence to let the rest of the community know what price they had obtained for their businesses can only help spread the MBO message. Among the buy-outs handled by 3i this year are: Offset Gerhard Kaiser, a high-quality printing concern with turnover of DM65m; Passport-Modevertrieb, a fashion house with DM75m turnover; and Ama Holding (furniture) with DM20m. 3i has also just concluded a deal involving a much bigger company - based in Bavaria, with turnover of DM260m - about which it can give no details, except that it is a world market leader in its area of manufacturing and highly profitable. 3i's most recent deal led to the formation of Brahms Diagnostika, the former diagnostic services division in Germany (with DM42m turnover) of Dow Chemical of the US. Although several institutions have pulled out of the German MBO market after entering with high hopes, Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen says others have come in. One of the best-established is Schroders which led one of Germany's biggest buy-outs, that of Ex-Cell-O, the machinery company, in 1987. This year, it has carried out another sizable buy-out, that of the all-terrain vehicle company of the Kassbohrer group. That deal was one of the five biggest MBOs to have occurred in Germany to date, says Mr Krenz. The company has a turnover of DM170m and is very profitable. Schroders has done four deals this year, the others involving companies in the automotive, fireproof tiling and paint equipment sectors. Now that the recession in Germany has ended, more companies are coming back into the market, adds Mr Krenz. They are looking to offload subsidiaries that are not central to their activities but which are now in better financial shape to sell than a year or so ago. Also, the imminent 7.5 per cent solidarity tax surcharge (to help pay for German unification costs) is prompting owners to try and sell their businesses before this comes into effect next year. The German MBO total for 1994 should exceed 60 deals compared with around 50 in 1993, Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen reckons. In the absence of exit possibilities through the stock market, the main method of cashing in on successful MBOs is by trade sales to other companies. Susan Deacon, assistant director of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital in the UK, says the existence of a more developed stock market would help the MBO scene. 'We are very conscious with German buy-outs that exits are not easy.' So far, Morgan Grenfell has not transacted any German MBOs, but it is looking hard for the right deals. Its powerful parent, Deutsche Bank, invested in its previous buy-out fund and is putting Pounds 30m (next to Morgan Grenfell's pounds Pounds 70m) into its latest Pounds 300m fund. Of that total, around a quarter will go into western European buy-outs, mainly French and German. The entrepreneurs are there, she says. It is just that the right deals take time to find. That is a problem with which Morgan Grenfell's competitors are all too familiar.</p>

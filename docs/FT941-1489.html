			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Gillette rejects rescue offer Gillette, the US consumer products group at the centre of a row over plans to transfer production from Spain, yesterday insisted it would go ahead with plans to close the Spanish factory. The Socialist regional government of Andalucia said it had offered to finance the investment required to maintain the razor-blade plant at Alcala de Guadaira near Seville, but the US company had refused the offer. Mr Francisco Oliva, chief regional employment official, said the Andalucian authorities would ask the European Commission to investigate Gillette's plan to move production to plants in Berlin and Isleworth, west London. After separate meetings yesterday with Gillette management and employees at the factory, he said the company was under an obligation to try to reach an agreement with its workforce and if it failed to do so might be liable to penalties. Spanish officials claim that the Spanish subsidiary, which made a pre-tax profit of Pta700m (Pounds 3.36m) last year, does not meet the legal criteria in Spain for justifying collective redundancy. No further meetings between the company and local authorities have been scheduled. The Boston-based group said its decision to close the Spanish operation, which employs just under 250, was part of a plan announced earlier this year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, which was the result of improved manufacturing facilities. The restructuring is due to affect 2,000 jobs worldwide, mostly outside the US. The UK and German plants had been 'integrated into facility upgrading', but the Spanish plant had older technology and was still geared to making fixed-head blades. 'Berlin and Isleworth can take care of western Europe very nicely,' a Gillette spokesman said. The company denied it was engaged in 'social dumping' by shipping production to Russia, Poland and China, where wages were much lower. Its ventures in these countries were unconnected with the European market.</p>

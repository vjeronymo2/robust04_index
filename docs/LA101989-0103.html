			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICK OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> The Vista Docents hold free tours of the historic Vista Del Arroyo Hotel, now  headquarters for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, at 10 a.m. on the third  Friday of the month. Tours of the hotel, 125 S. Grand Ave., Pasadena, last an  hour.  </P> <P> The hotel was taken over by the Army during World War II and was later used for  government offices. By 1978, it was in such disrepair that it was closed.  </P> <P> When it was reopened as headquarters for the court in February, 1986, a group  of lawyers' and judges' wives organized as the Vista Docents to conduct the  tours. Renovation, which has cost $10 million, is continuing.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Lufthansa fined The Philippines Supreme Court has found German airline Lufthansa guilty of turning away a Filipino passenger with a valid ticket to Africa. It ordered the airline to pay him Dollars 23,200 in damages, reports Reuter. The court said the carrier's failure to fulfil its obligations to a former Philippine Central Bank director on his way to Malawi was aggravated by the rude behaviour of a Lufthansa employee in Bombay. The customer was 'bumped' by Air Kenya, with which Lufthansa has a pooling agreement, on a flight from Bombay to Nairobi. The Lufthansa officer in Bombay threw down the man's passport when asked to help, the court said. The court said that under an arrangement between members of the International Air Transport Association, Lufthansa guaranteed that carriers like Air Kenya would honour customers' connecting flights. '(His) trip by several successive carriers is regarded as a single operation' of the German airline, the court said, explaining its ruling against the airline.</p>

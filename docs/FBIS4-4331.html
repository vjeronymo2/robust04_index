			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Washington and  Pyongyang recently exchanged letters clarifying their respective  positions on international inspection of North Korea's nuclear  facilities and a fresh high-level meeting.    Diplomatic sources here said Wednesday that Assistant  Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert  Gallucci sent a letter to North Korean Vice Foreign Minister  Kang Sok-chu several days ago, saying a third round of  high-level talks would not take place unless Pyongyang met two  previously agreed conditions -- full inspection of nuclear sites  at Yongbyon and an exchange of envoys between North and South  Korea.    Gallucci and Kang headed their respective delegations to the  previous two rounds of high-level U.S.-North Korean political  negotiations.    The letter contained no fresh offers but urged Pyongyang to  allow additional International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  checks of its nuclear facilities, while reaffirming the U.S.  position on further talks, a source said.    Gallucci wrote the letter in reply to a missive sent by Kang  in the middle of March.    In his letter, Kang urged Washington to hold a third round  of  talks as agreed, noting North Korea had permitted IAEA  inspections.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told South Korean  correspondents here that further high-level U.S.-North Korean  talks would not be held until Pyongyang complied with the coming  UN Security Council action, be it a resolution or a statement.    "I don't think it necessary for Washington to have prior  consultations with Pyongyang regarding additional IAEA  inspections, "He added, suggesting that the resumption of  dialogue depends on whether Pyongyang changes its mind on the  nuclear issue.</p>

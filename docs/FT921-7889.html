			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Treuhand to expand paper issue GERMANY'S Treuhand privat-isation agency plans to double the successful commercial paper programme it began last year. The expansion by DM5bn to DM10bn of the short-maturity paper, which has a low federal government risk, takes place against the background of DM30bn in new debt issued this year by the Treuhand. The agency predicted a very positive market response to the new issue. Last year's initial Treuhand issue in the newly launched German commercial paper market was well accepted by both German and foreign institutional investors. The agency said commercial paper was a particularly flexible and cost-effective form of borrowing as interest rates were on average 0.20 per cent (20 basis points) lower than money market loans. This added up to a saving of DM8m on a DM4bn issue. The number of banks offering the paper has been extended to 11 from seven. Dresdener Bank is arranging the issue, with Deutsche Bank as co-arranger. The Treuhand is unable to engage in medium-term borrowing until a new law is passed regulating the listing of its securities for trading on the German stock exchanges. The law is expected to be enacted in July. The agency also announced that privatisation would be completed this year in the east German food-processing industry, the first important sector of the economy to achieve this goal.</p>

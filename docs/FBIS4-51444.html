			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Fang </F> Jin (2455 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- State leaders including  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Zhu Rongji received the  third batch of advisers on Hong Kong affairs and the newly  appointed members of the Preliminary Working Committee for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.    President Jiang Zemin gave an important speech. After warmly  congratulating them, he said: Time flies fast. Many urgent  tasks remain to be done at a faster pace because in three years  China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong.    He pointed out: The CPC Central Committee has already  formulated a series of important principles and policies on the  administration of Hong Kong after 1997. Deng Xiaoping pointed  out sincerely as early as a decade ago that Chinese people in  Hong Kong have the ability to administer Hong Kong well and that  not believing this is the case is an idea left over by the old  colonialism. We have full confidence that people in Hong Kong  will administer Hong Kong well. He said that Hong Kong's  economic stability and prosperity today are inseparable from the  Hong Kong people's diligence and creativity. This was true in  the past and remains so today. The people of Hong Kong will  surely be able to create a bright future for Hong Kong. Of  course, Hong Kong's economic stability and prosperity can not be  separated from the mainland's economic development either.    Jiang Zemin said in conclusion: One important purpose of  setting up the preliminary committee and inviting Hong Kong  affairs advisers is to provide a chance and channel for Hong  Kong people to participate in the cause for a smooth transition  in Hong Kong and to lay a foundation for the realization of  "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He expressed  the hope that all the Hong Kong people will care for the affairs  related to China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and  for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, because  these are closely connected with the interests of the Hong Kong  people. He also expressed the hope that the advisers and  members of the preliminary committee will increase their  contacts with the mainland and facilitate the Hong Kong people's  participation in the cause so as to make full preparations for  the coming of 1997.    Also present at today's reception were Zou Jiahua, Qian  Qichen, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei, Lu Ping, and Zhou Nan.</p>

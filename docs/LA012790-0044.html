			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: BRIDE'S LOSES ITS READERS BUT HAS NO COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> In the magazine business, the phrase hot book is tossed around quite a bit. A  "hot book" is a magazine that is doing especially well -- picking up  circulation, selling lots of ads. "Hot books" are generally perceived as being  hip, ultra-cool, on the cutting edge of fashion and social style.  </P> <P> With that in mind, it is interesting to note that a certain magazine has just  published the biggest single issue in the history of consumer magazines. The  magazine contains 1,034 pages -- think about that -- and is stuffed with  advertising. A hot book, indeed.  </P> <P> And what is this magazine?  </P> <P> Bride's.  </P> <P> That's correct -- Bride's magazine. The current issue, with its 1,034 pages, is  bigger than the Seattle telephone book. Bride's, which has been around for 56  years, is seldom mentioned as a hot magazine.  </P> <P> After all, instead of covering the newest after-hours Manhattan clubs, or the  most talked-about performance artists in New York, Bride's features stories  with titles such as "Beautiful Bouquets" and "Watch Out! Don't Let Dry Cleaning  Ruin Your Wedding Gown." But apparently the audience is there; at $5 per copy,  Bride's expects to sell 600,000 copies of the latest issue.  </P> <P> I got in touch with Millie Martini Bratten, associate editor of Bride's, who  said that other people might be surprised at the hugeness of the magazine --  but to her and other staff members, it makes perfect sense.  </P> <P> "For starters, every issue of our magazine is really three magazines in one,"  she said. "We help couples go through the engagement period and plan their  wedding. Then there's a part of each issue that talks about romantic honeymoon  destinations -- that part of our magazine is bigger than most travel magazines.  And a third part of each issue is about when the new bride and groom arrive  home and set up house."  </P> <P> But all magazines try to compartmentalize -- if compartmentalization was the  whole story, every magazine would be as bulky as Bride's. Obviously, there is  something else going on.  </P> <P> "There is," Bratten said. "Unlike some other magazines, Bride's is not seen as  a whim to its readers. They want that information right now."  </P> <P> The readers of Bride's are women -- and some men -- who are planning to get  married. Because of this, the readership is constantly vanishing and then being  replaced. The magazine's editors have studied this.  </P> <P> "We have a complete turnover in readership every seven or eight issues,"  Bratten said. The magazine is printed every other month -- six times a year.  "Fifteen months is the length of the average engagement," she said. If that  seems long to you, trust her -- the people at Bride's seem to know everything  there is to know about weddings.  </P> <P> "The average wedding costs $13,021," she said. "That's for the clothing, the  ceremony and reception -- everything but the honeymoon. The average honeymoon  is $2,515."  </P> <P> And the reason the magazine is so fat with ads, she said, is that Bride's is  being read by an audience that does not have to be persuaded to part with its  money. "Our advertisers know that our readers will be buying a great deal of  goods and services over a fairly brief period of time," she said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, though, the success of Bride's does not have as much to do with  demographics or advertising reach as it does with something more intangible.  </P> <P> "For everything that has changed in our world, a wedding is still the most  important day in a woman's life," Bratten said. "A wedding is pageantry, it is  a multigenerational celebration. Brides-to-be still have an ideal of what they  want their weddings to be. They want their weddings to be perfect."  </P> <P> In these allegedly cynical times, those words might seem out of date to some.  But just as the readership of Bride's completely replaces itself every 15  months, so too new generations of starry-eyed brides-to-be keep coming along.  It never stops.  </P> <P> "I just talked to a friend of mine who lives in Los Angeles," Bratten said.  "She's 42, she's very successful, and she's getting married for the first time.  And she's just like a schoolgirl. She tells me, 'I've waited so long for this  -- I want everything to be just so. I want everyone who loves me, and everyone  I love, to be at the wedding.' "  </P> <P> After which she will undoubtedly stop reading Bride's. To be replaced  immediately by someone else who at this very moment might not even know what  her new favorite magazine will soon be.  </P></p>

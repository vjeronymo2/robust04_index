			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: RAISING A BURNING QUESTION  </P> <P> Mrs. P. Henry of Huntington Park needs to find a plastic or cloth cover,  preferably in green or gold, for a four-slice toaster that measures 11x9x6 1/2  inches. Can you help and be the toast of the Henry household, or will she take  a slow burn after taking a lot of heat for airing such a crummy request?  </P> <P> Liz Gallett of Ontario wonders where she can find sour pickles similar to those  that Del Monte used to make (but evidently doesn't any more). Can you help  Gallett out of this particular pickle before she gets a sour taste in her  mouth, or will she have to continue racking her brine for something else to  spice up her life?  </P> <P> For the several women looking for Magic Lady panties, we have a number of  mentionable sources. Pauline Samuels of Pauline's Girdle and Lingerie Shop,  8815 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, says she carries them in many sizes (she also  has difficult-to-find bras and girdles); Shirlie B. Ravich of Culver City also  suggested Pauline's. Betty Fahrenbach of Morro Bay says Old Pueblo Traders,  3740 E. 34th St., Tucson, Ariz. 85726-7800, lists Magic Lady in its catalogue  at $12.50 each.  </P> <P> Rosabelle Gunefson of San Diego says an item called Fully, which she says is  quite similar to Magic Lady, is made by Exquisite Form Industries, Pelham  Manor, N.Y. 10803. And Mae Johnson of Los Angeles says her sister gets Magic  Lady from Kraus Department Stores, 1201 Canal St. (at Basin Street), in New  Orleans.  </P></p>

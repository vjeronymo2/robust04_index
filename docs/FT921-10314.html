			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Resignation of finance director from troubled Attwoods ATTWOODS, the waste man-agement company which recently made a Pounds 80m rights issue to cut debt, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Stuart Lee as finance director. His departure had been widely expected following the deeply-discounted rights issue in October, which had to be revised after objections from institutional shareholders. Attwoods admitted then that it had suffered a 'credit crunch' after borrowing short-term funds to make acquisitions, and then failed to get borrowings rolled over when one of its US banks went under. The board has appointed a finance committee chaired by Mr Les Haworth, a non-executive director of Attwoods who is also chief financial officer of Laidlaw, the Canadian waste management and school transport group that owns a 29.9 per cent stake in the British company. Mr Haworth, a chartered accountant who was born and educated in Britain, will oversee the financial management of Attwoods until a new finance director is appointed, which is expected shortly. Mr Ken Foreman, chairman and chief executive of Attwoods, said the group might appoint another non-executive director. Three Laidlaw executives joined the board after the rights issue, including Mr Donald Jackson, chief executive of the Canadian group. Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman of ADT, also stepped down as non-executive director. Laidlaw acquired its initial stake in Attwoods in 1989 from ADT, the Bermuda-based car auction and security group. Sir Denis Thatcher is expected to continue as deputy chairman. Mr Foreman said trading conditions continued to be tough, although all but one of the group's divisions were ahead of last year's levels. Attwoods said Mr Lee, who joined the group in 1990 from Pleasurama, had left to pursue other business interests.</p>

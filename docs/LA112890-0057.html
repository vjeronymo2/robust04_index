			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BRODERICK CASE IN LIMBO BUT THE LEGAL BATTLES CONTINUE  </P> <P> In Superior Court, Betty Broderick appears headed for retrial.  </P> <P> Once again she can portray Dan Broderick as a cruel father and treacherous  husband who pushed her to violence.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the San Diego County Bar Assn., as part of its overall building fund  drive, has gathered $50,000 from lawyers and others for its Daniel T. Broderick  III Memorial Fund.  </P> <P> The money will be used to refurbish a meeting room to be renamed in Broderick's  honor at the association's headquarters in downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> An oil painting of Broderick may adorn the room. More than 100 big-name firms  and practitioners have asked to be listed on a plaque as friends of Broderick.  </P> <P> But a mild dissent to the Broderick memorial has now been raised from an  unlikely source.  </P> <P> Not from a feminist attorney or a criminal-defense lawyer, but rather from a  49-year-old retired Air Force pilot turned San Diego business and tax lawyer.  </P> <P> In a letter to the bar association magazine, Joseph E. Driscoll said that Dan  Broderick's death was "the culmination of uncontrolled mental and physical  violence" involving both parties.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, his professional competence is in question because of the  domestic violence, all of which affected their children -- thus making  debatable his compassion as a caring and loving father. So, what did we really  know about him?"  </P> <P> Driscoll, who has practiced in San Diego for two years, suggested that the  Broderick fund be used to "assist all who suffer from domestic violence."  </P> <P> In a response that was longer than Driscoll's letter, bar association President  Virginia Nelson said that Broderick is being honored for his legal career. She  also noted the bar's work with the Domestic Violence Prevention Program.  </P> <P> Driscoll says he appreciated Nelson's response but that it did not satisfy his  concerns.  </P> <P> He says he continues to be concerned about a profession that sometimes puts a  higher value on courtroom victories than on morality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Things Never Change  </P> <P> Locals only.  </P> <P> * Crying Wolfe?  </P> <P> As Times reporter John Glionna pointed out this week, San Diego surf-turf wars  are as real today as they were when Tom Wolfe wrote about the Pump House Gang.  </P> <P> If you believe Surfer magazine, the latest battle pits Point Loma locals  against surf team members from Point Loma Nazarene College in the waves off  Sunset Cliffs.  </P> <P> Says a letter purportedly signed by one Pat (Smedley) Phillips:  </P> <P> "Remember what you're getting into when you paddle out, and don't be a fool.  Localism lives like soul surfing. And a special note to all you PLNC goons:  Beware. . . . Take my advice and stay" away.  </P> <P> * First the route of the San Diego Marathon, set for Dec. 9, was changed  because the marathon could not get permission to run through Del Mar.  </P> <P> Now the route of Saturday's 50-mile Glendale Federal Bank Holiday Bowl Bicycle  Tour also has been changed.  </P> <P> In past years, the bike tour has gone up the coast highway from La Jolla to  Encinitas and back. This year it will loop through less-scenic Clairemont and  Miramar instead.  </P> <P> Unlike the marathon, the bike tour did not get a turndown from Del Mar. But  organizers decided to make the change anyway to avoid hassles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Out With the Odd  </P> <P> In Lemon Grove, it's against the law to molest an elk. Also, pool halls in  Lemon Grove must be equipped with spittoons.  </P> <P> Both laws, musty leftovers from the turn of the century, are being repealed  next month.  </P> <P> I know this because of San Diego attorney Vaughan de Kirby, whose specialties  include finding the absurdities of the law.  </P> <P> For example, he discovered that San Francisco has a leash law for elephants.  </P> <P> De Kirby tried to see if San Diego has a similar rule. He was told he would  have to bring a test case to determine if the city ordinance applies.  </P> <P> "I guess we'll never know. I don't have access to an elephant."  </P></p>

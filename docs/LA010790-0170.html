			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCALE OF PANAMA CORRUPTION HUGE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: NEW REGIME TARGETS 300 EX-OFFICIALS. RECORDS INDICATE 20% OF THE  BUDGET WENT TO GRAFT.  </P> <P> Combing through the ruins of Manuel A. Noriega's dictatorship, Panamanian  investigators have prepared more than 300 cases of corruption against former  officials accused of bleeding the treasury through padded payrolls, illegal  procurements and other embezzlement schemes.  </P> <P> Evidence from the records that escaped systematic destruction by Noriega's  fleeing supporters suggests that at least one-fifth of Panama's national budget  was pilfered on salaries of political appointees who showed up at work only to  collect paychecks, according to officials of the new U.S.-installed government.  </P> <P> With Noriega in American custody and out of the country, Panamanians are  turning their attention to the mess he left behind and how to clean it up.  Officials looking into the files say they are finding the scale of corruption  far greater than they imagined.  </P> <P> "Don't congratulate me," Mayor Guillermo Cochez told a well-wisher Thursday,  the morning after invading U.S. troops took Noriega prisoner. "It's all  craziness here. The public administration of the Noriega regime was based only  on seeing how much they could steal. And what they stole was incredible."  </P> <P> After a week at City Hall, Cochez has asked the new prosecutor to file charges  in two corruption cases against his predecessor, Mayor Jilma Noriega, who once  claimed to be a relative of Gen. Noriega but no longer does.  </P> <P> In one case, she is accused of leasing a municipally-owned gasoline station to  the Shell Oil Co. for 1/30th of the rent required by law, on the condition that  Shell sublease it at a similar rate to a local company owned by one of her  relatives.  </P> <P> The other alleged scheme was more brazen. For the past four years, Cochez  charged, Mayor Noriega personally raked off half the municipal tax payments  delivered to City Hall each January -- about $10,000 per day for each day of  the month.  </P> <P> Armed with photos and newly discovered lists of people in Noriega's  paramilitary Dignity Battalions, the new mayor has begun to fire potential  troublemakers from the municipal payroll. In addition, he is working to  identify and eliminate phantom workers who drew salaries while doing no work.  </P> <P> The sudden purges, also under way in 12 government ministries, have put  President Guillermo Endara's administration at odds with union leaders once  supportive of Noriega. The conflict is already poisoning the wave of relief  felt generally in Panama after Noriega's departure.  </P> <P> Panama's justice system, corrupted during 21 years of military rule, is being  revamped to settle such disputes and to try the growing docket of corruption  cases. But judicial reform has been delayed, and complicated, by the sabotage  of Supreme Court records the day after Noriega's ouster in the Dec. 20 U.S.  invasion.  </P> <P> Court workers have told Panamanian investigators that they saw one or more  Supreme Court magistrates setting fire to their own files. A blaze swept  through the court offices, on the top floor of the four-story Justice Ministry  headquarters, destroying most of the case records.  </P> <P> "What the fire didn't destroy the fire hoses did," said Cesar Quintero, one of  eight newly appointed magistrates on the nine-member court. "This wasn't the  work of common looters but high-level officials. They did this to make the new  court's work difficult and to destroy old cases of justice being rigged and  sold out."  </P> <P> Throughout the white colonial justice building, now abandoned, are computers,  photocopiers, fax machines and filing cabinets methodically smashed with axes  and iron bars. The new Supreme Court magistrates, who are to name lower court  judges, are still looking for new quarters.  </P> <P> Three other badly damaged agencies have been unable to reopen, including the  Finance Ministry, where Noriega supporters mined the elevators with explosives  before leaving. Col. Pasqual Gonzalez, the head of civil aviation,  booby-trapped his own desk.  </P> <P> "The order to the Dignity Battalions was to level the land, like Attila the  Hun, destroy everything," said an investigator for the new government.  </P> <P> Even so, he said, about 40 tons of files salvaged from government offices and  homes of Noriega supporters have been taken to American military bases in  Panama for scrutiny by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA.  </P> <P> American troops are also holding more than 50 top Panamanian military and  civilian officials at a high-security jail on one of the bases. They are being  questioned for information to bolster the federal drug-trafficking and  money-laundering indictments against Noriega in Florida.  </P> <P> The 300 criminal cases being prepared by Panamanian authorities are based on  evidence gathered by the controller general, Panama's chief fiscal  investigator, and sent to the attorney general. Both men were named by  President Endara.  </P> <P> The controller's oceanfront skyscraper headquarters sustained more than $1  million in damage when rocket-firing U.S. helicopters tried to blow up the  National Radio studios, lodged on a high floor. The building's rooftop power  plant was destroyed instead, but the ground-floor computer room, a treasure  chest of financial information, survived.  </P> <P> Officials there said that about half the cases sent to the prosecutor's office  last week had been investigated during Noriega's seven years in power but  shelved on orders of his Panama Defense Forces.  </P> <P> Many of the cases center on the growing economic power of the now-disbanded  Defense Forces, which took profits out of everything from vehicle registration  to import-export trade and became even wealthier as U.S. economic sanctions  against Noriega drove the rest of the country into a deep recession.  </P> <P> "There's everything in those files," an investigator said. "Widespread  corruption, money laundering, contraband, graft, payola. . . . It was a big  business!"  </P> <P> While such practices had become well-publicized political grievances against  Noriega, Panamanian officials said they are no less stunned by what they have  found. They said it has deepened their conviction that the U.S. intervention  was justified.  </P> <P> "The extent of the corruption was more than we thought," Controller General  Ruben Carles said in an interview. "We didn't know how deeply the military was  involved (in the economy). Now we are seeing this monstrosity from the inside.  The possibilities of getting these people out (of power) except by force would  have been zero."  </P> <P> He said that the Defense Forces used the National Bank of Panama, which is now  under investigation, to conceal their financial dealings "with overdrawn  accounts, phony loans, destroying of documents that were backing up loans and  concessions."  </P> <P> In the first major embarrassment for the new administration, Col. Roberto  Armijo was forced to resign last week as chief of Panama's new Capital Public  Security Force after auditors discovered that he and members of his family had  more than $1.2 million in certificates of deposit in that bank.  </P> <P> Another entity under investigation is Transit S.A., a private company managed  by Carlos Duque, Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate in the elections  of last May.  </P> <P> Transit was authorized to impose a "service fee" on most trade through the  Colon Free Zone (a merchandise transshipment facility, free of customs duties)  and turned the revenues -- $275 million a year, according to U.S. sources --  over to Noriega's family and a few high-ranking military officers. The company  has been taken over by the state and the fee has been eliminated.  </P> <P> While Duque remains at large, new information on Transit is coming from Rafael  Ceballos, his top deputy at the company for 18 years. In an interview two weeks  ago, before surrendering to U.S. and Panamanian authorities in Colon, Ceballos  said that he kept records of "every single check" and is willing to spill the  company's secrets.  </P> <P> While a full picture of corruption under Noriega will take months to emerge,  several government officials said it was far more costly to Panama than the  U.S. sanctions aimed at getting rid of him. The total value of Panama's economy  shrank 40% in 1988 and 1989, after the sanctions were imposed, and unemployment  climbed to at least 30%.  </P> <P> As it seeks $1.2 billion in emergency aid from the United States, the Endara  government is scrambling to eliminate phantom employees and thus save hundreds  of millions of dollars in salaries.  </P> <P> Such an employee is known here as a botella, or bottle. Some Panamanians say  the term is meant to suggest an empty bottle, something that has outlived its  usefulness; others say it stems from the image of a bum drinking booze from a  bottle instead of working.  </P> <P> The presidential palace payroll, at the time of the American invasion, was  top-heavy with bottles, according to Miguel Batista, the new vice minister  there.  </P> <P> Of 360 employees, he said, the first 47 below Noriega's handpicked president,  Francisco Rodriguez, did not work in the palace. All earned between $1,500 and  $3,000 per month and held such titles as "coordinator of planning" and  "executive assistant." Some were union leaders who really worked elsewhere and  drew two or more salaries.  </P> <P> "These are the only ones we've discovered so far in this ministry because they  are notorious cases," Batista said, studying a computer printout of the  payroll. "We are going to keep investigating, and surely more botellas will  appear. In all government institutions, we've found this phenomenon."  </P></p>

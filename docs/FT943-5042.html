			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No alternative to slowing consumption Sir, The recipe prescribed by Ambassador Clayton Yeutter (' 'Gatting' the greens', August 2), that nations 'become richer' first by letting their middle class rip before worrying about environmental issues, is the stock-in-trade of those who want to have the cake and eat it. Not only is it erroneous, it also gives licence to the continuation of the ongoing environmental plunder. This line of thought assumes that it is only the middle class which cared about our environment. It makes no sense without blotting out the historical fact that it is precisely as a result of the 'growth' of the (west's) middle class that we are now in this environmental mess. Surely, plugging for more of the same, encouraging non-OECD peoples to adopt a 'destroy first, rebuild later' mentality, is, to put it mildly, irresponsible. It is true that to tell non-OECD peoples not to consume the remaining resources without substantially (note: I don't say 'fundamentally') changing our pattern of consumption is like telling others not to eat the fruits left in the common garden while we are not prepared even to slow down the rate at which we gobble them up. It is just as hypocritical to talk of 'growth' and 'expansion' while professing concern about the environment. If we are sincere, we have no alternative other than to do the complete opposite: slow down our consumption rate. Then, we reason with non-OECD peoples to preserve what is left of their resources.

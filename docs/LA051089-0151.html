			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARGENTINA'S SABATINI BEATS GOLARSA IN ITALIAN OPEN  </P> <P> Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina overpowered Laura Golarsa of Italy  6-2, 6-2 today to move into the third round of the $300,000 Italian Open  women's tennis championships.  </P> <P> Sabatini, the defending champion who is ranked No. 3 in the world, overwhelmed  the 81st-ranked Italian in just over one hour on the center court of the Foro  Italico.  </P> <P> After the two held serve in the first four games, Sabatini took charge, running  off the next four games for the set while dropping just 2 points.  </P> <P> Golarsa broke serve in the first game of the second set, but Sabatini broke  right back and cruised the rest of the way as she controlled the tempo with her  heavy top-spin ground strokes.  </P> <P> Sabatini, who had received a first-round bye, will meet another unheralded  Italian, Laura Lapi, in the third round of what appears to be an easy path to  the final.  </P> <P> In other matches today, 10th-seeded Bettina Fulco downed Celine Cohen of  Switzerland 6-4, 6-2; No. 12 Isabelle Demongeot of France swept past Marzia  Grossi of Italy 6-4, 6-1, and No. 13 Barbara Paulus of Austria beat Amanda  Coetzer of South Africa 6-2, 6-4.  </P> <P> In Hamburg, West Germany, meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker  of West Germany defeated Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-1, 6-3 today to advance to  the third round of the $692,000 German Open tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia also advanced.  </P></p>

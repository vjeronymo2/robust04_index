			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> STATUE OF LAMB STILL ON LAM  </P> <P> Authorities can't find rhyme or reason to the theft of a statue commemorating  the little lamb that followed 19th-Century resident Mary Sawyer to school one  day.  </P> <P> The heist on July 1 has vexed some residents who believe they have been robbed  of a piece of history.  </P> <P> "I can't understand anybody taking it," said Karen Gaylord, a 20-year resident  and part-time spokeswoman for the Sterling Police Department. "It has great  historical value to the town, but it's not something that you could sell."  </P> <P> The concrete statue of the lamb had stood on the town common since the early  1960s and was a fixture of this central Massachusetts town of 6,000, said Ruth  Hopfmann of the Sterling Historical Society.  </P></p>

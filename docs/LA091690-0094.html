			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: AN UNAPPEASED SPIRIT:THE GENERAL IN HIS LABYRINT BY GABRIEL  GARCIA MARQUEZ TRANSLATED BY EDITH GROSSMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 230 PP.)  </P> <P> In 1830, Simon Bolivar, the brilliant and paradoxical figure who liberated much  of South America from Spain but failed in his dream of keeping it together,  resigned his office. With a few loyalists, he journeyed down the Magdalena  River to the coast, where he would die a few months later.  </P> <P> Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has written so much of the true history of the  continent by imagining it, has taken this last, little-known venture by its  supreme historical figure to write a meditation on power, old age and the  destiny of his people.  </P> <P> "The General in His Labyrinth" takes a dying phrase of Bolivar's -- "How will I  ever get out of this labyrinth?" -- as the marvelously well-placed keystone for  the book. We die when our life gets lost in the tangle of its own journey. A  great life is a great journey and a great tangle. Garcia Marquez's Bolivar  fights to keep hold of the contradictory thread of an unappeased spirit facing  eviction from a failed body.  </P> <P> Like the patriarch who daily makes a will and tears it up, Bolivar -- old,  shrunken and ill after 47 years of prodigious life -- is avid to relinquish his  power and to retain it. He resolves to abandon the effort to make a mighty  state out of Latin America -- "I have plowed the sea," he wrote -- while he  plots and struggles to go on with it. He exercises a spacious wit and  generosity while carrying out crabbed maneuvers of calculation and distrust.  One boot on Charon's barge and one hooked firmly to the river bank, he departs  and remains at the same time.  </P> <P> It is a barge, in fact, that he will board -- one of seven -- after an arduous  mule-back trek from the highlands down to the upriver port of Honda. A river is  one of the great classical images of life, and Garcia Marquez intends the  Magdalena -- which he used so powerfully in "Love in the Time of Cholera" -- to  mark a life's illusions and regrets, and the drift into its end.  </P> <P> First, though, comes the introductory scene, the best in the book: the lion  cornered by his enemies and by his own confused passions. Having resigned the  presidency and waiting in vain for the congress to call him back, Bolivar  proclaims his instant departure for Europe. Yet nobody -- not his enemies, his  friends, nor perhaps himself -- has any certainty as to whether he will  actually go.  </P> <P> We meet him, tiny and feverish, floating in the bath in his customary deathlike  trance. Jose, his loyal servant, comes before dawn to prepare him for the  journey. "Let's go as fast as we can. No one wants us here," Bolivar had  commanded. But he has announced his departure too often. "He won't leave and he  won't die," is the slogan scratched upon the walls of Bogota, his capital.  </P> <P> The opposition suspects him of wanting to perpetuate his rule, and name his  successor. Furthermore, much of the local Colombian establishment, led by Gen.  Santander -- it evolved into the Liberal Party that would battle in successive  civil wars with the Conservatives, who trace their lineage to Bolivar -- wants  an independent country it can control, and not an unwieldy federation that  could threaten it. In each of the states, in fact, a separatist faction  opposes, and eventually will prevail over, the Bolivarians.  </P> <P> The days of hesitations, of visits, of delegations bidding him farewell -- some  hoping to persuade him to remain, others fearful that they will succeed -- are  a poignant and ironic dance of veiled signals. Bolivar assembles a few personal  items in a knapsack -- "We never would have believed that so much glory would  fit into a shoe," he says grandiloquently, while arranging for seven pack mules  to carry the rest. It is both fraudulent and authentic, and so are the lines  that put an end to this introductory section:  </P> <P> "It was the end. Gen. Simon Jose Antonio de la Santisima Trinidad Bolivar y  Palacios was leaving forever. He had wrested from Spanish domination an empire  five times more vast than all of Europe, he had led 20 years of wars to keep it  free and united, and he had governed it with a firm hand until the week before,  but when it was time to leave he did not even take away with him the  consolation that anyone believed in his departure."  </P> <P> And indeed, throughout the slow, arduous trip downriver, struggling with  sickness, greeted at each river port by killer banquets and deadly ceremonials,  we follow Bolivar fluctuating in his labyrinth, recalling the past, dissembling  before the present and the future.  </P> <P> In fact, he never does board the ships that his staff successively books and  cancels. He will die in Santa Marta, still planning military actions against  separatists in Colombia and Venezuela, and sending ambiguous answers to a new  government in Bogota that begs him to come back.  </P> <P> Garcia Marquez, as always, is doing several things at once. There is the  portrait of the caudillo fighting his last battle: a dying that shatters his  visionary solipsism by forcibly introducing him to the society of worms. There  is the hot fecundity of the continent's lowlands, so fecund that, as we have  seen in the author's previous books, life is hospitable both to a thing and its  opposite. Magic realism, we call it; stress the realism.  </P> <P> There is, now that the author is embroidering upon a real figure, a more  explicit political message. His Bolivar, for all his vices and self-will,  represents a grand destiny that Latin America has lost to a small-minded  bourgeoisie that masks its greed with constitutional pieties. In the author's  general, we glimpse his own affinity to Fidel Castro; not as a political saint,  but as the mythic monster that fits his vision of his world.  </P> <P> All these things make "The General" a distinguished book. It is not, however,  anywhere up to the masterpieces: "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in  the Time of Cholera." The incidents of the journey, the appearance of ghosts,  memories and sweating mayors are quirky and alluring. But they seem choppy and  repetitive or even forced. The Magdalena provides a sluggish binding current;  it is a river of mud that only intermittently becomes a river of legend.  </P> <P> Garcia Marquez's power seems curiously hobbled in dealing with a historical  figure on the scale of Bolivar. He splendidly presents his image of Latin  America and of a great man redux. Redux apart, his protagonist lacks the  teeming variety, the strength, the mysterious and comic vitality; in short, the  magical reality -- and thus, the reality -- of Col. Buendia in "One Hundred  Years," or of the trio of geriatric demigods in "Love."  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Policy on supplies attacked MISMANAGEMENT of Britain's natural gas supplies had necessitated the decision to authorise imports from Norway, Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, said in the Commons yesterday. 'Where there was abundance, the government's policies have created shortage,' he said. Mr Dobson protested that the government had encouraged the 'dash for gas' by giving in to selfish demands of the privatised electricity companies instead of telling them to consider Britain's long-term interests. He feared that the UK would become dependent on gas imports not just from Norway, but also from the Gulf, countries in the former Soviet Union and from Algeria. Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, told the Commons that it would be necessary to examine the treaty with Norway concerning the Frigg field to determine whether it required amending or renegotiating. He maintained that the developments set in train would help significantly to open up competition in the gas industry. Mr Moynihan said companies participating in the feasibility study of a gas pipeline between the UK and the Continent would be in a position to win long-term contracts when the project was completed.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Cinema revenues top pounds 340m CINEMAS generated revenues of more than Pounds 340m last year, according to a study of the industry, Raymond Snoddy writes. The figure compares with Pounds 349m last year - but in spite of the small fall in turnover, profits are rising rapidly, the report by Dodona, a market research company specialising in the media, says. Total pre-tax profits are estimated to have increased from Pounds 9m a year to Pounds 25m between 1990 and 1991. 'Figures for 1992 and subsequent years are forecast to show further improvements in profitably,' Dodona says. The main reason is less pressure on profit-and-loss accounts now that the peak of building multi-screen cinemas seems to be over. Cinemagoing 3. Dodona Research, 8 Central Avenue, Leicester LE2 1TB.

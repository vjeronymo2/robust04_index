			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price soars to 17-month high FRENZIED BUYING yesterday re-ignited the fire started in the gold market by high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros. The price soared in London by nearly 3.5 per cent to USDollars 369.15 a troy ounce, its highest level for 17 months. Gold started 1993 at a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce.

Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that the rally was inspired by futures and options activity while buying of physical gold was dropping steeply. He 'guestimated' that the first 10 per cent rise in gold's price had knocked 400 tonnes off Middle East demand. 'But that has not stopped bull markets in the past.'</p>

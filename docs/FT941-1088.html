			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Why tea and sympathy won't do - London King Edward VII said of the man who gave London four Corner Houses serving 50m teas a year: 'I like Joseph Lyons because he feeds people well.' Allied-Lyons, the caterer's heir, but more interested in booze than tea, said on Thursday it was changing its name to Allied Domecq once it completes its Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro Domecq Group, the Spanish drinks business. Dropping the evocative Lyons name merits only a footnote in history yet it coincided with a significant shift in perceptions about London markets. Many investors who thought a little tea and sympathy would nurse the markets through their seven-week malaise now subscribe to a gloomier prognosis. A sharper rise in inflation and a bigger current account deficit than forecast in the UK, coupled with a further hike in interest rates in the US, hammered UK equities, gilts and sterling this week. Any residual hope of an imminent UK interest rate cut now hinges on political expediency; the economic rationale has largely evaporated. In fact, the next move in interest rates might well be up, a growing number of analysts believe. This would end the swooping decline from 15 per cent in October, 1990, to 5.25 per cent today which had driven the stock market rally. Apart from feeble fillips on Tuesday and yesterday, equities retreated rapidly. The FT-SE 100 index closed down a net 89.1 points, or 2.8 per cent, on the week at 3,129.0. Gilts, ridden by interest rate worries, were the main culprit. The price of the long gilts future contract lost a further four points to 105, taking its decline since the beginning of the year to about 12 per cent. The 10-year benchmark gilt price fell three points to 92. Sterling weakened as well, taking its decline against the D-Mark to some 5 per cent since January 1. The disturbing inflation figure was the 0.6 per cent rise in the retail price index during February, against forecasts of 0.4 per cent. The underlying annual rise, minus mortgages, was 2.8 per cent, against forecasts of 2.6 per cent. The trade figures were, however, more damaging because of the export and import trends they imply. The current account deficit grew to Pounds 2.6bn in the fourth quarter of last year from Pounds 1.8bn in the third. Looking at non-EU trade, imports grew by more than 1 per cent a month in the three months to February to a record level while exports showed no growth over the period. Among the more trenchant analysts, UBS claimed its research showed that the deficit could be double the official figure. 'If our suspicions about the true external position are correct, Britain's recovery is built on sand more friable and shifting than we had ever imagined.' The UK's recovery, although the best in Europe, is lagging about a year behind the US's. Yet, UK markets have fared far worse than New York markets since the Federal Reserve Board first raised US interest rates seven weeks ago and gave them another nudge up on Tuesday. The US economy is growing rapidly with no signs of pricing pressures. The Fed has tightened, however, as a pre-emptive move against inflation. The US markets have accepted this. As the chart shows, bonds are stabilising and equities have recovered from their post-tightening low in early March. With UK markets deeply unsettled by the Fed and other factors, bond yields have continued to rise and stocks to fall. Two factors at least are likely to prolong this agony. First, the increasing doubts over inflation and growth in the UK. Second, the Fed will be tightening more. It says it is moving from an easy to a neutral monetary stance. If US inflation is jogging along at about 2.5 to 3 per cent, that implies short-term US interest rates could rise to around 4 or 5 per cent from 3.5 per cent currently. Given London equities' reaction so far to rising rates, it is hard to imagine them staging a rally. While the equity markets had enough broad-based concerns as it was this past week, five leading stocks added some specific headaches. Shares in Glaxo fell 8.7 per cent, Wellcome 8.8 per cent, Allied-Lyons 7.8 per cent, Bowater 8.6 per cent, and Kingfisher 6.6 per cent. Glaxo was hit by news of a competitive threat to its money-spinning Zantac ulcer drug. A Ciba-Geigy subsidiary has applied for US approval for a variant which would evade Glaxo's patent protection as early as next year. Wellcome's interim results showed a marked slowdown in growth of sales volume and a 16 per cent drop in the sales value of Retrovir, its Aids drug. It also dropped development of a new anti-herpes compound. A 79 per cent increase in interim dividend to 8.6p failed to halt the slide. Bowater reported a 44 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 212m and a 13 per cent increase in annual dividend to 12.55p. But it talked of difficulties in European packaging and printing markets, leaving investors feeling its defensive virtues in a recession were a liability in a recovery. Kingfisher turned in a 51 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 309m but a lot of that growth came from Darty, its French acquisition. Operating profits from its UK retailing operations such as Comet, Woolworths, B&amp;Q and Superdrug fell 3 per cent. Its new policy of Every Day Low Pricing has yet to show through in profits. As for Allied-Lyons, the combination of a Pounds 651m rights issue, the Pounds 739m purchase of Domecq and the forecast of only a Pounds 10m increase to Pounds 630m in pre-exceptional pre-tax profits for the year ending this month left investors cool. But perhaps they will warm to Domecq's virtues. After all, it has the first and third largest brandy brands in the world, a far more potent product than Mr Lyons' tea.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> THE BEAR ISN'T STARVING; DON'T FEED IT;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV IS FLUSH WITH CASH; U.S. AID WILL ONLY HELP HIS STRATEGIES OF  REPRESSION.  </P> <P> Had Republicans in 1988 told voters we would be raising taxes to send foreign  aid to Moscow, even the Little Duke might have been able to slip around our  right end and run to daylight.  </P> <P> Yet, here we are. Six months ago, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt took a  fearsome pounding for even suggesting what Mr. Bush has decided to do: send $1  billion in food aid to Mr. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, whose friend and contributor is Dwayne Andreas of the  grain giant Archer Daniels Midland, suggests we raise Moscow's food-related  loan guarantees to $3 billion. Fine, Bob, but when Moscow welshes, let Andreas  and ADM eat the loss.  </P> <P> Astonishing. With the dollar sinking, the deficit exploding, the Fed feverishly  pumping cash into a failing Bank of New England, the S&amp;L crisis deepening,  the Persian Gulf adventure doubling in cost, Uncle Sam is launching a new  foreign-aid initiative -- to rescue the last dictator between San Francisco and  Vladivostok.  </P> <P> Were the Russian people starving, Americans would be there with food  assistance. But they are not starving. They just had the greatest harvest in  history, and Gorbachev's gang is flush with cash. Moscow's $4-billion windfall  profit from the doubling of oil prices, its $24 billion in credits since June  from the Germans and Saudis, plus $10 billion to $14 billion in reserves, give  Gorbachev all the cash he needs. Why, then, are we sending him food on credit?  </P> <P> Because Bush wishes to signal to the Soviets that Gorbachev is our man in  Moscow, that saving him serves U.S. national interests.  </P> <P> But does it, in December, 1990?  </P> <P> Surely, the Gorbachev who held back the tanks in Central Europe in 1989 was the  best Soviet leader of our lifetime. Ronald Reagan was right: Gorbachev was a  "different kind" of Communist. Were he to preside over the dismantling of the  Soviet strategic rocket force and the opening up of his "prison house of  nations," his regime would be as wise a strategic investment as the United  States could make. But there is no evidence that Gorbachev intends to preside  over the liquidation of the Soviet Empire; there is hard evidence that he is  aligning with the imperialist factions determined to save it.  </P> <P> The Soviet military still consumes 20% of GNP; Soviet tanks have been moved  east of the Urals to exempt them from U.S. arms-control agreements; Soviet  rockets -- aimed at the United States -- continue to roll off assembly lines.  Moreover, Gorbachev has lately declared his intent to use force to keep the  Soviet Union together. At the top of the Interior Ministry sits a newly  appointed ex-KGB tough from Latvia, Boris Pugo, whose deputy, Gen. Boris  Gromov, has the aspect of a Russian Napoleon. There is a good possibility that  just as U.S. food aid is pouring into Moscow this winter, Gromov will be  conducting a blockade of one or more Baltic republics.  </P> <P> In the battle between neo-Stalinists and reform Communists, Gorbachev was with  the reformers. We had an investment in his victory. But that fight is over. The  battle now is between those who believe in constitutional rights, free markets  and independence for the republics, and those prepared to use force to keep  Russia's captive nations captive forever. Gorbachev is emerging as the leader  and voice of the forces of repression.  </P> <P> His regime -- with its huge Marxist bureaucracy -- is now the impediment to  reform. As former National Security Council aide Roger Robinson of the Center  for Security Policy writes, the Soviet Union is referred to by American bankers  as "Red Bear S&amp;L." It should be shut down, its managers fired, its assets  parceled out. To stuff Moscow full of cash and credit in 1990 is to give this  failed regime the same lease on life we gave Lenin in the '20s, Stalin in the  '40s, Brezhnev in the '70s. This time, don't bail 'em out, let 'em go under.  </P> <P> Like the Commodity Credit Corporation loans to Poland in the '70s, and to Iraq  in the '80s, we will never see the money again; all that subsidized food will  have to be paid for by the American people.  </P> <P> By denying aid to Gorbachev, we could force him to act in his own best  interest. Without hard currency, he could not pay his bureaucrats, maintain his  arsenal, send aid to Cuba and Afghanistan, operate his state farms and  factories. Without aid, he must open his country to investment or go under. You  do the alcoholic no favor when you give him a drink; you do him a favor when  you put him through cold turkey.  </P> <P> President Bush put America's prestige behind Deng Xiaoping, and, until Aug. 2,  behind Saddam Hussein; he was burned by both. With this aid package, he ties  himself to a dictator who just may reward him with a crackdown that will cause  us to forget Tian An Men Square.  </P></p>

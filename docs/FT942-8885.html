			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann to split into four units Bertelsmann, the leading German media group, yesterday announced a restructuring plan following the collapse of Vox, its private television channel. An important element is the splitting of the group into four divisions: books, industry, entertainment and press. Mr Manfred Lahnstein, head of Bertelsmann's electronic media division which included Vox, has been appointed to head the supervisory board. He takes over from Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, who is stepping down. Vox, the Cologne-based TV channel, collapsed last March, 14 months after its launch. Its fall caused estimated losses for Bertelsmann of DM160m (Dollars 94.1m). Bertelsmann was previously divided into seven divisions, some determined by outdated geographical considerations, the company said. The new structure would make the company slimmer, faster and more effective, it said. 'The point is to enable business areas which work together to be better in tune with each other.' The group recently reported that earnings for the six months ending December were well above budget and likely to exceed the 1993 results.</p>

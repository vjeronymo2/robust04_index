			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Voters have only modest hopes for Danish coalition DANISH voters say they have only modest expectations from the new four-party coalition led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, chairman of the Social Democratic party, while business fears it will lead to higher costs and therefore to a loss of jobs. Mr Rasmussen spent yesterday putting together his cabinet, which he will present to Queen Margrethe today. It is expected that the administration - which will assume Denmark's current presidency of the European Community - will include at least a dozen Social Democrats, three members each from the Radical Liberal party and the Centre Democrats and two from the Christian People's party. The change of government is a change of faces more than of policies. The three centre parties which have joined the government were all supporters of the outgoing non-socialist government. Furthermore, many areas of policy, including defence and fiscal policy, are subject to multi-party compromise agreements binding on all participants for the rest of this year and in some cases longer. EC policy is hammered out in the all-party market affairs committee of the Folketing (parliament) and will therefore also not be subject to sudden change as a result of the new government. One of the foremost tasks for the new government will be to achieve a majority for the Maastricht treaty on European union in a referendum to be held probably in May. However, a poll by the Vilstrup institute, published in the national daily Politiken, showed 63 per cent of Danes would vote Yes and 37 per cent No. A month ago 70 per cent were in favour and 30 per cent against. Three quarters of voters polled by a weekend Gallup survey said they did not think the government would succeed in reducing unemployment, which is top priority in its programme. Two thirds doubted that it would succeed in lowering personal income taxes, another aim, or lead to a significant increase in real wages.</p>

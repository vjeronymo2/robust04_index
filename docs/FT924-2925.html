			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Return to sender, cost unknown: The fate of Britain's Post Office represents a test of the government's commitment to privatisation The British Post Office is the quintessential old-style public service. The village post office is a centre for news and gossip; the postman and pillar box are a traditional part of the landscape; the stamps have the Queen's head on them. This monolithic edifice is already under threat from the government's plans to sell Parcelforce, the parcels delivery service. In the next few weeks the government must decide whether to go a big step further: to sell off the Royal Mail and the post offices as well. Perhaps the surprising thing is that this did not happen long ago. The Post Office has been in profit for each of the past 16 years. It has no debt, needs no subsidy and has contributed Pounds 750m to the public coffers over the past decade. At a time when a cash-strapped government is reduced to seeking buyers for commercial no-hopers such as British Rail and British Coal, why is the Post Office still in the public sector at all? The answer is deeply political. The Post Office may rouse mixed feelings in the average voter, but by general consent it does an essential job pretty well. Tinkering with it might seem a useless application of ideology, besides jeopardising the universal nature of its service. Even the arch-privatiser Mrs Margaret Thatcher declared the Royal Mail sacrosanct when last running for election. And as the Post Office's managing director, Mr Bill Cockburn, pointedly remarks, in every marginal constituency there is a marginal post office. But as Mr Cockburn also makes clear, there are distinct problems with the status quo. However old-fashioned the Post Office's image, it forms part of the fast-moving and highly competitive communications industry. To hold its own in a world of electronic data, it must invest, modernise and perhaps even expand overseas. But as long as it remains in the public sector, any money it borrows counts as part of the UK budget deficit, or public sector borrowing requirement. At a time when the deficit is growing rapidly this is hardly a recipe for expansion. Not that Mr Cockburn is unaware of the political pressures. 'Of all the things we do,' he says, 'the post office network is politically the most sensitive. The key point is that we're the great cash dispensers. The Post Office hands out Pounds 100bn a year in cash to 28m people, in pensions, child benefit and so on. Most people leave the post office with more money than they came in with. That makes it a magnet to draw people in, and the spending power it generates is quite important.' The snag is that of the UK's 20,000 post offices, half do not cover their costs and have to be subsidised from the Post Office's other activities. 'If they were subjected to pure market forces,' Mr Cockburn says, 'you could see a substantial reduction in their number. That would be very, very controversial politically.' Privatising the network would also raise awkward commercial questions. It is not quite clear, for instance, whether the crucial contracts which allow the post offices to handle pensions, benefits and the like could be redrawn in sufficiently waterproof fashion to satisfy a commercial buyer. But there is an argument in favour of privatisation as well. The Post Office is a formidable force in the high street, with more outlets than the banks and the building societies put together. By law, it can only perform transactions for the public sector and the utilities. If it were permitted to undertake banking transactions, for example, it might be in a better position to fulfil its obligation to maintain a national network. But however tricky the post offices may be politically, they are small beer in commercial terms. Last year, they accounted for only a fifth of the Post Office's Pounds 5bn turnover and a 10th of its profit. From the government's point of view, the real big fish is the Royal Mail itself, which handles the delivery of mail excluding parcels. This accounts for three-quarters of the Post Office's turnover and made a pre-tax profit last year of Pounds 266m. On its own, Royal Mail might fetch about Pounds 1.5bn on flotation. As to how desirable this would be, Mr Cockburn remains studiously neutral. The main thing, he says, is that the organisation should be free to expand and modernise, not whether it is in the private or the public sector. But then, if the Treasury were capable of flexibility in funding public enterprises, much of the privatisation programme need never have taken place. And indeed, given that privatisation would doubtless mean a handsome increase in Mr Cockburn's Pounds 140,000 salary, his detachment may be taken with a pinch of salt. The business argument, however, has a certain logic. 'The real competition for the Royal Mail,' Mr Cockburn says, 'is faxes, press and TV advertising, automatic banking transactions and so on. Ninety per cent of mail is business mail, and clearly the business buyer has a range of choices. If you take the communications market as a whole, we reckon the post has a 15 per cent market share. So it's not by any means the dominant player. The real competition is telecommunications and its related products, especially as their real cost comes down over time.' In the course of the 1980s, the volume of mail in the UK went up by 50 per cent. But that represented merely a holding of market share, after a period of decline in the 1970s. To maintain that position, Mr Cockburn argues, what he needs above all is access to capital. 'We believe there's real potential to grow the business. But that involves the ability to do acquisitions and joint ventures, and to steer our business into other areas as the market develops. For example, we could add an electronic component to traditional postal transactions. Instead of giving us a lot of letters to deal with, a lot of people might prefer to give us computer tapes. We could then take the information from the tapes and deliver it to customers, either in hard copy or electronic format, or a combination of the two. 'That's the way the communications market is going to develop, and what we've got to avoid is getting locked into the old way of doing things and progressively losing out to technology. If we become old-fashioned, large companies will start to design us out of their process. We have to interface with our customers in the way they want, which might mean us having direct access to their computer systems or whatever.' But it is at this point that the private individual starts to feel uneasy. For the Royal Mail to transform itself in the service of big business is one thing. But if the price is privatisation, the average voter might feel threatened on two fronts. Not only would the traditional face of the Post Office change. It would also drift away from public accountability into the hands of a shadowy regulator, an Ofpost. Like the other privatised utility regulators, Ofpost would doubtless concentrate on questions of competition while denying responsibility for public policy. As to the first point, says Mr Cockburn, the business and residential community are in partnership. Individuals use the mail mostly to communicate not with each other, but with business. 'Social mail - voter to voter, if you like - only makes up 10 per cent of the total. A lot of the rest is business transactions by the residential community, whether electricity bills or phone bills. We're the pipeline in the middle, facilitating the transactions between the two.' The other benefit to the individual, he argues, is cost. Over the past decade, as volume has risen, the real price of sending a letter has fallen by 13 per cent. 'The Royal Mail is a business with very large fixed costs, and it clearly benefits greatly from growth, as we've seen in the past. So growth is an important business objective, and the benefits from it come back to both the residential customer and the business customer in terms of the real price we charge for the transaction.' But what about issues of public policy? The recent furore over pit closures and the lack of a national energy policy has reminded the British public that privatisation has its drawbacks as well as its strengths. Where is the guarantee that a privatised Post Office will continue to act in the public interest? The chief guarantee, says Mr Cockburn, comes in the promises made by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, when announcing the review now taking place. 'Mr Heseltine described certain things as non-negotiable. There will be a universal delivery service for both parcels and letters, from Monday to Saturday. There will be a universal tariff structure, so that a letter costs the same wherever in the country it is posted. And there will be a national network of post offices. 'These are the key political considerations - the hot buttons of controversy. If you can provide rock-solid assurance that these obligations will be protected and enforced, I think that would go a long way to reassuring people. The important thing is that wherever you live in the country you're not cut off from the network just because of economic arguments. So long as that's protected, I think it's all upside.' If the government were to decide to privatise the Royal Mail, it would have to deal with some thorny technical questions. In particular, it would have to decide whether to retain the Royal Mail's monopoly on mail below a certain price - at present Pounds 1 - in return for the obligation to deliver letters to every household in the country. It would also have to decide what the new limit should be. But for the student of privatisation, the really interesting question is whether the government will bring itself to risk the step in the first place. The commercial case for privatising the Post Office is at least as persuasive as for some other utilities. But there remains a residual unease in the British population about the idea of basic services being handed over to big business. The government's decision will be as good a sign as any of whether the UK's privatisation movement still has any life in it.  -------------------------------------------------  Satisfaction with the way industries are run (%)  ------------------------------------------------- Royal Mail                         82 Electricity                        77 British Gas                        69 British Telecom                    67 British Airways                    31 British Rail                       26  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Taylor Nelson Research  -------------------------------------------------</p>

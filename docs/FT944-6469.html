			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mineworkers threaten to disrupt export coal supplies Australian mineworkers have threatened to disrupt export coal supplies unless companies wring a significant price increase out of the Japanese steel and electricity industry customers in the annual round of price negotiations now getting under way in Tokyo, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The threat could herald a repeat of last year's experience when mineworkers walked out for several days in protest at the coking coal contracts and then held a second 48-hour stoppage over steaming coal price agreements. Their action prompted the federal government to agree to an inquiry into the industry, conclusions of which are due to handed down shortly. Yesterday, Mr John Maitland, president of the powerful Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, said that Australian producers 'should not think of settling for anything less than (a) USDollars 10 per tonne (increase)' and that he would not be prepared to guarantee the supply of export coal if company representatives could not negotiate a good price. There have been some rumours that producers would be willing to take a rise of USDollars 6 a tonne, but Mr Maitland said that this 'would represent no real increase at all in Australian dollar terms'. Last year, producers accepted price cuts of about 8 per cent in US dollar terms - with prices of hard coking coals falling by USDollars 4 a tonne. However, the Australian dollar has gained ground against the US currency over the past 12 months. Coal is Australia's largest export category, and the price agreements with the Japanese - negotiated annually - are used as a price-setter for the industry. The cuts agreed last year in the wake of big financial problems for the Japanese steel mills and threats of undercutting by Canadian producers, represented the fourth successive year in which prices had fallen.</p>

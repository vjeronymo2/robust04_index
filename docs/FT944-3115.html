			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / European energy law accord Ministers from at least 45 countries plus a European Union representative will meet in Lisbon over the weekend to sign the European Energy Charter, which aims to establish a legal agreement for investment and trade in energy between western organisations and those in central and eastern Europe. The charter was originally proposed after the fall of communism to provide the west with a vehicle for supporting Russian and east European industry. However, its completion has been delayed by disputes over the legal requirements that should be set and the pace of Russian reform. The US will delay signing the charter until next year, while Norway's vote to stay out of the EU casts doubt on its signature. Russia has said it will sign in principle, but it is unclear whether they will do so as early as this weekend.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Interest income buoys Electronic Data ELECTRONIC Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer systems and services group, produced sharply improved pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 boosted by higher net interest receipts. The results were in line with analysts' expectations and the share price moved up only fractionally to close at 510p. Turnover shrank by 11 per cent from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 15.5m, the consequence, according to Mr Michael Heller, chairman, of 'the continuing compression in the selling prices of hardware and the policy of the group to develop long term as a software publisher and services provider'. Profits before tax rose 20 per cent from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 4.88m; trading profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 3.79) with a further Pounds 784,000 (Pounds 290,000) in net interest receipts. Earnings per share were 17 per cent up at 38.4p (32.83p) and a final dividend of 3.1p is recommended to make a total of 5.1p, 20 per cent ahead of last year's 4.25p. Cash balances at September 30 were Pounds 10.2m after spending nearly Pounds 2m on a new corporate headquarters in Sheffield. EDP is a company in transition. It is moving away from hardware distribution towards software and services which last year contributed Pounds 8m to turnover. Last year it spent about Pounds 530,000 on research and development, chiefly on the production of a new software product, Univision, a database management system which will operate under either of the 'open' software environments, Unix or Pick. The future of the industry, Mr Heller said, lay in open - or industry standard - systems and the company's aim was to become a software publisher specialising in open products. Trading conditions remained harsh and he confirmed analysts' views that profits would be essentially flat in the present year. The company was looking for acquisitions and had identified suitable candidates for takeover, but would retain its cash pile until the moment was right.</p>

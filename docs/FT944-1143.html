			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Pride and joy mask problems: Election of radicals to national executive committee sounds warning to new South African government As South Africa's President Nelson Mandela ended his address to the ANC conference's closing session yesterday, the 3,000 delegates broke into song and dance, full-throatedly rendering an old struggle song praising the virtues of Mr Mandela and their movement. The smiles on the faces of the president and his colleagues as they hugged each other on the podium, and the unrestrained joy and pride of party activists gathered from around the country, told the same story: despite fears of clashes between the national executive and local branches over the slow delivery on election promises and the government's conciliatory attitude towards whites, the ANC's first national conference since coming to power in April resulted in a broad endorsement of existing leadership. Despite a frank admission by Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa that the party had been unprepared for the complex task of being in government, and remained poorly organised and was losing membership, both he and Mr Mandela, the incumbent party leader, were re-elected unopposed. Meanwhile, the ongoing struggle between Mr Ramaphosa and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki over who is the most likely successor to Mr Mandela was resolved in favour of the Mr Mbeki; he was elected the party's new deputy president. While acknowledging it had been remiss in implementing pre-election promises, especially in areas such as housing and provision of basic services to black townships, the leadership won general support for its policies as the party resolved to make 1995, in the words of one delegate, 'the year of delivery'. Many of the ANC's best-known radicals, including Mr Mandela's estranged wife, Winnie, were all elected to top positions within the party's National Executive. But the overwhelming victories by Mr Jacob Zuma in the race for national chairperson and Ms Cheryl Carolus, as deputy secretary-general, a Zulu and a Coloured respectively, demonstrated a clear commitment to a broadly moderate and representative leadership. The only explicitly hardline position to come from the gathering was the insistence that the ANC modify somewhat the pre-election agreement guaranteeing white bureaucrats' jobs for the five-year life of the interim constitution. From ministers and local activists alike, the belief that the state bureaucracy was at best incapable of implementing party policy, and at worst deliberately sabotaging it, led to widespread calls for dramatically accelerated appointment of blacks to senior posts. The conference left several problems unresolved as Mr Ramaphosa's litany of structural weaknesses was met with little but a promise to do better. In the absence of a detailed programme to boost recruitment and funding, paid-up party membership is likely to wither further as the liberation fervour generated among blacks before the election continues to dissipate. The party sidestepped discussion on the future of its formal alliance with the Communist party and Cosatu, the country's biggest trade union federation. The linkage is less problematic than formerly - most ANC supporters have jettisoned all ideological baggage - but it will become increasingly hard to keep up if the government holds to its tough economic line on tariff reform and industrial restructuring. While these shortcomings, and the need to start implementing its centrepiece Reconstruction and Development Programme, will have to be dealt with over the coming year, the party and its leaders know these are the challenges of the future. For now, they are content to revel in the fact that, after 83 years of struggle, they finally have the political wherewithal to address them.</p>

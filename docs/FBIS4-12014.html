			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Nabi 'Abd-al-Sattar] </F>   [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf made  intensive efforts on the sidelines of the Arab League Council  session to persuade Arab countries, foremost Egypt, to normalize  their relations with Iraq and allow the rift in Arab ranks to  heal.    Al-Sahhaf met with the Egyptian, Jordanian, and Moroccan  foreign ministers in a bid to improve Iraqi-Arab ties. Minister  al-Sahhaf said that his country will be pleased to receive any  Egyptian official who wishes to visit Baghdad in an attempt to  normalize relations.    The Iraqi foreign minister accused Israel of arming and  training the Kurds in Northern Iraq to destabilize the security  and stability of Iraq. Al-Sahhaf called for a stiffer Arab  boycott of Israel until the latter stops its arbitrary practices  in the occupied territories and respects the resolutions of the  UN Security Council and international legitimacy.    Al-Sahhaf said that his country implemented most UN Security  Council resolutions. He denied that Iraq holds any Kuwaiti  detainees, inviting Arab teams to visit Iraq to see for  themselves.</p>

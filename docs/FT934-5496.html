			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan may partially lift rice ban - Compromise offer before Gatt deadline Japan will present a compromise offer to partially lift its ban on rice imports to its trade partners under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks early next month, government officials said yesterday. After weeks of public denial that Japan and the US have been under negotiations over a plan to open Japan's rice market, the government has waited until the last minute before the December 15 deadline of the Uruguay Round officially to reveal Japan's position. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the time had come for the Japanese government to seriously sort out its opinions on the rice issue. Japan is poised to propose a plan in which it will accept minimum access of 4 to 8 per cent, and a six year moratorium period before tarification of foreign rice imports. The government is trying to convince those who oppose rice imports, by stressing the danger of Japan being blamed for the failure of the talks if it does not agree to a compromise deal on rice. Last weekend, Mr Takemura said Japan could not break up the Uruguay Round, and it would have to allow foreign access to the rice market. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of the Komeito, a member of the seven party government, also expressed support for a compromise deal. Mr Takemura said the partial lifting of the import ban would not contradict a parliamentary resolution and an agreement within the coalition opposing the replacement of the ban with tariffs. The government faces staunch opposition from the Socialist party, also a member of the coalition. The party has a large support base in rural areas of Japan, and has threatened to walk out of the coalition if the government reaches a decision to lift the import ban. Mr Takemura yesterday went out of his way to try and win over the socialists.</p>

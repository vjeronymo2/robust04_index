			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sharp fall in demand sees Deere loss deepen A SHARP fall in agricultural machinery sales resulted in the first-quarter loss at Illinois-based Deere deepening to Dollars 27.6m, or 36 cents a share. In the same period last year, the farm equipment manufacturer with worldwide interests suffered a loss of Dollars 19.9m or 26 cents. Deere also saw worldwide sales drop, to Dollars 1.424bn, from Dollars 1.452bn in the first quarter of last year. As in the first quarter of 1992, Deere instituted a series of factory shutdowns in an attempt to cut receivables at its equipment dealerships. The shutdowns contributed to weak profits. The combination of reduced production and higher first-quarter retail sales helped Deere dealers to cut receivables by Dollars 186m during the quarter. While Deere sold fewer pieces of equipment to its dealers, the dealers themselves reported significantly higher retail sales in North America. The company said demand remained very weak for agricultural equipment in western Europe, and its worldwide equipment operations recorded a net loss of Dollars 68.9m, compared with a Dollars 46.5m loss a year ago. Deere's financial services and North American lawn and grounds care equipment business improved, with each posting revenue growth in the quarter. 'First-quarter North American retail sales levels improved over last year, and provide a good base for the remainder of the year,' said Mr Hans Becherer, Deere chairman. But he added that industry retail sales of agricultural equipment in Europe 'are expected to continue downward. European agricultural continues to experience a fundamental change which will likely result in lower income to farmers and reduced crop production in 1993, putting further pressure on our overseas operations results.' Mr Becherer said Deere planned selective increases in its production schedules in 1993.</p>

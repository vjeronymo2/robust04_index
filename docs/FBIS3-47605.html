He said Singapore, a party committed to the concept,  understood the need to realise the caucus in the very near  future in the light of the conducive atmosphere both inside and  outside the region.    Obstacles are no longer there, more so with the change of  Washington's stand (on the matter) and that of Tokyo's, he told  reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Singapore Foreign  Minister Professor S. Jayakumar who arrived here this morning on  his first visit to Malaysia.    We like to see EAEC taking shape this year itself, he said,  adding that the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta was working towards  it.    He said Prof. Jayakumar agreed that given the present  circumstances, there was no reason for the caucus not to be  realised soon.    Abdullah said he hoped that the working relationship between  Kuala Lumpur and Singapore need not be too formal and that the  cordial ties should also be enhanced down the line, especially  at the officials level. Being neighbours, Ablullah said, a  good relationship between the officials was vital to further  maintain the long-standing bilateral ties.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Citrus Damage Estimate Eases: The government said freeze losses in the South  were not quite as bad as initially thought, but it still listed the citrus crop  at 9.92 million tons, 23% less than last season.  </P> <P> Orange production was forecast as 169 million boxes, 19% less than last season,  but 7% more than estimated by the Agriculture Department two weeks after the  Christmas weekend freeze. Grapefruit prospects, however, worsened. The crop was  pegged at 41.6 million boxes, down 9% from last month. If correct, it would be  38% smaller than the 1988-1989 crop.  </P></p>

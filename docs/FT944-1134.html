			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Steadfast support for Vietnam war: Obituary of Dean Rusk Dean Rusk, who died on Tuesday at the age of 85, was US secretary of state from 1961-69, serving throughout the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Only Cordell Hull, under Franklin Roosevelt, enjoyed a longer tenure in nominal charge of US foreign policy. Yet Mr Rusk's reputation ultimately rests almost entirely on his role in prosecuting the Vietnam war. He was born on a small farm in Cherokee, Georgia, in 1909. In 1931 he received a Rhodes Scholarship to St John's College, Oxford. There he observed what he regarded as a combination of pacifism, isolationism and public indifference, which, he believed, contributed immeasurably to the events that that led to the second world war. His later position on Vietnam was influenced strongly by his view of the 1930s. He became an associate professor of government, and later dean, at Mills, a women's college in Oakland, California. During the war, he served in Washington and New Delhi and by June 1945, as a colonel, was on the war department general staff. On the night of August 10 1945 he was one of the two colonels who drew the fateful demarcation line for Korea at the 38th parallel. As an assistant secretary of state for UN affairs, he dealt with such issues as the future of Palestine and the Berlin blockade. He showed little enthusiasm for an independent new Jewish state and bitterly complained about what he regarded as excessive 'Zionist' influence at the White House. He was assistant secretary for far eastern affairs when North Korea invaded the South in June 1950. and later supported reunification. He left the State Department for the presidency of the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1960, President-elect Kennedy, who had never previously met Mr Rusk, selected him as secretary of state after two short conversations, largely on the recommendation of senior members of the foreign policy establishment. Mr Rusk opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, although, characteristically, his disagreement was not public at the time. When the Berlin Wall went up that year, he believed the western powers should stand their ground, taking no military action. But Vietnam came to dominate US foreign policy under Mr Kennedy. Mr Rusk was convinced that 'southeast Asia was vital to the security of the free world', and that it was necessary to preserve the independence of South Vietnam. During the 1964 presidential campaign, he abandoned the traditional neutrality of the secretary of state by publicly calling for the election of Lyndon Johnson. Like President Johnson, he implied that the US would not massively intervene in Asia. But he strongly supported each subsequent escalation of the US intervention in Vietnam. When the national consensus in support of the war came under strain and cabinet members and former senior officials changed their views, he remained steadfast. He supported efforts at negotiation but the result he sought never wavered - he was not prepared to use negotiations to obtain what he viewed as a camouflaged surrender of the US position. Despite the war, Mr Rusk was successful in pursuing better relations with the Soviet Union. The seeds of what came to be called detente were planted during his tenure. In 1968, the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty was signed. However, Mr Johnson's plans to travel to Leningrad by warship for the opening of strategic arms limitation talks were stymied by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Mr Rusk left office in January 1969. Because of the unpopularity of his views on Vietnam, he was not offered an academic position at the most prestigious universities. In 1970, he became a professor at the University of Georgia, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. In 1990, his autobiography, As I Saw It, was published and he remained, to the last, unrepentant about the policies he had helped forge in the Vietnam war. President Johnson, to whom Mr Rusk was always closer by temperament and background than he was to President Kennedy, wrote in 1969: 'The man who has served me most intelligently, faithfully and nobly is Dean Rusk.' No-one will quarrel with his faithfulness, but, because of his role in the Vietnamese tragedy, few will now agree that he served 'most intelligently.' Dan Davidson, a Washington lawyer, served in the State Department under Dean Rusk and as a member of the US delegation to the Paris Vietnam peace talks in 1968.</p>

These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different perspectives are not easily captured in a single discount rate. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has reconsidered the issue, and has decided that multiple discount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, with each pertaining to a different perspective, are warranted. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different rates (i.e., consumer, commercial and societal) are used to capture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impacts of the standards on different constituents. The consumer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial rates are used to calculate life-cycle costs for purchasers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential and commercial products, respectively. The social discount rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used to calculate the net present value of standards for the Nation as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole. Separate rates, therefore, were used for the consumer sector, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial sector (since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased primarily by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial firms), and for society as a whole. This discussion will describe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the derivations of the consumer, commercial and social discount rates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were used in the different analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consumer discount rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 17, 1989, DOE published a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, and small gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), hereafter referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 1989 final rule. In the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected a 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent discount rate, based on a methodology derived from the Court of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appeals decision,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 768 F.2d  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1355, 1406 (D.C. Cir 1985). As discussed in the November 1989 final rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicability of the court decision changed somewhat with the passage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514). The Tax Reform Act phased out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deductibility of interest paid on consumer loans. Based on the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology, DOE calculated a range of discount rates that consumers incur;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this range is from less than 1 percent to slightly more than 15 percent. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected 7 percent for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for purposes of that rulemaking proceeding because it was near the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mid-point of the potential consumer discount rates. In addition, DOE believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the approach is reasonable in that it was related to the opportunity cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of money for purchasing consumer durables. As such, it was justified in terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of alternate consumer purchases that are foregone in order to finance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases of appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a subsequent final rule on energy conservation standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers (56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hereafter referred to as the May 1991 final rule, the Department restated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 7 percent rate was near the mid-point of the range of consumer finance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates for the purchase of appliances. It was further stated that if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department could obtain data on the methods that consumers use to purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances, it could develop a weighted-average, real, after-tax finance rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use as a consumer discount rate in the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comments on the September 1990 advance notice, Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation offered estimates of consumer financing of purchases of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment: 40 percent of retail sales are paid in cash; 35 percent use credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cards; 25 percent use retailer loans. These figures excluded new home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation's total sales. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1&hyph;2 and Appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While Whirlpool Corporation represents only one source of data, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has no reason to believe that Whirlpool Corporation's customers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differ from those of other manufacturers, and, therefore, accepted Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation's estimates as representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These numbers were applied to the real, after-tax finance rates that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred by consumers, as reported in the November 1989 final rule. Those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates were estimated to be just over 3 percent for appliances purchased as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of a new home (whose finance rate is a tax-deductible mortgage interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate), to slightly under 1 percent for cash purchases, to more than 15 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for credit card purchases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

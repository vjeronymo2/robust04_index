			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Hack drill A couple more names to add to the roll-call of young media tycoons in basic training. Observer commented earlier this week on how Australia's local newspaper business was being used by the Packer, Murdoch and O'Reilly families to see if the next generation had the right stuff to make it to the top. The same thing seems to be happening in the UK. Young Matthew Doull, a nephew of Conrad Black, has done his stint as a hack on the Daily Telegraph's city pages, and has now got the job of thinking up bright ideas for the Telegraph's new business unit. Another young thing to watch is Jonathan Rothermere, 26, who is currently writing for the Sunday Mail in Glasgow. With his father, Lord Rothermere, turning 69 this week it probably won't be long before young Jonathan gets a call to return to Associated Newspapers' headquarters so that he can learn how to do a proper job.</p>

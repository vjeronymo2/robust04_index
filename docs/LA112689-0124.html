			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS SEEK A QUARTERBACK FOR FUTURE  </P> <P> Steve Walsh might look good in a New England Patriots uniform. Bobby Hebert  certainly would, and ditto for Jim Everett.  </P> <P> Maybe Maine's Mike Buck could fill the bill. Or perhaps a quarterback from  Moscow (Idaho, that is) would be the person for the job.  </P> <P> Whomever. Wherever. As life slowly seeps out of this season, the Patriots are  already looking to the future. And to future quarterbacks.  </P> <P> "We've got to get a quarterback somewhere," said Dick Steinberg, the Patriots'  director of player development.  </P> <P> One of the major reasons the Patriots take a 4-7 record into Sunday's game in  Los Angeles against the Raiders is the problem they have had at quarterback.  </P> <P> Tony Eason failed and is now with the New York Jets. Doug Flutie failed and is  now buried on the Patriots bench. That leaves Steve Grogan, a 36-year-old with  a history of injuries, and Marc Wilson, a soon-to-be 33-year-old, who has  barely played in two years.  </P> <P> "It makes a lot of sense to try and look around and see what's available next  year in the draft or free agents (or) trades," said Patriots Coach Raymond  Berry.  </P> <P> It also makes sense for the Patriots to get a better read on Wilson, who has  played less than a half this year after sitting out all last season. Grogan, as  well as he has played, is certainly not the long-term answer, while Wilson's  one brief appearance this season makes him a possible solution.  </P> <P> Wilson made everyone reassess their opinions of him in his only regular-season  game after Grogan sustained a concussion early in the second half Nov. 5  against the Jets. Wilson completed 12 of 18 passes for 177 yards and two  touchdowns in a near-heroic performance.  </P> <P> Wilson's touchdown pass to Hart Lee Dykes with 1 minute, 3 seconds remaining  gave the Patriots a 26-24 lead. But the Jets won on a last-second field goal.  </P> <P> Berry might have opted to play Wilson Sunday against his former team, but with  last week's victory over the Buffalo Bills, Berry apparently holds a tiny bit  of hope that victories in the remaining five games might get the Patriots into  the playoffs. Thus, Grogan, who has played well in leading the Patriots to two  victories in his five starts, gets the nod.  </P> <P> "Trying to get (Wilson) a chance to play as a starter certainly figures in our  plans before the season is over," Berry said.  </P> <P> "Right now we're trying to concentrate on beating the Raiders."  </P> <P> Wilson, Grogan and probably Flutie are expected back in the Patriots camp next  year. New England also would like to bring in a young quarterback who can be  groomed to take over the starting job.  </P> <P> "The most likely scenario," said Patriots general manager Patrick Sullivan,  "may be for us to sign a free agent."  </P> <P> The Rams' Everett and the Saints' Hebert will be free agents at the end of the  season. But signing either might be costly -- not only in terms of the money  they would demand, but also because the Patriots would have to give up two  first-round draft picks as compensation.  </P> <P> Another factor is that the Patriots might not be able to lure Everett or Hebert  from their respective teams.  </P> <P> Trades for quarterbacks don't happen easily, and the asking price for a good  one is guaranteed to be steep. One quarterback who may be available for trade  is Walsh, who is behind another young quarterback, Troy Aikman, with the Dallas  Cowboys.  </P> <P> The Cowboys would probably demand a first-round draft pick to replace the one  they used to select Walsh in the supplemental draft last spring, additional  draft choices and maybe a player or two.  </P> <P> The Patriots would be interested, but probably not at that price.  </P> <P> The draft is a more likely avenue. Steinberg likes to build through the draft  and the Patriots may get a fairly early first-round pick depending on how they  finish.  </P> <P> The Patriots will definitely draft a quarterback. The problem is that there  aren't any blue-chip quarterbacks coming out of college next spring.  </P> <P> "We won't take a quarterback in the first round if he's not a first-round guy,"  said Steinberg.  </P> <P> Idaho quarterback John Friesz is the player most consistently mentioned as  having pro possibilities. Everyone seems to agree that the lanky, 6-foot-4,  216-pounder has a National Football League arm, but he is not mobile.  </P> <P> The Patriots are interested in Buck, who has played against National Collegiate  Athletic Association Division I-AA competition for the most part. Steinberg  said he will have to see him in postseason all-star games to make a complete  assessment.  </P></p>

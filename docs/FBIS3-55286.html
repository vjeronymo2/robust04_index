			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The Party of Russian Unity  and Accord supports the position of the Inter-regional  Association of Independent Deputies on the election of the State  Duma leadership.    Party leader Sergey Shakhray, who is also Russian vice-prime  minister, told a news conference in Moscow on Thursday that  there have been attempts by large election blocs to predetermine  the fate of the State Duma behind the back of the majority of  deputies. He stressed that the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord is ready for forming a broad coalition in the Duma "at  least on the basis of a common approach towards the principle of  election of the Duma chairman." This would ensure the equality  of all deputies, he added.    Independent deputies of the State Duma warned on Wednesday  that large election blocs are seeking to gain control of the  State Duma.    A statement issued by the Inter-Regional Association of  Independent Deputies of the lower house of the Federal Assembly  suggested reforming the house factions not only by the principle  of their party orientation, but also by other principles. It  also proposed forming ruling bodies of the house on a parity  basis. The deputies believe that every candidate should be  elected by secret ballot.    They said that deputies of the State Duma chairman should be  elected on a parity basis: One from the election blocs and the  other from individual constituencies. Additionally, the house  procedural regulations should be based not on a party principle,  but on the principle of multi-factionalism which takes into  account the interests of the whole deputy corps. As for the  procedural regulations they should not violate the constitution  or contradict the voters's will, the deputies said.    Shakhray said his party believes that the government should  raise the question of confidence in itself in the State Duma.  This would be a "forestalling step by the Cabinet of Ministers  to promote interaction between the government and the  parliament." In any case "we will support Viktor Chernomyrdin  as prime minister," Shakhray added.</p>

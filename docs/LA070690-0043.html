			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: SHE'LL WHEEL THROUGH C&amp;W CIRCUIT,  SINGING ABOUT POTHOLES IN LIFE'S ROAD  </P> <P> Is America ready for a handicapped, sex-changed country-Western singer?  </P> <P> Bobbie Lea Montgomery is betting on it.  </P> <P> A decade ago, while living in San Diego, Montgomery made a splash by becoming  the first handicapped person to undergo sex-change surgery (he to she). And to  have it paid for by Medicare.  </P> <P> Later, there was a quickie romance and marriage to a long-haul trucker. And a  son fathered by her husband and carried to term by her sister as a surrogate.  </P> <P> Then Montgomery and spouse left for Las Vegas, Houston, New Orleans and  elsewhere and fell off the media radar.  </P> <P> Now she's 43 and living in Nashville with her 9-year-old son, Scooter. She  feels she has experienced more than enough tragedy and treachery to qualify for  the country-Western charts:  </P> <P> Three divorces (one as a man, two as a woman), a degenerative bone disease that  left her wheelchair-bound, years of scorn while living as a transsexual, a wife  and unborn child killed in a traffic accident, political defeat (for mayor of  Slidell, La.), an elevator accident, and a husband and marriage ruined by  cocaine.  </P> <P> She pulled together $2,500 and hired studio musicians to cut "Heartbreak on  I-10" on her own label, Sexy Wheels Publishing Co. It's the mournful ballad of  her failed marriage to the man she met and wooed over the CB radio.  </P> <P> Soon she'll get into her specially equipped Oldsmobile and, like a latter-day  Loretta Lynn, make the circuit of rural radio stations in the South.  </P> <P> She's searching for a disc jockey ready for something entirely different.  Sample lyric:  </P> <P>  One day he told me  </P> <P>  If I was in a hospital bed  </P> <P>  With no arms and legs  </P> <P>  He'd still love me.  </P> <P>  That's how much we loved one another,  </P> <P>  But cocaine took it all.  </P> <P>  Montgomery knows that the country-Western road is littered with potholes and  heartaches. But she figures there's nothing that she and Scooter can't lick.  </P> <P> "Life is always changing," she says in a soft Southern voice. "I'm proof of  that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Have a Few Double-Takes  </P> <P> Sights and sites.  </P> <P> * Look-alike. Otherwise, different.  </P> <P> A woman in Marin County is such a ringer for Dianne Feinstein that she posed  for ads as a Di-clone for Hastings, the chic clothing store, when Feinstein was  mayor of San Francisco.  </P> <P> You might figure she'd be supporting Feinstein for governor. Wrong.  </P> <P> She's Grace Bos, sister of San Diego's Otto Bos, campaign director of Pete  Wilson for governor. She's a Wilsonite.  </P> <P> * Spotted at Cardiff on the Fourth of July:  </P> <P> A young surfer catching a dozen waves. Then dashing back to a group lounging  under a beach umbrella. Then nursing her month-old baby.  </P> <P> * Another difference between Orange County and San Diego County.  </P> <P> In Costa Mesa, the council delays funding for the South Coast Repertory after  the theater starts proselytizing patrons to write Congress to keep the National  Endowment for the Arts free of Dread Political Influence.  </P> <P> In San Diego, the Old Globe Theatre does the same thing, and no one utters a  peep. Peep.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Leap to Conclusions  </P> <P> Every croak is important.  </P> <P> A letter-writer to the Lakeside-based Animal Press was angry about "that  grotesque photo and article (in a previous edition) about a frog strapped to a  torture rack."  </P> <P> The photo had shown a pet frog that had been taught to pedal a tiny tricycle.  </P> <P> In a response at the bottom of the letter, Animal Press editors said they  suspect the frog "would prefer a three-wheeler and an easy life" to the more  common uses for captured frogs: biology class dissection or French cooking.  </P> <P> Not seeking to offend the letter-writer, though, the editors added that "we do  not encourage or endorse the use of frogs" for riding trikes.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudio Herrera] </F>   [Text] The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) today  received the endorsement of the Revolutionary Party of the  Workers (PRT), which regards it the "best possible (electoral)  option" and feels the task now is to "defeat at the polls the  oligarchic alliance (Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement], Morena [National Renewal Movement], Civic Renewal  Party)."    The PRT, which is reorganizing, threw its support behind the  PRD in a communique that stated that the latter offers an  internal structure "that allows for the opening of (basic)  maneuvering room for participation that is comparatively more  democratic."    In its analysis the PRT leaders gather that since the Civic  Democratic Opposition Alliance took control in 1989 it began "to  fragment as a result of the decisive impact of its abuses,  irrational greed, ill-disguised corruption, and, of course, its  systematic measures against the nation and the people."  According to the PRT, the errors of that alliance "were nothing  more than the inevitable and fitting result of the social nature  of the governing individual."    The PRT document, signed by Graciela Dixon, Egbert  Wetherborne, and Ramiro Guerra, indicated that "based on its  ideals, origin, and historic reason, the PRD is more committed  to the national tasks pending at the end of the century." The  group also pledged to work for the PRD platform, "because with  the people in power it will be possible to continue the struggle  for an improved national and popular option."</p>

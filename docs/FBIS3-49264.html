			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" evening news bulletin; relayed by TV </F> Polonia]    [Text] After a meeting of the leaders of the government  coalition, Aleksander Kwasniewski said that Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak had stuck to his promise of introducing deputy  ministers from the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD] to the presidential ministries. The prime  minister did not confirm this news. Minister of National  Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk has declared that he will tender his  resignation if the coalition introduces political deputy  ministers into his ministry.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] A month ago,  in the course of a meeting of the SLD Supreme Council,  Aleksander Kwasniewski stated that he agreed with Waldemar  Pawlak that each of the coalition parties would introduce one  deputy minister into the ministries of foreign affairs, internal  affairs, and national defense. Unofficially, it is known that  the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to this,  on condition that these will be people already working in his  ministry. The minister of internal affairs also said, during a  meeting with journalists of the GLOS SZCZECINSKI daily, that he  is not surprised by such a proposal. On the other hand, the  president protested strongly. Just a few days ago, SLD  politicians stated that to avoid provoking a conflict with the  Belweder Palace, Waldemar Pawlak will withdraw the nomination of  the deputy ministers. In the view of Aleksander Kwasniewski, in  the course of the meeting today Waldemar Pawlak stuck to the  earlier decisions.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Pawlak agreed?    [Kwasniewski] He did not have to agree, he agreed a long  time  ago, and we will be implementing this.    [Correspondent] So he again maintained this today?    [Kwasniewski] That is so. [end recording]    [Sojka] The head of the Ministry of National Defense has  announced that he will not agree to the introduction of deputy  ministers from the SLD and PSL, since, as he put it, the army  does not need political commissars.    [Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk] I will be considering our  moves, together with a possible tendering of my resignation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, will you agree to the  nomination of deputy ministers in the presidential ministries?  Mr. Kwasniewski said that you agree. Is this true? [video  shows Pawlak walking down corridor without answering]    [Sojka] Ewa Wachowicz, press secretary for the prime  minister, affirmed that the issue of filling deputy ministerial  posts in the presidential ministries is a marginal topic for the  prime minister.

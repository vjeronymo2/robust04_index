			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "$8 Billion Frozen by Soviet </F> Authorities Starting To Be Returned to Russian Enterprises"]    [Excerpts] IZVESTIYA has been told by Mikhail Fedorov,  chief of the Vneshekonombank [Bank for Foreign Economic  Activity] Domestic Hard-Currency Debt Servicing Administration,  that as of 14 May -- or, in practice, owing to the weekend, as  of 16 May -- the 1993 state foreign currency bonds have started  to be redeemed and to have interest paid on them. [passage  omitted]    According to M. Fedorov, the total value of the first  tranche  of bonds is $266 million. Moreover, another $250 million will  be paid out in the form of interest on all five bond issues.  Under the terms of the placing of these securities, the period  for presentation of the bonds for repayment is set at 10 years  -- in other words, until 2005. So those who are unable to  obtain their money immediately after 16 May will be able to do  so in the next few days -- there is plenty of time.    Naturally, bond-holders will be trying to redeem the bonds  and gain their interest in the first few days. Here a question  arises -- will they not be hampered by all kinds of technical  shortcomings? But, M. Fedorov assured us, the Vneshekonombank  has already received from the government all the foreign  exchange required and has transferred it to its 23 authorized  banks, with branches throughout the country. There should be no  problem in redeeming the foreign currency bonds.    Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that the first  tranche of bonds are held by only a few lucky people. They were  mainly placed with commercial banks, joint ventures, and  charitable foundations. State enterprises -- or what had until  recently been state enterprises -- as a rule received the fourth  and fifth tranches of foreign currency bonds. And they may  simply not survive until redemption -- in other words, they  could go bankrupt.    Admittedly, an aftermarket in state foreign currency bonds  is  already taking shape. And those enterprises which need the  money immediately -- for restructuring, say, or to pay their  debts -- can sell their securities. But, naturally, for far  less than they are worth.    Thus, according to specialist assessments, the second  tranche  of the securities currently stand at 62 percent of par in the  aftermarket, the third tranche is trading at 42 percent, the  fourth tranche at 31 percent, and, finally, the fifth tranche is  trading at 26 percent of its par value. Of course, many  enterprises see this as robbery -- and not by those purchasing  the bonds, but by the state.    Nonetheless, to be fair, it should be said that the blame  for  this hardly lies with the current Russian Government. It is  paying up for other people's debts, even though it has assumed  them itself. Moreover, the fact that under the current complex  conditions the government has clearly honored its obligations  under the first tranche of the foreign currency bonds even as  regards the payment of interest will undoubtedly strengthen  confidence in other state securities and have a positive affect  on the financial situation as a whole.    Incidentally, many specialists were forecasting on the eve  of  the scheduled payments that the bond redemptions could  destabilize the foreign exchange market and lead to an uneven  fall in the ruble. But, as is not hard to calculate, all of the  first tranche together with the interest on all the other  tranches comes to around $500 million. This is not such a big  sum -- it is comparable to the size of just a week's trading on  the Moscow Interbank Foreign Exchange Market.</p>

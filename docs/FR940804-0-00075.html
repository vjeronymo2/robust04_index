			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 52.31(e)(1)(iv) of the final rule has merely been renumbered. Section 52.31(e)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule previously contained these requirements and substantially remains unchanged. The preamble to the proposed rule at page 51276 provides that this section requires States to apply the offset sanction consistent with amended section 173, regardless of whether the State has approved NSR rules consistent with section 173 requirements. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that States that have been delinquent in meeting the NSR requirements of the amended Act are not benefitted by applying sanctions in accordance with NSR rules that are more lenient than required by the Act or by the absence of NSR requirements within the State. Under this section, therefore, all affected areas subject to the offset sanctions would be subject to similar requirements in achieving those offsets, as specified in the amended Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 52.31(e)(1)(v) of this rule is unchanged from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(v) of the proposed rule. The purpose of this provision is to establish when the increased offset requirement will be applied. As noted in section II.B.2. above, EPA received numerous comments on this issue. For purposes of applying the offset sanction, EPA had some flexibility in determining what permits would be subject to the increased offset requirement. As noted in section II.B.2., numerous commenters suggested other possibilities. For example, some suggested that the increased offset ratio only apply to permits for which an application was received after the date the offset sanction applied. As stated more fully in the detailed response to comments document located in the docket, EPA has determined that the offset sanction should have immediate effects in affected areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 52.31(e)(2) of the final rule sets forth the highway sanction. Several revisions have been made to this section. As with &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), EPA has removed the highway sanction table from &sect;52.31(e)(2) of the proposed rule for the same reasons discussed above for why the offset sanction table was removed. Similarly, &sect;52.31(e)(2) includes new language that directly refers to the timing provisions of &sect;52.31(d). As with the similar revised language in &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), this is merely to clarify that the highway sanction applies with respect to the times set forth in that subsection, even though the area is not listed in a table in the rule. In addition, a new sentence has been added which specifies that the highway sanction only applies to affected areas that are also nonattainment areas. Although this issue was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule, the proposed rule and the preamble to the proposed rule referred back to the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction requirement of the Act (58 FR 51274, 51279; &sect;51.32(e)(2) of the proposed rule.) Section 179(b)(1) states that ``[t]he Administrator may impose a prohibition, applicable to a nonattainment area *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, EPA is incorporating this language, which was merely referenced in the proposed rule, into the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Implications of Today's Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Implementation of the Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 179(a) provides that unless the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., nonsubmittal, disapproval, and nonimplementation) has been corrected within the time periods prescribed therein one of the sanctions in section 179(b) ``shall apply, as selected by the Administrator.'' Under this final rule, sanctions will apply automatically in the sequence prescribed herein in all instances in which mandatory sanctions are applied under section 179(a) following findings under section 179(a)(1)&hyph;(4) for part D plans or plan revisions that EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to reverse the sanction sequence. However, if the sanction clock has expired for any findings before September 6, 1994, no sanction has yet applied since EPA interprets section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Since this action constitutes the final sanction selection rulemaking, the offset sanction begins to apply on any areas for which the sanction clock has elapsed on September 6, 1994. To understand the timing of the application of mandatory sanctions in these cases, it is first necessary to clarify the discussion in the proposal at p. 51274 on how the sanction clocks function under section 179(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

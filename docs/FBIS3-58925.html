			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Paul Duchateau: "Still A Matter of </F> Urgency"]    [Text] The PS [Socialist Party] turns the page. It could  have come up with a formula clearly stating the temporary nature  of the situation, the resigning members expressly being invited  to return to their responsibilities as soon as "the matter has  been cleared up" and their innocence confirmed by the courts.  By contrast, the vast game of musical chairs conducted by  Philippe Busquin and the choice of Elio Di Rupo as deputy prime  minister bears witness to a very strict "realpolitik," staking  all on a lasting revival of the coalition.    Such an attitude may, however, lend credence to the idea  that, in fact, over and above the inevitable expressions of  solidarity, the Socialist Party is sacrificing the three Guys.  Because it doubts in some way their complete innocence, or  because that is the price which must be paid in order to restore  its image.    But will this quick fix then be enough to allow the  coalition  to get off again on the right foot, almost as if nothing had  happened? Even if they are both bound by the same fear of  electoral defeat, the PS and the CVP [Christian People's Party]  have seen their old differences once again exacerbated by the  recent events. Busquin and his colleagues cannot get it out of  their heads that it is harassment by Flanders, and by the  Flemish partners in the coalition in particular, which drove  them to the episode of the triple resignation and which for  several days created a Titanic-like atmosphere in the Socialist  Party.    If a full-blown political crisis, with elections thrown into  the bargain, has been avoided as a result of these three  resignations and wide-ranging reshuffle, there is reason to fear  a resurgence of a muffled community war which will trigger a new  separatist dynamic, at present dulled rather than eradicated,  which, due to the increasing confusion of public opinion, will  serve to break the fragile balance struck by the latest state  reforms.    Perhaps, therefore, the Agusta affair may no longer directly  threaten the coalition, but it does continue to undermine  political life and the foundations of Belgian society. It is  still a matter of urgency that the truth, and the whole truth,  be revealed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A separate Kashmir Directorate has been set up in  the Foreign Office to highlight the Kashmir issue worldwide. A  spokesman of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP] said in Islamabad  that the step has been taken on the prime minister's directive.  He said the prime minister would like to expose the brutal  atrocities carried out by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir,  adding that she attaches significant importance to the Kashmir  issue whenever she pays a visit abroad. The PPP spokesman said  the government after careful consideration has formulated a  strategy to secure international support for its just stand on  Kashmir. He expressed the hope that its efforts will get a  considerable boost as a result of Ms. Bhutto's upcoming visits  to the United States and Russia.</p>

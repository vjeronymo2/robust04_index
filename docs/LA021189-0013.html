			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT REFUSES TO GIVE DOG ITS DAY IN 2-YEAR LEGAL STRUGGLE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court received another last-minute request Friday morning to stop  an execution, but this one differed in an important respect: The plea was made  on behalf of a dog.  </P> <P> After brief consideration by the justices, the request was denied.  </P> <P> Taz, a Malemute/Akita-type dog that was described as "husky and playful" by its  Oregon attorney, had already lost rounds before a county board, two state  courts in Oregon, a federal district judge in Portland and the U.S. 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Why did the dog's owner file appeals for two years?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Called Unfair  </P> <P> "Because he loved his dog," said Kerry Rydberg, a Eugene lawyer who represent  dog owner Shane Bowlin. "We also think this was unfair and unconstitutional. We  think the evidence was not very strong, and we were not permitted to  cross-examine the witnesses."  </P> <P> According to the thick court record, Taz's troubles began on Jan. 23, 1987,  when he was seized by Deschutes County officials for having "engaged in the  killing, wounding or injuring of livestock." Specifically, he had been seen by  a ranch owner "chewing on and biting a llama" along with two other dogs,  including a pit bull.  </P> <P> After two hearings before the county board, Taz was sentenced to "be killed in  a humane manner on Feb. 18, 1987." But the county agreed to stay the execution  while Bowlin appealed.  </P> <P> In his petition to the high court, Bowlin contended that he had been "denied  fundamental due process of law." The county ordinance under which Taz was  convicted "violates the 14th Amendment" because it does not require a full  adversarial hearing. Second, "plaintiffs were not permitted to confront and  cross-examine the witnesses" who identified Taz as one of the attackers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vicious Attack Cited  </P> <P> County officials say they had ample evidence that all three dogs took part in  the "vicious" attack. But Rydberg says Taz may have been mistaken for another  dog.  </P> <P> On Dec. 23 last year, U.S. Judge James M. Burns in Portland turned down the  constitutional challenge.  </P> <P> "Federal courts used to be viewed as austere, even learned tribunals," Burns  began. "Not any more. Thanks to the expansion of civil rights jurisprudence,  this is now a 'doggie court.' Indeed, this case is an animal 'double-header'  since it involves both dogs and llamas."  </P> <P> But, in a 13-page opinion, Burns carefully considered and rejected the dog  owner's legal contentions. He even added a footnote assuring dog owners that he  meant "nothing derogatory" by his comments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stay Denied by Court  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, the 9th Circuit Court denied a motion to stay the execution.  </P> <P> The two-year court fight came to an end Friday afternoon. Minutes after the  emergency petition was denied by Justice Antonin Scalia, Taz was "put to  sleep," according to county officials.  </P> <P> "We knew it was a long shot. But we didn't want to give up without trying,"  Rydberg said.  </P></p>

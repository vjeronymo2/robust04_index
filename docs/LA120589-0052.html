			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills  at an average discount rate of 7.55%, down from 7.63% last week. Another $8  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.30%,  down from 7.45% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills  sold for 7.52% on Oct. 23, and six-month bills averaged 7.26% on Aug. 8, 1988.  The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.80% for  three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,809.20 and 7.69% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,630.90. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry  official on Friday [28 January] called for a more cooperative  approach by the private sector to help increase American access  to Japan's automobile and auto parts markets.    "The cooperation approach" being proposed by the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] for Japan's auto  industry is designed to dispel "mutual distrust" between  Washington and Tokyo in the bilateral trade framework talks,  Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice MITI minister, told a press  conference.    Okamatsu was briefing reporters on his recent visit to the  United States, which was intended to help lay the groundwork for  the February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Through a series of talks with top executives of the U.S.  "Big three" carmakers and U.S. Government officials over a week  until Wednesday, it was made clear that the two sides remain  apart over the definition of the term "objective criteria"  agreed between them previously, Okamatsu said. But he added the  two parties agreed not to resort to "cosmetic" accords just to  tide over the February meeting.    Okamatsu said the new cooperation scheme comprises three  phases -- the setting of objective criteria by each auto maker  in parts purchases and other areas, evaluation of performance in  accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding  whether or not to craft additional steps based on the assessment.    Criteria for Japanese carmakers may also include the number  of their dealership chains handling U.S.-made cars and whether  the "design-in" approach is being adopted by them, Okamatsu said.    On the other hand, criteria would also be applied to U.S.  automakers, such as whether their products are tailored to meet  the needs of Japanese motorists by, for instance, having  right-hand steering wheels, he said.    The new approach regards the establishment of mutually  cooperative relationships on a private-sector level as a first  step toward progress in bilateral trade talks, Okamatsu said.    Turning to the issue of a government role in trade and other  business activities, he said the Japanese side rejected a U.S.  call for Tokyo to use administrative guidance to increase  imports.    Such a step would run counter to Prime Minister Hosokawa's  major policy of deregulation, Okamatsu said.    After the press conference, a senior MITI official  accompanying Okamatsu on his U.S. visit said he had the  impression that views among U.S. Government officials are a bit  divergent over the definition of objective criteria. But the  Clinton administration, with the free market mechanism held up  as its chief economic policy, will probably work hard in order  to coordinate the differing views, said the official who  declined to be named.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, labor and social policy </F> minister, by Andrzej Bober and Jerzy Baczynski in Warsaw; from  the "Letters on Economy" program--live]    [Text] [Bober] Mr. Minister, the election slogan of "It  Doesn't Have To Be This Way Any More" is being replaced by the  slogan of "It Could Be Even Worse." As we heard, the number of  unemployed will probably exceed 3 million people today. So what  does a labor minister actually do?    [Miller] You know, as I was watching the press conference by  [the former chief of the National Radio and Television  Broadcasting Council] Mr. Markiewicz, a thought occurred to me  that the situation has indeed deteriorated, except that is not a  result of Pawlak government's measures, or even of the  coalition's measures. I am sure it will not deteriorate further  in the future but in order to be able to assess that, let us  meet in a year's time and see what the results are.    [Bober] What does a labor minister do?    [Miller] He deals with [hesitating] providing protection for  the process of transformations. Your colleague here in the  studio was kind enough to mention my ministry's name. I would  say my ministry's goal is to lessen the pain of the  transformations, that is to say its goal is to make sure that  the pain does not become unbearable and that it does not rise to  a level where society refuses to give its consent anymore to the  inherent cost of the transformations.    [Bober] So the Labor Ministry deals with providing social  benefits?    [Miller] Not just that, but the ministry also makes efforts  to establish a new labor regime which would be adapted to the  market economy; it also tries to change the system of social  benefits by conducting a deep reform of social benefits, and an  active social policy. But I understand you are mainly  interested in unemployment.    Well, I have been trying to convince my colleagues in the  government that if just one minister was charged to deal with  unemployment and with fighting it, then of course nothing would  ever change. I can remember a sentence spoken by [former  Swedish] Prime Minister Palme in which he said that in his  cabinet, every single minister is charged with unemployment.  Perhaps that is somewhat of an overstatement but in any event,  I have been trying to promote an approach under which every  minister--in particular chiefs of economic ministries--while  making various economic decisions, should be asking himself a  question of what impact the decision will have on the  unemployment situation.    [Bober] I see. We will return to that theme but let us keep  discussing the ministry's role for a while longer. Last year,  the ministry devoted 3.5 trillion zlotys for [unemployment]  benefits, training courses, and loans to the unemployed, while  this year, there are plans for the figure to rise to 5.7  trillion, not counting the 1 trillion which you [addressing  Miller] quote, stole, unquote from [Land Use Management and  Construction] Minister Blida.    Mr. Minister, these monies are not actually devoted to  creating new jobs, but to the protections that you described, is  that not so?    [Miller] No, no, they are largely devoted to creation of new  jobs. You mentioned the almost 6 trillion zlotys which is  devoted to so-called active forms of fighting unemployment.  What are these active forms about? They include public works,  interventionist measures, gaining new skills, and loans to the  unemployed--these are naturally the most efficient type of  measures. The real drama is about [hesitating] the fact that  out of the Labor Fund, 90 percent of the financial means were  devoted to unemployment benefits up to now, and only 10 percent,  which we talked about, to active forms of fighting unemployment.  What I tried to do was to increase the amount [devoted to the  active forms], that is to say to change the disadvantageous  ratios there. If the Sejm adopts the budget draft, then we will  be able to increase the figure of 10 percent to 13 percent.  That, of course, is only a slight increase, but it is better  than no increase at all.    [Bober] I see. But the thing is, we are trying to use  percentages as consolation here but my understanding is that  during sessions of the Council of Ministers for instance, you  meet with the other ministers. So how would you explain this  strange situation where schools are educating future experts as  we speak, but we already know at this stage that nobody will  need those experts in a year, half a year, or two years? So the  other ministries contribute to creating unemployment?    [Miller] Yes, you are right on that point. I mentioned the  economic ministries but you rightly noted that there is also the  Education Ministry, but I must admit that there have been some  changes occurring recently, I mean that ministry has taken  counteractive measures against any further functioning of  schools whose graduates are bound not to find jobs in the  region--these are mainly vocational schools, ones attached to  factories and plants. And of course, without a close  cooperation....    [Bober, interrupting] I see. But my understanding is that  there must also be some cooperation with the Finance Ministry  since it has the means either to promote or restrict  entrepreneurship through its tax system and financial  arrangements. In a situation where tax thresholds are raised on  a motion of the Finance Ministry, then what is the result of  that? The result is that the so-called gray area widens,  incentives to work disappear, there occurs a willingness to hide  one's own income, but it does not serve at all the cause of  development.    [Miller] You are right in a way, but on the other hand, one  cannot abandon the tax system completely. But I agree with  you....    [Bober, interrupting] I am not in favor of such a move.    [Miller] I agree with you that the tax system should promote  entrepreneurship and that is why my view is--and we will submit  such proposals--that one must widen the system of various [tax]  breaks, especially for investors who want to invest in areas  which are particularly endangered by unemployment, I mean in  gminas [small administrative units] particularly endangered by  unemployment. There are over 400 such gminas, out of the total  of about 2,500. So you see it is a very [hesitating] serious  problem. We must look for new kinds of measures, for instance  such measures that create incentives to those workplaces which  employ graduates. Let me cite for you a really tragic number:  About 30 percent of all the unemployed are young people, less  than 24 years old. That number indicates how big the drama and  the phenomenon [of unemployment] really is.    [Bober] The last report of the Business Center Club, which  was released last week, suggests that there is... [Bober pauses]  That Polish entrepreneurs can see a danger for the market  economy. Now, if they can see a danger for the market economy,  that means that they can see a threat for the industrial  development in general. Again, the issue of creating new  workplaces is being curbed, in a way.    [Miller] I believe that these are all exaggerated....    [Bober, interrupting] Exaggerated?    [Miller] Exaggerated fears concerning the question of how  unemployment can be eliminated. I think that two conditions  must be met; first, the economic growth. We have a 4 percent  economic growth; however, economic growth alone is still too  little....    [Bober, interrupting] Perhaps this is within the limits of  statistical error?    [Miller] In Spain, for instance, there is a lot of economic  growth, but at the same time, 20 percent of the country is  unemployed. Apart from the economic growth, there must be an  active form of creating the labor market. That means....  [Miller pauses] I have already briefly discussed those active  forms; however, I believe that we should take greater care of  the regions threatened by unemployment as well as the social  groups which are particularly threatened by unemployment. We  should try to decrease unemployment there...    [Bober, interrupting] I understand; however, Mr. Minister,  do you think that your colleagues, industry minister, ownership  transformations minister, are of the same opinion? Indeed, I  must agree with the view that it is not your ministry that  creates unemployment. It is, actually, the activities of these  ministries that create unemployment. Are they aware of these  simple economic interdependences?    [Miller] You have placed me in a very difficult  situation....    [Bober, interrupting] I want you to evaluate your  colleagues.    [Miller] If I mention one minister and not the others, they  will be offended. However, I have gotten the impression,  especially in the recent weeks, that this agreement is greater,  especially with the industry minister and the ownership  transformations minister. You have mentioned Minister Blida. I  would like to comment on that. Our conflict lies in the  following....    [Bober, interrupting] That you take money away and she gives  it back.    [Miller] 1.250 trillion zlotys are reserved for the  implementation of a law that does not yet exist. This law on  apartment rentals and expenditures will come into effect on 1  October this year--at the soonest. Until that time this money  will not be used, probably to the satisfaction mainly of  Minister Misiag--but not to my satisfaction. I suggest that  this money be paid to people earlier; that is, the apartment  allowances should be paid beginning on 1 April, once the budget  is passed. The poorest families, which can obtain this money  earlier, cannot wait until October, November, or December.    [Bober] Mr. Minister, can you possibly precisely answer the  question of when we will really be able to see new workplaces  created?    [Miller] Well, actually we still have two years to stop  the process of increasing unemployment. It is worth recalling  that it was supposed to amount to 400,000 when the process of  transformation in Poland was just beginning in 1990. Why am I  saying that we have two years? Because after that time, for  demographical reasons, the number of young people looking for a  job will rise dramatically. In line with some data, by 2010, in  Poland there will be approximately 50 percent of the unemployed  in the entire European labor market, with the exception of the  states of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, we must make  quite a fundamental breakthrough in this area over the two  years; otherwise, we will not be able to control this process  later on.    [Bober] That means that it is difficult to say precisely  when we will be able to see....    [Miller, interrupting] I believe that it will be in the  middle of this year, in May and June. At that time the number,  which has already amounted to 3 million, will start to drop.  This is related to the fact that we will start large-scale  welfare work, intervention work; second, I think that these  harbingers of the economic recovery will result in rather  positive results.    [Bober] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for these explanations.  They are not very comforting....    [Miller] They are just as they are....    [Bober, interrupting] However, it is not for this reason  that we have invited you to the program. We rather wanted you  to present the dangers of this situation, because it really is  dangerous.    [Miller] Yes, the situation is really very dangerous. I  believe that, if possible, as early as this year the Sejm should  adopt an all-national program of combating unemployment. Why  all-national? Because this task exceeds the strength of one  ministry, or even the government. The state must take advantage  of all the instruments that it has at its disposal.    [Bober] Thank you for these explanations.    [Baczynski] Mr. Minister, I think that, contrary to what  Andrzej Bober said, many economists would consider you an  extreme optimist--if you assume that in the middle of the year  unemployment will stop increasing. According to some forecasts,  we will not manage to avoid the level of 5 million unemployed,  or an index such as in Spain--over 20 percent. Professor Kabaj,  among others, forecasts that already now, if we took into  consideration the concealed unemployment, there would be at  least 1.5 million or 2 million more unemployed than the  statistics actually show....    [Miller, interrupting] According to other statistics, this  unemployment is smaller than the number of registered persons.  We simply have a margin of persons who register themselves on  those unemployment lists for other reasons.    [Baczynski] At any rate, we wish you good luck.    [Miller] Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China's first  environmental protection technology fair opened in Yixing,  Jiangsu Province, today.    The National Environmental Protection Technology Market,  located in the city's environmental protection science and  technology park, also opened today.    On display during the five-day fair are 500 new materials  and  new products from manufacturers across the country. The fair is  being sponsored jointly by the State Science and Technology  Commission, the China Environmental Protection Industry  Association and the Yixing City Government.    Included are equipment for treating waste water, purifying  waste gas and controlling noise, meters and instruments, and  both Chinese and foreign environmental protection techniques and  information.    Yixing furnishes 15 percent of the annual output value of  China's environmental protection industry. In 1992 it set up a  national high- and new-technology industrial development zone --  the Yixing Environmental Protection Industrial Park.    The National Environmental Protection Technology Market in  the park serves as a bridge between research institutes,  manufacturers and dealers.</p>

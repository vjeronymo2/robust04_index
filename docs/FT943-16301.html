			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates reveals plan to delist Bredero Investors in Bredero Properties, the property developer, are looking to British Land for a lead in how to react to the news that Slough Estates will delist Bredero after the close of the current privatisation offer, on July 29. British Land recently purchased a 6.9 cent stake in Bredero, and is refusing to comment on its plans. However, it is unlikely to want to emerge as a passive investor in a private company. Slough made its 10p a share offer on May 26 (when the share price was 15p), but at the initial close on June 17, it had acceptances from only 6.76 per cent of outside shareholders, adding to its existing 49.5 per cent stake. Mr Trevor Brown, who owns more than 4 per cent of Bredero's shares, described the move to delist as 'blatant bullying'. However, under Stock Exchange regulations, directors do nor require shareholders's approval for such a move. Slough said it will not increase its offer, but Mr Derek Wilson, group managing director, denied that the threat of delisting was a means of pushing shareholders into accepting the offer. 'The company, as it stands at the moment, is finished. It has no income-bearing assets, and the overhead needs to be reduced.' Smaller shareholders may be discouraged from retaining shares in a private company, but marketmakers have said they would trade shares on a matched bargain basis, assuming that there remains a substantial minority shareholding.</p>

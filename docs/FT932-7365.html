			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / No more Maastrichts The one thing we have learned for sure from the Maastricht treaty is that we must never go through that kind of thing again. We do not need and cannot handle another European treaty such as Maastricht; we must avoid a re-run of a ratification process, the main effect of which has been to drive a deep split through the centre of the European political establishment, and turn a large proportion, perhaps a majority, of the voters against the European Community. The prolonged uncertainty over UK and Danish ratification has effectively paralysed the EC for about a year. That paralysis should now end. But in the meantime whole chunks of the treaty, starting with economic and monetary union (Emu), already look in need of an overhaul. The 12 member governments must do their best with the treaty they signed. But the voter support that would enable them to make a fresh start has been seriously alienated by the various struggles over ratification. In the course of these struggles, the treaty has come in for many detailed criticisms, starting with the standard complaint that it is a confusing farrago of heterogeneous ingredients, prepared according to different recipes. Almost no one has a good word to say for it, unless they are being provocatively unconventional. But many of the specific criticisms of the Maastricht text are of little consequence compared with the central flaw which we can only now see with hindsight - the purpose of Maastricht was to take Europe a great stride forward, but the real political effect of the treaty-making process has been to make European integration more unpopular, divisive and difficult. Unless we draw the right conclusions from the Maastricht experience, the inherent stresses of treaty negotiation, revision and ratification are likely to sandbag the Community over and over again, at considerable cost and no advantage. Some say the Maastricht programme for Emu was always unworkable; others say that it is unworkable now. We shall see. But the really serious political flaw in the programme was not in the details, but in the attempt to make it compulsory. We know why. The French wanted a binding commitment from the Germans now, because they were not sure they would get it voluntarily later. But this attempt to pre-empt the future was a fundamental strategic mistake, because it stirred up gratuitous opposition. Anxiety among the Danes was so intense that they have been allowed to opt out of virtually the whole of the treaty. The UK is excused from monetary union and the social chapter. And on the day, even the Germans will need a vote in the Bundestag to go ahead with monetary union. We should not be surprised by this outbreak of political reality. If the big day ever comes, the transition to monetary union will obviously be a conscious act of choice, by each of the governments, with the explicit consent of their parliaments. It will not be made in obedient submission to the Maastricht treaty. If this simple truth had been clearly built into the treaty we might have had less trouble. There would have been no need for superfluous opt-outs, and the treaty could probably have been ratified with more speed and less fuss. The lesson is obvious. With each new phase of integration, the EC is increasingly likely to encroach on national sensitivities. That will mean a simple three-way choice: to move at the pace of the most reluctant; to force the reluctant off the bus; or to embrace the principle of a variable-speed Europe as a desirable characteristic of the integration process, even more important than subsidiarity. If these are the options, the choice is easy. A Community of mature democracies should not compel the reluctant to act against the will of their electorates; and it should not allow the reluctant to exercise a veto on the enthusiastic. The corollary is that future Community treaties need to be different in spirit from Maastricht: more general, less prescriptive, more elastic, less formalistic, more evolutionary. In the Maastricht treaty, the general and the particular are all bundled up together. As a result, if the Danes had said No the second time round, the others would have had no idea what to do next. It is absurd to walk into that kind of mess, and the 12 must make sure that they do not do it again. This is not a purely theoretical problem. The Maastricht treaty provides for a review and renegotiation in 1996. But some elements of renegotiation need to happen earlier, partly to bring the Emu plan into line with economic reality, and partly because of the membership negotiations with four member countries of the European Free Trade Association. In these negotiations the 12 will ask the four to declare their whole-hearted commitment to the aim of a common foreign and security policy. But since three of the four are neutrals, such promises will be unreliable, and perhaps hypocritical. The 12 would do better to address openly the issue of a variable-speed Europe. With the Danish vote, Maastricht has a reprieve, but it is no more than that. A very large minority voted against the treaty in France and Denmark. The polls suggest that popular opposition may be even greater in Germany and Britain. This is not a satisfactory basis for implementing the treaty. In domestic politics, perhaps, a majority is a majority, however small. But an evolving Community needs a much broader acquiescence. That in turn may depend on the recognition of national idiosyncrasies through the principle of variable geometry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Resignation of S. Korean `PM'" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Yi Hoe-chang a few  days ago tendered his resignation as "prime minister [PM]" of  South Korea four months after his appointment and Kim Yong-sam  immediately endorsed it.    NODONG SINMUN today views his resignation as a virtual  dismissal by the traitor Kim Yong-sam who hated his recent acts  and words as a "challenge to the presidential authority."    His recent acts and words in question are that Yi Hoe-chang  "attempted to control the state affairs" by ordering the  participants in a "coordinating meeting on the policy of  reunification and security" to report the results of the meeting  before implementing them. The meeting was held with the  participation of "Chongwadae [presidential office]" clan and  "cabinet ministers" concerned, but in his absence.    The news analyst says:    The power struggle erupted because both the traitor Kim  Yong-sam and the "prime minister" were captives to greed for  "government power."    South Korea is a virtual colony of the United States, so the  "president" Kim Yong-sam cannot make a "policy" at his will.  This being the fact, it is foolish of the "prime minister" to  try to lead the "administration".    Yi Hoe-chang's lot is the unavoidable fate of a colonial  puppet.    Anyhow, it is obvious that the dismissal of the "prime  minister" is a product of the crisis of the "civilian  government" of South Korea.    It is one year or more since the emergence of the Kim  Yong-sam regime but the third "prime minister" has to be  appointed now. How long will this unstable home be maintained?    Shouts for "down with Kim Yong-sam" are growing louder  outdoors and the power struggle is getting more serious indoors.  This is a sign of the collapse of the "civilian government."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F> Alain Baron in Vienna; date not given: "Austrian Public Opinion  Moves in Favor of Integration" -- first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES]    [Text] After the first one in November in Paris, a second  French-Austrian forum, held on 28 January in Vienna, brought  together officials and economic decisionmakers from both  countries to discuss Austria's integration into the European  Union, which is scheduled for early 1995. A French-speaker and  francophile, Alois Mock (christian democrat of the Austrian  People's Party) is a fervent supporter of integration.    [Baron] Where do the negotiations on Austria's integration  into the European Union stand? Will the deadlines be met?    [Mock] I am convinced that it is possible to conclude them  positively by early March. There has been an enormous amount of  work in view of the complexity of the problems tackled,  especially in the area of agriculture. However, I am pleased  that the Greek Presidency proposed a timetable that reflected  the Community's intention. This desire matches ours. On 8  February, we have a meeting with the three other applicant  countries (Sweden, Norway, and Finland), and then a series of  meetings beginning on 21 February and lasting until the end of  the month. The Austrian referendum will take place afterwards  and, if the outcome is positive, actual integration could take  place on 1 January 1995.    [Baron] Just a few weeks ago, Austrian officials feared that  public opinion would reject integration. Where do things stand  today?    [Mock] Things change quickly; public opinion is very mobile.  For two months, there has been a majority that is pretty much in  favor -- especially following the recognition, which we obtained  at the meeting on 21 December, that Austrian standards for the  environment will be maintained. That had a very positive effect  on public opinion.    [Baron] Once integrated, will Austria become the "leader" of  the countries of Central Europe within the Community?    [Mock] That would be exaggerating our sway within the  Community. However, we will indeed make our experience and  knowledge of relations between the former free Europe and the  European countries of the Danube Basin available to the  Community bodies.    [Baron] You place a great deal of emphasis on the role of  the  regions in the Community. Why?    [Mock] In Austria there was an obstacle to European  integration: The unjustified fear of bureaucratic centralism  from Brussels that would wipe out individual features. We must  consult each other and make decisions together on problems that  affect the entire Community. However, we must also let the  lower levels find their own answers to their own problems as  much as possible.    [Baron] Are you referring to the principle of subsidiarity?    [Mock] Yes, of course. But this is not just a matter of  subsidiarity. It is also an issue of democratic control.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar completes last stage of rescue package Trafalgar House yesterday completed the final hurdle in its financial restructuring when shareholders unanimously approved a proposed Pounds 425m rights issue and placing of convertible preference shares. Mr Simon Keswick, Trafalgar's new chairman, described the rights issue - the company's second over a 10-month period - as providing a 'fresh start'. Analysts agreed that it was a turning point in the fortunes of the troubled conglomerate, and suggested that further capital raising would be 'unthinkable' within the next two years. Shareholders were being asked to approve a 1-for-3 convertible preference share issue, and a further Pounds 70m placement of convertibles aimed at broadening the company's institutional shareholding base. The capital raising represents a rescue package to offset exceptional write-downs of Pounds 397m, which brought the valuations of the group's properties, hotels and other investments down to realistic levels. The acceptance of the rights issue represents a victory for 25 per cent shareholder Hongkong Land, the cash rich property investment arm of the colony's Jardine Matheson group. Hongkong Land was the force behind the restructuring, which followed the appointment of its finance director to the Trafalgar board. The Jardine group has secured short-term credit lines for Trafalgar from HSBC Holdings, which has historically-strong bonds with the 'princely hong'. In August its control will be further demonstrated by the arrival of Mr Nigel Rich, Jardine's 'taipan' - or managing director - as the new chief executive.</p>

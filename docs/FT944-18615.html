			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: High-speed rail still an option in US Sir, Richard Tomkins concluded in his article, 'Fast trains are a long time coming' (August 29), that in the US 'it is now accepted that the private sector alone will not build high-speed railways'. His conclusion is correct. However, his assertion that the problem facing US high-speed rail projects is that 'most Americans never take trains' is off the mark. Where frequent, convenient, and comfortable service is offered, Americans will ride trains in great numbers. This is evident on at least four popular Amtrak routes - New York to Washington, New York to Albany, Chicago to Milwaukee, and Los Angeles to San Diego. But the service must be offered in order to attract passengers. Over the past two decades, the US preoccupation with high-speed rail has been focused on multi-billion dollar dedicated right-of-way solutions based on the Japanese, French and German models. All of these projects, requiring huge investments, have failed. Neither the private nor the public sectors can or will raise the funds necessary for such expensive undertakings. Operating high-speed rail service on existing track has come to be recognised as an achievable solution. This 'incremental approach' is based on the successful Swedish model. Tomkins is correct in saying this is not easily done. But combining service-proven tilt trains like X 2000 with the upgrading of existing track, new signalling to govern high-speed trains, improved crossing protection, even the addition of entirely new track to increase capacity - all are affordable when compared with the cost in dollars and in time of building new railroads for high-speed trains. The Northeast Corridor linking Boston, New York, and Washington will be the first US high-speed rail corridor developed using the 'incremental approach'. I believe that its inevitable success will be a model for other projects around the US. Joseph S.

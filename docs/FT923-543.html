			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / DPP demands strict time limits in fraud trials MRS BARBARA MILLS QC, director of public prosecutions and former head of the Serious Fraud Office, yesterday called for radical action to tackle the problems of long fraud trials. She told the Bar's annual conference in London that the country could no longer afford to live with the present system. Public confidence had been badly damaged by the Blue Arrow and Guinness cases and needed to be restored urgently. Mrs Mills said time limits should be imposed on trials, with none taking more than two months. 'There are some trials which advance nowhere day after day,' she said. 'What are we doing wasting the public's money in this way? This has got to stop.' Trial judges should have the power to decide how much time should be spent on each issue in a trial, Mrs Mills continued. Barristers should be limited to half an hour on each issue. A simple fraud offence should be introduced and the prosecution should be obliged to produce short indictments. Plea-bargaining should be encouraged, Mrs Mills said. At the moment the justice system achieved very little for victims of fraud. In the US plea-bargaining had been instrumental in recovering millions of dollars for victims. She also proposed that prosecution and defence should be compelled to co-operate in identifying the issues for trial by early disclosure of their cases during pre-trial hearings. The intention behind the special pre-trial procedure for fraud cases introduced by the 1987 Criminal Justice Act was excellent, but did not work because it had no teeth. Defendants who did not co-operate should not be allowed to give evidence and cross-examine at the trial on issues about which they had not disclosed their positions during pre-trial hearings. Mrs Mills was supported by Mr Justice Henry, the Guinness trial judge. He called for enforced pre-trial disclosure, for time limits, for trials to begin with a summary of the issues by the judge and for the jury to have a list of witnesses and a timetable. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the conference the predominance of European law over national law was proving a growing constraint on action to promote competition in the UK. Trying to inject competition into the supply of beer following the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, for example, was hindered by the possibility of a conflict between beer orders under the Fair Trading Act and an EC exemption on exclusive purchasing agreements. The UK also appeared to be constrained by the exemption in action it could take to modify the distribution system for cars. He criticised 'restrictive distribution arrangements where the effect is to ban certain kinds of retail activity.'</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> INTO THE TERROR IN 'WHIRLWIND'  </P> <P> Imagine a crowd of women, their ravaged faces pressed like hungry children  against the metal fencing of a prison yard, staring in devastation at  unattainable freedom on the other side.  </P> <P> That is the closing image of the Sovremennik Theatre of Moscow's "Into the  Whirlwind," and it's hard to forget. Adapted by Alexander Getman and staged by  the company's artistic director, Galina Volchek, in the Bagley-Wright Theatre  of the Seattle Center, "Whirlwind" is a co-presentation of the Intiman Theatre  and One Reel, producers of the Goodwill Arts Festival.  </P> <P> This issue-driven piece, based on the chilling first half of Eugenia Semyonovna  Ginzburg's memoirs of 18 years in Stalinist prisons, is the theatrical  centerpiece of this festival. Like so many other political hot potatoes, it had  been banned in the Soviet Union until glasnost relaxed the rules and the  Sovremennik was able to commission the adaptation and put it before the public  in February, 1989.  </P> <P> What comes across clearly in the telling of this tale of systematic and  dehumanizing punishment, is the smoldering passion of artists suddenly free to  express pent-up indignation and rage. It is Russians pointing horrified fingers  at Russians in their own immediate past -- and vowing that such history must  not repeat itself.  </P> <P> Ginzburg's nightmare was one of thousands that happened in a particularly  frenzied period of political purging in the '30s and '40s. She was a professor  who had the misfortune of praising publication of the wrong book by a colleague  and who became one more guiltless target of Stalinist paranoia.  </P> <P> Her true story reads like a bad novel. It is a series of horrific events from  the moment, in 1934, when she became suspect (even though married to a leading  member of the Tartar Province Committee of the Communist Party) to the time of  her incarceration in Kazan three years later, and her mental and physical  torment over the next 18 years -- through imprisonment, deprivation,  interrogation, torture, disease and the Gulag.  </P> <P> Ginzburg, who died in 1977, did not live to see her book published in the  U.S.S.R., let alone performed on stage. But she might have approved of what the  Sovremennik has achieved, re-creating not so much the events as their  psychological implications and damage. If we know that a dramatization can only  inspire outrage, there is always the danger that it will be robbed of its  drama. It is theater for the already-converted. But the combination of  articulate acting and Volchek's swiftly-paced direction, supported by a sound  score of metal clanging and grinding against metal (to the amplified screams of  torture), plunges us viscerally into the terror. This is not a play you just  watch, but a play you experience.  </P> <P> "Whirlwind" is performed in Russian, with subdued simultaneous translation over  headsets -- an imperfect but satisfactory arrangement. Marina Neyolova plays  Ginzburg in a performance of gradual but calamitous deterioration. This is a  woman who simply couldn't take the easy way out, not from a pretentious sense  of personal integrity, she protests, but out of an incapacity to falsify her  behavior. She wonders what might have happened if the torture had become more  intense. But it apparently did not and the journey remains one of spiraling,  anguished decline into her own personal whirlwind.  </P> <P> When the play closes with the announcement that these women will trade a prison  for a labor camp in Siberia, a kind of frantic joy busts out all over. It means  surrendering the stench and dankness of the cells for the great outdoors, icy  or not. The stage is suddenly bathed in light and these women rush forward to  embrace the limited promise of freedom, only to have the gates slam in their  faces and their hope fade with the lights.  </P> <P> It is an indelible image.  </P> <P> The unsettling lighting design and armored environment of Mikhail Frankel's set  contribute greatly: Everything threatens, confines and restricts, making the  moment of false hope at the end all the more shocking for having been illusory.  </P> <P> But it is Volchek's ability to reproduce the psychological disintegration so  palpable in the book that makes this "Whirlwind" affecting. She re-creates the  sense of a society devouring itself in an orgy of accusation and recrimination,  fostering a form of emotional cannibalism. The irrationality is all the more  horrifying for being explainable. As with the Maly Theatre of Leningrad's  "Brothers and Sisters," seen at the Old Globe last fall, we are invited to  watch the breakdown of reason and note how quickly it can spread.  </P> <P> An unusual dimension of "Into the Whirlwind" is its all-female component of  prisoners. The interaction among them cuts deeply into issues of motherhood and  sisterhood (though oddly enough, not rape or sex). A silent member of this cast  is 83-year-old Paulina Myashnikova, Ginzburg's friend and cellmate during some  of her ordeal. Myashnikova's presence is a testament to its reality.  </P> <P> Such an element of theatre-verite in a decidedly non-realistic presentation  seems to be part of the Sovremennik's effort to continue to define itself as a  theater on the cutting edge. Sovremennik (meaning "contemporary") was founded  in 1956 -- coincidentally, the year Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's purges  at the 20th Party Congress -- and it has had Volchek as artistic director since  1972. If it gives in to mild sensationalism now and then, it is in the pursuit  of passionate issues. This is not a company that preaches. It puts its audience  through the play -- no matter how uncomfortably. The more so, the better.  </P></p>

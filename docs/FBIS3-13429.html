			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Affairs  Ministry issued a statement today describing the action taken by  the UN Human Rights Commission as irresponsible and strongly  condemned it.    In a vote, the UN Human Rights Commission, despite the fact  that the majority of its members voted against or abstained,  approved a resolution on the violation of human rights in Iran,  supported only by Western countries.    The statement by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign  Affairs Ministry stresses: Those who issued the resolution have  remained silent in the face of the Zionist regime's crimes at  the al-Khalil mosque and have even stopped, in the first round  of its debate, a resolution that would have condemned the  Zionist regime.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry statement also mentions: It has  been proved to the world that the Western countries who support  such resolutions, are themselves practically assisting the  anti-human crimes and the clear violation of human rights in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of Europe, through their  deception.    The statement by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Islamic  Republic of Iran emphasizes that the Iranian punishment laws are  based on the Islamic legal concepts, accepted and respected by  over 1 billion world Muslims, and such resolutions not only have  no credibility or legitimacy, but will also damage the  credibility of such forums.</p>

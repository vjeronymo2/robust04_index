			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Uganda has protested to the Rwanda Government  over remarks made by the Rwanda Government Minister Justin  Mugenzi on the BBC yesterday, implicating Uganda in the war in  Rwanda. It called on the Kigali government to desist from  making such unhelpful remarks which do not help in finding a  solution to the tragic situation. The charge d'affaires of the  Rwandan Embassy in Kampala, Mr. Joseph Bukeye was this morning  summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the minister  of state for foreign affairs, Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja, presented  him the protests from the Uganda Government. Mr. Kirunda  Kivejinja told the charge d'affaires of the Rwandan Embassy that  remarks made by Mr. Mugenzi on the BBC Focus on Africa, on the  27th of April, that President Museveni controls the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] and that if President Museveni directed  the RPF, the killing taking place in Rwanda would stop, were  baseless, irresponsible and dangerous.    Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja told Mr. Bukeye that the Government of  Uganda and President Museveni have no control whatsoever on the  RPF. He informed him that the Government of Uganda views such a  statement coming from a senior official of the Rwandan  Government with grave concern and finds it totally unacceptable.  The minister drew the attention of the charge d'affaires to the  tireless efforts that President Museveni had made in trying to  find a lasting solution to the conflict in Rwanda. He said that  to clear the allegation that Uganda was involved in the conflict  in Rwanda, President Museveni has requested for a UN observer  mission which is (?planned) to man the Uganda-Rwanda border.

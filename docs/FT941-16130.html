			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Managed trade costs Americans Dollars 70bn each year Tariff barriers, quotas and other managed trade arrangements in the US cost American consumers about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 47bn) a year, according to a study published today by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics.* This cost is likely to be pared to around Dollars 30bn over the coming decade as tariff cuts agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation take effect. While Dollars 38bn of the current consumer cost is due to 'normal' low tariffs averaging 3.5 per cent which affect 60 per cent of US imports, the remaining Dollars 32bn is due to high tariffs, or 'special protection,' in 21 sectors ranging from canned tuna to ceramic tiles, and maritime services to machine tools. 'The textile and apparel sectors ..continue to be the Mt Everest of US trade protection,' say authors Mr Gary Hufbauer and Ms Kimberly Elliott. They account for Dollars 24bn of the Dollars 32bn consumer cost due to special protection. Estimating that 190,000 jobs would be lost if special protection were eliminated across the 21 high-tariff sectors, the authors say the average consumer surplus loss for every job saved by protection is Dollars 170,000 - six times the average annual compensation (wages plus benefits) of manufacturing workers in the US. 'This figure far exceeds the cost per worker of even a generous adjustment programme entailing income maintenance, retraining and relocation,' the study says. Examining 100 anti-dumping orders outstanding at the end of 1991, the study finds that these duties raise prices on the Dollars 3bn of imports affected by an average of 45 per cent. * Measuring the costs of protection in the United States, by Gary Hufbauer and Kimberly Elliott, Institute for International Economics, Washington.

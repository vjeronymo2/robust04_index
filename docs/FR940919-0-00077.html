			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Categories of TC Wastes Affected by Today's Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following TC wastes are subject to UTS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) all wastes identified as D018 through D043 (described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule as ``new organic constituents); (2) D012 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D017 organic pesticide wastes whose TCLP extract composition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the concentration criteria of 40 CFR 261.24, Table A but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose EP extract composition does not; (3) D012 through D017  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticide wastes whose TCLP extract composition meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration criteria of 40 CFR 261.24 Table A, as does the EP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extract composition, and (4) soil and debris contaminated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preceeding three sets of wastes. The first two categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are newly identified wastes, i.e. wastes not yet identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous at the time of the 1984 amendments and therefore not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the original statutory schedule. (The March 29, 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule extended the list of chemicals defined as TC and changed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraction step to a more sensitive procedure which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially identify more pesticide wastes than did the EP.) For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soil contaminated with the TC wastes, the variance process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available (see discussion in the Background section of this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the heading ``E. Treatment Standards for Hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Soil'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the proposed rule, regulating land disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly identified TC wastes by addressing underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents is the same approach as EPA adopted in the recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule for ignitable (D001) and corrosive (D002)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic wastes, promulgated on May 10, 1993 (published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 24, 1993, 58 FR 29860) in response to the court's decision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste Management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 976 F. 2d 2. That case vacated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and remanded certain Agency regulations (commonly referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Third Third rule) establishing prohibitions and treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for characteristic wastes, and also established rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to when the prohibitions and standards would not apply. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of the court's decision, an overview of the interim final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule published on May 24, 1993, and a discussion of how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency proposed to apply this approach to the TC wastes can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the text of the proposed rule at 58 FR 48092.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule regulates underlying hazardous constituents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the D018&hyph;D043 as well as in newly identified D012&hyph;D017 and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rest of the universe of D012&hyph;D017 wastes. (The definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``underlying hazardous constituents'' is contained at 268.2(i) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule.) For those D012&hyph;D017 nonwastewaters originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated in the Third Third rule, today's rule changes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerical value of the previously applicable treatment standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the UTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Soil Contaminated by Underground Storage Tanks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Soil which is contaminated with petroleum and is managed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during corrective action of releases from a RCRA Subtitle I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underground storage tank (UST) is not subject to the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards promulgated today for the TC organic wastes (D018&hyph;D043). Such soil that fails the TC for one or more of the newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified organic wastes (D018&hyph;D043) has been temporarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferred from regulation as a hazardous waste (55 FR 26986). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the Agency has proposed to permanently exempt UST  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum-contaminated soils from the TC rule (58 FR 8504).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, any Subtitle I petroleum-contaminated soil identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D001 through D017 would not be subject to the deferral and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be subject to all applicable RCRA land disposal restriction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency reminds the regulated community that any soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated by a release from a hazardous substance UST  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Subtitle I) as well as from all non-Subtitle I USTs (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum tanks) will continue to be subject to applicable RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste requirements, including the land disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions. Likewise, petroleum-contaminated soils from non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UST sources that exhibit a hazardous characteristic are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to applicable Subtitle C requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Metal TC Wastes Are Not Affected by Today's Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule does not affect TC metal wastes at all; this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule leaves the Third Third final treatment standards (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to EP metals) in place. Furthermore, today's rule does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the mineral processing wastes which were formerly exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Subtitle C regulation under the Bevill Amendment but which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently lost that exemption. Included in that set of wastes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes from the remediation of historic manufactured gas plant or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coal gasification sites. EPA will address TC metal wastes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the former Bevill mineral processing wastes in a future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Legal and Policy Basis for Today's TC Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule applies the UTS to underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents in D012&hyph;D043 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters' principal objection to the proposed standards for TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes was that the September 1992 Circuit Court decision did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize EPA to regulate underlying hazardous constituents in TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of these comments asserted that organic TC wastes were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fundamentally different from ignitable or corrosive wastes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore EPA's decision to apply the standards promulgated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the May 24, 1993 Interim Final Rule for ignitable and corrosive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes was inappropriate. These commenters said that TC wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were unlikely to pose a threat to human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment once treatment removed the single constituent, partly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because such treatment would remove other similar hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components of the waste. None of these commenters submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process data demonstrating these claims. On the other hand, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters argued that merely deactivating characteristic wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might well leave hazardous components intact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is regulating in this rule underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents in TC wastes when they are managed in non-CWA/non-CWA equivalent/non-Class I injection well waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. If, as commenters assert, treatment of the TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent effectively treats underlying hazardous constituents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then regulating the underlying hazardous constituent poses no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further burden. Additionally, EPA believes that the compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring provisions requiring the generator to address only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those underlying constituents ``reasonably expected to be present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the wastes'' relieves generators and treaters from an undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters objected that extending the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treat underlying hazardous constituents from ignitable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosive wastes, as promulgated in the May 24, 1993 Interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final Rule, to TC wastes was unnecessary. The numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standard for the constituent present at the TC level,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenters reasoned, meets RCRA's section 3004(m) ``minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat'' requirement. EPA is not persuaded by such reasoning. 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 22542, 22652 (June 1, 1990); Chemical Waste Management, 976  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.2d at 14; HWTC III, 886 F. 2d at 362. The TC level identifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes that are clearly hazardous, and does not evaluate presence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of underlying hazardous constituents, non-groundwater exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathways, or adverse environmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ongoing Management Practices for TC Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule solicited comments and data on volumes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC wastes managed in Class V injection wells, and on waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practices employed prior to such injection. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received little substantive comment and consequently has no basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for changing the proposed approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also solicited information about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial generation patterns in order to allow the Agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess the potential for source reduction or recycling for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC wastes in light of their wide diversity. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received no comments describing current industry practices upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the Agency could act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is to consider opportunities for source reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recycling of these wastes, and ways treatment standards could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect such types of waste minimization. The Agency notes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subtitle C rules generally, and the LDR rules in particular,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have already resulted in substantial volumes of hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer being generated, because these rules impose waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management costs on hazardous waste generators, and thus create a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial incentive to generate less waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, several commenters expressed concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievability of UTS for underlying hazardous constituents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex matrices and about the appropriateness of numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards based on incineration. See the discussion of UTS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.A of this preamble for more information on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tunisia seeks bigger EC olive oil quota SADDLED WITH unprecedented surplus stocks of olive oil, Tunisia has asked the European Community to raise its annual export quota to the EC from 46,000 to 60,000 tonnes. The stocks, amounting to 200,000 tonnes, are the consequence of the largest olive production recorded in the country's history which, for the 1991-92 season, amounted to 270,000 tonnes. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the five countries accounting for more than 90 per cent of the world's production of olive oil - Italy, Spain, France, Greece and Tunisia - all recorded a bumper crop at the same time, thus pushing up total world production last year by more than one third to 2.2m tonnes. Tunisia pays a tariff of Ecu5-10 (Pounds 3.95-Pounds 7.90) per 100 kilogrammes of olive oil, compared with Ecu55 for exports by Moroccan and Turkish, which have no quotas because the amounts are small. One of the key reasons why Tunisia cannot gain a bigger EC quota is that community members pay their own producers large subsidies. For Tunisia the olive oil industry is vital. The product accounts for 8 per cent of total Tunisian export earnings and 42 per cent of the value of all food exports.</p>

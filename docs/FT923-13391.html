			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukrainian manganese deal agreed AUSTRALIAN manganese producer Portman Mining says it has reached agreement with the Ukrainian government on a joint venture to expand a large underground manganese mine in southern Ukraine, reports Reuter from Perth. Portman is to complete a feasibility study on the mine, at Stepnogorsk in the Bolshoy-Tokmak area of the Nikopol manganese basin, before entering a 55:45 venture to develop the project. Mr Brian Johnson, Portman's executive director, said that total ore reserves of the Bolshoy-Tokmak deposit have been calculated at more than 1bn tonnes, making it one of the world's largest known manganese ore bodies. Portman is to earn its 55 per cent interest in the venture by providing a plant with a capacity of 1m tonnes of ore a year. It will also offer management, marketing and working capital to allow production to be expanded to 1m tonnes a year, from 250,000 tonnes at present, and will investigate the possibility of having the ore smelted at a ferro alloy smelter at Nikopol. The processed ore is used as feedstock by ferro manganese alloy producers, mainly in Europe, Russia and China. Mr Johnson said he would not disclose Portman's expected investment in the venture until it is formalised later this year. 'But it is within the company's ability to finance the project from existing cash flow and it will not require external loans for development.' He added: 'The Ukraine project should give Portman Mining competitive access to sections of the European manganese market as well as potential large volume sales to the Russian steel industry at a later date.'</p>

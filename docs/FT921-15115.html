			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's long surge set into reverse by jobless data Wall Street US STOCKS ran into their first genuine setback since mid-December yesterday, as disturbing employment news sparked heavy selling across all markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.07 at 3,199.46, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.51 lower at 415.10. Even the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, the star performer of recent days, succumbed to sellers, dropping 4.10 to 615.70. NYSE turnover was 238m shares, and declines clearly outnumbered rises by 1,088 to 653, an indication of the downward pressure. At first glance, the employment data for December were ambiguous. Although the headline unemployment rate rose a sharp one-fifth of a percentage point to 7.1 per cent - the highest since 1986 - the number of people employed on non-farm payrolls rose last month, by 31,000. Although analysts had expected a sizeable fall in payrolls, the figure was not as promising as it looked, because the bulk of the rise in employment was restricted to government agencies. Private sector employment actually fell by 35,000, and it was this that weighed heaviest on investors' minds. Part of the selling, however, was a natural reaction to strong recent gains, and few analysts argued that yesterday's declines were a prelude to a major correction in equity prices. Among individual stocks, a rare blue-chip gain was recorded by Sears, Roebuck, the giant retailer, which climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 on comments from the company claiming that it saw 'encouraging' signs of consumer activity in recent sales. The day's biggest decline was in Employee Benefits Plan, which plummeted Dollars 30 1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 in turnover of 3.5m shares after the company reported fiscal second quarter profits well below analysts' expectations. Thiokol jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 15 3/4 after investors reacted positively to a 'buy' recommendation from Bear Stearns, the Wall Street broking house. Two of the big three car manufacturers tumbled at the end of a week which saw dreadful 1991 sales figures and a difficult trip to Japan by top management in seek of concessions on trade, although both recovered some of their lost ground in late trading. General Motors fell Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 31 3/4 and Ford slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30. On the over-the-counter market, Aldus slumped Dollars 8 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/2 after the company estimated fourth quarter profits at between 27 cents and 32 cents a share. Canada TORONTO closed higher in another busy session, ending a hectic first full week of the new year. The 300 composite index gained 12.79 points, about 0.35 per cent, to close at 3,593.39. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 328 to 271. For the week, the index gained about 76 points, or about 2.2 per cent. Volume was a heavy 42.97m shares, the ninth highest in the exchange's history, but was down from yesterday's 49.01m shares. Trading value at CDollars 564.7m was down from yesterday's CDollars 691.0m. Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the conglomerates group, up 1.6 per cent. Financial services gained 1.4 per cent and consumer products were also higher. The gold group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.4 per cent. Energy group fell 1.0 per cent.</p>

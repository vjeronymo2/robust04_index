			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has agreed that two inspectors  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can continue  their work at the country's nuclear facilities.    Ho Hyo-pil, vice director of the secretariat [title as  received] of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland, said that the decision followed a request by the  IAEA.    He said that it reflected the DPRK's magnanimity and served  to prove the transparency of its declared peaceful purpose of  nuclear development.    The two IAEA inspectors arrived in Pyongyang on May 17 to  carry out checks at the Yongbyon radiochemical laboratory.    On June 13, the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the IAEA,  the world's nuclear watchdog body, and refused any further IAEA  inspections of its nuclear facilities from that date.    This followed an IAEA decision on June 10 to impose  sanctions  against the DPRK.    At a press conference today, Ho distributed a memorandum,  prepared by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland, which accused South Korea of stockpiling plutonium  in secrecy and itself being engaged in the development of  nuclear armaments.    The statement included a strong protest against what was  described as the IAEA's "injustice" and "double standards" over  the nuclear issues of the South and North sides of Korea.</p>

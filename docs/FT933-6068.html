			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor (1): No illusions over Bundesbank Sir, As the editor of the only English-language newsletter focusing on German monetary policy I have to take issue with your contention that it is almost impossible for non-German analysts to understand what the Bundesbank is about ('Bundesbank stays tough', leading article, August 27). It is very simple really. The Bundesbank has a legal mandate to combat domestic inflation. Its 1957 constitution makes no mention of cross-border responsibilities. And domestic growth and employment are accorded considerably lower priority. So why the puzzlement as to Bundesbank motives? Two further points. First, there is a growing case for questioning if high nominal short rates are, under the present circumstances, the best method of bringing German money supply and inflation back under control. They are artificially inflating time deposits (32.5 per cent of M3) to the detriment of longer-term forms of savings, and they are inducing speculative capital inflows that expand overall domestic liquidity. Second, non-German financial professionals constantly overlook the fact that credit policy decisions in Germany are made by a Bundesbank council consisting of 16 members, each with one vote and an individual political affiliation. Rate decisions are a matter of high politics in both a partisan and a personal sense within this closed forum - whatever the Bundesbank itself tries to maintain. As long as many in the council, including its current president, continue to believe that high rates are the solution to unacceptably high inflation, the absence of cuts on July 29 and last week completely fulfils the Bundesbank's constitutional mandate. There are, however, signs that a rethink of the current high-rate policy is being kindled by the newly appointed senior Bundesbank officials, particularly vice-president designate Johann Wilhelm Gaddum. Such arguments have yet to win the hearts and minds of the council majority. But we believe that they will do so well before the end of the year.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Cosa Nostra chief taken in Sicily raid ITALIAN security forces yesterday announced the arrest of Mr Nitto Santapaola, the most wanted member of the Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. Mr Santapaola, who has been sought by authorities for more than 10 years, was surprised at a farm about 80km from his Catania base during a night raid by 400 police. His capture follows the arrest in January of Mr 'Toto' Riina, his main ally in the ruling commission of the Cosa Nostra. Although Interior Ministry officials said yesterday there were 25 people still on the government's most-wanted list, these two arrests represent a significant blow to the Mafia's organisation. Mr Santapaola's capture came five days after a car bomb exploded in the wealthy Parioli residential district of Rome, injuring 23 people. Police are working on the theory that the bombing was the work, at least in part, of the Mafia. Mr Nicola Mancino, interior minister, told parliament yesterday that it was a reasonable assumption the bomb was aimed at Mr Maurico Constanzo, a television talk-show host. Mr Constanzo's car passed three seconds before the explosion, but he was protected from the blast by a wall. However, some parliamentary deputies questioned whether the bomb was not part of a destabilisation campaign conducted by dissident elements within the security services. Mr Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said yesterday: 'The arrest of Santapaola is not a reply to the bombing in Parioli. . . rather it is another piece in the strategy of continuous assault on the structure of Cosa Nostra, which the state has been carrying out firmly over the past year.' Police claimed they had been closing in on Mr Santapaola for some time. Already 105 arrest warrants had been issued against members of his clan and a further 39 against its allies. The raid was carried out by a special group flown in from the mainland. Mr Santapaola offered no resistance, and merely asked to have a brief breakfast with his wife before being escorted to a maximum security jail. The farm where Mr Santapaola was arrested belonged to Mr Pietro Rampullo, arrested last September and alleged to be behind the killings of two anti-Mafia judges - Mr Giovani Falcone, who died on May 23 last year, and Mr Paolo Borsellino, who died two months later. Mr Santapaola is suspected of involvement in the killings. Police claim the arrest resulted from investigative work, rather than the testimony of former Mafia members who had agreed to co-operate under witness protection programmes. However, there are suggestions that Mr Riina's and Mr Santapaola's violent methods in running the Cosa Nostra had lost them support within the organisation, and that some families were happy to see them captured. In both instances they were caught in or near their home bases.</p>

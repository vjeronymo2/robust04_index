			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAN HELD AFTER STANDOFF  </P> <P> Special weapons and tactics deputies arrested an armed, distraught man early  this morning after he had holed up in a Santa Ana-area garage Tuesday for an  all-night standoff, according to a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> Paul Jones Morgan, 47, was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon  after he allegedly fired several shots at his wife, then retreated to his  home's garage, where he refused to come out and repeatedly threatened to kill  himself, said Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rivas.  </P> <P> About 9 p.m. Tuesday, deputies went to the home in the 12000 block of Dunas  Road after receiving a report of shots being fired, Rivas said. After Morgan's  wife and teen-age son escaped through a window, deputies called for Morgan to  leave the detached garage.  </P> <P> Crisis negotiators talked with Morgan through the night as the man waved a  9-millimeter pistol and threatened suicide. About 7:10 a.m. today, SWAT  deputies hurled flash-bang grenades into the garage to distract Morgan, then  tackled him. Rivas said the man was reportedly distraught over marriage  difficulties.  </P></p>

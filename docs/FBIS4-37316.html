			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin  Ramadan has received a Yemeni parliamentary delegation led by  Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, a member of the Yemeni House of  Representatives. During the meeting, Taha Yasin Ramadan  reiterated Iraq's unchanging stand on the recent events in  Yemen. He said Iraq supports Yemeni unity and legitimacy. He  said the enemies are working to partition united countries into  several parts to facilitate the achievement of their colonialist  ambitions, to control them, and to interfere in their internal  affairs.    He said the unity of Yemeni territory and people is a source  of strength for the Arab nation, and that the support extended  to the separatists by some Arab rulers provides another piece of  evidence that those agents' are conspiring against the Arab  nation in a bid to dismember it, on orders from colonialist  powers.    The Yemeni parliamentary delegation leader expressed high  appreciation and great pride in the heroic stand of President  Saddam Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He said the Iraqi  people have become an example and a model for steadfastness and  sacrifices, through which they have scored great victories and  thwarted conspiracies and aggressions. He indicated that the  Yemeni people will fight in defense of the one homeland and the  one people, and that they will thwart this chapter of conspiracy  against Yemen and the Arab nation.    Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan also received Pascal  Jacquino [name as transliterated], head of the diplomatic and  strategic institute in France and head of the higher school for  the press, and his delegation. The vice president stressed that  many states are suffering economic and security problems as a  result of the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the continued  blockade imposed on its people. He indicated that continued  U.S. hegemony and efforts to implement U.S. ambitions and  colonialist policies will jeopardize world peace and security.  He said America's allies have lost their independent  decisionmaking ability and their sovereignty.    He indicated that the disagreement of most UN Security  Council member states with the U.S. Administration is considered  a defeat for America and a victory for Iraq, because Iraq has  managed to thwart all America's conspiratorial, aggressive, and  misleading tactics on the military, economic, political, and  propagandist fronts.    Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that Iraq will remain as it has  always been throughout history -- with a united land and people,  Arabs and Kurds, rallying around their leader and symbol, Saddam  Husayn and his wise and brave leadership, which has made the  Iraqi people a model for emulation by countries that adhere to  their principles, defend their objectives, and reject  humiliation and subservience.    Pascal Jacquino expressed confidence in Iraq's prosperous  future in view of its rich human and material potential and the  progress that it has achieved in the march of reconstruction.  He stressed the importance of promoting Iraqi-French relations  in the service of the two countries' common interests.</p>

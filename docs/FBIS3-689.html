			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It seems as if the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] is now presenting new demands at  the peace talks in Lusaka, which the government views as  improper. Our correspondent Joao Ligio has further details.    According to observers here in Lusaka, the course of the  peace talks has reached such a stage that only a greater  international intervention can give it a favorable image. The  two parties view any concessions at this period as capitulation.    On the remaining points on national reconciliation, a few  days ago UNITA received the government proposal on its peaceful  integration in the nation's political life. UNITA has not yet  given its final reply.    On the news media, UNITA does not say yes or no to the  integration of its radio, the Voice of Resistance of the Black  Cockerel, according to the existing legislation. It says  however that it intends to maintain its editorial line.    On the return of property, it says that it is waiting for  new  guidelines from its leadership, because it does not agree with  the way it would be processed.    On the reimposition of the state administration, UNITA wants  eight provinces and 50 districts in central and southern Angola,  with the exception of Lunda Norte and Uige, to fall under its  administration. The government does not want to be diverted  from the legal framework.    Before concluding discussions on national reconciliation,  the  parties are also expected to discuss UNITA's role in national  and local administration and Jonas Savimbi's status.</p>

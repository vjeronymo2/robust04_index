			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS -- A RISKY LEAP;  </P> <P> POVERTY: SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S SHIFT AWAY FROM FOOD STAMPS MAY WORSEN THE PROBLEM  OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER.  </P> <P> Hunger hurts everyone. We all have a stake in preventing infants from being  born underweight, in improving the performance of school children, in improving  the work performance of adults and in preventing debilitating and expensive  nutrition-related health problems among the elderly.  </P> <P> No one goes hungry by choice.  </P> <P> Hunger is the result of poverty; and in America today, 32 million people are  poor.  </P> <P> According to a recent, scientifically valid survey of poor households in the  United States, 3 million to 5 million children are hungry. This same survey  found that hungry children suffer significantly more health problems than  children who have enough to eat. These illnesses cause children to miss more  days of school. And hungry children cannot learn.  </P> <P> Many larger issues relating to poverty must be addressed, including adequate  education, jobs and wages, affordable housing and health care. But hungry  children cannot wait for long-term solutions.  </P> <P> Any proposal that could help alleviate hunger deserves careful consideration.  But converting food stamps to cash, as San Diego County began to do this fall,  is unlikely to lessen the blight of childhood hunger. In fact, it may well make  this problem worse.  </P> <P> The federal food stamp program was begun in the early 1960s as a way of helping  poor families achieve a nutritious diet. Even before severe cuts in the early  1980s, it was never funded at a level sufficient to assure adequate diets for  low-income people.  </P> <P> Food stamp benefits are not based on poor households' food costs in the real  world. Instead, benefits are based on the "thrifty food plan," a hypothetical  projection of the least amount that low-income households could spend to obtain  a minimally adequate diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that  only about 1 in 10 low-income households spending this amount would obtain a  nutritionally adequate diet.  </P> <P> Little wonder, then, that soup kitchens and food pantries report substantial  increases in requests for emergency assistance at the end of the month, when  food stamp allotments have run out.  </P> <P> It is against this backdrop that San Diego began its "cash-out" project.  Households that previously received booklets of food stamps each month now  receive checks in the same amount.  </P> <P> Proponents assert that recipients will have greater freedom as to how to spend  this money. The county also expects to reap administrative savings, because  checks are less expensive to write and distribute. In fact, this freedom is  likely to be illusory, the savings relatively insignificant and many other  costs hidden.  </P> <P> USDA studies show that a household's nutritional level increases far more  rapidly with each additional dollar it receives in food stamps than it does  when that same dollar is provided in cash. Studies of previous cash-out  projects do not show dramatic improvements in the program's performance.  </P> <P> The Alabama welfare department recently asked food stamp households whether  they would prefer the freedom of receiving assistance in cash rather than food  stamps. Much to the department's surprise, the majority of the recipients it  surveyed preferred stamps.  </P> <P> One of the dangers of the cash approach is that it gives landlords and  creditors the opportunity to charge more.  </P> <P> In many communities, rents for the lowest-quality housing hover a few dollars  below the maximum public assistance grants; when grant levels increase, many  landlords raise their rents by a corresponding amount.  </P> <P> Landlords cannot collect food stamps as rent, but converting stamps to cash  allows landlords to raise rents.  </P> <P> Other creditors may react similarly. With energy costs skyrocketing and the  Low-Income Home-Energy Assistance Program having been cut 47% over the last  nine years, many poor households are forced to negotiate limited service  arrangements with utility companies for which payments may be based on  percentages of their incomes.  </P> <P> Many of these creditors will want their share of any "new" cash that comes into  a poor household, even if that cash is just the equivalent of the household's  food stamp allotment.  </P> <P> The danger that cashing out food stamps poses to low-income children is  exacerbated by the inadequacy of other food assistance programs. A lack of  funds still prevents the highly acclaimed Special Supplement Food Program for  Women, Infants and Children (WIC) from serving more than about half of those  eligible.  </P> <P> In California, which already has lower-than-average WIC funding, thousands of  children were thrown off of WIC this summer because unexpected food price  increases threatened to exhaust program funds. For these children and those  unable to get onto WIC, food stamps are the main line of defense against  hunger.  </P> <P> Although it is much too early to form a firm judgment on the San Diego  experience, local food pantry operators are already reporting a sharp increase  in requests, which appears to go beyond what could be expected from a  slackening economy.  </P> <P> Significantly, poor households are coming much earlier in the month, having  exhausted their food budgets sooner than they had previously.  </P> <P> This increased demand for emergency food comes at a time when surplus  commodities for the poor have been drastically reduced. The result is that many  families in dire need may be turned away from these food pantries. San Diego  County hopes to save $600,000 in administrative costs this year.  </P> <P> But the costs of hunger are quite great: even a slight increase in  hunger-related illness is likely to increase Medi-Cal costs by more than the  cash-out's administrative savings.  </P> <P> And, although it may be harder to measure the human costs of these illnesses  and the long-term losses in productivity resulting from hungry children's  failure to learn in school, these costs are no less real.  </P> <P> In a world where low-income people's resources more closely approximated the  cost of living, providing food assistance as cash would have great merit for  reducing the stigma of the program.  </P> <P> But under existing conditions, a cash-out of food stamp benefits threatens to  further undermine the tenuous nutritional safety net on which many more  households and their children already depend.  </P></p>

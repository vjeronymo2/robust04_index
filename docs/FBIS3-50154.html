Martin Dorazin reports from his news conference:    [Dorazin] At a news conference shortly after arriving at the  old Ruzyne airport, Minister Baudys summed up the contents of  his visit to Lithuania. During his talks with the Lithuanian  president, the parliament speaker, and the minister of defense,  Baudys focused on briefing them on the Partnership for Peace  project. He also briefed the Lithuanian representatives on our  attitude toward European security. Let us recall that a desire  to cooperate with NATO was voiced by representatives of the  Baltic countries in the so-called letter from three presidents  to NATO.    The Czech minister of defense then got acquainted with the  situation in the Lithuanian Army, which is undergoing the  process of building and has problems similar to those of the  Czech Army.    Minister Baudys confirmed that the Czech Republic will grant  Czech surplus equipment to the Lithuanian Army as a gift.    Antonin Baudys expressed mild surprise at the atmosphere  full  of trust that accompanied his visit to Lithuania and said that,  while we have survived socialism, Lithuania survived the USSR.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO Q &amp; A: WHAT DOCUMENTS DO NEW MANAGERS GET?  </P> <P> QUESTION: Our homeowners association is just going into its second year. We  have been frustrated with our management company's lack of follow-up. This is  the company that we inherited from our developer, and they have given us  excuses instead of leadership in dealing with the developer. Our new board will  probably vote to change management companies next month.  </P> <P> What documents and records can we expect to have transferred to the new  management company? Do the association's records and files belong to the  management company or to the association?  </P> <P> ANSWER: All of the association's documents, records and files, including  contracts, financial statements and correspondence, belong to the association.  Personnel records should be turned over to the association if employees work  directly for the association rather than the management company.  </P> <P> You will probably find that the current management company will request that  someone from the association board of directors be present for the transfer of  records. Most management companies will have a release form that lists the  documents that are being transferred. Reputable management companies will be  very efficient and cooperative during the transition process.  </P> <P> Although you didn't ask for my advice about changing management companies, I  would suggest that you have a face-to-face meeting with the owner of the  current management company to discuss your concerns.  </P> <P> During the development phase, the management company is often perceived as  being on the side of the developer. However, the developer who serves on the  initial board of directors and the manager must act in the best interests of  the association, even if the management company is a division of the  developer's company.  </P> <P> Terminating the current management company should be your last resort.  Transition to a new company is not always smooth, and there are bound to be  some problems while the new company is becoming familiar with the association's  procedures and its members, contractors and vendors.  </P> <P> If you do change management companies, an audit should be performed by an  independent certified public accountant. Ask for the accountant's advice  regarding the mangement transition. I recommend closing any bank accounts that  have the current management company's personnel as signatories, leaving just  enough funds to cover any outstanding checks that haven't cleared the bank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Auditor's Financial Statement Always Late  </P> <P> Q: I know that California law requires that homeowner associations distribute a  copy of the annual financial statement within 120 days after the close of the  fiscal year. Our association's board of directors has not complied with this  for the last two years. They blame the delay on the auditor, and distribution  has been from one to three weeks late. The board's attitude is, "It's no big  deal." How important is it that this deadline be respected?  </P> <P> A: The law that you refer to affects associations that have an annual gross  income exceeding $75,000. There is no penalty, though an owner could file a  civil action against a board that does not comply with the law. In my opinion,  being one to three weeks late does not show a flagrant disregard for the law.  </P> <P> I would tend to be more critical of the auditor who accepted the job and then  could not complete it within the legal time limit. Boards should make this  deadline a part of the terms of the contract with the auditor. Since this seems  to be a major concern to you, why not volunteer to serve on the audit committee  next year and see to it that this report is distributed on time?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buyer Should Examine All Legal Documents  </P> <P> Q: We are thinking about selling our house and purchasing a condominium. We  would like to see the legal documents and rules and regulations before we buy,  but our real estate agent says that we will receive them at the close of  escrow. Is there any way that we can review these documents prior to  purchasing?  </P> <P> A: Yes, you should not be shy about demanding to see the declaration of  covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs), the bylaws, rules and  regulations, board meeting minutes, financial statements, annual budget and  reserve study. Your real estate agent's response was definitely incorrect. The  escrow closing is not the proper time to receive this important information.  </P> <P> If you sign a purchase agreement prior to receiving the documents that you  request, the contract should include a clause that gives you 10 days after  receiving the documents to review the information. You have the right to cancel  the contract if the legal documents and related information do not meet with  your approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Complex Means Many Board Duties  </P> <P> Q: I am considering buying a condominium and have wondered about the merits of  a small association of three to six units versus a large association. I would  like to have your opinion.  </P> <P> A: If you decide to purchase in a small association be prepared to volunteer  your time as a working board member. What do I mean by a working board member?  In a large association, serving on the board may involve merely coming to a  board meeting once a month to vote on policies and procedures while a  management company is responsible for the financial operation, maintenance and  day-to-day affairs of the association.  </P> <P> In a small, self-managed association, each owner should be willing to  participate in the work of the association, including the accounting,  maintenance, record-keeping, insurance and other operations. Read the legal  documents that state the powers and duties of the board and make sure that you  are willing to participate in some way.  </P> <P> In many very small associations, one overworked individual often does all the  work, from replacing light bulbs to overseeing contractors, and continues to do  it simply because none of the other owners will volunteer.  </P> <P> Serving as a board member in any size association is a big responsibility  because of the financial decisions, insurance obligations, rule enforcement and  record-keeping that are required. In a large association, there is a likelihood  fo having more volunteers who are willing to serve, whereas in a small one, it  is very difficult to find volunteers, and they quickly tire of the job because  of the greater burden of hands-on participation without professional  management.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Board Should Hire Lawyer to Update Rules  </P> <P> Q: Our association's documents need to be updated. We do not want to pay  attorney's fees. Where can we purchase a model set of CC&amp;Rs that correlates  with current laws? Would we be able to obtain another association's documents  that we could adapt for our association?  </P> <P> A: I am not aware of any "boiler-plate" documents that you could copy, and I  certainly would not recommend that approach. The amendment process is one that  requires the expertise and guidance of an attorney who is knowledgeable about  all the recent changes in community association law. For example, there have  been recent changes in federal law which make restrictions against children  illegal.  </P> <P> Associations that wish to amend their documents should first determine that it  will be possible to get the approval fo the required percentage of owners.  After the board has determined the changes that are necessary, then consult  with your attorney who will prepare the wording of the proposed changes and  assist with the notification of members for the vote. If the amendment is  approved, it must be recorded with the county.  </P> <P> I do not understand why association boards are unwilling to consult with  attorneys when the need arises. Board members are not expected to know all the  answers. They should be willing to pay for expert help which will often prevent  costly problems arising at a later date. By relying on professionals, the board  is reducing their liability.  </P> <P> If you are concerned about the cost, discuss this during the initial  consultation and see if the attorney will do the work for a flat fee or at  least give you a "not-to-exceed" estimate of the total cost. Request a monthly  billing statement so that you can keep track of the cost as the work  progresses.  </P> <P> Hickenbottom is past president of the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the  Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit research and  educational organization.

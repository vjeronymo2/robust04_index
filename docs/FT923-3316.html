			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Losses and capital gains DURING the tax years 1989-90 and 1990-91, I incurred losses, for capital gains purposes, of Pounds 6,3000 and Pounds 62 respectively, on sales of equities. In the following year, 1991-92, I made a capital gain; but within my normal entitlement for that year. The same will probably be the case in 1992-93. Can I carry forward my losses for 1989-90 and 1990-91 to offset any excess gains in future years? Yes, by virtue of section 5(4)(a) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979: 'where the amount of chargeable gains less allowable losses accruing to an individual in any year of assessment does not exceed the exempt amount for the year, no deduction from that amount shall be made for that year in respect of allowable losses carried forward from a previous year'. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

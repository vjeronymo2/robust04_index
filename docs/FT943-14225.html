			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Slough Estates in Pounds 55m land deal with L&amp;G Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, is to pay Pounds 55m for Legal and General's 32 acre portion of the Winnersh Triangle business estate near Reading, Berkshire, in its largest property purchase in more than five years. The acquisition will give Slough control of a 75 acre business park, with a total of 1m sq ft of built office and warehouse space. The L&amp;G site was developed in the early 1980s and has 556,000 sq ft of space, with a current rent roll of Pounds 4.37m from tenants including Mars, Hewlett Packard and ICL. The purchase price puts the property on a yield of 7.96 per cent, and Mr Derek Wilson, group managing director, said the property was let on long leases and was 'not significantly over-rented'. Mr Wilson said there would be management benefits from taking on the entire site. L&amp;G is being paid Pounds 12.5m in cash, with the remainder being paid through the issue of 5.36m new Slough shares. Slough has concentrated primarily on developing sites in its existing portfolio, rather than buying new properties, and it currently has 120,000 sq ft of new property under construction. Within the Winnersh site, there is a further 12.5 acres where more development is planned.</p>

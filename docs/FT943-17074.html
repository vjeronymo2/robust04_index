			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Brazil's answer to inflation: get Real: A look at the biggest currency switch 'in the history of the planet' From midnight last night, all bank accounts in Brazil were switched electronically from cruzeiro real to the Real (RDollars ), the new currency which the country's monetary masters hope will wipe out an inflation rate of 50 per cent a month. 'There has never been such a replacement of money in the history of the planet,' said Mr Alcir Augustinho Caliari, president of Bank of Brazil. Preparations for the changeover have been under way for several weeks. Armoured cars, escorted by the army, have been delivering new currency to bank branches around the country and the central bank has started incinerating cruzeiro real notes - and is likely to do so for months. The old currency will continue to be legal tender for two weeks, at a set exchange rate of RDollars 1=CrDollars 2,750, while the Dollars 3bn or so of outstanding notes and coins are swapped into Reals. It is not the first time Brazil has changed its currency. The four previous occasions since 1986 involved simple changes of the unit's name or the slicing off of zeros. This time a completely new currency regime is being introduced. The Real has been set at parity with the US dollar. A special interim accounting unit introduced in February, called the Unidade Real de Valor (Urv), also equal to the dollar, has helped prepare most wages and prices for the switch. Salaries which were quoted in cruzeiro reals were switched to Urvs from April and, from today, will be switched from Urvs to Reals at a rate of 1:1. Contracts covering everything from housing rents to school fees, which previously had to be corrected regularly to keep pace with inflation, are being transferred into Reals based on average prices over the last four months. Shopkeepers were encouraged to use the Urv in preparation for the Real. But most shop prices will be switched into the new currency from today. Supermarkets were closed yesterday while price labels were changed. Despite a TV and pamphlet campaign and a telephone information service, the government is worried many people still do not understand the mechanics of the changeover. The parity link with the US dollar will be maintained for an 'indeterminate' time - probably until after presidential elections in October - through intervention in foreign exchange markets with the help of the country's near Dollars 40bn in reserves. The supply of the new currency will also be limited, to RDollars 9.5bn between now and April, a slightly higher limit than expected. But the central bank will have a 20 per cent cushion in the case of emergencies. There is concern that the targets could be shifted. Dollar parity and issuance limits are likely to reduce inflation at least for a few months, according to economists. And with the interest rate futures market for July indicating a nominal rate of about 7 per cent, some say inflation will fall to 2-3 per cent a month by August. This price stabilisation could lead to a Dollars 20bn 'windfall' for consumers as their salaries' purchasing power remains stable. This has led to fears of a consumer boom and widespread shortages. As a result, real interest rates are likely to remain high for some months. President Itamar Franco is keen that interest rates fall quickly. However, Mr Pedro Malan, president of the central bank, said that if interest rates fell too quickly, money invested in government debt would flee to other assets, such as land and cars, leading to an 'explosion of consumption'. President Franco is thought to have vetoed original plans to boost the autonomy of the central bank and strengthen its role in the National Monetary Council, Brazil's chief financial authority, because of this dispute over interest rates. State and federal banks, which rely on profits from inflation to pay for overstaffing and often politically inspired loan policies, may face difficulties if inflation stays low. In an election year, the government is unlikely to close loss-making banks. Instead, the central bank may be told to provide short-term support, again placing in question the credibility of money supply targets. Economists say the plan faces even more serious challenges in the medium term. Congress failed this year to revise the constitution, which places unreasonable spending demands on the government. 'We have a combination of conditions to lead to stability in the next few months. To consolidate that over the long term is up to (the future) government,' said finance minister Mr Rubens Ricupero.</p>

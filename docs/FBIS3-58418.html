Especial envoy of the Majles presiding board and head of  Iran- Germany parliamentary friendship group Mohammad Javad  Larijani told IRNA here that the Iranian parliamentary  delegation visits Germany at the invitation of German parliament.    He said his visit aimed at clarifying Iran's stands on  important regional issues, removing obstacles on mutual ties and  identifying new grounds for future cooperation in the region.    Larijani added that the Iranian delegation and German  authorities exchanged views on such topics as Central Asia,  Iran-Germany cooperation in the region, Middle East issues and  Israel-PLO deal.    The Iranian official further noted that the apostate Salman  Rushdie's blasphemous book had harmed peace, security and  understanding among followers of different religions because of  insulting millions of Muslims.

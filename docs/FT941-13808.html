			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Power industry decision delayed Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry's regulator, needs extra time to decide whether to refer the power generation industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He originally hoped to reach a decision in the middle of this month, and last week electricity stocks gained sharply in anticipation of a deal. But an announcement now seems unlikely before next month. Last week Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asked Prof Littlechild to brief him on progress. The absence of a decision is one of the factors holding up the government's planned review of the nuclear power industry. The terms of reference for that, which were due in December, also face a delay until next month. The hold-up is due to the difficulty in hammering out an agreement with National Power and PowerGen, the two largest generators, over prices and commitments to offer for sale generating plant that is not needed. In December Prof Littlechild said he would have to settle these issues if a reference were to be avoided. Prof Littlechild also said in December that he wanted to discuss plans for reforming the electricity pool - the wholesale electricity market whose complex arrangements have been blamed in part for rising electricity prices. But apart from an exchange of letters last month, nothing has happened. The threat of a monopoly reference is one of the biggest uncertainties currently facing the electricity industry. However, analysts are increasingly confident that a deal can be reached, particularly now that large energy users have said they do not think a monopolies investigation would be useful.

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / US cool to Iraqi-Russian overture on Kuwaiti border Iraq last night announced its 'willingness' to recognise the sovereignty of Kuwait and its UN-demarcated border, but the US responded coolly, foreseeing no early easing of sanctions against the Baghdad regime. The move came in a joint Iraqi-Russian statement after talks between President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, who arrived in Baghdad yesterday. The statement amounts to Iraq's most explicit step towards formal recognition of Kuwait and its borders - a condition the UN Security Council demands before lifting any sanctions such as the ban on Iraqi oil exports. But it fell short of unequivocal recognition, declaring: 'Iraq confirmed its willingness to solve the issue of recognising Kuwait and its borders as demanded by Security Council resolution 833 in a positive manner.' The statement appeared to peg recognition to UN Security Council agreement to start a six-month test period of Iraq's weapons monitoring programme. Its ambiguous phrasing suggested Iraq was insisting the UN fix a definite timetable for the testing, leading naturally to lifting of sanctions. It stated: 'Following Iraq's formal recognition of Kuwait's sovreignty and borders, Russia will support the specifying of the start of the formal operation of the long-term monitoring system in accordance with Security Council resolution 715.' It said that the monitoring period 'should not exceed six months', and that 'from the Russian point of view' the Security Council should then lift sanctions if Iraq had complied during that period. Although Russia, France and China favoured giving Iraq such a clear timetable before last week's Iraqi troop movements, Britain and the US have opposed such a move. In Washington, a US official said last night an Iraqi agreement to recognise Kuwait would not lead to an early lifting of UN sanctions. Recognising Kuwait was 'only one element in the list of things Iraq has to do', the official said, adding: 'We would not see any possibility of easing sanctions at this point.' Nevertheless, Iraq will hope that the Russian initiative, which followed talks earlier this week between Mr Saddam and two senior Russian envoys, will re-open debate in the Security Council over linking the lifting of sanctions to the start of the weapons monitoring programme - debate which was effectively closed by Iraq's latest troop movements near the Kuwait border. Meanwhile, two Iraqi Republican Guard brigades were reported last night to have halted their withdrawal from the Kuwaiti border area. They were reported to have dug in around the southern city of Nasiriyah, 100km north-west of Basra and well within easy striking distance of the Kuwait border. A US official said the Iraqi units might believe they had moved far enough to satisfy US and allied demands. But the Pentagon said the Iraqis were still close enough to strike quickly into Kuwait. Earlier, Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US troop build-up in the Gulf would reach only 30,000 and troops could start going home within weeks after Iraq withdraws forces from the Kuwait border. A more powerful force of US warplanes would remain for the foreseeable future. US and French officials clashed yesterday over US proposals for a military exclusion zone in southern Iraq. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, called Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, 'ill-informed and counter productive' for saying the build-up of US troops in Kuwait was 'not unconnected' to US domestic politics. She said Mr Leotard's remarks 'give comfort to a brutal dictator' and suggested France's position was motivated by its commercial links with Iraq. The row spoilt efforts by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to paper over differences among western allies on establishing an exclusion zone in southern Iraq. The US has stepped back from earlier suggestions for barring tanks and heavy military equipment from a vast demilitarised zone stretching up to the 32nd parallel - the boundary of the existing no-fly zone. But US officials insist some way must be found to avoid having to make costly troop deployment any time Mr Saddam wants to play cat-and-mouse games. Mr Hurd, speaking at a press conference in Bahrain before flying to Saudi Arabia, said an exclusion zone was an option which came under the category of 'some way' to be found to stop a recurrence of the Iraqi troop build-up. Another option, a pre-emptive airstrike, appears to have receded. One problem with a ground exclusion zone, which mirrors the air exclusion zone, is that it could be seen as a step towards dismemberment of Iraq. Although no western country wants Mr Saddam to remain in power, they remain committed to the territorial integrity of Iraq, if only as a buffer against Iran.</p>

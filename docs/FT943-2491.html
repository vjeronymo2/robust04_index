			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Switzerland The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the D-Mark this month reflects uncertainty over the outcome of the forthcoming federal elections in Germany, coupled with the apprehension that monetary policy in the two countries is set to diverge as Swiss short-term interest rates rise. The strength of the Swiss franc - against the US dollar as well as the D-mark and other European currencies - may delay the implementation of rate increases, but there is no doubting Switzerland's enhanced attractions as the safest of Europe's safe havens. Whether this means that Switzerland's financial markets are due for a prolonged bout of outperformance vis a vis their German counterparts, is another matter. Arguably the Swiss franc is overvalued on a purchasing power parity basis, limiting the scope for a further widening of the differential between yields on Swiss and German bonds. As for equities, Switzerland has underperformed European markets by 10 per cent since the course of US monetary policy changed in early February, and is likely to continue to do. This is partly due to the currency effect, which depresses earnings at Switzerland's multinational corporations, as evident from the muted first half earnings growth reported by Nestle last week. The Swiss market, which outperformed Germany earlier in the economic cycle, now gives investors less geared exposure to recovery than Germany, where analysts expect that, thanks to restructuring, corporate earnings will rise by 80 per cent this year and 40 per cent next.</p>

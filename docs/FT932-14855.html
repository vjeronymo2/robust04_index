			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Observer: Flagging enthusiasm Reconciliation is in the air in the Anglo-French fishing dispute. French fishermen have sent the Royal Navy a flag to replace the one they burned. Observer can exclusively reveal that Admiral Sir Benjamin Bathurst, the First Sea Lord, has been sent a new Union Jack by Jean Le Boucher, president of the Basse-Normandie regional fisheries committee. The original from the patrol craft HMS Blazer, mistakenly reported at the time to be a White Ensign, was set alight during a protest in Cherbourg marina on March 28. The new one will be given to Blazer's commander, who is expected to frame it for display rather than assign it to the flag locker. However, sensitivities are still raw enough for the Navy to have decided against publicising the French gesture. Gotcha]-style headlines might just set tempers ablaze again.</p>

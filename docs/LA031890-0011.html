			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: OLD WELL BY ZHENG YI TRANSLATED BY DAVID KWAN (CHINA BOOKS:  $8.95)  </P> <P> Zheng Yi's uncompromising novel is a fascinating portrait of rural life in  contemporary China, where ancient traditions -- including the worship of  ancestral gods -- coexist with modern technology and bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Although he is educated and industrious, Sun Wangquan leads a bleak existence,  scarcely different from that of his peasant ancestors, who dug wells for their  tiny village in the arid Taihang mountains in Shanxi province.  </P> <P> The search for a reliable source of water becomes a search for meaning as  Wangquan finds himself torn between the traditional values represented by his  loveless arranged marriage and his passion for a restless, free-spirited modern  girl.  </P> <P> Despite the international reputation of his novels and his screenplay for the  film of "Old Well," Zheng Yi was arrested in July, 1989, and reportedly remains  in custody.  </P></p>

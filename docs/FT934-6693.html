			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Fiat to reduce workforce by 5% Fiat, Italy's largest private group, is planning to cut 5 per cent of its workforce in the Italian automotive sector and lay off a further 10 per cent during the next two years. The news was broken to engineering trades unions last night by Mr Maurizio Magnabosco, head of Fiat's industrial operations. Earlier in the day the unions had leaked the outlines of Fiat's proposals, which are aimed at the crisis in the European car market. Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, also had a meeting with Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, in which he is believed to have outlined the Turin-based auto group's plans to tackle over-capacity and cope with job losses. Discussions are due to take place today with the Labour Ministry on how the measures are to be implemented and how they can be accommodated into the scheme of government-backed lay-offs. Fiat is the last of the main European car manufacturers to seek cuts in its workforce, and this is the first serious cut since 1982-83. But this year's Italian production, yet to reflect the impact of the Punto launched this autumn, will be little more than 1.1m. This compares with capacity of nearly 2m vehicles. Largely because of the 15 per cent decline in European sales and the 22 per cent drop in local sales, the Fiat group this year expects losses of L2,200bn (Pounds 888m). Fiat Auto, the car division, employs 95,000 in Italy and a further 40,000 overseas. Mr Magnabosco said 3,800 jobs were to be cut among administrative staff. Of these 800 would be at the group's Turin headquarters. The aim would be to find other jobs within the group. However, the unions were doubtful this would be possible. Labour cuts on the factory floor will affect some 1,000 near Naples, of whom 800 will be reabsorbed elsewhere. However, the greatest uncertainty surrounds the Arese plant near Milan, built in 1960, where production of the Alfa 164 is due to end in 1996. Fiat said body-work at Arese would be shifted to another northern plant, Rivalta, and this would involve 2,000 lay-offs for two years. But Mr Magnabosco said job opportunities would be created with the reconversion of part of Arese as an industrial park - as happened last year with the old Lancia works at Chiavasso. Overall the bulk of the lay-offs, some 5,000, will come from the older plants in Fiat's home base Turin.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "On the Team of Institutes, </F> the DIW in Berlin Plays Left Wing--The German Institute for  Economic Research"]    [Text] Berlin--The minister for economics calls it "that  socialist institute in Berlin." The president of the Bundesbank  is annoyed by that "bunch of political activists." The German  Institute for Economic Research, the DIW, is viewed as being on  the far Left among the empirical economic research institutes.  Just the same, DIW President Lutz Hoffmann cannot complain about  a lack of research jobs.    The reason for Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's friendly  slap at the DIW was that the institute registered a dissenting  opinion in the fall report by the six economic research  institutes. The other five prophesied a GDP growth rate of 1  percent in western Germany for 1994 whereas the Berlin institute  is still holding to its forecast of a 0.5 percent decline to  this day. The reason the institute gave for its conclusions was  that the interest structure is skewed in that short-term  interest rates exceed long-term interest rates and that interest  rates generally are still too high.    Hoffmann, 59, says that the disagreement is not political  but  "about basics." Uncertainty about when the upturn will occur is  a "very delicate situation" for all economic researchers. Under  similar circumstances in 1992 the Institute for World Economics  (IfW) dissented from the majority in the spring and the  Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI)  dissented in the fall.    The DIW, Hoffmann says, is the only institute which compiles  overall economic data on a quarterly basis. On this basis, "we  believe we have a slightly greater sensitivity" for the  mechanics of the economy.    From a political point of view the institute continues to  pay  tribute to the Keynesian, demand-oriented approach but the  spectrum of opinions "has broadened," the advantage being that  there are frequent "vehement discussions."    In spite of its sometimes unpleasant findings, e.g. the  early  warning of large-scale unemployment in eastern Germany, the  institute's clients limit their critique to snide remarks. "We  are not discriminated against when it comes to requests for  expert opinions," Hoffmann says.    The DIW also is skeptical with regard to the debate over  Germany's viability as an industrial base. The institute's  economic divison reached the conclusion that there is "no sign  of a structural or cost crisis" in western Germany and that  findings for western and eastern Germany are being mixed  together "in inadmissible fashion" in public debate. Hoffmann  would like to get away from the "hackneyed wage cost debate" by  designing an indicator for technological competitiveness. By  this fall this approach is to answer the question of whether the  United States and Japan "have or have not outdistanced" Germany  as an industrial power.    In 1925, Ernst Wagemann, the president of the Reich  Statistical Office, founded the "Institute for Economic  Research." The institute received its present name in 1941. At  the end of 1993 it had a staff of 215, including 100 social  scientists, 61 of whom hold a doctorate.    Lutz Hoffmann has headed the institute since 1989. His  father  already worked on empirical economic research as a unversity  professor. Hoffmann himself went into industry initially but  when Herbert Giersch offered him a position as a university  lecturer in 1963 he decided that "this might be something I  could do for a while."    He stayed with it and became a professor, acting as an  advisor to the prime minister of Malaysia and the World Bank. He  also worked on developing countries, energy issues and  international economic relations. In 1988, he was offered the  presidency of two highly respected economic research institutes  at once: the DIW and the Institute for Economic Research in  Hamburg (HWWA). He chose the Berlin post, replacing Hans-Juergen  Krupp. The president's job also includes a professorship in  economics at the Free University in Berlin.    At this time, the DIW has nine divisions: public sector,  economy, structural research, Berlin-Brandenburg, world trade,  industry and technology, East Europe, transportation, energy and  raw materials.    Since 1983 the researchers have polled the same households  which make up the "socioeconomic panel" (SOEP) once a year  regarding occupation, income, expenses as well as their  satisfaction with their own economic situation. Hoffmann says  that this "longitudinal survey" which has included the new  laender as of 1990 is unique for Germany. He is also proud of  the fact that U.S. Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker uses the SOEP  data.    The Berlin institute reports on its work in its weekly  reports. A selection from these reports is published in a  monthly English-language ECONOMIC BULLETIN. In addition, the  institute publishes a quarterly and the annals of structural  research.    Over the past several years the DIW annual budget has  steadily grown to 30 million German marks (DM). Along with the  Institute for World Economic Research in Kiel, the Berlin  institute has the biggest budget of the six institutes which put  out their joint economic report. The DIW earned DM13 million  from its economic studies, thus almost equaling the Munich Ifo  Institute's third-party revenue, i.e. 42 and 43 percent  respectively.    Hoffmann has no intention of further increasing the  percentage of outside contracts. Because of the government  subsidy for the institute premises, the institutes are permitted  to add no more than a 33-percent surcharge to their personnel  costs in order to cover other costs. In other words, if research  reports made up a greater percentage of income, less money would  be available for basic research such as the National Economic  Report or the calculation of capital stock. "We are not flexible  enough" to obtain more lucrative contracts from the private  sector, Hoffmann says.    As at all other institutes, the DIW staff is paid according  to civil service rates. Even if staff members were prepared to  work 60 hours a week on a short-term basis, Hoffmann "could not  legally" pay the corresponding salaries.    Subsidies from the Federal Government and the land of Berlin  totaled DM15.97 million in 1993 and DM16.12 million in 1994. The  remaining funds come from membership fees to the DIW (which is a  registered association) and the Society of Friends of the  Institute chaired by Daimler-Benz board chairman Edazrd Reuter.    As is the case with all six of the institutes, the DIW's  principal client is the economics minister even though his share  of the research reports has gone down to between 15 and 20  percent which Hoffmann says is due to increased competition,  e.g. from Prognos AG, Basel and, increasingly, private  management consultants. Other clients include various additional  ministries both at the federal and the land level as well as the  EU. Occasionally, foundations, labor unions, and industrial  firms have also commissioned DIW studies.    Every "two or three years" some client will want to keep  research findings from being made public. The Berlin Senat, for  example, asked for a study on the financial implications of a  merger between Berlin and Brandenburg. Permission to make the  study public which is a formality as a rule was "quietly  refused," Hoffmann says. Why? "Because a merger would be a  financial disaster for Berlin."    In 1993, the DIW launched a study on potential population  and  economic trends in Germany up to the year 2000. On behalf of the  minister for economics it is regularly preparing joint reports  with the Kiel IfW on the situation in Russia and Belarus and on  progress in eastern Germany.    The Korean Development Institute of South Korea has asked  the  DIW to look into the question of what lessons divided Korea can  learn from German unification. The study has not yet been  completed but Hoffmann is already in a position to say that if  there is a chance for Korean unification, monetary union should  be the final step in the process. At the outset trade should be  liberalized and North Korea should be opened for South Korean  investment. As a "low-wage backwater," the North would then have  "enormous opportunities to catch up." The precondition for any  such development, however, would be that "the political freedom  to move in that direction would be guaranteed."    Looking to the future, Hoffmann expects demand for  long-range  scenarios on ecological issues. The DIW is working on a study  for Greenpeace, for example, which focuses on the impact an  ecological tax reform would have on the economy. Above all,  Hoffmann says, development in the new laender "will keep us busy  for another 10 or 20 years."</p>

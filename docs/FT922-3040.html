			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: Smaller companies 'uncertain' - At a glance Analysts at Hoare Govett are predicting a period of uncertainty for smaller companies over the next few months. This judgment certainly seems to be born out by the latest indices. The Hoare Govett Small Companies index (capital gains version) fell 2.03 per cent to 1272.1 over the seven days to June 11. The County Nat West index showed an almost identical trend, dropping 1.97 per cent to 1012.59 over the same period.</p>

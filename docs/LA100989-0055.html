			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VISITING DEER QUICKLY WEAR OUT WELCOME;  </P> <P> ANIMALS RAVAGE GARDENS, IMPERIL MOTORISTS IN QUEST FOR FOOD, WATER  </P> <P> Call them urban deer. Driven by increasing hillside development and persistent  drought conditions, they venture into an unlikely and often unwelcome  environment, from busy streets and residential gardens in the San Fernando  Valley to the pounding surf of Malibu.  </P> <P> Their search for food and water brings them into almost daily contact with  residents of communities that border the canyons and foothills of the Santa  Monica and Santa Susana mountains, particularly in areas where new development  is displacing existing wildlife.  </P> <P> Lost and panicked deer have been injured and killed on canyon roads. They have  been spotted along Ventura Boulevard in Encino and outside upscale restaurants  and chic boutiques, struggling to find their way back to the mountains, animal  control officers said.  </P> <P> They drink from back-yard swimming pools, feast on roses and begonias, dart  down quiet streets and stroll along lush country-club fairways.  </P> <P> "The ultimate conflict between mountain development and the wilderness," said  Rob Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn., who observed four  deer during a recent round of golf at the El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana.  </P> <P> Deer have always inhabited the area mountains. State and local officials  estimate that 9,000 live in the vast and undeveloped ranges of the San Gabriel  Mountains and anywhere from several hundred to more than 1,000 are in the Santa  Monicas and Santa Susanas.  </P> <P> The animals have been turning up near hillside residences for years. But  California Department of Fish and Game officers say more of them appear to be  venturing into urban areas as new developments invade their territory and the  drought stretches into its third year.  </P> <P> "A deer is like any other animal," said Jon Fischer, a wildlife biologist with  Fish and Game. "It will go where food is easiest to get, and if I water my back  yard and it is full of succulent flowers, a deer would be crazy to stay 400  yards away and eat dry grass. So they are overcoming their fear of people and  coming into back yards."  </P> <P> Enchanted by their beauty and grace, hillside dwellers often welcome the deer  -- initially. But the novelty wears off once the animals start eating expensive  flowers and ravaging gardens that took years to create.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Consolation  </P> <P> State and local officials offer homeowners little consolation. They can't move  the deer, they say, because that would overpopulate existing animal ranges and  lead to starvation and disease.  </P> <P> In addition, they say, deer adapt poorly to new areas. When 200 were moved from  Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay to Napa County 10 years ago, 80% wound up  dead on local roads within three weeks, most of them victims of traffic  accidents, said Larry Sitton, wildlife management program supervisor for Fish  and Game.  </P> <P> Animal control officers, who warn that deer can be dangerous if cornered,  recommend using commercial repellents or lion droppings to keep them away. But  homeowners who have tried those remedies say they offer only a temporary  reprieve.  </P> <P> "We have no ivy left," said Susan Gottsegen, who lives on Coronet Drive in  Encino. "They ate the whole hillside. It's barren. They come three and four at  a time, and they're very brazen. They come right down  </P> <P> and walk on the street. I have a German shepherd, and they're not even afraid  of her. She barks at them and they just keep grazing. They've become  domesticated.  </P> <P> "The first time my neighbors saw one, they said, 'Look, it's Bambi,' "  Gottsegen recalled. "They thought it was so beautiful -- until Bambi started  eating all their flowers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Food Sources  </P> <P> Gottsegen has lived on Coronet Drive for 26 years. She said she never had a  problem until grading began for the 178-home Caballero Canyon development at  Reseda and Ventura boulevards. She suspects that the deer have come from there,  seeking new shelter and food sources.  </P> <P> "They have nowhere else to turn," said Sonia Thompson, program manager for the  Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, who predicts the deer population in Los  Angeles will ultimately perish as their habitat is destroyed.  </P> <P> "If they have no natural vegetation in the canyons and no water sources, and  they go down to gardens where people put out poison . . . that is sort of a  death warrant right there. Then there are domestic dogs that chase them into  the road where they are hit by cars."  </P> <P> About 18 deer are killed by motorists each year in the West Valley area, said  Irene Malloy, president of the Marine and Wildlife Rescue Station in Agoura  Hills, who helped prepare a 1988 study on animal fatalities for the  conservancy.  </P> <P> But the number could be even higher. In September, 10 deer were hit and killed  by cars in the West Valley area served by the county's animal care and control  center in Agoura, said Lt. Martin Broad of the West Valley Animal Care and  Control Center.  </P> <P> Most are traveling between the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains, where  only one wildlife corridor remains, she said. The deer grow confused and  venture into oncoming traffic. One died two weeks ago on Agoura Road in an  incident that occurs so frequently Malloy has started calling the drag "death  row for deer."  </P> <P> "The desecration of deer in this canyon is pitiful," said Malloy, who lives in  Liberty Canyon. "It's tragic."  </P> <P> There also have been problems along Mulholland Drive, Coldwater Canyon Avenue  and Beverly Glen and Laurel Canyon boulevards. "Deer live in there," said  Dennis Kroeplin, a wildlife officer with the city-operated West Valley Animal  Care and Control Center. "They have trails that cross those roads, that were  there before the roads. You find deer-crossing signs to caution drivers, but  they still get killed."  </P> <P> State game warden John Hernandez said he recently helped rescue a buck that was  chased by stray dogs all the way to the ocean in Malibu. "It wouldn't come near  the shore," Hernandez said. "We had to get everyone back so it felt confident  returning to the hills."  </P> <P> Andy Nieman never had deer problems at his Encino hills home until last spring  when his dog died. Now six deer frequent his back yard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Advice  </P> <P> "They've eaten hundreds of dollars of begonias," Nieman said. "You feel sorry  for them. The poor deer, they're hungry."  </P> <P> Nieman took the advice of animal control officers, drove to the Wildlife  Waystation in Little Tujunga and picked up lion droppings that he placed around  his property. It worked -- for two weeks. Then the deer were back.  </P> <P> "This is insane," Nieman said. "I can't lick it. I'm not going to do this every  two weeks."  </P> <P> In Sherman Oaks, deer feasted all summer on 75 rosebushes that surround J.  Hardy's hillside home. "They've just stripped them," said Hardy, who peered out  her bedroom window late one night in July and found herself staring a deer in  the eye.  </P> <P> "I screamed," she said, "and it went flying."  </P> <P> Animal advocates say development is the greatest threat to deer in the Los  Angeles region. "When you stop and think of the growth in Southern California,  that's not surprising," Fischer said. "We build houses and put up fences. We've  restricted their movement. So what has been historically deer habitat is now  somebody's back yard."  </P></p>

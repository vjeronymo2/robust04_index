			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "J. Hruby: The Purification of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Slovakia Is No Longer Possible"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Social Democratic Party of Slovakia  (SDSS) is at the bottom. The coalition agreement with the Party  of the Democratic Left on the joint course of action in the  early parliamentary elections is too binding for them and  deprives them of their identity. This is what SDSS Deputy  Chairman Jozef Hruby says in the declaration he provided to TA  SR yesterday, through the Press and Information Department of  the Movement For a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].    The enormous debt, amounting to tens of millions, and the  permanently reappearing attempts by principal functionaries at  violating their own statuses have disturbed the peaceful ranks  of the SDSS so much, J. Hruby continues, that the need to  establish an authentic social democratic party is being  discussed more and more openly. In his opinion, it is difficult  to expect a reversal at the meeting of the SDSS Central Council,  which is to take place on 25 June. Those who are against the  planned merger with the Party of the Democratic Left are most  likely to ignore it and will not come. Those who are hesitating  or have fear will be silent, and, as soon as the Central Council  has a quorum, the supporters of the merger will push through  their cause.    Jaroslav Volf is likely to enter SDSS history as the SDSS's  most successful liquidator. It is a sad thing that he often  uses the name of Alexander Dubcek as a shield. In view of his  attitudes, it is immoral, Hruby said at the conclusion of the  declaration.    The SDSS Central Council Presidium rejected Hruby's  declaration as fictitious, unfounded, and subjective. It is  allegedly motivated by his personal failure to get his name on  the preliminary list of candidates for parliamentary elections  in 1994 in the order he would like to have seen.</p>

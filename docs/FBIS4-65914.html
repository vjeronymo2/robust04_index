			<p>BFN     [Text] The former Cold War enemies, NATO and Russia, are  working toward cooperation. The main topic of discussion at the  NATO summit, which opened in Evere this morning [24 May], was  what form this cooperation should take. At the beginning of the  year, NATO launched the so-called Partnership for Peace, a form  of close military cooperation excluding NATO membership. A  total of 16 former East bloc countries already have accepted the  invitation. Russia wants to accept as well, but under certain  conditions.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Katelijne Hermans at the  military  airport at Melsbroek] Belgian Defense Minister Delcroix is  waiting for his Russian counterpart. General Pavel Grachev will  explain to NATO what Russia thinks about military cooperation,  about the so-called Partnership for Peace. A total of 16 former  East bloc countries already have accepted the invitation, but  Russia is hesitating, demanding a special status of its own.  Furthermore, it bothers the Russians that the Partnership for  Peace concept originated with the Americans. So, Minister  Grachev will present to NATO a Russian document on military  cooperation. The two documents, the Russian and the Western,  will have to be discussed and signed together.    [Grachev, in Russian, with Dutch subtitles] We will sign the  document on the Partnership for Peace, but we first want to  explain our vision of military cooperation. A representative of  President Yelstin will sign the two texts in Brussels, the  Partnership for Peace and our document on cooperation between  Russia and NATO.    [Hermans] But NATO sees this slightly differently, and feels  that Russia, like every other country, must sign the normal  Partnership treaty. Apart from that, a special political  dialogue can be held.    [Delcroix] I believe that every sensible person agrees that  Russia cannot be compared to other countries. Russia has a  separate tradition, a separate position, and a separate  political and military force. We have to take this into  account. I believe that we in NATO must begin the dialogue with  Russia, also and perhaps especially outside the Partnership for  Peace framework. [end recording]</p>

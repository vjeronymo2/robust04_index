			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plea to EC on fishing curbs BRITAIN last night called on the European Commission to withdraw fish conservation proposals that would require some British trawlers to be confined to port for at least 10 consecutive days each calendar month. Sir Hector Monro, junior Scottish office minister, told the Commons that if the Commission failed to respond British ministers would 'vigorously' oppose the proposals when the EC fisheries council meets for talks in Brussels next week. While acknowledging that British fishermen felt they had had a 'very rough ride this year' through enforcement of conservation quotas, he insisted that some restrictions would continue to be necessary. Sir Hector explained that the government was trying to find a 'halfway house' which would avoid British trawlers being tied up in port on consecutive days. The government had agreed a programme for the next four years which would reduce fishing right across the UK fleet through a combination of decommissioning and licensing measures. 'In this context a 10-day tie-up targeted at a particular group of boats is unnecessary and inappropriate,' he said. Sir Hector confirmed that provisions in the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill would enable the government to control the number of days which fishing vessels spent at sea next year. Mr Gavin Strang, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the government's failure to introduce a properly managed and socially acceptable de-commissioning scheme had made a substantial contribution to the 'crisis' in the industry. A scheme was needed that provided compensation for all engaged in the industry and not just for the owners of fishing vessels. Challenged by Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, about the cost of such a scheme, Mr Strang retorted that Labour was not advocating that it should be 'on the cheap - far from it'. Mr Curry said Pounds 25m spread over three years was 'on the table' for a de-commissioning scheme, 75 per cent provided by the British taxpayer. He emphasised that a de-commissioning scheme and a system to limit fishing through 'effort control' would have to go together. The government secured a majority of 81 (294-213) to defeat a Labour attack on its conduct of fisheries policy.</p>

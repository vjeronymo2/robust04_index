			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 14 (CTK) -- The conclusion of a  coalition agreement between Slovakia's two ethnic Hungarian  parties Egyutteles [Coexistence] and the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement (MKDH), has so far been hampered by the  different positions on their alliance with other groupings.    "The agreement on close cooperation and coalition between  Egyutteles and the MKDH is ready to 95 percent. We only could  not reach consensus on whether or not the coalition should be  open for other political groupings," Egyutteles Chairman Miklos  Duray told CTK today. Egyutteles has 9 and the MKDH 5 deputies  in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament.    Duray pointed out that on Monday [13 June] his movement had  acceded to the MKDH demand that a twin-coalition be established  before launching negotiations with the non-parliamentary  Hungarian Civic Party (MOS) and the Hungarian People's Party  (MLS).    However, given electoral law provisions on electoral  thresholds, only an offer of a triple coalition or participation  of the two remaining ethnic Hungarian parties in a common list  of candidates can be considered, Duray said. "We (Egyutteles and  the MKDH) will conclude a double coalition and then jointly  discuss the conditions to be set for other partners," he added.    Duray pointed out that according to the prepared coalition  agreement, the placing of contenders for deputies' posts (on the  common lists of candidates) was to be decided by lots. "If the  lot provides for a MKDH candidate to place first, an Egyutteles  candidate would follow second," he explained.    He said that the two movements had also decided to divide up  their costs "equally". The state subsidy which the coalition  will receive for votes gained in the autumn elections will be,  Duray said, divided up "partly equally and partly according to  the number of seats acquired in parliament."    "In its program the Egyutteles movement is also open to  left-wing non-communist forces," Duray said. However, he  admitted that the ethnic Hungarian coalition found itself "to  the right from the center" in the political spectrum.</p>

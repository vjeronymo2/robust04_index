			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has  decided to build up military preparedness as there is a strong  possibility of North Korean provocation in 1994-95.    The ministry has also decided to push a future-oriented  defense policy in anticipation of a unified Korea in the 21st  century while designating "five large military reform tasks" to  respond to President Kim Yong-sam's call for reform and the  creation of a new Korea.    The decisions are outlined in the ministry's report on its  programs for 1994, submitted Thursday by Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae to President Kim Yong-sam at a conference room of the  Ministry.    Yi said that North Korea completed preparations for war in  1993 and designated 1995 as the year for unification of the  country. Therefore, if the nuclear issue runs into a dead-end in  1994-95 or the Kim Il-song regime is threatened, North Korea  could attempt a military provocation in order to find a way out.    Against tension being built up by North Korea in connection  with the nuclear issue, Yi said, South Korea is maintaining  standby measures in close coordination with the United States.    South Korea and the United States have a solid joint defense  posture against any kind of North Korean armed provocation since  the United States has worked out a new military strategy, Yi  told the president.    Moreover, the ministry, taking possible security situations  in the 21st century into consideration, is promoting equidistant  and cooperative relations with China, Japan, and Russia, Yi said.    In addition, the ministry will try to reorganize and  transform South Korea's military from a manpower-based force  into a technology-intensive and quality force by strengthening  military technological education, Yi said.    He said the ministry will continue to carry out reform while  internationalizing and globalizing national defense policy.    After receiving the report, President Kim instructed  ministry  officials to effectively manage the nation's defense resources  and train all military personnel so that they can ensure a  scientific management of the military force in the future.    "In order to do this, the ministry should develop new  personnel management and undertake a systematic training  program," Kim said.    Kim also urged the ministry to continue self-cleansing  efforts to be reborn as a new military and undertake mesures to  keep "the transparency" of defense projects and their  effectiveness.    Following the report, Kim had lunch with senior military  officers.    The president noted some concern that public opinion is  sharply critical of the military because of a number of  irregularities exposed in recent months.    The military has impressed the public deeply with the  selfless dedication and sacrifice it demonstrated in a couple of  disasters -- the Asiana jetliner crash near Mokpo, South Cholla  Province, and the sinking of the Sohae-ho ferry in the West Sea,  off Kunsan.    The entire military should not be judged on the basis of a  few irregularities committed by a very limited number of people,  Kim said.</p>

So far, ministries  have the richest experience in it. They have an experience in  cooperation in its comprehensive meaning, in relations with  other countries and cooperation within the country, within the  republic. Therefore, as far as I know a move toward contract  relations has been observed in many ministries, in the Ministry  of Industries for example.    A certain group of people has purchased a certain enterprise  like a shop, a production workshop or an agricultural facility.  However, it has not broken away from the state, from the  ministry and it begins a new sort of relations with similar  organizations on the basis of reciprocal payment, of course.  These relations should be beneficial for the ministries and ten  times more beneficial for this privatized enterprise.    Otherwise, the majority of enterprises will not be able to  survive competitiveness in, say, the Central Asian market, or  the Russian market, and so on, to say nothing of the West  European market. Each enterprise needs to be developed daily  and annually. To be developed technically, to develop technology  and administration and so on. An individual enterprise will  find it very difficult. It will take a long time for an  enterprise to establish links and relations with Europe, Asia,  and other countries and enterprises and they will not have  enough possibilities. Therefore, ministries may become  indispensable as partners of enterprises like this. If our  ministries take up a principle of partnership with such  enterprises, they will be needed in future by the country and  especially by these enterprises.    Underground privatization is an issue to be considered  separately. I think a special group should be created within  the Cabinet of Ministers in this respect, of course on the basis  of your ministry and involving, in my opinion, representatives  of the prosecutor's office, Ministry of Justice, lawyers and our  lawmakers and some of these cases should be legalized. Who are  the participants in this underground privatization? [passage  omitted]    The principal participants in so-called underground  privatization are those who work at the enterprise. These are  managers, chief engineers, and others. This is a collective. I  think that we have to change our hostile attitude toward this  corps of managers which has an inclination to transfer  enterprises to a new concept. Because, regardless of our  desire, these people are the best professionals and they are  capable of transferring a certain enterprise or a certain  facility to a new concept relatively painlessly. Someone will  find illegal benefits in it, someone will become rich but I  think even a newcomer should become rich, anyway. [passage  omitted]    When a plant or a factory or any other facility transfers to  market economy, it will test its abilities itself. If they do  not fit new requirements they will be filtered by the life.  Natural selection will take place. [passage omitted]    There should apparently be a list of systems and  organizations which are required by the state as something to  rely on and a source of its power and which cannot be subjected  to privatization. I cannot agree with the public view that a  collective should not have an advantage in privatizing its  enterprise. [passage omitted]    I do not want us to be enslaved by the idea that the state  must own 51 percent of all enterprises. I do not support this  idea. Its share may be 60 percent, or 10 percent. To establish  obligatory share for every enterprise and facility means to  create obstacles along the way we want to take. [passage omitted]    In order to secure the basis for normal development of  privatization we need rather a labor-consuming process of taking  inventory on all our property, everything possessed by us, I  mean the state. When we know what is in our possession we will  be able to act with more courage. [passage omitted]    I would not delay the process of introducing vouchers. I  am also in a way sceptical in this respect but later a  redistribution of the property will take place. For instance, I  can buy some property for, say, 100,000 coupons and if I fail to  use it I will sell it for a higher or lower price. A  redistribution, which is essential in the society developing in  the way of market economy, will take place. [passage omitted]    Now, the issue of selling property for coupons. If we decide  to sacrifice Georgia to the coupon, let us do it. I do not  consider it a sin to regard the dollar as a principal criterion  for the evaluation. The evaluation has to be done in dollars  and then, if we insist that the coupon remain the only legal  tender, let us accept the payment in the coupon equivalent of  the dollar price. [passage omitted]    The best way to save the coupon is the revitlization of the  economy. The best form is the development of entrepreneurship,  proprietorship. [passage omitted] But I think that when we  speak about the state property, the dollar must be considered as  the principal unit of valuation.    About the concentration of the means received as a result of  privatization. I am against including these in the general  budget. I would back up an idea that these means should be  accumulated in a fund created at the Ministry of State Property  Management or in some other shape. The sum should accumulate at  the bank. In case the sum freezes, it will not be worth a  penny. The sum must be in circulation. And, in the first  instance, I would return the money to entrepreneurs, to private  business and I would give a new momentum to the business.  [passage omitted]    Yet another point to be discussed. A law on bankruptcy must  be initiated. I do not know when this will happen because now,  with the current energy crisis, everyone is bankrupt and all  enterprises must be sold. But it will not keep on like that, I  suppose. I believe, the situation will improve in some time and  then this law will be passed. It must be done by all means.  Generally, laws that are passed, must be implemented and the  bankruptcy law in particular.    Finally, a few words about the press. The press is not  represented well here. There are some here but it is  insufficient. [passage indistinct]    We speak about reforms frantically. This is a reform. What  else is a reform? This is one of the most important parts of  the reform. How can you blame the government for not  implementing reforms when you yourself do not know what a reform  is? If you do not know, come and let us learn together. I  cannot say that Avtandil [Silagadze] has presented an ideal  report but it is the best that can be presented today. There  will be a new one, a better one in a year's time, because he  will gain something from me, I will gain something from him. We  are learning from each other. If we work jointly, we will  advance along the road of reforms. Otherwise, only slogans  remain. [Some say] we are the party which has a program of  national salvation and something like this. This is a sheer  paper and nothing else. These are empty phrases and nothing  else. Programs of national salvation can be drafted only during  a process of relations like this. I mean a process of learning  and working together, criticizing one another, helping one  another and looking for a way out of a political or economic  crisis together. [passage omitted]</p>

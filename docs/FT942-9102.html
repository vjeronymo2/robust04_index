			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (11): Grimy name to live down - Diesel makers seek a bigger market share Diesel engines, the workhorses of everything from vans and buses to ships and small-scale power generation, are not normally associated with generating power on a large scale. This is perhaps not surprising given the fast growth of gas turbine combined cycle power generation over the past decade. Most statistics on thermal power generation tend not to give diesel a separate category of its own, yet according to Diesel and Gas Turbines Worldwide new orders for diesel, dual fuel and gas-engine power plants grew to a record 7,000MW last year, about 12 per cent of the annual global power market. Quietly, diesel engine producers are working to address the common perception of diesel power as dirtier than rival methods of generation, and invest heavily in producing equipment that can be used for reliable, baseload power generation. Mr Pentti-Juhani Hintikka, Finnish president and chief executive officer of Strasbourg-based Wartsila Diesel Group, is naturally enthusiastic about prospects for an industry of which his company is the leader - it claims a 20 per cent share of the diesel power plant market and has the broadest product range. Mr Hintikka believes diesel could in time lift its share of the power plant market as a whole to 25-30 per cent, depending on how the industry develops, and says that already over the past five years it has cut down the lead of gas turbines over diesel engines from eight-to-one to four-to-one in terms of total power capacity. The type of engine and of customer is very varied. Wartsila delivered 1,400MW of power plant installations last year, with half going to south-east and east Asia. China emerged as an important customer - Wartsila's Dutch subsidiary won a contract for a 110MW power plant in Guandong province, while its Finnish company is supplying 13 diesel generator sets to the Pan Yu plant, also in Guandong and due to be completed by the end of the year. Short lead times were an important a factor in winning the business. Several larger heavy fuel-burning diesel plant deliveries were completed to independent power developers and the mining industry in Central and South America, containerised plants were delivered and commissioned in Russia, while in Europe orders were received for combined heat and power-type gas engine installations. The bread-and-butter business for the diesel engine industry has for years been the heavy fuel oil-burning engine, with which Wartsila, for example, has had great success in India. But in the mid-1980s, recognising that gas was becoming the fuel of choice for power generation, the company began a major effort to develop a gas-burning diesel engine, and now claims to be industry leader in gas and gas-diesel engine technology. There are two types of engines that burn gas. First, there is the gas-diesel engine, which Wartsila pioneered in 1987. The important advantage of these engines over every other type of prime mover is that they can run on any type of fuel from heavy fuel oil to natural gas, and with computer control can be switched from one fuel to another without any interruption in operation. This flexibility, says Mr Hintikka, was a major argument used by Wartsila to clinch an order in the Philipinnes last year. The second basic type of gas engines uses so-called 'lean burn' technology, with spark ignition and a lean air-to-gas mixture that raises thermal efficiency and gives very low NOx emissions. The concept is ideal for smaller power plants in the 400 to 3,000kW range, says Wartsila. Mr Hintikka has a twin strategy for increasing the use of diesel power. In developing countries, the aim is to offer a reasonable price and fast construction times, but Wartsila also wants to be a player in the industrialised world, where high efficiency, reliability and low emissions are the priority. In particular, Mr Hintikka is looking to exploit the independent power producer (IPP) market in regions as diverse as the US and south-east Asia. IPP clients accounted for 45.6 per cent of Wartsila's diesel power plant sales last year - 'they are really setting a new trend, making it important for us to perform better,' says Mr Hintikka. They are followed by utilities which accounted for 25.7 per cent of sales and industry with 20.4 per cent. The remaining 8.3 per cent came from natural resources and other customers. To succeed against gas turbines, diesel power has to be competitive in terms of thermal efficiency and emissions. By including a steam turbine, gas engines can be used in combined cycle formation, and Mr Hintikka says Wartsila has designs for 100MW plants with thermal efficiency of 54 per cent, closely comparable with combined cycle gas turbine generation. As for emissions, the relative performance of gas engines and gas turbines depends on how they are measured. The diesel engine industry prefers to measure emission levels in terms of grams per kilowatt-hour, under which diesel engines come out cleaner, but gas turbines emerge on top if emissions are measured on parts per million (volume-based). There are size constraints on diesel power, Mr Hintikka admits. Ten engines is probably the maximum practical number in each plant, and at 16MW apiece plus a steam turbine total power output of 200MW is possible. Beyond that size, the efficiency of gas turbines improves, further loading the odds in their favour. Even with this limitation, though, Mr Hintikka believes there are plenty of opportunities for diesel power. The traditional heavy fuel oil market will remain, but the real growth will be in gas engines in both the industrialised and developing countries. The key technological challenge, he says, is to keep improving thermal efficiency while keeping emissions under control, involving continuing heavy spending on research and development. At the same time, as lead times are so important to winning orders Wartsila Diesel is engaged in much the same kind of continuous cost reduction and manufacturing reorganisation as has taken place among the gas turbine producers, against whose performance it measures itself. An example are the changes at the Wartsila SACM Diesel plant at Mulhouse, where employment has fallen from 1,000 in 1989 to 750 now. Productivity has risen as lead times have been reduced, through a combination of investment in new machinery and simplifying and shortening the route taken by engines as they progress through the plant towards completion. Mr Matti Tulkki, president and chief executive of the French unit, quotes reductions in internal lead times from seven months to 1.5 months, or from 11 months to five months for the biggest engines.</p>

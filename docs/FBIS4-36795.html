			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column by Fawzi Ibrahim: "Medicine </F> Trade Too!"]    [Text] It seems that the cancer of soaring prices is not  confined to basic commodities and other materials but acutely  and clearly affects the medicine trade, although the state  provides medical necessities and medicines for the citizens by  importing and marketing them. A specialized institution is  carrying out that duty and is distributing these necessities and  medicines to pharmacies and other marketing centers. A new  group of people, however, has entered the trade markets along  with traders, brokers, and parasites on this profession, which  are using various ways to torture the sons of their people and  to suck their blood in order to make huge profits and to become  wealthy at the expense of millions of poor, patient people.  God, conscience, and history will punish this group of people  for standing in the ranks of Iraq's enemies, which want to hurt  the patient people.    Regrettably, the pharmacies have been drifted by this  current  and have imposed high prices on pharmaceutical materials and  necessities and medicines, although the Medicine Corporation has  fixed the prices of these materials. Woe unto you if you ask  the pharmacist any question. He may refuse to give you the  medicine which you badly need even if you pay him a fortune.  This is not how the elite treat each other. They do not forget  their patriotism to make profits at the expense of the sick and  the poor of our people. Some pharmacies even sell medicines and  antibiotics to hospitals or private clinics, instead of  displaying them, so that they can avoid questioning. At the  same time, these hospitals ask for fantastic prices. In this  way, pharmacists avoid embarrassment before the citizens. The  majority of the pharmacies also exploit weak control,  inspection, and follow up by the competent authorities to invent  ways to sell these medicines as imported materials. Although  these pharmacies were charged by the competent authorities with  violating the fixed prices, they resumed their violations  following the end of their closure periods. The pharmacists  union should take a firm position toward these violators by  withdrawing their licenses, the Medicine Corporation should  cancel agency contracts with them, and the security, party, and  popular institutions are urged to follow up and deal with this  phenomenon like other phenomena which have recently surfaced,  especially the phenomenon of the surging prices of basic  commodities.</p>

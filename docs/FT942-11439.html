			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (7): A special relationship with Latin America - An investment bank operating in another emerging market Since planting its flag in the New World more than a century ago, N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons believes it has now emerged as one of the leading institutions in Latin America. The privately-owned banking group, which established its presence by handling Brazil's first bond issue, has nurtured a special relationship with the region which has paid off in recent years with its appointment as advisers to some of the largest privatisations ever undertaken by developing countries. Mr Michael Phair, a Rothschild's director with responsibility for emerging markets, attributes that success to the bank's staying power in a continent notorious for haemorrhaging money. When other banks abandoned the region as political regimes developed a taste for nationalisation, he says, Rothschild reinforced its presence, particularly in Chile and Argentina. That persistence brought its reward at the end of the 1980s as politicians embraced free market principles instead of protectionism and state control. 'The change took place when the voters became so desperate that they opted for trade liberalisation,' Mr Phair said. A new breed of finance ministers came to office who had watched the Thatcherite disposal programme restore some of Britain's economic vitality in the 1980s, and they turned to merchant banks and advisers which had handled the big issues. So it was that Rothschild, adviser to the Department of Energy on the Pounds 5.6bn British Gas privatisation, landed some of the region's biggest contracts. The Argentine government appointed it to oversee the Dollars 4.2bn restructuring and sale of Gas del Estado in 1992 - at the time, the largest energy sell-off outside the UK. It reinforced that success last month with its appointment as advisers on the disposal of Electroperu's Central-North Interconnected System, Peru's largest state sell-off. The bank's efforts, however, have not been concentrated solely south of the Rio Grande. Last year it exported its UK privatisation experience - dominated by its advisory role in the Pounds 5.2bn sale of the 12 regional electricity companies - to 18 countries, where it was appointed in 43 transactions. That record left Rothschild as the world leader in privatisation assignments for the second year running, according to the 1993 league table compiled by Privatisation International, the specialist magazine. Mr Tony Alt, the bank's managing director of corporate finance, believes the ranking reflects its success in developing expertise in particular industries. It has, for example, teams devoted to telecommunications which cut their teeth on the British Telecommunications sell-off, and its more recent Dollars 4.3bn link with MCI of the US and the Dollars 2.2bn sale of their holding in McCaw Cellular. It has picked up the role as adviser to Hungarian Telecom, of which 30 per cent was sold last December for Dollars 875m, and is advising the Dutch government on the forthcoming privatisation of the KPN post and telephone utility. 'We're deeply involved in this process and we intend to build on our expertise,' says Mr Alt. That strategy does not always pay off. Last October, Rothschild was one of a number of banks which saw a hefty investment and six-month bidding effort evaporate after the government of Singapore scaled down the privatisation of Singapore Telecommunications. It decided the partial sell-off, in which Goldman Sachs was named adviser, would not be underwritten - depriving the bank of an estimated Pounds 20m in underwriting fees. Last autumn, the Greek government also dealt a blow to Rothschild by sacking it as leading adviser on the privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications company. A senior official in the socialist government, said at the time: 'We're naive perhaps, but we were shocked at the size of the fees the conservatives were prepared to pay to foreign consultants.' Rothschild is coy about privatisation fees. Without naming figures, Mr Phair says: 'It's very labour intensive and not overly remunerative.' The bank does not disclose whether it collects 2 per cent of a deal's value on completion - the prevailing rate in Europe in recent years - or if it's moving towards charging an hourly rate, as advocated by the European Commission. The real reward, says Mr Phair, is the reputation which a successful privatisation earns for the advisers. 'In the past, many banks regarded working for governments as rather unattractive, but it has proved an extremely good springboard to other business.' The spin-offs include rights issues, divestments, bond issues and acting as 'adviser to several companies which have achieved considerable growth through successful acquisitions.' Its clients include Nabisco, Hanson, Revlon and Marks &amp; Spencer. Mr Alt, meanwhile, says the bank is expanding its activities in largely untapped markets such as South Africa and China. He led a delegation recently to South Africa, where the bank told 38 companies that its experience - initially through handling mining stocks and subsequently through secondary market-making by its associate brokers Smith New Court - made it well placed to offer access to international capital. The bank is also about to set up an office in Shanghai to build up its corporate finance and bullion finance operations. 'These countries are aware of outside finance, but they're not focused,' says Mr Alt. 'What we're offering is access to international capital markets and the ability to guide them through cross-border mergers and acquisitions  -that's what N. M Rothschild is all about.'</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved guidelines that for the first  time will allow city funding for individual artists. Under the new guidelines  (which also permit non-matching entry level grants for emerging arts groups  with a less than three-year history), the city can provide non-matching grants  of $1,000 to $15,000 in direct fees and/or production costs for artists or  designers to create publicly accessible artworks or artworks for nonprofit  institutions that are unable to pay artists' fees. Fundable projects include  artist-in-residence programs, public performances, murals and design projects.  The guidelines apply to projects scheduled to begin after Jan. 1 and be  completed before June 30. The grant application deadline is Oct. 2. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

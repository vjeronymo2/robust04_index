			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Dr. Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu  and Kashmir and the National Conference leader, has become too  active in the valley affairs after his return from London. He is  making some meaningless statements to support his selfish  political interests which might aggravate the situation. Farooq  recently said in an interview given in Geneva, where he had gone  as the Indian representative to the 50th conference of the UN  Human Rights Commission, that the central government should soon  prepare a formula to resolve the Kashmir issue. This formula  should include plans to return to the pre-1953 position given to  Kashmir under to the Indian Constitution. He had indirectly  supported giving autonomy to Jammu-Kashmir by this statement.  Farooq wants the valley to get its former constitutional  position so that he could become its leader and call himself the  prime minister instead of the chief minister, establish a  separate election commission, and negotiate a new definition of  the valley with the Center. We can praise Dr. Abdullah's  interview given in Geneva for strongly criticizing Pakistan for  interfering in India's internal affairs, however, we cannot  agree with his suggestion to announce a special package giving  Kashmir its former constitutional position.    Autonomy or a special package for Jammu-Kashmir cannot  guarantee solving the problems in the very sensitive and  riot-torn state. This could raise questions about unity in this  region because the problems there have been created by Pakistan  deliberately. New conspiracies are implemented every day to  spread anarchy, and it is not possible for Farooq Abdullah to be  unaware of it all. He has isolated himself by issuing this  statement in Geneva. He is neither the authorized spokesman for  Jammu-Kashmir nor can he be considered the only representative  of the Jammu-Kashmir people. Who will make the decision to  prepare a special plan for the valley under this situation? It  is useless to think about a special package when there is no  elected government in the state. It is a good thing that the  central government did not take Farooq Abdullah's statement  seriously and Home Minister Chavan has refused to issue any kind  of special package before the election in Kashmir. Farooq said  that he was not afraid of the threats issued by the terrorists  in the valley and that his suggestion, if the government decides  to accept it, could help people there to learn about their  rights and to establish peace in the valley. His ideas show his  superficial mentality and reeks of political vested interests.    The most important step to establish peace in Kashmir and  start the political process there is to put an end of the  Pakistan-supported terrorist activities. The naive youth in the  valley must be made aware of Pakistan's unholy designs and be  made to understand that their interests would be protected only  if they remain with their own country and help maintain peace.  Pakistan and its intelligence agency, ISI, are pulling all kind  of stunts to make sure peace is not established in the valley.  Its rulers are trying to condemn India by raising the Kashmir  issue at the international level, and its intelligence agency  ISI is sending trained terrorists to create unrest in Kashmir.  India, after a long time, has accelerated diplomatic efforts and  started a strong campaign to silence Pakistan. Similar alertness  and swiftness is needed at the border so that Pakistan is forced  to give up its declared policy of spreading unrest in Kashmir.  Only then can the situation in the valley be normal and the  atmosphere be made conducive to starting a political process.  The Farooq formula can create new problems in the present  situation and also will provide encouragement to Pakistan.  Therefore, it should not be discussed at all.  *</p>

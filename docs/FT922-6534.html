			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Legal clash may harm Channel 5 prospects PROSPECTS of a merger between Five TV and The Entertainment Channel, both bidders for the Channel 5 franchise, appeared to be damaged yesterday after Five TV signalled it might continue its legal battle against TV-am. Five TV yesterday lost its High Court action to gain an injunction preventing TV-am from investing in The Entertainment Channel, but later indicated that it could take the issue to a full hearing. No hearing could be held before the July 7 deadline for franchise bids, but the clash could reduce the chances of the consortia joining forces. Several leading shareholders in both consortia believe high start-up costs mean that the Channel 5 franchise will be viable only if the bid is uncontested and the minimum Pounds 1,000-a-year bid made. The vice-chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls, said an exclusivity and confidentiality clause signed by TV-am when it was shown Five TV's business plan should not prevent it from investing in any rival Channel 5 bidder.</p>

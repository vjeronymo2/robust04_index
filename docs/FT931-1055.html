			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan urged to take lead on export control rules THE Japanese government yesterday received a report from a senior advisory body urging the country to take a leading role in redefining rules on the export of technology with potential military uses. Once a target of criticism for inadequate export controls, Japan believes a relatively good record more recently puts it in a strong position to lead the debate on developing a new regime to prevent proliferation of mass-destruction weapons. The Security Export Control Committee report listed general recommendations to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to be responsible for drawing up specific lists of countries and products needing to be controlled. The committee raises concerns about export of items not under the control of the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) but which may have military applications. It questions the safety of the 'know' clause used by such countries as the US, UK and Germany. If the exporter 'knows' technology may be used for military purposes, official approval is needed. The report suggests tougher controls are needed, 'based on clear and objective standards' not conditions 'such as whether the exporter knows how goods to be exported will be used'.</p>

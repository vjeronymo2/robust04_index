			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANDIEGO AT LARGE: GUNTHER WILL BE GONE, BUT HE WON'T BE REPLACED  </P> <P> When famed animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams appeared in San Diego for the  first time in July, 1969, Eric Beheim was there.  </P> <P> When Gunther (nobody calls him Gebel-Williams) begins his final San Diego  appearance on Tuesday, Beheim will be there. It's a job (he's a saxophonist),  but it's also a devotion.  </P> <P> "I started going to circuses when I was 6 years old in Cleveland, and I haven't  stopped," said Beheim, 43. He's a musician who lives in Lakeside and joins the  circus orchestra every summer when it plays San Diego.  </P> <P> "Once Gunther is retired, people will start bragging that they actually saw him  perform," Beheim said. "It'll be like old-timers today who saw the legendary  Clyde Beatty or Frank Buck."  </P> <P> After 20 years as the star of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,  the 54-year-old Gunther has announced plans to retire after a farewell tour  with the circus, which arrives Tuesday at the Sports Arena for a six-day run.  </P> <P> Beheim remembers Gunther wowing the crowd in 1969 as he was propelled from a  teeter board onto the back of an elephant. He remembers in the 1970s watching  in an empty arena as Gunther trained a rare and temperamental white tiger  between shows.  </P> <P> He remembers one night when Gunther's finale -- riding a tiger atop an elephant  -- culminated right next to the orchestra.  </P> <P> "I looked up at the tiger, and he looked back down at me, right in my eyes,"  Beheim said.  </P> <P> On this tour, Gunther's closer involves simultaneous control of three rings of  animals -- Siberian and Bengal tigers in one, elephants in a second, and  Lipizzaner horses in a third.  </P> <P> "They may find someone to succeed Gunther, but not to replace him," Beheim  said.  </P> <P> Amazing and Sticky  </P> <P> Facts that will dazzle your friends:  </P> <P> * The Del Mar Smurfs chewed 234 feet of Bubble Tape bubble gum while beating  teams from Temecula, Poway and Vista to win the Vista Little League tournament.  </P> <P> Amurol Products Co. of Naperville, Ill., makers of Bubble Tape, had heard that  the Smurfs were partial to the chewy stuff and rushed a case to Del Mar in time  for the tourney. It comes in skinny rolls 6 feet long.  </P> <P> * Syndicated columnist Bob Greene says Pete Rose speaks with an Ohio accent,  "the prettiest accent on Earth."  </P> <P> But Times reporter Barry Horstman, like Rose, a native of Cincinnati, says that  isn't so. He says Rose talks more like people who live across the Ohio River in  Kentucky.  </P> <P> How does he explain that? Kentucky is where the race track is, Horstman notes.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Libertarian Club, long accused of harboring a far-out  philosophy, will erase all doubt at Tuesday's meeting.  </P> <P> Title of the after-dinner speech: "Anarchists' Guide to the Galaxy."  </P> <P> How Times Change  </P> <P> That was then, this is now.  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson has come to San Diego twice to take a bow for the  renovation of the downtown Sandford Hotel: last October when he was seeking  reelection and this week as he warms up to run for governor.  </P> <P> Senior housing is a major political issue, and Wilson after all was helpful in  shifting $500,000 in federal funds to the project. The rest of the $6.5 million  came mostly from two nonprofit  </P> <P> organizations run by Mavoureen O'Connor.  </P> <P> At a ceremony Wednesday night, Wilson cut a ribbon and praised O'Connor as "the  Houdini of those who make housing happen." The smell of irony was in the air.  </P> <P> When Wilson was the all-powerful mayor of San Diego, O'Connor was rebuffed in  her bid for an appointment to the Housing Commission. Her ideas on how to  finance low-income housing were seen as too unconventional.  </P> <P> No More X-Rated Jogging  </P> <P>  "I don't know, but I've been told. . . "  </P> <P>  Trainees in the Marine Corps drill instructor school sometimes run in  formation along the shore in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach, red shorts,  T-shirts, combat boots, DI school flag held proudly aloft.  </P> <P> So it was Wednesday afternoon. Sunbathers stopped, looked and listened. What  they heard was surprising to some.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps says it won't happen again. Next time the DIs jog in public,  there will be no X-rated singing in cadence.  </P></p>

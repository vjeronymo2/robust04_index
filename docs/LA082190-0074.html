			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP ;  </P> <P> IS EMBARGO ENOUGH TO STOP SADDAM?  </P> <P> Like a giant anaconda slowly and relentlessly squeezing its prey, the world's  most sweeping international embargo is tightening its grip around Iraq. "The  countdown has begun," a senior U.S. official says confidently. "It's just a  matter of time."  </P> <P> Yet the outside world may have to wait longer than many analysts expect for the  blockade to squeeze the last breath of resistance from Baghdad -- provided the  rising level of rhetoric and the frustration over the foreign captives don't  flare into conflict first.  </P> <P> Unlike other oil-rich Persian Gulf nations, Iraq has placed its highest  priority on developing a more independent agricultural and industrial base. But  it still imports goods large and small from around the world -- cotton,  medicine and razor blades from Egypt, beef from Argentina, dairy products from  Ireland, grain from the United States and Australia, fresh produce and cooking  oil from Turkey, cars, steel and television sets from Japan, and everything  from matches to warplanes from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But Iraq's most vulnerable side is its dependence on food imports: A full 80%  of everything that Iraqis eat comes from abroad.  </P> <P> And, besides the pressure to replenish stocks of bullets and ballistic  missiles, Iraq's biggest challenge in the face of the Western sanctions will be  to fill the stomachs of more than 17 million Iraqis, tens of thousands of  foreign workers and captives who are trapped in Baghdad, and the million-plus  residents and foreigners in Kuwait, U.S. and private analysts agree.  </P> <P> Even the most optimistic estimates give Iraq two to six months of survival on  its current food reserves. First will come the shortages. Then, rationing. And  finally -- over the long term -- could come actual starvation.  </P> <P> But the impact is likely to be uneven. U.S. estimates show that Baghdad had a  115-day stockpile of rice in July, but only a nine-day supply of corn, which is  mainly needed to feed livestock. The country's sugar stocks should last only  about 20 days.  </P> <P> The slow strangulation is already being felt. In a dramatic acknowledgment of  the embargo's impact, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week publicly  appealed for his countrymen to eat less. Baghdad bakeries have stopped making  pastries. And despite threats of severe punishment for hoarders, stores in the  Iraqi capital were mobbed last weekend as panicked shoppers rushed to buy up  huge sacks of flour, sugar and other basic goods. In occupied Kuwait, the bread  lines are four hours long.  </P> <P> How long Hussein can survive politically as conditions deteriorate also may  defy the odds, according to the limited Western intelligence available.  </P> <P> "Most of the opposition is abroad, in prison or in the ground," a U.S. analyst  concedes. While Iraq's restive Kurds in the north and its Shiite majority in  the south have long been hotbeds of dissent, the only two groups strong enough  to mount an effective challenge to Hussein are the Revolutionary Command  Council and the military, which have served as his power bases since he became  Iraq's president in 1979.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's implicit strategy has banked on the worsening  economic squeeze to foment enough opposition inside Iraq to bring on the  overthrow of Hussein -- prompting Iraq to retreat from Kuwait and eliminating  the threat of future Iraqi adventurism.  </P> <P> Initially, U.S. officials were ecstatic about how quickly the embargo began to  take hold. America's allies cooperated in deploying a multinational fleet  almost immediately. And Turkey and Saudi Arabia lost no time in closing the  Iraqi oil pipelines in their countries.  </P> <P> But Riad Ajami, professor of international management at Ohio State University  and author of a new report on the Iraqi economy, asserts that for all the  Western efforts, Iraq may not begin to feel any real pain for 45 to 60 days.  </P> <P> Part of the reason is that Iraqis are relatively well fed. The average Iraqi  eats 3,000 calories a day -- a very high rate of food consumption compared to  Third World countries. "Iraqis don't begin at the level of Bangladeshis or  Mozambicans," an Administration economist says.  </P> <P> Analysts say that how long the initial period of shortages lasts will depend on  three factors -- the amount of goods that Iraq has stockpiled, the size of the  country's next harvest and the amount of storage capacity that will be  available for foodstuffs.  </P> <P> "There's evidence that this (Iraqi invasion of Kuwait) was planned months  ahead," says William B. Quandt, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution  who was a National Security Council staff member during the Jimmy Carter  Administration. "Saddam (as Hussein is widely known in the Middle East) has  been able to plan for things for some time, and he must have anticipated at  least a partial embargo."  </P> <P> Baghdad has been spending almost $2 billion a year just for food imports --  four times the value of its food exports. And virtually everything it buys is  essential: wheat, rice, flour, sugar, milk, eggs, beef, chicken and livestock  feed.  </P> <P> With the current harvest season just beginning, Baghdad may be able to offset  the impact of the embargo in the short run, a Turkish Foreign Ministry official  says. Iraq has the most arable land in the Arab world -- about 20% of a country  that occupies 168,000 square miles, an area slightly larger than California.  About 70% of Iraq's arable land is currently being cultivated.  </P> <P> But Iraq has limited storage facilities, such as grain elevators, and building  a long-term reserve would be difficult, according to Samir Milady, an Egyptian  expert on international food policy.  </P> <P> Analysts say Hussein is likely to put off full-scale rationing of basic  necessities until the last possible moment, if only because it opens the way  for would-be political opponents. And Iraq may have bought itself an additional  five to six months by reportedly looting $5 billion in gold and cash from  Kuwait's central bank.  </P> <P> The biggest unknowns are the amounts of food and other necessities that may be  brought in by Turkish smugglers, or transshipped through Jordan, or trucked in  from as far as the illegal "pirate" ports of Lebanon. "No embargo in history  has been 100% successful," Ajami points out. "Market prices can make strange  bedfellows."  </P> <P> But Ajami says Iraq's money may not go very far. "The prices of all these goods  will quadruple before they get to Baghdad," he says, "and the psychology of  sanctions will begin to be felt long before that, undermining the confidence of  people in Saddam's ability to run the economy and the state."  </P> <P> As a result, experts say that the first signs of malnutrition could be seen in  Baghdad within four months. If this occurs, the situation could get desperate  by early next year. "That's when people will begin to slaughter animals and  resort to what all people do in desperation: eat what they haven't eaten  before," Ajami says. "That's also when the shortages will be so acute that the  world will see images that will make everyone uncomfortable about starvation  and children with inadequate diets."  </P> <P> U.S. officials concede that Hussein may eventually be able to buy more time by  appealing to the single loophole in the U.N. resolution that imposed the  embargo -- an exemption for humanitarian aid.  </P> <P> "There is potential for serious disagreement on the prohibition of foodstuffs  for humanitarian purposes," says a U.S. official monitoring the embargo. "At  the moment, we're applying the embargo strictly (because) there's no indication  that Iraq needs food. But if starvation sets in, it'll certainly play to the  court of world public opinion."  </P> <P> A State Department strategist agrees. "If we see pictures of Americans in Iraq  and Kuwait suffering like everyone else, I wonder how popular sanctions will  be," he muses. Yemen and Brazil have already said they will consider sending  food on humanitarian grounds to prevent starvation.  </P> <P> Even so, the current embargo has far more potential to succeed than any  previous international boycott, for one reason: It has the endorsement -- and  full participation -- of both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The loss of imports from both countries will hurt Iraq severely. Since  diplomatic relations were resumed in 1984 after a 17-year break, the United  States has gradually become Iraq's leading supplier of food, accounting for  about a third of Iraqi imports and providing virtually all the country's rice,  corn, animal feed and vegetable oils. In 1988, U.S.-Iraqi trade totaled $2.8  billion.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, historically a close political and military ally of Iraq, has  been the major supplier of the country's technology, machinery, oil-extraction  equipment and arms. During the first nine months of last year, Soviet-Iraqi  trade totaled $2.1 billion.  </P> <P> Moreover, the embargo comes at a time when Iraqis already have had to tighten  their belts as a result of Hussein's eight-year war with neighboring Iran. A  decade ago, on the eve of its invasion of Iran, Baghdad had amassed a  $40-billion surplus in foreign exchange. But like water in the desert sands,  the funds quickly evaporated as Hussein poured out billions to maintain his  arsenal.  </P> <P> Just as Hussein misjudged the Western reaction to his invasion of Kuwait last  month, he underestimated the cost of the war with Iran in 1980. Hussein thought  the military foray would be quick and dirty. But the tenacious Iranians fought  back, and within two years the conflict was costing him $1.5 billion a month.  </P> <P> Iraq's oil exports plummeted then, too -- by as much as 80% -- because a  pipeline to the Mediterranean through Syria was cut off and its sole outlet to  the sea was hostage to the war.  </P> <P> As the supply of basic foodstuffs began to dry up, Hussein warned that Iraqis  would have to absorb new economic hardships through "rationalization" and an  end to all "non-essential spending." His regime was in such dire financial  straits that he urged Iraqis to turn in their gold jewelry and heirlooms.  </P> <P> For weeks, Iraqi television showed footage of women donating gold bracelets,  necklaces and rings, which together brought in 50 tons of gold worth more than  $600 million, according to the Baghdad press. Even Hussein's wife contributed  her personal valuables to the cause.  </P> <P> In all, Iraq's misadventure in Iran and the subsequent drive to rebuild the  country has left Baghdad with a debt of between $80 billion and $100 billion --  half of it owed to gulf neighbors and half to European institutions.  </P> <P> Indeed, some analysts believe that Hussein's economic plight may have played a  role in precipitating the current gulf crisis. "The debt and the credit squeeze  were as much responsible for Iraq's decision to invade Kuwait as the historic  territorial claims," says a congressional staffer who specializes in the Middle  East. "(Hussein) needed the money more than the land."  </P> <P> Still, today's waiting game may not be all in the West's favor.  </P> <P> "Iraq can probably survive two or three months before the brunt hits the public  too badly, but we will also get tired of this (standoff) before long," Quandt  points out.  </P> <P> Some even believe that Hussein may ultimately prove better able to stay the  course than President Bush. "Saddam can hold out longer than American public  opinion in keeping a huge force in Saudi Arabia," says Ken Katzman, a former  CIA analyst now at Defense Systems Inc., a Washington consulting firm. "He's  confronted long odds for a long time and always survived. If we look to  sanctions to destroy him, then we're looking under the wrong rock. Sanctions  are not the way to rattle his cage. He only understands force, violence and  military strength. That's what it will take to fundamentally change his view of  the crisis."  </P> <P> Although Administration strategists are hoping for an Iraqi version of the  recent revolutions in Eastern Europe to rid the region of the "Saddam problem,"  they concede there are no Vaclav Havels or Lech Walesas waiting in the  background to challenge Hussein's rule.  </P> <P> The Kurds, who account for 15% of Iraq's population, have been a constant  irritation to the regime. With help from foreign intelligence agencies -- the  CIA, Israel's Mossad and pre-revolutionary Iran's SAVAK -- Kurdish guerrillas  mounted a potent, though ultimately unsuccessful, insurgency in the early  1970s.  </P> <P> Kurdish guerrillas, however, continued small-scale attacks on their own in  their northeast strongholds. By 1987, the unrest so angered Hussein that he  blew up 500 Kurdish villages and relocated up to a half-million Kurds. In the  spring of 1988, his forces used nerve and poison gases in the village of  Halabja against Kurds who had supported Iran in the war, killing about 5,000 of  them. Since then, he has created a virtual cordon sanitaire around the region.  </P> <P> In talks in Washington this past week, Jalal Talabani of the Kurdish Democratic  Party pledged support to Kuwait's ruling Al Sabah family in its fight to regain  control of the tiny city-state. Kuwaiti officials-in-exile say the Kurds will  again try to mount new attacks in the north to divert Iraq's troops now massed  along the southern borders with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Another potential hotbed is Iraq's Shiite community, which accounts for 60% of  the population. Again, however, Hussein has ruthlessly tamed opposition. After  the 1979 revolution in predominantly Shiite Iran, Hussein executed Iraq's  leading radical Shiite cleric, Mohammed Bakr Sadr, and deported an estimated  200,000 Iraqi Shiites of Iranian origin across the border into Iran. The  remnants of the group Al Dawa -- Arabic for "The Call," which Sadr headed --  are now headquartered in Tehran.  </P> <P> Although the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appealed to the Iraqi Shiites to side  with their brethren in Iran and to rise up against Hussein, the majority were  loyal to Iraq instead. Indeed, the majority of troops in the Iraqi army are  Shiite, mostly in low-ranking positions. Nationalism has had more appeal than  religious roots.  </P> <P> But tiny cores of resistance did surface: In September, 1987, a small cell of  Al Dawa operatives opened fire during a parade to celebrate the annual Army Day  in Baquba, just north of Baghdad. Although troops returned fire, at least 50  were killed, according to foreign envoys, who were among the dignitaries  invited to attend.  </P> <P> According to European envoys, however, Western intelligence is not looking to  the Shiite community as the primary challenge to the strong-arm rule of the  Takriti clan, from which Hussein comes and members of which permeate the  government.  </P> <P> That leaves two bodies: the military and the Revolutionary Command Council that  serves as Hussein's inner circle. As yet, however, foreign envoys cannot  identify viable individuals or cells within either that would be capable of  taking over. "Sanctions will eventually squeeze Iraq very hard, but that will  not necessarily lead an army officer to bump him off," Quandt says.  </P> <P> Ajami agrees. "(Hussein's) intelligence capability prevails in all segments  within the military," he says. "It would be hard for him not to find out about  any movement against him. There's also no guarantee that a group of young  officers would be any more compromising than Saddam. Iraq could end up with an  even worse monster."  </P> <P> Hussein's abrupt peace offer to Iran last week could lead to dissent within  some military quarters angered by the enormous financial and personnel losses  suffered during that eight-year conflict. At the same time, however, the Iraqi  leader's appeal to the Arab world to rise up against foreign military  intervention and political domination -- to prevent Arab resources from being  diverted to Western coffers -- appears to have growing appeal, not only in  Iraq.  </P> <P> Most U.S. analysts argue that Hussein is eventually doomed. "He's finished --  period," the congressional expert says. "If he goes forward, he faces defeat  and overthrow. If he goes back, there will be a lot of questions about why this  took place at all, especially after his peace with Iran on Iranian terms. And  if he stays put, he'll be strangled economically."  </P> <P> But most analysts are also unable to come up with a workable scenario for  Hussein's overthrow.  </P> <P> Three factors -- the prospect of a prolonged stalemate as the embargo slowly  squeezes, the absence of visible domestic opposition and the escalating tension  over American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait -- have led a growing number of U.S.  experts to predict that foreign military force will be the only short-term  means of removing the "Saddam problem" from the Middle East political equation.  </P> <P> From now on, it is a test of wills -- and time.  </P> <P> Staff writers John Thor-Dahlburg in Moscow, Kim Murphy in Cairo, Nick B.  Williams Jr. in Dubai, and James Gerstenzang in Kennebunkport, Me., contributed  to this report. Hugh Pope in Istanbul, Turkey, also contributed to this  article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> But There Are Risks for Bush, Too  </P> <P> * Detention of 3,000 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait could evolve into the biggest  hostage crisis yet for the United States.  </P> <P> * There may be terrorist attacks by Islamic militants anxious to punish America  for intervening.  </P> <P> * The economic fallout from the intervention could tip America into recession.  </P> <P> * Intervention may trigger such a popular backlash in the region that it  undermines the very moderate Arab regimes it was meant to aid.  </P> <P> * Failure to make Hussein back down could severely damage American credibility,  inspiring an even worse regional arms race as regimes decide they can no longer  count on either superpower for protection.  </P> <P> * Rather than the world's policeman, the United States could come to be seen as  the world's cowboy, slowing the evolution to a post-Cold War order.  </P> <P> * There could be an Iraqi attack against U.S. troops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Noose Around Iraq  </P> <P> * Syria, an old and bitter rival, sends troops to Saudi Arabia and reinforces  its border;  </P> <P> * Turkey cuts off one of Iraq's main oil pipelines and joins in U.N. economic  sanctions;  </P> <P> * A hostile Kurdish minority in northern Iraq pledges support for Kuwait and  waits for Saddam to slip;  </P> <P> * Iran welcomes Iraqi peace overtures but demands a withdrawal from Kuwait and  nurses the bitter wounds of a long war;  </P> <P> * U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf threaten to halt sea shipments into or out  of Iraq;  </P> <P> * Saudi Arabia, bolstered by tens of thousands of U.S., Egyptian, and other  troops, cuts Iraq's other main oil pipeline;  </P> <P> * Jordan tries to walk a tightrope between its moderate Arab and Western  benefactors on one side and its neighbor, Iraq, on the other.  </P></p>

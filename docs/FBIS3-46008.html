Preparations for an international airport have started.  According to a preliminary plan, the airport will be built in  two phases. The first phase will involve the construction of a  2,600- meter runway and the second phase will involved a  3,200-meter runway. The first phase, estimated to cost 350  million yuan, is scheduled for completion in 1995.    Work on a deep-water harbor capable of accommodating ships  of  3,000 tons is to start soon near the dam site. The project is  expected to cost 120 million yuan.    With a designed handling capacity of 10 to 50 million tons  annually, the port will be used to transport materials needed in  the construction of the Three Gorges Project, of which  preliminary projects have started.    Meanwhile, a highway bridge across the Chang Jiang River at  Yichang will be built soon.    The Three Gorges Project, which was launched two years ago  by  the Chinese Government, is one of the world's largest water  conservancy and power projects. A dam 185 meters high and  nearly 2 km long will be thrown across the Chang Jiang River  before the year 2010.</p>

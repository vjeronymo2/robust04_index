			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Defining the term nonroad equipment is a logical outgrowth of this rulemaking, is in keeping with the intent of Congress, and clarifies EPA's use of the term. EPA also notes that the definition of the term ``nonroad vehicle'' has been revised to match the statutory definition; instead of defining nonroad vehicles as vehicles propelled by nonroad engines, they are defined as vehicles powered by nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> U. Definition of New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the September 6, 1991 NPRM proposing regulations under section 209(e) of the CAA regarding preemption of state nonroad regulations, EPA proposed a definition of ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle.'' In that NPRM, EPA defined ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle'' to mean a nonroad engine or a nonroad vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. EPA did not provide a definition of ``new'' in its May 17, 1993 NPRM because EPA expected that the definition of ``new'' promulgated in the context of the section 209(e) rulemaking would control how ``new'' would be defined in this rule. However, EPA has not yet promulgated its section 209(e) regulations. Therefore, EPA is finalizing a definition of ``new'' in this rulemaking relying in part on the definition proposed in the September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ultimate purchaser was proposed to be defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such a new nonroad vehicle or nonroad engine for purposes other than resale. Additionally, with respect to imported nonroad engines, EPA proposed to define ``new'' nonroad engine to be a nonroad engine manufactured after the effective date of a regulation issued under section 213 which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for importation into the United States. These definitions also applied to ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in locomotives.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on EPA's proposed definition of ``new'' were several. First, CARB, the San Diego Air Pollution Control Board (SDAPCB), and the Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) supported EPA's definition. CARB asked that EPA clarify which regulatory activities states may perform; for example, whether states may require in-use testing and impose add-on or retrofit requirements. On the other hand, many commenters, including U.S. Representative Terry Bruce, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA), opposed EPA's proposed definition and proposed that ``new'' should mean manufactured after either the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments, November 15, 1990, or after federal regulations take effect. These commenters believe that Congress intended an ``absolute'' preemption. That is, the nonroad engines and vehicles in the preempted categories manufactured after November 15, 1990 would never be subject to any kind of state emission regulation. EMA commented that if EPA does not accept the latter definition, it should expand its proposed definition so that engines remain ``new'' until they have exceeded their useful life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters in the railroad industry also supported a definition of ``new'' as ``manufactured after November 1990'' and stated further that the railroad industry has traditionally been preempted from state regulation, such as in the area of safety. The same commenters indicated that they believe that state control of locomotive emissions or state enforcement of federal standards would interfere with interstate commerce. Railroad commenters also stated that any standards for rebuilt or remanufactured engines or locomotives should be uniform federal standards_not state standards. Furthermore, if remanufactured engines were rebuilt to comply with such federal standards, they should be considered ``new''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also opposed the proposed definition regarding imported vehicles and engines because the definition of ``new'' was different depending upon whether the nonroad engine was produced domestically or abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed definitions for ``new nonroad vehicles'' and ``new nonroad engines'' parallel the definitions of ``new motor vehicles'' and ``new motor vehicle engines'' in section 216 of the Clean Air Act. The definition of ``new'' proposed for imported nonroad engines was intended to address nonconforming engines which may become subject to federal emission requirements at the time the engine or vehicle is imported into the United States. The Agency has decided to delete this definition of ``new'' for imported engines. EPA agrees with the commenters that imports and domestic products should generally be treated alike for regulatory purposes. Today's rule treats domestic and imported nonroad engines the same way for purposes of determining whether they are new.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule establishes for the purpose of these federal regulations, a definition of ``new'' as it applies to all domestically manufactured and imported ``new nonroad engines,'' ``new nonroad vehicles,'' and ``new nonroad equipment.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  New nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment are defined as engines, vehicles, and equipment the equitable or legal title to which has not been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. The ultimate purchaser is defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such engine, vehicle, or equipment for purposes other than resale. For some engines, vehicles, or equipment the passage of title in the United States may not formally occur or manufacturers may retain title and lease the engines or equipment. In these cases, a domestic or imported nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad equipment will retain its status as ``new'' until such engine or vehicle is ``placed into service.'' An engine, vehicle, or equipment is considered ``placed into service'' when the engine, vehicle, or equipment is used for its functional purposes. EPA believes that the definition of new should include the ``placed into service'' addition to the motor vehicle definition of new found in section 216 of the Act because of the nature of the nonroad market. Nonroad engines, nonroad vehicles and nonroad equipment are often leased and maintained by the manufacturer well into the useful life of the nonroad equipment. A piece of equipment, the title of which has passed to the ultimate purchaser, should not be treated differently than a piece of equipment which is being used but has not yet passed to an ultimate purchaser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not provide a final definition of ``new'' for the purposes of determining the scope of preemption of state nonroad regulations under section 209(e). EPA shall finalize its definition of ``new'' as applied to preemption of state regulations in a later rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

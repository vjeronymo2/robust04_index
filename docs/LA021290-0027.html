			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVING HATE CRIMES DUE NOTICE  </P> <P> The federal government collects voluminous statistics on an abundance of  activities. Is there any need to extend that list by adding to it information  on the specific incidence of hate crimes? There is, because hate crimes are  indications of a social pathology that represents a clear and present danger to  public safety and welfare. Hate crimes seem to be on the rise, but no one knows  for sure because no comprehensive collection of data takes place. That will  soon be remedied. Both houses of Congress have now passed the Hate Crimes  Statistics Act. The measure has President Bush's support. Soon it should be  possible to get a clear understanding of just how widespread hate-related  incidents are.  </P> <P> Under the bill approved by the Senate last week -- the House passed a similar  version last June -- the attorney general would be required to keep statistics  on crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. Among  the crimes to be counted are murder, assault, arson, robbery, theft, threats  and vandalism. Reports on these crimes can easily be gathered by the Federal  Bureau of Investigation as part of its regular Uniform Crime Report survey of  nearly 16,000 law enforcement agencies. The bill has been strongly backed by  civil rights, ethnic and law enforcement organizations.  </P> <P> Hate crimes, the Justice Department noted in a 1988 report, "are far more  serious than comparable crimes that do not involve prejudice because they are  intended to intimidate an entire group." That point -- that hate crimes have a  multiplier effect, with a single incident capable of affecting many people --  is of supreme importance. Are hate crimes on the rise, and if so, what patterns  can be discerned, what groups in society might be most at risk? Before long,  thanks to this necessary legislation, law enforcement officials and the public  should begin to get some credible answers.  </P></p>

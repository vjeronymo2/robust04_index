			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 10 June, the government discussed  countermeasures related to the imposition of sanctions against  the North by holding a unification-national security policy  coordination meeting presided over by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime  minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the  secretariat for the North-South talks in Samchong-dong in Seoul.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who returned home yesterday,  gave a report on movements of the United States and China,  permanent members of the UN Security Council. An in-depth  discussion took place on ways to persuade China and Russia,  which are now showing passive attitudes, to impose sanctions.    Also, the government understood that the proposal put forth  yesterday by North Korea's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam for  accepting additional inspections of the nuclear facilities in  the Yongbyon area is surely an attempt to weaken the  international cooperative system. The government decided to  make further diplomatic efforts to make the countries concerned  understand this.    The government once again confirmed its position that the  sanctions against North Korea should be imposed in stages,  swiftly, and effectively, while checking up on ways for a  pangovernmental countermeasure in connection with the imposition  of sanctions.    In today's meeting, in particular, with the judgment that  the  current national security is being threatened, the government  discussed ways to solidify the national security system aimed at  preparing against all types of provocations by North Korea.</p>

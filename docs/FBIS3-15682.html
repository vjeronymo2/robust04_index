In her interview with  Interfax she expressed the opinion that supervisors had no right  to stage a press conference and give their assessment of the  elections having not informed the Central Elections commission  about their remarks beforehand.    At a press conference held in Almaty Tuesday representative  of the CSCE bureau on democratic institutes and human rights  Elizabeth Winship declared that the elections to the parliament  and local power bodies held in Kazakhstan March 7 do not  correspond to international legal norms.    At the same time Artamonova asserts, that during an official  reception staged after the press conference leader of the CSCE  delegation Jean van Nowling declared during his private  conversation with chairman of the Central Election Committee  Karatay Turysov that supervisors "have no special remarks."    Member of the Central Election Commission Talgatbek  Abaydildin also qualifies statements of foreign supervisors as  tactless. In his interview with Interfax he declared that one  cannot judge about the democratic standards observed at  elections in the whole republic basing on 3-4 facts of  violations.    Well-informed sources in Kazakhstan's leadership in Almaty  reported to Interfax that the republic's Foreign Ministry, in  particular, is examining a statement of the CSCE supervisors and  is going to present its answer in the near term.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLS WIFE, SELF IN FRONT OF SON  </P> <P> A woman was murdered by her estranged husband, who then shot and killed himself  in front of their 26-year-old son at a Chula Vista boatyard Sunday afternoon,  police said.  </P> <P> Mona McGee, 49, who lived in Los Angeles, where she managed a retirement home,  had come to the California Yacht Marina at 640 Marina Parkway, where her  husband, Charles Andrew McGee, 56, lived on a boat, authorities said.  </P> <P> She had come to retrieve some of her personal property, which she had finished  loading into her car when the shooting occurred at 12:22 p.m., said Patti  Holian, spokeswoman for the Chula Vista Police Department.  </P> <P> Holian said Mona McGee was talking to her son, whose name was not released,  "and by the son's description, there appeared to be no problem, until suddenly  the father opened fire on the mother, then shot himself. In other words, the  son said there was no obvious disagreement or problem until the shooting  erupted."  </P> <P> Mona McGee died at the scene, and Charles McGee was pronounced dead shortly  afterward at UC San Diego Medical Center, according to a spokesman for the San  Diego County coroner.  </P> <P> An autopsy on both will be performed today.  </P></p>

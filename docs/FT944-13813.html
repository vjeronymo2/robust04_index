			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / People: Campbell shows his colours at Courtaulds Gordon Campbell, 48, who has been running Courtaulds' fibres and chemicals business, has been appointed deputy chief executive (operations) and made responsible for the group's three main businesses. The directors responsible for these areas will, in future, report to him. Since the demerger in 1990, Courtaulds has reorganised its business from five divisions into three and Campbell's promotion is one of several changes as the international chemicals group completes the reorganisation of its management structure which began in February. Under the old regime, executives had been responsible for various parts of the world as well as various products. Under the new structure responsibilities for operations and development are being separated with a deputy chief executive responsible for each, and with geographic and business lines clarified. Eryl Morris, 51, who was responsible for coating and the Far East until earlier this year, has been appointed deputy chief executive (development) with responsibility for corporate development, planning and research. His brief includes responsibilities for all regions with opportunities for expansion - Far East, East Europe and Latin America. Neville Petersen, 54, who had been chief executive of Courtaulds' European coatings business, becomes responsible for the group's worldwide coatings operations and will have reporting to him the chief executives of the various overseas coatings businesses. David Wilkinson, 55, who joined Courtaulds in 1961, has been put in charge of the fibres business and will join the main Courtaulds board at the start of next year. Courtaulds has also made several changes to its senior management team below board level. Peter Fearn takes over as chief executive of the European coatings business next April and Bill McPherson is moving to Singapore to be chief executive of the Asia Pacific coatings business. Peter Rodgers is appointed chief executive of Courtaulds Chemicals from January 1 and will report to Gordon Campbell. Colin Welford is to take over as chief executive of Novaceta.</p>

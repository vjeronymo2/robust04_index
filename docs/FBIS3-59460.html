			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ranko Vaskovic: "The Multiparty System Contested </F> by Media"]    [Text] Although it still has not been defined as a state  under international law, nor has it been recognized as a new  state community under the political documents of the  international community now in effect, the Srpska republic [RS]  has all the attributes of statehood, manifested, first of all,  in the existence of the supreme political bodies, the Assembly  and the government, to which, of course, the functions of the RS  president are added. When it is taken into account that the new  Serbian state in Bosnia has its own government news agency, and  government radio and television as well, all the necessary  conditions have been met for the optimum functioning of a legal  and political community, which, to be frank, also has a very  strong army and police in addition to the institutions mentioned  already.    The news media, above all television and radio, impart  particular importance and features to everything that has been  said so far about the attributes of RS statehood, which were  brought about under the difficult reality of war, which has  persisted for nearly two years now. In singling out radio and  television, we did not mean to underestimate the importance and  role of the many publications operating on the territory of the  RS, but only to recall the special place they have in informing  the Serbian people. Recently, for instance, media interest in  the RS has been centered not only on the events of the war, but  also on the political activity of certain political parties,  above all the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS]. However, the  political activity of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], the  Socialist Party of the RS, and other parties, and indeed even  certain associations and political organizations not organized  as parties, is just as important. After all, the very fact that  during the birth and evolution of the new Serbian state a  multiparty system has grown up out of the social and political  stratification of the Serbian people, which is an essential  condition of parliamentary democracy, places a special imprint  on the upcoming democratic and multiparty elections in the RS,  which will be held when all the necessary conditions are brought  about. It should be emphasized that even the present Assembly of  the RS is a multiparty body, although the SDS has a sizable  majority.    The thaw in the activity of the political parties registered  in the RS has not been given proper weight or treatment in the  media, especially television. There is no doubt that this can be  seen when various news releases and reports are issued for the  public and are addressed to the Serbian people and thereby also  to the membership of the parties addressing them through the  media. The most recent example is the news item recently  broadcast from the television studio in Pale on the Second  Newscast concerning the news conference held by the Serbian  Radical Party in Banja Luka. The only message to the public from  the leadership of the Serbian Radicals of the RS reported from  that news conference in that news item was that the instruments  of the law-governed state are being applied more effectively on  the territory of the RS, and that is all! Can it be that nothing  more was said at that news conference of the SRS of the RS about  anything else happening in the RS? Did that party's leadership  really summon a sizable number of journalists just for one  sentence?! Nor are we inclined to believe that the leadership of  any party which intends to participate seriously in the  proceedings of the parliament of a state, and that would thereby  also apply to the leadership of the SRS of the RS, would dare to  send to the public by fax or other means of communication just  one sentence about its discussion with the newsmen. The costs of  such a project (!) would be much greater than the political  effect they might achieve by their presentation to the members  of the media. This is not an isolated case. A similar fate has  befallen news releases and reports issued from news conferences  of other political parties, except for the Serbian Democratic  Party, whose record so far on behalf of the RS has not been  challenged by anyone. But the way in which news releases of  other political parties are issued through the government news  media, especially RS Television, which beyond all doubt is the  one most watched and and the most influential, is not fair and  should be changed immediately. After all, a piece of news,  however important and subtly written, cannot have great value if  its broadcast time on television is reduced to a mere 20 seconds  or so!    The media neglect of the political activity of certain  political parties in the RS, whether the blockade by the leading  news media is deliberate or inadvertent, constitutes a negative  political legacy which thousands of Serbs belonging to various  political parties will be looking at in the upcoming election  campaigns in the RS. After all, the upcoming multiparty  elections in the Serbian republic Krajina and then in Serbia as  well, will have a strong political impact on overall political  events in the Srpska republic. And if there should be a  political solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near  future, one that is acceptable to all three nationalities  involved in the conflict, the scheduling of the first multiparty  and democratic elections in the RS will not be so far off.</p>

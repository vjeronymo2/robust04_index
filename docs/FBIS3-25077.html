"In Kinshasa, there is more  criticism of Monsengwo than Mobutu. Children throw stones at  his black limousine."    Olenghankoy is one of the leaders of a new generation of the  Zairian opposition--"young people who owe nothing to Mobutu," as  he puts it. Olenghankoy is also one of the people behind the  "dead city" protest action, with which the Sacred Union based  round Tshisekedi occasionally paralyzes Kinshasa. In addition,  Olenghankoy was one of the opposition negotiators in the talks  held at the end of last year and the start of this year with  Mobutu supporters on a new attempt at cohabitation.    That agreement was immediately misused by the Mobutu camp,  even though it had not even been ratified by the agreed  procedure. The High Council of the Republic, which took over  the role of provisional parliament from the National Conference,  was dissolved at the end of January and merged with the rival  Mobutu parliament to form a broader, new High Council. The  Tshisekedi supporters protest against what they see as this  illegal course of affairs, but they are taking part in the  discussions in the new council. They say an empty chair policy  would be counterproductive. Now, Archbishop Monsengwo is the  opposition's bogeyman. "Two Wednesdays ago, he called together  the old High Council, in his capacity as its president,"  Olenghankoy said. "He told us two things. First, if we did not  vote for the dissolution and expansion of the parliament that  Wednesday, then there would be an armed intervention by Mobutu  and we, members of the High Council, would be on welfare.  Second, he presented us with a list of the salaries to be paid  in the expanded High Council. Mobutu had agreed to a wage of  $3,000 a month for every member. Imagine: People who have never  seen $100 in their life are suddenly promised $3,000 a month. A  majority voted for the dissolution of the old Council in a  euphoric mood. Monsengwo knows the weak spots of the Zairian  politicians: Everyone is hungry and therefore virtually  everybody is for sale."  <H5>  The presidential term of office is over </H5>   And now? According to the Mobutu camp, the expanded council  must quickly appoint a new prime minister and, for the  president, that cannot be Tshisekedi. "Tshisekedi is the only  leader to be elected legitimately since Patrice Lumumba,"  Olenghankoy said. "He was appointed leader of the government  after debate in the National Conference and that decision was  never undone by the High Council. Mobutu has no claim on  legitimacy whatsoever: His former presidential term of office  ended long ago. Tshisekedi does not have to be elected again.  His position is not empty. The new High Council just has to  reconfirm its confidence in Tshisekedi and his government on the  basis of normal parliamentary rules."    If the politicians can be bought so easily, by Mobutu or  Monsengwo, then it should be impossible to achieve a majority  for Tshisekedi? "No," Olenghankoy said, "the prime minister  must come from the opposition, according to the agreement. And  the opposition still has a majority in the expanded High  Council, which now has 784 members. Mobutu has already tried  everything to break that majority, first in the National  Conference and then in the High Council. But every time it  really came down to it, he never succeeded in finding a majority  against Tshisekedi. Even those who are said to be behind Mobutu  only do so because of the money."    They call that "the politics of the stomach." Such politics  mean that it is difficult to see who is in the opposition and  who is not. "The real members of the opposition are those who  opposed the dictatorship in the years when the great majority of  our politicians still thought that Mobutuism would never end,"  Olenghankoy said. "Afterwards innumerable Mobutu supporters have  fled to the opposition -- while maintaining their corrupt way of  life, because it has become second nature to them. For me, they  are not really members of the opposition. And we fully  understand that many people round Tshisekedi continue to work  for Mobutu. But ultimately they will not dare to oppose  Tshisekedi. Because later the people will judge them in  elections."    In Kinshasa, Olenghankoy himself once went to disturb a  nighttime rendezvous between Monsengwo and a number of former  barons of the regime who called themselves members of the  opposition by day and conspired against Tshisekedi by night.  <H5>  Wriggling </H5>   He has unshakeable confidence in final victory. "The people  want peace and democracy, and the people will in the end win the  struggle against those who work for the status quo in Zaire,"  Olenghankoy said. "And the people are behind Tshisekedi. Our  most recent `dead city' protest in Kinshasa was a referendum for  Tshisekedi. Monsengwo can carry out his Vatican diplomacy, the  monseigneur can bargain and maneuver, but even he cannot beat  the people. Now even children understand that Monsengwo is  wriggling, and that he is disappointing the original faith of  the people."    "In popular districts there is so much criticism of him  that a support committee has been set up for the archbishop,"  Olenghankoy said. "It includes Karl-I-Bond -- who, when he was  still in the opposition, was Monsengwo's greatest opponent. Who  else is in that support committee? Every one of them has served  Mobutu: People who were indicted by name in the National  Conference's reports on the dishonestly acquired goods and  political assassinations. How can a priest, a representative of  god on Earth, permit himself to be supported by corrupt brutes?  And why do they support him? Because Monsengwo prevented the  National Conference from drawing conclusions from these reports  about corruption and repression. Within that committee, forces  are working together which should be opposed to one another like  day and night."  <H5>  Mobutuism </H5>   Once Olenghankoy got started, his tirade against Monsengwo  would not stop. "He always travels and acts alone," he said,  "without answering to the bodies of which he was or is  president, for the last three years. Nobody knows who he speaks  to or what about." Last week Monsengwo wrote a letter to the  troika -- the United States, France, and Belgium -- who together  are closely observing the developments in Zaire. They then  confirmed their unconditional faith in him, despite the  opposition in the Tshisekedi camp to the dissolution of the old  High Council. "Monsengwo is still managing to prevent our  partners from intervening resolutely," Olenghankoy said. "He is  deluding them that he is following a third way between Mobutu  and Tshisekedi, and that this way will ensure peace. In Zaire,  no one believes him any longer."    Olenghankoy also denied that the troika was slowly  distancing  itself from Tshisekedi. He has just returned from the United  States, where he had contacts at the very highest level. "And  the Americans continue to adopt a very strong position against  Mobutu," he said. "In their analyses they continue to attach  great importance to Zaire, which is the richest country in  Africa. The Americans know that Mobutu is no longer  safeguarding their interests, on the contrary, he is damaging  them."    "Mobutuism is like a virus which is spreading very rapidly,"  Olenghankoy said. "Now it has reached other parts of Africa.  It kills its victims quickly and on a massive scale -- quicker  than AIDS. Mobutu is creating trouble spots elsewhere in  Africa, to distract the world's attention from himself. The  Americans realize that. And the French also know that Mobutu is  in the way of their interests. We cannot complain at all about  Belgium: This country is fully backing up its conviction that  Zaire must free itself from Mobutu."  <H5>  Sacred belief </H5>   All good and well, Monsengwo can do nothing right -- but he  does not have an army at his disposal like Mobutu. And that  army is keeping Mobutu in power. Right? Olenghankoy laughs off  that line of reasoning. "To tell the truth," he said, "in the  past Mobutu could never count on his army. And now he can count  on it even less. He has no more than a small unit armed to the  teeth. The DSP [Special Presidential Division] is not behind  the president, in contrast to what people believe here.  However, there is a small unit in the DSP, called the dragons:  They are Mobutu's nephews, uncles and close relatives.  Virtually all the other parts of the army have been disarmed by  Mobutu."    "The Zairian army is the most ridiculous in the world -- and  the impoverished military understands that," Olenghankoy said.  "It is they who distribute our pamphlets. Nor are the security  services undivided supporters of the president. They pass their  information on to us as quickly as they pass it on to him. We  have never played with the idea of taking power by force, we  have chosen peaceful methods, but if the day comes when the  people revolts -- and that day is approaching -- then it will be  clear that Mobutu's army is useless. Even now he is virtually  in exile in his own country: He is hiding in his native  village, Gbadolite."    This sacred belief in the will of the people can surprise  someone observing from a distance. Haven't the Zairians  tolerated Mobutu for 30 years? And why should the starving  people be more resistant to the 'politics of the stomach' than  the politicians? "The people have a far more straightforward  way of thinking than the politicians," Olenghankoy said.  "Politics has become business, a form of prostitution: Many  people are hoping to make their fortune by choosing for or  against Mobutu. That is commerce. But the mass of the people  cannot be bought off. In the popular neighborhoods there is an  expression which is frequently heard: Dying is nothing, but  living under Mobutuism is to die every day."</p>

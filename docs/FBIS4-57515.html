			<p>BFN     [Text] Uruguayan Agriculture Minister Pedro Saravia has  said it is necessary to prevent the surfacing of new forms of  protectionism. He made this remark while opening a meeting of  the so-called Cairns Group, made up of 14 countries exporting  unsubsidized agricultural products. The discussions will be  held until tomorrow at the ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association] headquarters in Montevideo. Following are Dr. Pedro  Saravia's remarks:    [Begin Saravia recording] The negligible reductions in  export subsidies make us believe that this practice, which  particularly misrepresents the trade of agricultural and  livestock products, will continue limiting the development  possibilities of agriculture in our countries, at least the  mid-term development possibilities.    In our opinion, it is clear that the Cairns Group did not  achieve all the goals set when it was established.  Nevertheless, based on the fact that we did not fully achieve  our goals, it is necessary for the group to continue operating  in the pursuit of a freer and fairer international trade in  agricultural and livestock products.    Bearing this goal in mind, the group must remain alert and  active in order to secure full compliance with Article 20 of the  agricultural agreement on the pursuit of the reform process. We  must add the necessity of strengthening the advancements  achieved thus far to this mid-term necessity of substantially  reducing agricultural protectionism and subsidies.    Therefore, we now believe the Cairns Group must play an  active role in monitoring compliance with the commitments  entered during the Uruguay Round, in keeping alive the issue of  agricultural trade on the international agenda, and preventing  the surfacing of new forms of protectionism.    Dear colleagues, we understand that the Cairns Group played  an important role during the Uruguay Round, served national  interests, and in the future it must continue playing such a  significant role -- as it has been playing so far -- for the  benefit of the member states and the multilateral regulation of  agricultural trade. [end recording]    These were the words of Agriculture Minister Pedro Saravia.</p>

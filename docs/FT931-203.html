			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind plea for rotation of UN forces MR MALCOLM RIFKIND last night said forces for United Nations operations, such as in Bosnia, should alternate regularly between countries as he voiced alarm among ministers at the cost of Britain's overseas defence commitments. The defence secretary said the UN needed to find 'a better way of sharing the burden'. Countries should commit forces for a finite period with a clear understanding that they would then be replaced by an equivalent force from another country, he said. Speaking at a Tory Reform Group meeting in London, Mr Rifkind hinted that if Britain were to join a UN peace-keeping operation in Bosnia, the government would insist on such a rotation scheme being in place. He noted that UK forces have been in Cyprus for 30 years. His speech reflected concern among cabinet ministers at the financial and human costs of Britain's already-limited involvement in Bosnia, and their frustration at the apparent reluctance of other countries to become involved. Most Conservative MPs would resist any substantial expansion of the UK role in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has set out his concern at the implications of the UN's expanding operations. So far, however, lobbying among other countries for a change in UN procedures has been kept relatively low key. Mr Rifkind said his proposals would encourage other countries to join UN operations by ending their fears of being sucked into an open-ended commitment. He said Bosnia was 'a snapshot of the kind of hugely complex, politically fraught, multinational operation which will increasingly face us in the future. 'The dividing line between pure defence and humanitarian aims will become increasingly blurred, with important implications for public pressure on us to get involved.' Britain would need 'from time to time' to stand out against the use of force, Mr Rifkind said: 'We should not be coy about this - it seems to me entirely honest and defensible that we should avoid entanglement in a military operation which we believe is unwise or ill-conceived.'</p>

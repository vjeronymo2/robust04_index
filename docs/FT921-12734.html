			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Management: Why the American Challenge ran out of steam Whatever happened to Le Defi Americain? Twenty-five years ago, when some of us were only just starting to cut our teeth on the business world, this elegant French thesis about the coming supremacy of US multinationals over the Europeans was on everyone's lips. Within a few years, the doctrine - literally, 'The American Challenge'  - grew decidedly shaky, as European companies showed themselves remarkably resilient against their US rivals. By the mid-1970s, with a rampant Japan on the rise, it was dead. Unlike 1960s fashions in most other aspects of society today, it shows no sign of coming back into vogue. Disney is expanding in France, GE in Britain and eastern Europe, while Philip Morris is rumoured to be back on the European takeover warpath. But with the debacle of President Bush's trade mission to Japan coming hard on the heels of the latest travails of IBM and General Motors, it is evident to everyone that American big business is in deep competitive trouble - not just against Japan, but also vis-a-vis Europe. The trouble may be even deeper than most people realise. For the last five years, many American executives, economists and government policy-makers have consoled themselves with the results of a widely quoted 1987 study of international trade patterns. In essence, this showed that though the US share of world exports had declined between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s, exports from the overseas operations of US multinationals were enabling them to hold their overall share of world trade. Now, in a study guaranteed to make President Bush and many of his compatriots positively bilious, a US professor has concluded that the aggregate world share of very large American corporations has fallen far more sharply than is generally thought, especially since the mid-1980s. The study covers revenues from all sources, including domestic sales from local production, which were not examined by the 1987 report. It has just been published under the provocative title of Global Corporate Competition: is the large American firm an endangered species?* By analysing Fortune magazine's regular tables of top US and non-US companies, Lawrence Franko of the University of Massachusetts has compiled a set of global corporate 'Top 12' league tables for 15 separate industries from 1960 through to 1990. His tables show two things: how many companies headquartered in various countries appear in each industry's top 12; and, for that industry, each country's collective 'world market share' - defined as its percentage of the aggregate dollar sales revenues of the Top 12. To the obvious objection that exchange rate fluctuations may have distorted some of his results - notably for 1990 - Franko points out that the dollar was also weak at other times over the study period, including in 1980 and 1988. Takeovers and diversification beyond the strict bounds of a particular industry may also have distorted the rankings from time to time, as may the divestment programmes which have frequently followed such splurges. But Franko makes some adjustment for this. However, the overall downward US trend has been so sharp in most industries as to make most objections little more than marginal. US companies have held their 'world market share' of the professor's league tables since 1980 only in aerospace, food and beverages, and (almost) paper and paper products. In most cases, the main gainers have been Japan and Korea. But one European country or another has surged forward in motors (Germany), banking (France), food (Switzerland), iron and steel (Germany), paper (Sweden), pharmaceuticals (UK), and tyres (France). Does all this matter or is it just the expression of an increasingly international world economy, where the US share will fall inevitably as other nations build industrial prowess? Robert Reich, the influential US economist, argues that corporate nationality is of fast declining importance, since traditionally 'headquarters activities' such as research and development are becoming dispersed geographically within 'transnational' corporations. Franko contests this. The most highly skilled - and highly paid - jobs are still 'nearly universally located at headquarters' he claims. So is decision-making over such sensitive issues as multinational tax allocation. Franko may overstate slightly his case on the 'headquarters effect': in reality, research and development activities, together with other corporate decision-making jobs, are becoming quite widely dispersed in several of the companies which appear in his various Top 12s. But these are still the pathfinders: his general argument remains powerful. He is also right in rebutting hopes that smaller US companies - the likes of Apple and Microsoft, for example - may 'ride to the rescue of the nation'. During the last 30 years, the Japanese, Koreans and the Europeans have been performing this transformation more effectively than American counterparts, Franko concludes. Apart from the obvious observation that by no means all European countries - notably Britain - have been performing nearly as well as he implies, one can only concur with his judgment - and with his statement that the nationality of a company's ownership can still matter considerably. Not invariably, perhaps, but often enough to make it a cause for concern. So what price a late 1990s French tome called 'Le Defaut Americain'? The D-word has alternative meanings: 'shortcoming' and 'complete absence'. Take your pick. *Business Horizons journal, Nov-Dec 1991.</p>

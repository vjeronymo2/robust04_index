			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Birt launches big shake-up at BBC MR JOHN BIRT, the new director general of the BBC, yesterday embarked on a fundamental reorganisation of the corporation and its management, designed to improve its efficiency and accountability. The changes, Mr Birt promised, would make sure that in the 1990s the corporation would be able to 'build on its best programme traditions, enhance its creativity and absorb the best of contemporary management practice'. Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will become deputy director general with special responsibility for bringing together BBC World Service radio and television. He will also oversee a new directorate combining the corporation's resource, engineering and services departments. In the second big outside appointment, Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes at Channel 4, will become managing director of BBC Network Radio. She will also lead a year-long review to define the kind of programmes the BBC should produce. The corporation will also set up an annual performance review in every area to measure performance against stated targets, particularly for programmes. The blueprint for the future was produced after Mr Birt met with senior executives in both public and private sector industries. Mr Birt declined to discuss yesterday whether the BBC had repaid Channel 4 'golden handcuff' money paid to Ms Forgan to encourage her to stay at the channel. It is believed about Pounds 70,000 has been paid. Asked about overspending at BBC Television, Mr Birt repeated that Pounds 38m had been overspent in 1991-92 and his 'best guess' was that Pounds 21m might be overspent this year. Some senior BBC managers suggest the figure may be higher. The new plans include important changes to the way programmes are commissioned and made. For the first time channel controllers who commission and schedule programmes will be separated from the departments which produce them. Both will report to Mr Will Wyatt, who remains network television managing director. A study will also be held into the extent to which programme departments should unite radio and television programme making. Mr Birt said he believed 'bi-media' was the future of the BBC but judged it to be 'too far for one leap'. Analysis, Page 6 Editorial Comment; Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / MPs' motion on BCCI OPPOSITION MPs yesterday accused Touche Ross, liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, of showing 'no regard' for the future of corporate customers of the bank. In the latest in a series of parliamentary early day motions, 44 MPs focused on the case of Mone Bros, a small Leeds-based company, and charged Touche with 'dishonouring agreements and putting jobs at risk'. Having paid 'the full Pounds 250,000 agreed price for essential equipment,' the motion stated, Mone was told that this was to be 'confiscated by Touche Ross'.</p>

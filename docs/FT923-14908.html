			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Blood on their cheque books: Dominic Lawson asks why images of brutality are not considered pornographic LAST weekend I had someone killed for me. I didn't commission the killing but I have the uneasy feeling that a murder was carried out for my benefit. If you read the Sunday Times magazine then you, too, have had someone butchered for your benefit. The cover of last week's issue showed a young Burmese in the first throes of death. His mouth is opened wide with terror as another Burmese plunges a knife into his chest. It is said to be the killing of a government collaborator by a member of the Karen National Liberation Army. But this is not an incident of sudden violence snapped hastily by a photographer hiding out of sight. The man being butchered has had his arms tied to a tree. Somehow he has wrenched them round in a desperate effort to staunch the gush of blood as the blade slices through his chest cavity. The position of the killer is interesting. He is standing to the side of the victim as he thrusts and twists the knife. This means he cannot plunge the weapon in straight but it also means that he can give the photographer, one Bruce Haley, an unimpeded view of the execution. Inside the magazine, 'the executioner' - that is the only name given to him by the author of the blurb accompanying the pictures - is seen posing for the photographer, after carrying out his bespoke killing. Other pictures show the executioner punching his hog-tied victim in the face. The final picture in the series sees the executioner wiping his bloody blade over the all-but-eviscerated body of his victim. In its way, this is the most revealing photograph of all. The man with the camera must have been standing almost over the murderer as he finished off the job, judging from the angle and focus of the snap. I don't know whether the Sunday Times commissioned Bruce Haley to perform his part in this choreographed execution. The pictures are also attributed to an agency called 'Colorific]' which perhaps had sold these gory and undeniably 'colourific' prints to the highest bidder. Whatever the chain of events, a lot of people other than 'the executioner' have blood on their cheque books. It is a degrading process for all of them. And for all of us, the readers. For most men, I suspect, such pictures evoke disgust, first at the people responsible for showing them to us, but then, more awkwardly, at ourselves, because we are strangely compelled by the sight of acts of extreme violence and brutality. Thus, the first question those of us who have never served in the forces tend to ask those who have tends to be: 'Did you ever kill someone?' And if the answer is 'yes,' we then go on to demand all the gruesome details. That is why, I suppose, men like war films so much, although the Sunday Times pictures are to war films what snuff movies are to soft pornography. If the Sunday Times had published pornographic pictures as shocking as those it printed of the staged execution and evisceration of a Burmese teenager, then it would have been prosecuted for actions 'likely to deprave and corrupt.' It is trite but true that in Britain the pornography of sex is deemed unfit for public display, whereas violence has become mandatory prime-time viewing. The BBC has started a new series called '999' which, under the pretext of showing how the emergency services go about their work, offers us the gore to guarantee high ratings. In the first programme, I am told, there were featured a woman being filletted by a speed boat and a parachute instructor being strangled by his cord. There is, however, a difference between what the BBC is broadcasting and what the Sunday Times published. The BBC is showing accidents. The Sunday Times is in the business of deliberate acts of horror. As a newspaper it has taken the line, in the argument over Andrew Morton's book on royal marital difficulties, that by not preventing her friends from talking to the writer, the Princess of Wales has tacitly authorised their acts. In doing nothing to prevent the murder of a young man, is the Sunday Times's photographer tacitly authorising that act? Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.</p>

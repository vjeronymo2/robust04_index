			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS SAY DECISION HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE ON HIRING NEXT COACH  </P> <P> Amid conflicting reports, Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football  operations, insisted Monday that the Chargers have not targeted their next head  coach.  </P> <P> And, Ortmayer added, Charger owner Alex Spanos hasn't made up his mind yet. "If  he has," Ortmayer said, "he hasn't told me."  </P> <P> The three leading candidates to replace Al Saunders are Redskin assistant Dan  Henning, former Illinois and California Coach Mike White and Charger defensive  coordinator Ron Lynn.  </P> <P> Last week the word around the NFL was that White was the leading candidate  after New Orleans Coach Jim Mora and former 49ers Coach Bill Walsh made strong  endorsements in White's behalf. Player-agent Leigh Steinberg and two NFL  general managers said they expected White to be the choice.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, the pendulum swung in Henning's favor in Indianapolis at the  scouting combine workouts where representatives from all 28 teams watched  college seniors work out in preparation for the April draft. Ortmayer and  Henning were present at the workouts and talked each day.  </P> <P> Bruce Allen, the agent for Charger wide receiver Anthony Miller, said the word  in Indianapolis was that Henning would get the job. Allen was in Indianapolis  recruiting college seniors to be future clients.  </P> <P> But Ortmayer said Monday, "We haven't offered the job to anybody."  </P> <P> Bruce Allen is the son of former Ram and Redskin Coach George Allen. Bruce  Allen confirmed that his father has been consulting with Ortmayer during the  coaching search process.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said Monday that he hoped to have a selection by the end of this week.  One of the hang-ups is a business trip that has taken Spanos to New York.  Ortmayer said he will meet with Spanos before offering the job to anybody.  Spanos is expected back this week.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said the list of potential candidates has shortened to two or three  candidates. As late as last week, the list also contained the names of Bears'  running backs coach Johnny Roland and Charger assistants Wayne Sevier and Jerry  Rhome. He also said he had no plans to interview any new candidates.  </P> <P> The Chargers have been looking for a head coach since they fired Saunders Dec.  19. But Ortmayer dismissed the notion the Chargers have been tentative in their  search. He cited his "system" as the reason for the delay. He also pointed to  the need last week to draw up a list of 37 players to protect as part of the  league's effort to implement management's attempt at free agency.  </P> <P> Players not protected are unconditional free agents until April 1. Ortmayer  said the Chargers already have talked to agents and players that are  unconditional free agents. He said one of the players the Chargers are  interested in is Redskin offensive lineman Russ Grimm.  </P></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Buy-out proposed at closed colliery A management buy-out has been proposed at Hatfield colliery near Doncaster, British Coal confirmed yesterday. If successful, it would be the first in England during the current round of pit closures. A buy-out has also been proposed at Betws colliery in south Wales. Mr Jeff Ainley, Hatfield's pit manager, has written to Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, informing him of his interest in heading a management buy-out team for the pit. Hatfield employed 260 men when it closed on November 18, down from 450 a year earlier. The pit, sunk from 1911 to 1917, can produce coal for the domestic, industrial and power station markets. In 1992-93 its output was nearly 550,000 tonnes. From April 1993 to its closure, it lost more than Pounds 8m. British Coal said: 'If the management team at Hatfield pursue their interest to the tender stage their submission will be considered on the same criteria as all other applicants.' A total of 28 closed pits have been advertised for lease and licence, including four where the closing date for applications is January 21 - Littleton and Silverdale in Staffordshire, Frickley at Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and Hatfield. British Coal said it had received preliminary indications of interest for these four. Interest has also been expressed in the four pits advertised last month, for which the closing date was yesterday. These are Bentley near Doncaster, Calverton near Nottingham, Rufford near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear. All ceased production last year. British Coal would not identify the bidders. However, RJB Mining and Caledonian Mining are believed to have expressed interest in Wearmouth. RJB is also believed to be looking at several other pits.</p>

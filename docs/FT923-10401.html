			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: USF&amp;G improves sharply midway USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday managed a small Dollars 6m profit after tax in the three months to end-June, compared with a Dollars 56m loss in the same period a year earlier. This followed an equally slender profit in the first quarter, and takes the insurer's net profits for the first half to Dollars 10m - sharply improved on the Dollars 111m loss seen a year ago. The second-quarter profit was scored after realised gains on investments of Dollars 6m. Investment gains in the first half also totalled Dollars 6m. USF&amp;G said net profits from its property-casualty business reached Dollars 52m in the second quarter, against a loss of Dollars 44m a year earlier. This was attributed to improved loss experience and a better mix of business  -following decisions to pull out of certain markets and states. The result came despite larger-than-expected catastrophe losses, including the recent hailstorms and tornadoes in Kansas and Oklahoma. These have plagued the entire US property-casualty insurance sector. USF&amp;G's life insurance business made a small Dollars 1m loss after tax in the quarter, compared with a profit of Dollars 11m in 1991. The company blamed the result on lower sales, related 'to the depressed nature of the single premium deferred annuity market'.</p>

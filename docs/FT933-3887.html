			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Clinton reasserts superpower role PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asserted the US's willingness to assume the responsibility of world leadership in an effort to assuage doubts about America's view of its role as the sole remaining superpower. While acknowledging that the US had played a peripheral part in the secret negotiations that led to mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr Clinton said the deal offered an opportunity for an 'effort to reassert and define America's role in a very new world. 'We must develop a strong philosophy and a practical set of institutions that can permit us to follow our values and our interests and to work for a more humane and a more democratic world,' Mr Clinton said at a White House ceremony to announce that the US would resume contacts with the PLO. Since he took office Mr Clinton has not always been able to strike an effective balance between his desire to act multilaterally and his inability to push his allies in the directions he wishes to go. In Bosnia the US has tried to lead the UN and Nato towards a firmer policy against Serbian and Croatian aggression, but has backed off when confronted by European resistance. Mr Clinton yesterday asserted a compelling US interest in 'peace, the absence of oppression, the recognition of human rights - both on an individual and group basis - and, wherever possible, democracy. 'I believe that while we must work with our friends and neighbours and allies through multilateral organisations as much as possible, the leadership of the United States is still absolutely essential to bring many of these conflicts to a successful conclusion,' the president said. 'It is clear to me that for the foreseeable future we have a unique role which we must assume, and it is very much in our interest as well as consistent with our values to do it.'</p>

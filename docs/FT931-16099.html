			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Jakarta stocks dampened by Astra ownership crisis - Opinion is divided for 1993 On December 29, a dealer entered the Jakarta Stock Exchange, registered a crossing of 10m shares of Astra International in a Rp100bn (Dollars 49m) transaction, and walked out. The incident was an exception. Many brokers had no work at all during the Christmas period. The Jakarta market has been subdued in recent months. After rising 27 per cent in the first six months of 1992 to above 330 points, the composite index declined to end the year at 274, a 14 per cent gain but less than a Jakarta bank would pay for money on deposit. Trading volume, although slightly higher than 1991, averaged Dollars 13.2m a day last year while market capitalisation stood at Dollars 19.3bn. Falling interest rates have brought some cheer, but this is expected to have a mixed effect on corporate performance, since some companies rely on interest earnings for a substantial portion of their profits. Also, over the past two years, companies with higher gearing have increased their offshore borrowing, the costs of which are rising as foreign bankers express concern at Indonesia's Dollars 78bn international debt. An ownership crisis at Astra International, Indonesia's second largest group which accounts for about 10 per cent of the market's capitalisation, has also dampened investor enthusiasm. 'We have had strong sell orders. The only difficulty has been finding buyers,' notes one foreign broker. Brokers believe the crisis at Astra is close to being resolved but the company's share price, currently hovering at the Rp9,000 mark, would have to struggle to return to its mid-1992 support level of Rp13,000. Nevertheless, the stockbroking community has its optimists. 'We all thought about going home in November 1991 (repeat 1991) and then the market rallied,' says Mr Peter Arkell, head of research at Niaga Securities. He expects the index to reach 350 by the end of 1993. 'We are anticipating a cyclical bounce in the performance of the larger companies,' he explains, forecasting an 18.6 per cent increase in the market's earnings in 1993 following a small decline last year. The market also has its pessimists. Baring Securities forecasts earnings growth of just 3.2 per cent this year and advises only selective buying. Most brokers have adopted a downbeat view of the economy. Although inflation has been cut by one-third to about 6 per cent in the past 12 months and non-oil exports continue to grow at 20 per cent a year, investment is falling sharply. Economists are also concerned about the banking sector, the woes of which were highlighted last month when the central bank ordered the liquidation of Bank Summa, which had outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn. Brokers across the board are voicing their frustration at the management of the Jakarta Stock Exchange and Bapepam, the government's regulatory body. Last month Bapepam demanded that brokers acting as underwriters must get a bank guarantee to cover their potential obligations. 'It is the only market in the world where such a condition is imposed. Bapepam does not appear to understand markets or to take advice,' complains one local broker. While such rules frustrate brokers, they also complain of poor supervision of companies and inadequate disclosure. Last year saw a spate of internal acquisitions, whereby public companies bought private assets from their majority shareholders. 'Public shareholders are getting a raw deal and are receiving inadequate protection from the supervisory authorities,' says a senior analyst at one broking house. He believes that some internal acquisitions were conducted at inflated prices. It is only when looking farther into the future that brokers perk up. With a 185m population and economic growth of nearly 6 per cent a year, Indonesia is a large and potentially dynamic market. And while gloomy about the market's short-term outlook, even the pessimistic brokers consider some stocks as bargains. The foreign director of one broking house describes a particular mining stock as 'unbelievably good value. So good, I bought some for my father-in-law'.</p>

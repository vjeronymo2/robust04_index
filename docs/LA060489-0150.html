			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROLE OF TEACHERS  </P> <P> Recently I attended my eighth-grade daughter's Back-to-School Night at Sowers  Middle School in Huntington Beach. As I shook each teacher's hand and said how  much I appreciated her efforts, I began to realize how much I will miss these  wonderful people.  </P> <P> Through my daughter, I came to know her teachers so well. Mrs. Black shared her  love of reading and writing. She gave me a child who is anxious to share  another composition with positive comments and happy to read a book other than  a Nancy Drew mystery. Mrs. Wolfe, a very aware woman, gave me a daughter that  now races me to the first section of the newspaper each morning. Mrs. Hinds  used her background as a math student to help my daughter realize that advanced  math is indeed conquerable, even enjoyable. Mrs. Daly continued the science  department's traditions of fostering excellence in girls as much as in boys.  Mrs. Dominic shared her zeal for girls in sports and now we have a fine  volleyball player to cheer. As an aide for Mrs. Hayes, this lovely lady helped  my child realize that life is absolutely delightful. Each teacher routinely  made my daughter feel good about herself.  </P> <P> I like the stimulating young lady that these fine professionals send home to me  each afternoon. Through my daughter, I continue to learn. Over the last three  years, all her teachers have provided an environment and guidance that will  afford my daughter a lifetime of success. What they have given my child is  priceless.  </P> <P> JULIE BURNETT  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

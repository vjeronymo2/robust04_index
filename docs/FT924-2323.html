			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: This happy life ON THURSDAY morning I skidded into Gatwick on an overnight flight from Barbados. I had started in St Lucia - boat from Jalousie Plantation to Castries, then a hopper-flight to Bridgetown. By the time I reached Gatwick I was tired and dehydrated. But I was not cast down. Rather the opposite: I was gripped by cheerfulness, suffused by a pearly light. I do not eat on aircraft. Neither can I sleep. What I do is read, so I arranged my books around me. At present I am reading four books. All refreshingly middle-brow. Nothing stuck up about me. Yet I could not settle to any of them. Was I having a panic attack? Should someone tell the pilot? I reached for the sick-bag but in my confusion plucked up highlife, the in-flight magazine of the world's favourite airline. At once my pulse began to settle; my cells were drenched with lifeforce; I started to hum a hymn; I blessed the people around me. Have you seen highlife recently? In a time of sorrow and recession, of calamity and hideous schism, highlife shines a beacon to all the world's lost peoples. Do not think of it as a free-sheet devoted to peddling holidays. Think of it as evangelical, its message as bright as moonshine: We're enjoying a golden age, folks. We really, really are. Everything is upbeat in highlife. No place is a dump, for every place is beautiful. Poverty is almost unknown. Pollution is a fiction. Trade wars are a lie. No clouds dim the sky. Rivers run fast and pure. The planet is an Eden. No-one kills a dolphin. If we just reach out a hand, humming-birds alight on it and whistle a happy tune. To accomplish its sacred mission of spreading optimism and cheer, highlife does not dip in and out of the bran-tub of travel-writing cliches fastidiously or selectively: it welds them together half-a-mile at a time. In highlife, India is 'a land of infinite variety and complexity' with a 'rich architectural heritage, picturesque street life and extraordinary mosaic of cultures.' Goa has a 'curiously seductive identity.' Penang, in Malaysia, is a 'holiday playground' of 'swaying palm trees, great beaches, large swimming pools . . . lovely sunsets.' In Thailand, Phuket has 'magnificent beaches of soft golden sand, splendid scenery and rich coral and marine life.' Along the 'sun-blessed vacation coasts' of Kenya and Tanzania, the great cities of a now forgotten civilisation once flourished 'like a necklace of pearls strung out along the azure-fringed coast of East Africa.' Then there is the section of the magazine devoted to duty-free goods brought to us by discerning manufacturers whose elves and fairies have toiled all year to make this Christmas a memorable one. On Thursday I could have bought gallons of posh fragrance. Or a Raymond Weil Parsifal watch for Pounds 575. Or 57gm of 'skin caviar' for just Pounds 68. There is a woman I know who describes anything she does not like, anything that offends her eye, as 'pukey pukey.' Anything she does like  - a plate of peasant soup, a Tuscan hill at sundown, a dark-curled youth astride a red motor-scooter - is 'blissy blissy.' As my flight from Barbados shuddered towards sunrise and I read deeper into highlife, all I could mutter was 'blissy blissy,' like a toad in a honey vat, drowning but happy, confident of an after-life. The man who edits and publishes highlife is the redoubtable and inexhaustible William Davis, who is also chairman of the British Tourist Authority. What a cross he has to bear, what vicissitudes must test him, as he wages his campaign against pessimism, depression, fear, sadness, pre-millennial tension and malicious mis-representation of the joyful facts of life. Davis writes often to the newspapers. Nothing passes him by. Should a journalist misrepresent him, or fail to take him seriously, then swift is his retribution, his letters of rebuttal as unerring in their delivery as the spears of our ancestors into the eye of a shaggy mammoth. Bill Davis is worth the government and the opposition put together. No honour should be denied him. His salary should be tripled. He should live in a palace with a garden full of primroses. He is a giant of a man. Our hero. Our saviour. This afternoon I am catching Lithuanian Airlines' flight TE453 from Heathrow to Vilnius. Now that should be interesting.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: The Lex Column - Infallible guide to the 20th century At this time of year, we normally offer our readers a selection of stocks which might prosper in the next 12 months. This year, prompted by a period of holiday reflection, we hazard some general thoughts on how the markets might develop in the longer run. Peering into the 20th century, we believe that as methods of manufacture improve and market activity increases, the joint stock company is bound to occupy a larger place in the nation's economy. It also seems to us that the fashion for amalgamation, which has already swept together some of the most venerable names in British commerce, has further to run. Thus, it is difficult to believe that the brewing industry will long remain in so many hands. The most celebrated, such as Guinness, Bass and Whitbread, have a long history. But the nation can scarcely support them all. It would seem sensible for the two Scotch brewers, McEwan and Younger, to form common cause. They could even combine with their southern neighbour, Newcastle Breweries. As for local brewers such as Boddingtons, their continued independence is scarcely to be hoped for. Among the banks, there seems less scope for combination. It is hard to imagine proud institutions like London &amp; Midland or London &amp; Westminster submitting to a change of name. As with the brewers, though, there might be a case for Scotch banks combining. There seems little point in the small Caledonian population maintaining a Bank of Scotland and a Royal Bank of Scotland. This brings us to most daring of our speculations: that there might be amalgamation among railway stocks. Such is their importance to the markets that it is hard to conceive of losing famous names like the Hull &amp; Barnsley or the North Staffordshire. But a degree of merger may prove advantageous. It might even be possible to merge the Brighton with the Chatham &amp; Dover, or the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire with the Sheffield. But one prediction may be ventured with some confidence. Great industrial enterprises such as Babcock or Vickers, J &amp; P Coats or Nettlefold may come and go. One can even picture life without P &amp; O Navigation or the Savoy Hotel. But whatever happens, the railways will remain the commercial backbone of the country and the safest repository for the prudent investor's savings. With that thought, a happy and prosperous New Year to all our readers.</p>

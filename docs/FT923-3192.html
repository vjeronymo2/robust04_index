			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: ERM adjusts to the strain A WEEK may not be a long time in politics, but it is in the foreign exchange markets. Just over a week ago, at their meeting in Bath, European Community finance ministers announced their opposition to realignment. Now they have had to concede one. In Bath they also made loud calls for lower German interest rates. Now they have obtained them. Thus the 7 per cent devaluation of the Italian lira, combined with the Bundesbank's commitment to reduce German interest rates today, looks a sensible compromise. It is also the least that could have been done. Whether it proves enough depends on decisions still to be announced. That the authors of the volte face were Germany and Italy is not surprising, since these countries are probably the most relaxed about parity adjustments. Nevertheless, the deal is potentially dangerous, especially for Italy. Devaluation was probably unavoidable when short-term rates of interest had been driven to 15 per cent and the country may have lost more than half its reserves since the beginning of the summer. But devaluation will do little for economic growth in the short term and may not permit lower interest rates either. Licking their wounds at the loss they have just suffered as a result of the devaluation, creditors of the Italian state are likely to baulk at annual increases in their outstanding loans of 10 per cent of gross domestic product, or more. The Italian parliament must give Prime Minister Giuliano Amato emergency powers to impose budget stringency. If it refuses, it will have sown the wind. Italy will then reap the inflationary whirlwind. Credibility fears Germany too faces new dangers. For the ERM as a whole, much depends on whether the interest rate reduction apparently promised by the Bundesbank turns out to be notional, or substantial, and whether it looks like being the first of a series, or an isolated event. For countries such as the UK, or even France, significantly less pressure on parities demands the prospect of substantial and sustained cuts in German interest rates. But such cuts might damage the Bundesbank. The German central bank was evidently terrified of continuing the already costly short term intervention in support of the lira. But if the price it pays for lira realignment is premature cuts in domestic interest rates, its credibility could be impaired, especially after its recent reaffirmation of domestic monetary targeting. Such a weakening of the Bundesbank is in nobody's long run interests. Should German interest rate reductions be large, therefore, it will be still more imperative for the German government to make a serious - not, as now, largely fictitious - effort to limit the growing indebtedness of the German state. Boost to treaty The French government is naturally delighted at the prospect of lower German interest rates and hopes for lower French rates too. Less than a week before the referendum on the Maastricht treaty, such reductions might well tip the electoral scales. Even if French interest rates cannot be reduced at once, the government will be able to present the helpful stance of the Germans as an indication of the value of European co-operation, while warning that such cooperation would be threatened by a 'non'. If the scale and presentation of the German interest rate reduction is important for France, it is vital for the UK. First the floating of the Finnish markka, then the pressure on the Swedish krona and now, in the heart of the ERM, the parity of the lira is changed. The pound is likely to be next in the firing line. Should the German interest rate cut appear to be a token, pressure to raise UK interest rates, maybe sharply, could be severe. Especially with the Conservative party conference coming up soon, the government is bound to find the possibility of higher interest rates horrifying. But now that markets have been reminded that the ERM is a system of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, they are likely to draw the obvious conclusion for other currencies. The immediate UK problem is the level of interest rates, not the exchange rate against the D-Mark. But a small parity adjustment like that of Italy is most unlikely to help reduce interest rates. A government determined to stay in the ERM will have to do what is necessary, while hoping that what the Bundesbank does proves enough to save it from the higher interest rates it dreads.</p>

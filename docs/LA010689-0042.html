The gunmen, believed to be drug traffickers, also  threatened to kill one missionary for every Colombian extradited to the United  States to face drug charges, according to Hector Pardo of the Colombian  Evangelical Federations. Missionaries Richard Grover, 50, of Minneapolis, and  Roy Libby, 50, of Atlanta, were kidnaped Tuesday night in the southwestern  village of La Florida.  </P></p>

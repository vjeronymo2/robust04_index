			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAVERICKS OWNER TRYING TO END DANTLEY'S HOLDOUT  </P> <P> Though recently acquired Adrian Dantley still hasn't joined the Dallas  Mavericks, owner Donald Carter is trying to remain patient.  </P> <P> Carter flew to Washington Sunday night and met Dantley and his agent to discuss  when the team's newest player could join the Mavericks.  </P> <P> Carter and Dantley, along with Dantley's agent, David Falk, were still meeting  late Sunday night at a Washington hotel, where Carter went after flying in his  private plane to the nation's capital.  </P> <P> Carter refused to talk to the media after he arrived in Washington, but said  earlier he hoped that after their meeting Dantley would return with him to  Dallas on Carter's plane.  </P> <P> "We're his sixth team in the NBA and I can understand why he would want to meet  with the owner of the new team he is going to play for," Carter said.  </P> <P> Dantley, angered when the Detroit Pistons traded him to the Mavericks for Mark  Aguirre and a 1991 draft pick, has missed two games since the trade Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dantley is losing $15,000 for each game he misses.  </P> <P> The Mavericks also have been hurt by injuries.  </P> <P> Guard Derek Harper has a knee injury and will not play in tonight's game at San  Antonio.  </P> <P> Center Bill Wennington has a sprained ankle and did not play in Saturday  night's 105-94 loss to the Houston Rockets.  </P> <P> Forward Sam Perkins is bothered by a sore kneecap, and Brad Davis played  against the Rockets with a broken finger.  </P> <P> Rolando Blackman is playing with a splint on a broken finger.  </P> <P> Forward Roy Tarpley is undergoing treatment for drug abuse.  </P> <P> "We are hurting right now," Dallas Coach John MacLeod said. "We need Dantley  bad. I hope he gets here soon."  </P> <P> Without Dantley, Dallas has no proven scorer in its front line.  </P> <P> Terry Tyler, who started in Aguirre's small forward spot, scored only two  points against the Rockets. Detlef Schrempf, coming off the bench, had 11  points.  </P> <P> The Mavericks, contending for one of the eight playoff spots in the Western  Conference, are seventh, one game ahead of Portland and 1 1/2 games ahead of  Denver.  </P> <P> Dallas plays at San Antonio tonight.  </P></p>

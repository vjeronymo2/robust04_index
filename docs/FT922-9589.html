			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Smurfit pleased to see decline limited to 9% JEFFERSON SMURFIT, the Irish paper, packaging and financial services group, yesterday reported surprisingly good results for the year to January 31 1992. Pre-tax profits fell 9 per cent from IPounds 173m to IPounds 157.5m (Pounds 143.8m), on turnover of IPounds 1.23bn (Pounds 992.6m). Diluted earnings per share declined 6 per cent to 48.7p (52p), only the second time in a decade they have dropped. However, Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint deputy chairman, said: 'We are pleased and proud of these results given the market conditions. Of course, we are not happy with the reduction in earnings, but we have been doing better than everybody else, so we have a right to be pleased.' Mr Smurfit predicted that next year would be a strong one for the paper business. Sales growth last year had mainly been achieved through acquisitions and a 5 per cent rise in the value of the dollar. The group spent IPounds 50m on four acquisitions Operating profits increased in four of the five geographical regions. The one decline was caused by a collapse in prices in the US and Canada. Mr Smurfit said these businesses, which represented 10.5 per cent of turnover, had caused significant heartache. The timely restructuring of JSC/CCA in late 1989 had reduced the group's dependence on US earnings, he added. The price of linerboard in the US had recently fallen from Dollars 410 to Dollars 330 per tonne, said Mr Smurfit. Similarly, the price of newsprint had been in free-fall and had now reached about Dollars 100 a tonne. Recent attempts to push through price increases had failed. A final dividend is not proposed, leaving the 1991-92 total at 2.202p (5.05p); however, there will be a first interim of 4.872p (2.202p) for the current year. Mr Smurfit explained this was being done for tax reasons. Later in the year there will be a 1-for-1 scrip issue. The group had IPounds 919m in cash and no debt, said Mr Smurfit. These funds were not invested in Ireland. He said the group had plenty of investment opportunities, but it was unwilling to pay unrealistic prices for businesses. It was planned to expand in mainland Europe and have 10 per cent of the corrugated cardboard market, said Mr Smurfit. The group presently had about 3 per cent, with little presence in France and none in Germany. The group had written off its Pounds 15m investment in bonds issued by Brent Walker, the leisure group. Mr Smurfit said they may eventually be worth something, but it was better to reduce the uncertainty surrounding them.</p>

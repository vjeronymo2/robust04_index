			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Lebanese girls drowned after Syrian rocket fire capsized a boat packed with  refugees fleeing Lebanon's civil war. The boat was ferrying passengers from the  besieged Christian port of Juniyah to a Hovercraft bound for Cyprus when a  Syrian rocket battery opened fire. Crew members from the Hovercraft lowered  life rafts and picked up six passengers, while eight others were rescued by a  fishing boat. In Beirut, three people were killed and 18 wounded in duels  between Syrian and Christian forces and in clashes across the capital's  dividing Green Line.  </P></p>

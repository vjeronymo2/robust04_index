			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / BCCI auditors lose legal action PRICE Waterhouse yesterday failed in a court attempt to halt a disciplinary inquiry by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales into the firm's role as auditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed down two years ago. The High Court dismissed an application by partners in the firm who had sought to challenge the institute's decision to proceed with an inquiry while legal actions were still pending against the firm over handling of the BCCI accounts. They said the inquiry was unfair and could prejudice its ability to defend itself both before the inquiry and in court. Lord Justice Mann said Price Waterhouse co-ordinated BCCI's worldwide audits from June 1987. The withdrawal of BCCI's banking licences which led to the bank's demise in July 1991 followed a Price Waterhouse report which disclosed widespread fraud. Among the court actions pending against the firm are three UK actions by BCCI's liquidators claiming damages for negligence in connection with the 1985, 1986 and 1987 audits. There are also actual or possible proceedings in the US, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Sedley, said there was 'no real risk of injustice' which would entitle the court to intervene to prevent the performance in the public interest of an investigative procedure which was part of the institute's supervisory function.</p>

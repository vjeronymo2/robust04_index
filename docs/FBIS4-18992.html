			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elisa Wasch report on news conference by Iranian Foreign </F> Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in Austria on 11 April -- recorded;  Velayati statements in Persian with superimposed German  translation]    [Text] [Announcer] Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati is currently visiting Austria. Today he had a talk  with Foreign Minister Mock. According to the assessment of the  two ministers, the relations between Austria and Iran are very  good. After the talk, Foreign Minister Velayati gave a news  conference and Elisa Wasch asked him about the human rights  situation in Iran.    [Wasch] Iran is not precisely regarded as the supreme  guardian of human rights. The Iranian authorities persecute the  opponents of the Islamic regime with great severity.  Consequently, the UN Human Rights Commission has condemned  Iran. The United Nations specifically objects to the large  number of executions, the torture of prisoners, and the fact  that defendants are often unable to defend themselves in court.  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati is simply denying  that these human rights violations exist.    [Velayati] This is certainly not the truth. If the  Americans had solved their problems with us and if they had not  had any problems with us, we would certainly not have had such  problems as human rights violations and the Americans would not  have mentioned human rights violations in Iran.    Who does not know that very good U.S. allies in our region  are committing the worst human rights violations, which,  however, are not discussed -- for example, Israel? But this is  not mentioned anywhere.    [Wasch] Last year, the Iranian Government did not permit the  UN special envoy for human rights to enter the country. Asked  about the reason for this, Foreign Minister Velayati said:    [Velayati] We are convinced that he is a henchman of these  governments and that his position on this issue is not objective.    [Wasch] Writer Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to death in  Iran for his allegedly heretic book Satanic Verses, will be  honored in Austria in the near future. He will be awarded the  Austrian State Prize for European literature. However, Iranian  Foreign Minister Velayati does not believe that this will put a  strain on the relations between Austria and Iran. The Austrian  Government has nothing to do with the decision of the jury that  awarded the prize to Salman Rushdie, he said. However,  according to Velayati, it is not possible to set aside the death  sentence for Salman Rushdie. A religious sentence will always  remain valid, he said.</p>

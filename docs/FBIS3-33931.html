			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to United Nations 'Ali al-Hudayri </F> by Ashraf al-Faqiyy in Surt; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Faqiyy] At the Arab League Council's 98th  session the Arab states decided not to sign the Paris agreement  banning chemical weapons. But the Arab position changed a great  deal after most states signed the agreement. How can this be  explained?    [Al-Hudayri] The Arab states were subjected to pressures  from Western states, especially the United States, to force them  to join the agreement banning chemical and biological weapons.  The agreed Arab position was to sign the agreement provided  so-called "Israel" joins the agreement banning nuclear weapons.  Because it is unimaginable that the Arab states would sign the  agreement on chemical weapons while an entity in the region has  mass-destruction weapons.    [Al-Faqiyy] How do you explain the UN absence from the peace  process in the Middle East, especially as the resolutions  adopted by the Security Council are the basis of the peace  process?    [Al-Hudayri] Regrettably, Arab weakness and the lack of a  real vision enabling the Arabs to confront Western and Zionist  pressures have enabled the Western side to achieve victories,  especially in the so-called "Declaration of Principles  agreement," which was intended to approve the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, which does not achieve peace. The problem has never  been Gaza or Jericho. The problem lies basically in the Zionist  occupation of the Arab territories, the settlements, and the  annihilation campaign to which the Arab people in the occupied  territories are exposed. As for so-called Gaza-Jericho  agreement, it is no more than throwing dust in the eyes.    How can peace be established while all current talks are  obstructed by major disagreements among the negotiators over the  crossing points and controlling them, and while these talks also  do not lead to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state? What  is happening is a Western joke at the Arabs' expense. Some  naive people have accepted these arrangements for other reasons  which I cannot reveal.    What the Arab side accepted in the Gaza-Jericho agreement is  much less than what had originally been on offer. And I am  certain that if the Arab peoples realize the truth of the  matter, they will have a correct view that will be able to  change the course. All Arab states, including Libya, are for  peace. But Libya believes that peace should be based on justice  and the recovering of the Palestinian and Arab people's  legitimate rights in the Golan, the West Bank, and Lebanon.    [Al-Faqiyy] Do you have reservations about the Arab states'  positions on the implementation of Security Council resolutions  on Libya since the Lockerbie crisis began?    [Al-Hudayri] The pretext mentioned by some Arab states is  compliance with so-called international legitimacy, which has  been misused in an illegitimate manner. Despite the harm  inflicted on Arab interests and the Security Council  resolution's failure to take account of internal law, the Arab  states tend always to find the justification in that they do not  want to violate international legitimacy. Libya is completely  aware of the pressures to which the Arab states are exposed.  They find themselves in a weak position, and so cannot resist  or refuse to comply. The recent Security Council resolution,  that is Resolution 883, is considered interference in the Arab  states' internal affairs. Some Arab states have realized that,  and attempts are being made to stop encroachment on Arab  sovereignty.    [Al-Faqiyy] What is your opinion of French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe's saying that Libya is talking a lot but offering  nothing tangible in reality regarding the Lockerbie crisis?    [Al-Hudayri] Libya has always expressed its intention of  resolving the Lockerbie issue, especially as the Libyan people  are the one harmed most as a result of the sanctions imposed  since 15 April 1992. It is not in Libya's interests for these  sanctions to continue. We are eager to solve this problem as  soon as possible. We have offered numerous positive solutions  which, had they been accepted by the United States, Britain, and  France, would have helped to secure a solution. But lack of  desire on the Western states' part prevented that. If they were  serious, they would have accepted some of the proposals made by  Libya, which are based on respect for international legitimacy  and Libyan sovereignty, demand a fair trial for the suspects,  and refuse to allow the Libyan people to stand trial for no  crime they have committed.    [Al-Faqiyy] What new can Libya offer to find a solution?    [Al-Hudayri] Despite the clear injustice to which the Libyan  people are exposed as a result of the embargo imposed on them,  we will try with the three Western states to being an end to  this case. We are convinced that they do not want a solution,  as they have turned the Lockerbie case into a political issue.    [Al-Faqiyy] Do you believe that the Lockerbie case is  intended to change the entire Libyan regime?    [Al-Hudayri] The Libyan regime cannot be destroyed, because  it is not based on one or two figures who can be destroyed and  that would be the end of it. To do that, the Libyan people have  to be destroyed. It is the Libyan people alone who are entitled  to retain or replace the regime.    [Al-Faqiyy] Is there any link between former Libyan Foreign  Minister Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance in Cairo and the  Lockerbie case?    [Al-Hudayri] I have nothing to say in that connection.</p>

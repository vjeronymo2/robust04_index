			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALTOVISE DAVIS DENIES SHE IS IMPOVERISHED  </P> <P> Representatives of Altovise Davis, wife of the late entertainer Sammy Davis  Jr., has denied a report that her husband's debts have left her impoverished.  </P> <P> Sammy Davis died May 16 of throat cancer.  </P> <P> The denials apparently stem from a supermarket tabloid's report that grief and  impending poverty had driven Altovise Davis to attempt suicide.  </P> <P> "I'm prepared to document that Altovise is in fine shape emotionally and she is  in fine shape financially," San Francisco attorney Vasilios Choulos told  reporters.  </P> <P> Family representative Gary Frischer said she did not attend the press  conference because "she's busy right now on a project in Los Angeles." Choulos  said she is considering several "creative projects" on her life and her late  husband's.  </P> <P> Both men denied they were lending credence to the tabloid report by denying it.  "He who protests sort of accuses himself? Nothing could be further from the  truth," said Choulos.  </P> <P> Choulos acknowledged that Sammy Davis' prolific career and legendary generosity  created "all sorts of loose ends" financially, but he said the entertainer left  about $6 million to $8 million in real estate, jewelry, rare books and guns,  and insurance.  </P> <P> Recalling that he was quick to perform for others' benefit, Choulos said,  "Sammy probably gave away more than he ever made. A lot of people made money on  Sammy."  </P> <P> The Davis will, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, listed $2 million in  personal property and $2 million in real estate. The tabloid report quoted the  $4 million total, then claimed that sum would be consumed by debts, mortgages,  liens and bequests to friends.  </P></p>

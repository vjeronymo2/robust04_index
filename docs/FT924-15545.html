			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Chintz, swags, ribbon, bows: anything goes] THE REALLY good news is that if you are faced with blank walls and are wondering which which way the decorating wind is blowing, you can relax  - this is the year when almost anything goes. At this week's Decorex in London, the interior decorating world's version of the fashion world's catwalk shows where what style guru Peter York calls the 'chintz ladies and the obelisk boys' make free with the swags and the paint effects, there were enough styles on offer to cover almost every mood, from cool and minimalist to high baroque. There were room-sets left over from some other, lusher age - so awash with lavish fabrics, sumptuous bibelots and expensive finishing touches that one wondered where their creators had been these last few years. There were Gothic rooms and sweetly simple country rooms; there were baronial halls bedecked in tartan and sumptuous boudoirs; and every now and again there was something fresh that caught the eye. Crabtree Kitchens, for instance, had put together a kitchen (photographed right) which in spite being made up from the familiar traditional parts managed to look clean, fresh and new - a thoroughly grown-up kitchen, all sophisticated urbanity without an ancient curlicue or a false panel in sight. The cabinets have clean, simple lines and the hand-painted pewter finish (layers of black are rubbed down to reveal the silver base coat and the whole is finished with a protective lacquer) and dark green Corian marble top adds a sleek, metropolitan gloss. Polished chrome is used for the fittings - tee hinges, drawer pulls and hook latches. If your notion of a proper kitchen veers more towards the farmhouse than the chic, then it is worth noting that Crabtree Kitchens also has a Shaker, a Provencal and a some simple wooden versions. Crabtree Kitchens is at The Twickenham Centre, Norcutt Road, Twickenham, Middlesex TW2 6SR. Side by side with the new softened metropolitan look is, of course, our old friend the ethnic look. Rather the way in which new directions in fashion usually start with the big designer names and then filter down to the high-street, so it is in decorator-land. Way back in the mid-eighties, when most of us were drowning in chintz and faded grandeur was all the rage, a few of the prescient, avant-garde designers began playing with motifs gleaned from primitive pieces. Bonetti &amp; Garouste, a French design partnership, started it all by including African references, such as hide and horns, in their furniture. In the avant-garde interior fine porcelain and oil paintings made way for ancient artefacts and African masks. African colours like cream, brown and black began to predominate in interiors and strong primitive lines became the rage. David Gill's gallery at 60 Fulham Road, London, was a focal point for a lot of this new primitive work. Global Village, with its clever combination of Third World craftsmanship and Western sophistication, made the look available to those who had neither the time nor the know-how to cart tribal masks from Africa, low tables from Rajasthan, planters' chairs from Malaysia. When Habitat explored the ethnic look last autumn the new tribal mood really hit the high street. This autumn, Habitat has refined it further so anybody still looking for the component parts can find them at very accessible prices. There is plenty of cream and brown, there are wooden artefacts that look hand-turned, and wrought iron candelabra and hand-forged steel. There are traditionally-woven rugs from India, some exceedingly attractive, generously-sized pewter, brass and stone lampbases, driftwood frames and lots of rattan - that other essential for the right-on nineties home. Habitat's prices seem to me good - its very attractive range of checked cotton fabrics at Pounds 2.95 to Pounds 8.75 a metre are some of the best value I have come across. A large rough-looking (on purpose, you understand) painted cupboard is Pounds 399 while for Pounds 349 you could get a Carrara marble-topped table big enough to seat six. The catalogues are available now from Habitat stores and larger newsagents at Pounds 2.</p>

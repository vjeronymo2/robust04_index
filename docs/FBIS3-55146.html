INTERFAX has learned that during their 40-minute  conversation  they discussed concrete issues aimed at the strengthening and  development of the Commonwealth. They noted that by joint  efforts they would manage to overcome crisis phenomena and the  prolonged strip of failures in economic development experienced  by majority of countries.    During the meeting they paid great attention to the problems  of the Economic union. In particular, they pointed out that  there was still no legal basis for this union. The participants  of the talks stressed the necessity to speed up formation of  payment union in the multi-currency system and parallel  initializing of important documents to create a free trade  regime.    Korotchenya asked Yeltsin, who will chair the CIS in the  first half of 1994, to set forth proposals concerning creation  of inter-state structures to ensure activity of the economic  union.    Yeltsin and Korotchenya also discussed issues related to  practical implementation of the Collective Security Treaty.    On the eve of this meeting Korotchenya sent a letter to  Yeltsin in which he proposes to prolong the term granted to  heads of states to make a decision concerning formation of  collective peacemaking forces and their functioning which is to  expire on March 24, 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio to </F> business leaders; place and date not given; broadcast in  progress -- recorded]    [Text] ...from the strategic point of view of the  Presidency, it has not been a topic that has had any emphasis in  my government. It has not been a topic in which I have blindly  been determined to sign the peace agreement as my predecessor  unfortunately did. We do not want to give false expectations to  the population and encourage the guerrillas. That is what we  did in the past. I believe international positions support us,  and the government's peace plan is very clear in its objectives,  especially in the development of the process. It is not that we  are not in a hurry but, rather, we are not going to play to the  tune of the guerrillas, who want to stand out before the  international community. We believe, however, that the current  conditions, especially the unfortunate situation in Mexico, have  come to absolutely favor the situation in Guatemala.    I am going to travel to Mexico, possibly next month, because  I have received an invitation from President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari. I am taking advantage of this opportunity to tell you  that I expect all the support and cooperation from you because  we are going to [words indistinct]. In terms of economic  issues, I expect to bring a delegation that is totally prepared  to negotiate. Therefore, I expect support from you to enable us  to take a delegation that can negotiate and prepare the economic  future of this country with Mexico. The other goal is  political. Within this general goal we would like to talk about  the subversives in Mexico through the [words indistinct] and the  signature of the peace agreements, at least the conclusion of  the armed confrontation.    I am taking advantage of the fact that the most important  goal is not the conclusion of the armed confrontation but the  fight against poverty and the need to provide solutions to  economic and social demands. We have to provide solutions now,  at this time, as we are doing now through our participation and  through decentralization, not only by providing potable water  and electricity but by bringing hope because the people have  lost hope. This is why I have begun visiting the poorest and  most remote regions of the country. The president and the  government has to give hope to the country's productive sectors.  They must know that there is hope. Otherwise, we could face  the problems faced by Mexico, such as poverty and extreme  poverty. The demands made by the subversives and the groups in  southern Mexico should be resolved before it is too late.    I was telling you about how the government will conduct its  activities. But before this, I forgot to mention the other  objective, which is that of reconciliation and the fostering of  peace here in Guatemala. I have said it often in the interior  of the Republic. We are the only ones who can revolutionize  Guatemala, but it will be a moral and peaceful revolution.  Those who have remained here and those who have suffered the  effects of violence, poverty, extreme poverty, lack of security,  and its consequences have to work for a reconciliation, the  reconstruction of Guatemala, and the engendering of peace. This  is what I told you -- that we are determined to work for a  national peace plan as part of a process -- a process we hope  can be completed as soon as possible from a humanitarian point  of view. Nevertheless, from a strategic point of view, we are  in no hurry if it is to become an advantage for the subversives.  I told you that the five points I have mentioned will be to  consolidate democracy and the state of law, fight poverty,  increase production, protect the environment, and  institutionalize modernization through austerity, honesty, and  social participation.    As for the first topic -- the consolidation of democracy and  the state of law -- I can mention the modernization of  institutions, freedom of speech, free elections, balance of  powers, and the subordination of the Armed Forces to civilian  rule. These are things we can plainly mention. I say these  things in front of the Armed Forces, in front of the Guatemalan  Army. It is something that is understood, because there is a  clear concept that this is most advisable for the Army. [words  indistinct] for that institution and, therefore, for the  government and the Guatemalan nation. That is why we speak  about the subordination of the military to civilian rule, which  is a slow process, but a process that has already begun.    As for the fight against poverty, it includes access to  opportunities, the participation of the poor in social life, the  participation of the poor in political life, improvement of  markets, prevention of the creation of monopolies, protection  for workers, consumer protection, and better organization of  businesses. As for the preservation of the environment, we are  going to combine environmental policies with technology and use  resources to decrease poverty. As for modernization, we are  going to improve the state's management capabilities, and we are  going to work for efficient macroeconomic management,  encouragement of private investment, promotion of foreign  investment, and the country's advance into international markets.    I will not go into detail because I would be speaking for  too  long. Nevertheless, I would like to give a few examples. For  instance, in the field of government social policies, the  improvement of the government's working capacity, the  decentralization of public services, and the strengthening of  local governments will be priority concerns. The management of  hospitals by a board of trustees is a fact. This is a decision  made by this government. The state does not have enough funds  to efficiently run hospitals. Hospitals are poorly run and  there is corruption in the handling of hospitals. The solution  is to have a board of trustees run hospitals and oversee  privatizations. As for privatizations, fortunately this  government has no problems in preventing monopolies.  Privatizations are needed to make government enterprises more  efficient. It is a way to reduce the state's debt. This is how  I see it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Comment" by Contributing Editor Professor Withit </F> Mantaphon: "Thai-UN ties: From discourse to intercourse?"]    [Text] Any observer of the relations between Thailand and  the United Nations (UN) can probably pinpoint the fact that  politics and economics have been very much in the forefront of  their discourse in recent decades.    The Cambodian issue, particularly the process towards peace  between the warring factions, was the political agenda par  excellence throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. The issue of  free trade and the multilateral round of trade negotiations  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have  superseded that political agenda during the present decade.  There is no better testament to this than the more than 10,000  pages of key documents resulting from the Gatt negotiations  which will lead to the establishment of the new World Trade  Organization.    Has there been sufficient intercourse with other issues  beyond politics and economics?    There has been a gradual shift towards broadening the  relationship. For example, on a positive front, Thailand has  become more committed to environmental issues under the UN  umbrella. This orientation is seen in Thailand's own  participation in the concretization of international instruments  on the promotion and protection of the environment. These  include the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete  the ozone Layer, and the various treaties and declarations  resulting from the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and  Development. The latter include the Convention on Biological  Diversity and the Convention on Climate Change.    On another front, the issue of human rights, democracy and  development -- and their interrelationship -- have come more  strongly to the fore. This was evidenced by Thailand's  participation at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights held  in Vienna. Together with other countries, it adopted the World  Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights which called  for the adherence to and implementation of international human  rights standards at the local level, including effective  national mechanisms for the protection of human rights.    Yet, there are certain realities which undermine Thai-UN  relations. The shortcomings may be highlighted as follows:    1. In Thai foreign policy, there is inadequate emphasis on  democracy, and this is exemplified by its attitude towards the  political situation in Burma. Although the various forums of  the UN, including the UN Human Rights Commission, have called  for reversion to democracy and release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi  and other elected leaders in Burma, Thailand has preferred to  shun the issue of democracy in its relationship with Burma. It  has been more willing to accommodate the Burmese military junta  under the Thai and Asean policy of "constructive engagement"  rather than distance itself from that element of  authoritarianism and promote the cause of democracy.    This is a serious anomaly, as the present Thai Government  was  born of a democratic movement and owes its legitimacy to  democratic underpinnings in 1992. Morally, it is obliged to  uphold the flag of democracy internationally.    2. Foreign policy-making in Thai governmental circles tends  to be bureaucratic; it is not sufficiently participatory. The  presumption among key governmental entities is that it is they  who should shape policy-making and the interrelationship with  the UN.    Interestingly in several delegations sent to international  meetings, the composition of the delegates is drawn purely from  governmental circles rather than an admixture of people derived  from non-governmental and governmental settings. Non-state  actors, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the  business sector, community groups and concerned individuals, are  not sufficiently consulted and granted adequate attention. This  is particularly related to the question of access to and from  NGOs in setting the agenda for foreign policy, especially in  regard to life and death issues such as democracy, development,  human rights, the environment and peace.    Are there any public hearings/enquiries on foreign  policy-making, and if so, how transparent and accountable are  the authorities?    3. On many issues of concern to Thailand and the UN, the  response on the pan of the Thai authorities is reactive rather  than proactive. This is exemplified by the inadequate  participation of Thai representatives in several UN forums.    In the key setting of the UN Human Rights Commission,  Thailand is merely an observer rather than a full-fledged  delegate. This implies that events are likely to shape Thailand  rather than the reverse. This creates an imbalance, as the  response from the authorities tends to be too late, and negative  repercussions will ensure unnecessarily.    4. The policy at the national level is more curative than  preventive on many issues. For example, while Thailand  complains that it has many Burmese refugees on its soil, it  fails to deal sufficiently with the root causes of such  displacement, especially the undemocratic regime in power in  Burma, as part of preventive action.    Likewise, the recent debacle concerning 25,000 Cambodian  refugees who sought refuge on Thai territory to escape from  fighting between the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian government forces  in the Pailin area was a situation where international censure  could have been prevented. In pushing those refugees back to  Cambodia without international monitoring and transparency,  Thailand incurred the reprimand of the international community.  The damage could have been avoided if the authorities had  allowed the refugees to stay in Thailand temporarily and had  worked towards transparency of conduct in the search for humane  solutions.    5. The argument of national security and the executive  entities vested the powers to deal with national security issues  in Thailand are both obsolete. They are the ideological  vestiges of the Cold War days, which are imbued with vested  interests often aimed at self-perpetuation.    Precisely because foreign policy and Thai-UN relations are  at  times shaped by such obsolete residues, the Thai response to  several international issues is parochial rather than  international. A key example is the persistent argument used by  the parochial approach to claim that refugees are merely  "illegal immigrants" without rights in Thailand. This flies in  the face of the international perception of refugees, namely  those fleeing for well-founded fear of persecution and other  dangers in their country of origin, and the fact that refugees  have guaranteed international rights, such as the right not to  be pushed back to areas where they may fear persecution and  other dangers.    The international scenario has changed radically and the  notion of "security" now being advocated has to be based more  upon issues of human security, development, democracy, human  rights and peace.    6. Thai relations with the UN are still searching to grapple  with transnational issues, such as cross-frontier environmental  degradation, diseases (e.g. Aids), human rights violations,  criminality such as the sale and trafficking of women and  children for sexual purposes and armed conflicts. Evidently,  unilateral action does not suffice, and international  cooperation is a key to both prevention and cure.    However, precisely because Thai foreign policy is reactive  rather than proactive, the likelihood of damage looms large.    7. The Thai-UN relationship is more often than not bifocal;  it concentrates on politics and economics rather than a broader  range of social and other issues. The latter include the  concerns of marginalized groups, and the lack of equity and  social justice both locally and internationally. There is  inadequate attention for the issue of income distribution and  resource reallocation to help those who are poor and  peripheralized. Gender and racial discrimination also rears its  head in many circles, both national and international.    It is precisely this neglect that renders Thai foreign  policy  and its intercourse with the UN less than comprehensive.    For the future, the Thai-UN agenda should address the above  failings by underlining the following components:    -- democracy, development, environment, peace and human  rights as key underpinnings of Thai foreign policy,    -- a more participatory and pluralistic process for  formulating and disseminating foreign policy, especially with  the cooperation of non-state actors and the institution of  public hearings/enquiries,    -- a more proactive approach in and beyond the UN, as well  as more emphasis on preventive action and early-warning against  possible violations of international standards,    -- more accession to international treaties on human  rights and effective implementation of international standards  to counter undue nationalism and parochialism,    -- a more humane and people-centred vision of national and  international security, shunning the vestiges of the ideological  past,    -- a more effective response to and an agenda on  transnational issues,    -- a more concrete insertion of social and  non-political/economic issues in the priorities of foreign  policy.    The impact on Thai-UN relations can be reinforced by  activities within and beyond the UN as follows:    Multilateral level:    -- establishment of an agenda for peace and security with  a more people-based vision    -- adoption of an agenda for social development in a more  pluralistic setting    -- promotion of the linkage between democracy,  development, environment, peace and human rights, and  transnational action    Regional/sub-regional/bilateral levels:    -- incorporation of issues of social development, for  example a social development agenda, into all regional and other  forums that deal with economic, political, peace and security  issues (e.g. the Asean regional forum and Asean Free Trade Area,  and bilateral joint commissions)    -- establishment of independent and accessible human  rights system to prevent and remedy human rights abuses    -- enhancement of the linkage between democracy,  development, environment, peace and human rights in the national  and transnational setting    National/local levels:    -- establishment of human rights units in all government  ministries to promote human rights and its linkage with the  other issues noted above    -- adoption of national plans of action on human rights  and their linkage with other issues    -- institution of a national human rights mechanism which  is accessible, independent and transparent    With these orientations in mind, we can work towards  ensuring  that the discourse is not relegated to the realm of lip  services, and that it becomes a forward-looking interaction well  into next century.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS PRESS CASE FOR OWL  </P> <P> Environmentalists told senior advisers to President Bush on Friday that the  timber industry has grossly exaggerated the economic impact of proposals to  save the Northwest's northern spotted owl from extinction.  </P> <P> The White House officials who heard the environmentalists' story Friday had  heard from the timber industry the day before.  </P> <P> The Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to declare the northern spotted owl a  threatened species next week, a move that probably will require that vast  tracts of land be set aside for habitat protection, which will result in severe  reductions in timber harvests.  </P> <P> Larry Tuttle, director of the Wilderness Society of Oregon, said the  environmentalists were "very encouraged" by the tone of the White House  meeting.  </P> <P> "It gave us a chance to debunk some of the numbers that the timber industry has  been using to support their case. Clearly, they are using worst case numbers  and, in some cases, worse than that," he said.  </P> <P> A panel of government scientists said in April that 8.4 million acres of  forests must be set aside to ensure that the owl will survive.  </P></p>

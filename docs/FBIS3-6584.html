			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of  the National Unification Board, released a statement to the  North this afternoon in connection with the breakup [kyollyol]  of the eighth North-South working-level contact. In the  statement, he said that North Korea's unilateral breakup of the  working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys is an  act of turning a blind eye to our efforts for dialogue for the  resolution of the nuclear issue and the international efforts  toward that end and that it is unacceptable and cannot be  justified with any excuse.    In today's statement, Deputy Prime Minister Yi also said  that  contrary to our patient efforts, North Korea had consistently  maintained an attitude of delaying or avoiding the adoption of  the agreement for the exchange of special envoys and gone,  finally, so far as to reject the contact itself, stating that it  does not hesitate to wage a war. He also said that North Korea  had been leading the situation to a serious phase.    He added that our position to peacefully resolve the nuclear  issue remained unchanged and that the government would explore  all means possible, while maintaining close international  cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue.    He also urged North Korea to be keenly aware of the  situation  facing it at home and abroad at present and assume a correct  attitude at an early date to resume the dialogue to resolve the  nuclear issue.</p>

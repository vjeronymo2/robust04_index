			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, a conforming amendment is adopted to the ancillary importation regulation on registered importers, part 592.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule is effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . NHTSA notes that without this amendment to permit a continuous entry bond, RIs and their customers will be unable to import nonconforming vehicles pursuant to 49 CFR 591.5(f). Therefore, NHTSA finds that the issuance of this notice without prior opportunity for comment is necessary in view of the difficulties that unexpectedly began to occur recently and would continue to occur were part 591 not amended. The agency also finds for good cause that it is in the public interest to establish an immediate effective date for the amendments made by this notice. In the absence of an immediate effective date, RIs would be unable to continue importing vehicles from Canada and other countries. The amendments impose no new requirements but instead provides an alternative to an existing requirement, whose continued viability is doubtful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice was not reviewed under EO 12866. After considering the impacts of this rulemaking action, NHTSA has determined that the action is not significant within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It amends an existing requirement to afford RIs an alternative method of providing a bond for imported nonconforming vehicles. The number of RIs affected is less than 20. The cost impacts of this regulatory action are cost savings to the RIs in procuring bonds (an estimated $20 per vehicle), and nonquantifiable cost savings in the paper work involved to obtain single-entry bonds. The impacts are so minimal as not to warrant the preparation of a full regulatory evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has also considered the effects of this action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this action would not have a significant economic impact upon ``a substantial number of small entities,'' but it will have a significant economic impact upon RIs, which number less than 20, and which are small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This action appears required to allow them to continue in business. Governmental jurisdictions will not be affected at all since they are generally neither importers nor purchasers of nonconforming imported motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 ``Federalism'' and determined that the action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The action will not have a significant effect upon the environment because it is anticipated that the annual volume of motor vehicles imported will not vary significantly from that existing before promulgation of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim final rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the interim final rule. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

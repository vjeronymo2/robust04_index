			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Granada in active session RESULTS well ahead of even the most optimistic forecasts sent shares in Granada ahead, stimulating good, two-way business as the recent surge in the shares opened the way for some profit-taking. The shares had jumped up 30 at one stage in before falling back, one line of 2.7m being sold into the market at 330p and placed immediately at 332p, in late trading. They closed at 334p, a rise of 25 on the day. Profit forecasts for the current year were upgraded to a range of Pounds 150m to Pounds 165m. Smith New Court was one of a number of houses to turn positive on the stock. The results, mostly achieved through rationalisation and efficiency measures, again raised questions over Granada's strategy in maintaining earnings growth. However, Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett, joint brokers to the group, said that acquisitions were not an urgent need and he predicted reputable profits growth over the next two years. Others were less sure. Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest said: 'We believe that the need for an acquisition to propel long-term earnings growth is a real one.' Possible targets touted in the market ranged from other television groups, which the Granada management is said to be acknowledging as a matter of 'not if, but when', to catering companies. With a counter bid for Gardner Merchant, the Forte catering subsidiary, all but ruled out (an imminent announcement is expected that Forte has sold it to its management), Sutcliff Catering, owned by P&amp;O, may be a target. Tarmac alert Housebuilder and building materials group Tarmac resumed its position as one of the market's favourite takeover plays. BTR, the conglomerate was widely tipped as a potential predator There was more intrigue for the market when Cazenove, the broking house was said to have been a keen buyer of Tarmac Cazenove is broker to BTR, but also to Tarmac. The shares sped up 6 to 96p, after 97p on turnover of 12m, the heaviest single day's activity since late September. Takeover stories have surrounded Tarmac for many months. Minorco, the overseas arm of the Harry Oppenheimer group of companies, was widely rumoured as a potential bidder for Tarmac earlier this year. Tarmac's building materials operations were seen as the star attraction. In the late 1980's Minorco launched an ultimately unsuccessful bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, the mining group. More recently, however, the market has warmed to the acquisition by Tarmac of the previously government-owned Property Services Agency. GEC displeases The market gave a decided 'thumbs-down' to GEC shares after the group delivered a 3 per cent increase in half-year profits and a 5.1 per cent rise in the interim dividend. Both figures were at the top end of the market range, but failed to please some of the super-optimists. 'The headline number was a shade below the figure the market was going for, but it was certainly not disappointing, nor was the dividend,' said one specialist who believed the market had 'simply got over-excited.' Analysts quietly trimmed estimates for full year profits from the Pounds 860m-plus pencilled in ahead of yesterday's figures to around Pounds 840m. GEC shares settled 9 off at 263p on disappointing turnover of 6.3m. Dull figures from Bass coupled with a cautious statement sent the shares into retreat and the shares slipped 15 to 585p. The market had hoped for some positive news on the hotel and leisure sector, but the company remained reticent. Although the Holiday Inn division was said to be improving in a difficult market, discussions with Queens Moat Houses over extending the two groups' interests produced little comment from Bass management. Queens Moat shares slipped 1 1/2 to 44p. Analysts suggested that Bass was discussing potential deals with other, mostly US hotel groups, and that a deal over extending the Holiday Inn flag was still alive. The cautious Bass comment sent shares in Scottish and Newcastle tumbling 8 to 413p. Prudential took its stake in Vaux, the hotel and brewery group, below 3 per cent. The shares shaved a penny to 206p. Whitbread Investment Company took its holding in Greene King to 6.5 per cent, the shares adding 2 to 470p. There was further severe punishment for HSBC shares after the latest slide by shares on the Hong Kong market. HSBC plunged a further 22 to 480p in London yesterday with dealers highlighting the exceptionally high level of turnover in the stock - 22m shares - which they said indicated unusually large selling pressure. Standard Chartered closed 15 off at 528p. Barclays benefited from switching from HSBC and Standard, the shares moving up 6 to 388p on 9.5m traded. Merchant banks with marketmaking activities rose sharply, with institutions aware that recent record performances by the equity market could well mean good profits for dealing firms. But there were hints that more job losses could be in the pipeline. SG Warburg settled 10 firmer at 496p and Kleinwort Benson rose the same amount to 289p. The prospect of an avalanche of claims arising from the floods affecting the UK, hit the composite insurance stocks. Commercial Union fell 15 to 607p, General Accident 13 to 588p, Guardian Royal 6 to 177p and Royal 12 to 265p. Sun Alliance settled 10 down at 336p. A switch out of BOC, down 15 at 758p, and into ICI was said to be being advised by Smith New Court. ICI shares rose 14 to 1027p. A weak US dollar depressed many drug stocks. Profit-taking also affected Wellcome leaving the shares 20 adrift at 1042p. Reports that the ministry of defence had signed a memorandum of understanding with Kuwait for the UK to supply defence equipment caused a late run in GKN. The shares jumped 15 to 419p. The company is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries of such a deal through the supply of the Warrior and Piranha armoured vehicles. One analyst speculated that such a deal may be worth as much as Pounds 750m to GKN. The availability of a sizeable line of stock was said to have been the reason for the early decline of P&amp;O. The stock was later reported to have been been cleared but sentiment remained depressed by a sell recommendation from Yamaichi. The shares closed 6 off at 491p. US buying helped Tiphook bounce 30 to 305p. Bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries with GEC being the new name among possible predators. The shares jumped 10 134p. BTR has also in recent weeks been mentioned as a possible bidder for Lucas. US buying was reported in Rolls-Royce where the shares firmed 2 to 104p, in trade of 4.7m. FR Group were wanted and the shares jumped 9 to 200p. A positive recommendation from SG Warburg helped T&amp;N add 9 to 147p, though the broker was said to be negative on Kwik-Fit which caused the shares to give up 8 to 94p. Speculation that Vickers may soon win a tank order from the Middle East caused the shares to firm 5 to 89p. Shares in Booker advanced 26 to 370p as James Capel was reported to be recommending the stock. News of slightly disappointing new connection figures for November at Vodafone, the cellular phones group, were behind the 9 drop in Vodafone shares to 397p on turnover of 2.9m. Telecoms specialists said the new 'Lowcall' sales initiative, which promotes a new low rental tariff, had proved a disappointment with 'Lowcall' subscribers of 16,500 said to have been made up of 8,500 brand new customers and 7,500 customers shifting to 'Lowcall' from the existing Vodafone system. MicroFocus continued their excellent recent performance, adding 50 more at 2658p while there was further discreet support for Scholes Group which moved up 9 to 119p. US buying of Sears helped the shares advance 4 to 96p with 9.8m traded. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (55).

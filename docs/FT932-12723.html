			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF warns UK of tax rise or cut in spending BRITAIN will have to increase taxes or cut spending to curb its growing government deficit, possibly as early as this year, the International Monetary Fund warns in its latest World Economic Outlook, published yesterday. The fund also suggests that Britain might have trouble in meeting its inflation target next year. The IMF's message is the starkest warning since the recent signs of a return to growth in the UK economy that the recovery might be blown off course by either a continuation of large fiscal deficits or rapidly rising prices. The IMF has also slashed its growth projection for the European Community this year to 0.1 per cent. In its last outlook, published in October, the IMF said EC growth would be 2.3 per cent in 1993. The report says the sustainability of the UK recovery 'will depend on the (UK) authorities' ability to safeguard the credibility of their anti-inflationary commitment, especially in the light of the potentially inflationary consequences of sterling's decline (since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism)'. The recovery 'in turn depends critically on the adoption of further measures, in the 1994 budget or even before, to secure a faster reduction of the large budget deficit'. Any further cuts in UK interest rates 'should be resisted', the report continues, unless there is good reason to believe inflation is under control. However, UK economic prospects for 1993 have 'improved', with the likelihood that recovery will be 'firmly established' by next year. Gross domestic product is thought likely to expand by 1.4 per cent this year, and by 3.1 per cent next year. The gap between government spending and income is put at 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product last year, rising to a likely 8.8 per cent this year and falling slightly to 7.7 per cent in 1994. The deficit will still be 3.8 per cent of GDP in 1998 on current policies, the IMF calculates. The IMF reckons the retail prices index, minus mortgage costs, will rise by 3.9 per cent this year, against 4.7 per cent last year, and rise to 4 per cent in 1994. Action for expansion, Page 6</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Haitian MPs to rule on premier THE Haitian parliament is to decide whether it will accept the head of the country's small communist party as an interim prime minister, in moves to clear the way for a return to the country and to power of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was overthrown and sent into exile by the army in September. Although Mr Rene Theodore, the communist leader and a critic of Father Aristide, has said he will accept the post, many legislators, and the army leaders, continue to have reservations about any moves leading to the return of the president. Mr Theodore has been accepted as a compromise candidate by Fr Aristide and the Organisation of American States. Mr Theodore has said, however, that his acceptance of the post is conditional on the lifting of a trade embargo imposed on Haiti after the coup by OAS members and several European countries. His position thus supports that of the military. Mr Theodore has said he cannot set any dates for the return of the president, suggesting that he would have to be guided, perhaps by the country's military leaders. The OAS has maintained that the president must be back in office before trade is reopened. But diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, and Washington, said yesterday that the OAS was likely to be flexible, and would be willing to consider a phased removal of sanctions when there were clear signs that Fr Aristide would be allowed to return. The army, which will have the final say, is concerned about the impact of Fr Aristide's return. He has said that junior officers involved in the coup were following orders, but their commanders would be tried or exiled. The military and Haiti's small elite also fear that the return of the populist politician would embolden his many poor supporters to act against those who staged and supported the coup.</p>

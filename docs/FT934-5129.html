			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: 'Son of BES' to boost investment - Small companies The chancellor has attempted to stimulate equity investment in small companies by setting up a successor to the controversial Business Expansion Scheme (BES), and proposing a new scheme to encourage venture capital investments. His measures were welcomed by banks that have provided the overdraft and short-term debt finance which has been used as a substitute for equity by small companies. Many had called for the chancellor to devise a 'son of BES' scheme. The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) announced in the Budget will follow the BES in offering income tax relief on equity investments in unquoted trading companies, but will exclude investments in private rented housing. The BES, which is due to end in December, was originally limited in the same manner, but became discredited after it was extended in 1988 to private rented housing schemes, and turned largely into a tax avoidance vehicle. It will also include a measure to encourage 'business angels' who introduce finance to small companies by letting them become paid directors of the companies they invest in without losing tax relief. Mr Clarke's second measure to encourage equity investment - following criticism from banks and small business groups that small companies are too dependent on short-term finance - is to encourage a new form of venture capital trust. He is to issue a consultation paper in the new year which will propose a new type of investment trust that would invest a big proportion of assets in unquoted companies. Investors would gain tax relief on dividends and capital gains. Mr Clarke emphasised in his speech that the venture capital trust would allow investors to limit the risk of investing in what is traditionally an unstable market by diversifying their risk across a portfolio of small companies. The EIS will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent up to a maximum of Pounds 100,000 a year and companies will be able to raise up to Pounds 1m a year. The Exchequer estimated that EIS would cost Pounds 10m in the next financial year.</p>

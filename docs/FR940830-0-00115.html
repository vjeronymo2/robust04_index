			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment said that paragraph (b) did not adequately explain that failure to file complete information under the referenced sections is not automatically fatal, but is curable by means of submittal of the information in response to a notice from the authorized officer asking for it. The paragraph clearly says that this failure is curable, and no amendment is considered necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment said that paragraph (c) did not reflect the case law regarding on whom BLM must serve notice. It cited an Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) decision to support its position. The IBLA decision in question directed BLM to look at assessment affidavits in order to help determine the last address of record for an owner. This paragraph, however, merely deals with determining who is the owner of a claim, not where he or she lives. Therefore, it does not run afoul of the cited decision of IBLA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 3833.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment requested that a change be made to paragraph (d) to allow for an additional method of service within this subpart. This change cannot be made in the final rule because it was not proposed in the May 11, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication. Substantive changes may not be made in regulations, absent emergency circumstances, without providing opportunity for public comment on the proposed changes. 5 U.S.C. 553. The BLM will give consideration to this request to determine whether additional methods of service are warranted and should be adopted by future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 3851.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments asked whether mill or tunnel sites should be added in the co-ownership provisions of this section. The answer is yes, and sites have been added to this section in this final rule to clarify the rights and responsibilities of co-owners of these sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Pune, April 28--The chief election commissioner, Mr  T.N. Seshan, said today he will strictly enforce the Rs 1.5-lakh  ceiling on election expenses of a candidate and threatened  political parties and their candidates with invoking Indian  Penal Code [IPC] if they attempted to circumvent the ceiling,  reports PTI.    Mr Seshan told representatives of political parties here  that  the IPC section 171(H) prohibited expenses of more than Rs 10 by  "anybody," a term, he said, which included political parties  too, on behalf of the candidate without the candidate's consent.    "And if the candidate gives his consent for such expenses,  those expenses would be included in his election expenses for  which the ceiling under the Representation of People's Act (RPA)  section 77 is Rs 1.5 lakh," he said, warning that exceeding the  ceiling would mean villation of the RPA.    Mr Seshan described the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling as a "joke,  which  needs either to be increased or abolished," but nevertheless he  asserted its strict implementation since the provision was  enacted by Parliament.    He is on a three-day visit to supervise poll preparations in  the Ahmednagar and Baramati Lok Sabha constituencies.    Mr Seshan, in response to a suggestion by a political  leader,  said a decision on the proposal to provide polling slips to  voters either by the government or by the election commission  itself would be taken by May 2.    He said there was no ban on candidates going to religious  places but "direct or indirect political propaganda" inside such  places of worship was liable for penal action.    Mr Seshan welcomed a suggestion to appoint an observer  during  elections to monitor use of religion for political gain.    The entire election process will be video-taped which would  make it easy to detect violation of model code of conduct for  elections by political parties and candidates.    He directed the district election machinery to widely  advertise through newspapers for knowledge of voters that all  ballots would be mixed together before counting as a step to  protect the identity of voters and prevent post-election  intimidation.    The election commission would send 600 central police  personnel to assist the local administration during the polling.    Among those who attended the meeting were the Congress  leaders, Bapusaheb Thite, who would be the party's candidate for  the Baramati by-election, a Congress MP [member of Parliament],  Mr Vidura Navale, the district Congress president, Mr Krishnarao  Bhegade, the Janata Dal leader, Mr Shambhajirao Kakade, among  others.    Mr Seshan also denied reports that he allegedly "snubbed"  the  Congress MP from Kopargaon, Mr Shankarrao Kale, at the meeting  with representatives of political parties at Ahmednagar  yesterday.    "I did not know that he is a MP," Mr Seshan told political  leaders who met him here while denying that he humiliated Mr  Kale whom he described as a senior parliamentarian.    "Join a political party and I will talk to you," is how Mr  Seshan dismissed a journalist who wanted to elicit more  information on the election process.    "I have lost confidence in the press," he told journalists.    Mr Seshan went on to cite his personal medical reports  saying  he would speak to journalists on any topic other than those  under his official purview. "Press of India is a good means (to  achieve ends). But today I do not use it as a means and want no  benefit from it," he added.</p>

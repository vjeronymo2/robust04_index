			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Greenalls/Devenish It looks like drinks all round on Boddington, the pub retailer which tried and failed to acquire Devenish two years ago. Devenish has now succumbed to the Greenalls Group, but not without extracting a high price for its shareholders. One of these is Boddington, which earns a profit of some Pounds 13m on the 20 per cent stake it acquired at the time of its original bid. Greenalls argues that it has gained critical mass in pub retailing. Even if it is right that additional size matters, the benefits may prove elusive. Greenalls presumably felt a high price was necessary to pre-empt a counter bid from Boddington. It is paying a historic multiple of 21, not much higher than that of 17 attached to Boddington's earlier offer, which came close to succeeding. Yet Devenish has since carried out much of the rationalisation which made Boddington's price worth considering. Greenalls will now have to rely mainly on synergy advantages. By dressing up its offer to include a convertible bond, it has disguised what promises to be a mildly dilutive effect. Long-term supply agreements on both sides will limit the combined companies' ability to squeeze price reductions out of the brewers. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the addition of Devenish's throughput would make much difference to Greenalls' purchasing clout anyway. Boddington, which could easily have fallen into the same trap, thus appears to be doing the right thing by opting for cash - especially since, having enfranchised its outside shareholders, Greenalls has developed an unhealthy penchant for using its new freedom to issue shares.</p>

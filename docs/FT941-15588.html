			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Milk market left in disarray by delay The Pounds 3bn milk market in England and Wales has been thrown into disarray by the government's decision earlier this week to delay plans to open it up to competition. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, rejected a plan for reorganising the Milk Marketing Board into a producer's co-operative in time for the board to be abolished by April 1. The market liberalisation could now be put off until the beginning of July or even October, with the board remaining the statutory buyer and seller of milk until then. Some dairies have threatened to by-pass the board from April, even though it would be technically illegal. 'My fear is that a Sunday trading situation will develop if a lot of companies break the law,' said Mr Richard Smith, who heads the Northern Milk Partnership. The uncertainty has cast a shadow over some investment plans. 'While there is this insecurity in the market, it is difficult to commit money to capital investment,' said Mr Roger Clarke, commercial director at MD Foods, which is holding back investment of up to Pounds 12m until the situation is clearer. The Milk Marketing Board has to address important issues such as its plans for selling milk in the new competitive environment, transfer of assets to the new co-operative and haulage arrangements before it can gain approval from government. The Ministry of Agriculture is then expected to put the board's plans to another consultation period which could take three months. The milk marketing year begins in April, when farmers make their financial plans for the coming season. The abolition of the board part way through the year makes it difficult to plan ahead. In addition, the board generally pays farmers a premium of up to 3p per litre for milk during the summer in an effort to encourage production in a slack period. Farmers fear the board will abandon the practice this year in order to preserve its cashflow before abolition. Board officials, in an attempt to reassure farmers, stress it is just a delay they face rather than any fundamental changes to the new market.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Advertising downturn in US and UK behind 31% drop at Wace WACE GROUP, the printing services company, blamed the downturn in the London and New York advertising markets for a 31 per cent drop, to Pounds 18.3m, in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said the group had 'produced a resolute performance against an acute recessionary environment in both the UK and US'. Turnover rose to Pounds 305m (Pounds 235m), reflecting the inclusion of a full year from Parkway and Ripley Group. The chairman said his 'main priority during 1991 was to rationalise and integrate the acquisitions made by Wace in recent years'. The group shed 500 jobs during the year, about 9 per cent of the worldwide total, and a further 190 jobs had gone since the year-end. Wace said the difficult property market had caused it to write down its portfolio of investment properties by Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 10.8m). The property write-down, together with a Pounds 16.4m write-off of goodwill associated with earn-outs in the year, decreased the group's net assets to Pounds 78.7m (Pounds 95.5m). This, along with a rise in net borrowings to Pounds 82.4m (Pounds 53.4m), had caused gearing to rise to 105 per cent. However in December, a private placement of Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.8m) senior loan notes had improved the profile of the group's debt with Pounds 78m being repayable after more than two years. Mr ten Bos said it was the board's firm intention to reduce borrowings to a more acceptable level, though this might be difficult to accomplish fully in the short term. 'Although the first half is traditionally quiet for Wace, the first three months of 1992 have given the group a sound start to the year,' he said. 'Currently, the European operations are performing strongly; certain aspects of the UK market remain difficult, but with competition still being removed through closures and liquidations, the outlook for 1992 is optimistic; and the US market is begining to show signs of improvement.' Earnings per share fell to 12.6p (25.5p) after the payment of a full year's preference dividend. The final dividend is held at 6p, giving an unchanged total of 8.25p. Mr ten Bos said the maintained dividend - covered 1.5 times by earnings - reflected the board's confidence in the future. COMMENT No more skeletons appear to be lurking in the Wace cupboard - named Clegg or anything else. That was the key message which the group sought to convey to the City yesterday, and it seems to have succeeded. Gearing is high and is unlikely to fall until Wace can make some significant property disposals. However, the other ratios - dividend and interest cover - look fairly comfortable. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the house broker, is forecasting a cautious Pounds 23m, which puts the shares on a modest prospective multiple of 7.7. Although the shares rose from 119p to 127p, the question must be why they did not regain more of the ground lost since last year's peak of 284p. Doubtless the thought of the DTI inquiries casts a shadow over the company, but the shares look oversold at this level - and could attract a predator.</p>

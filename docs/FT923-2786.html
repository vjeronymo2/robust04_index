			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher Hard times and prudent management of cash flow distinguished Kingfisher's interim figures yesterday. Indeed, the company earned an interest credit for the first time since its buy-out 10 years ago. Yet there are inevitable signs of strain at the trading level. Worst affected is B&amp;Q which has been fighting price battles with DIY competitors Texas and Do It All. Despite B&amp;Q's late entry to the fray, profits fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 40m. As it attempts to persuade consumers it offers value for money, B&amp;Q is switching to fixed low prices. This is a good long term plan, but it carries considerable cost. The question is no longer when the recovery will arrive, but rather how to live without it. There is overcapacity in the DIY sector, and price cutting will take time to weed out the weaker companies. B&amp;Q will be a winner. Meanwhile its profits risk being squeezed by bouts of heavy discounting on the part of its competitors. As for the rest of the group, Comet still has a poor position in its market. Having failed to buy Dixons, the logic for Kingfisher must be to sell its electrical retailer eventually. Woolworth is dependent on a good Christmas, the prospect of which recedes as fast as sterling falls. Kingfisher's best asset, its management, is struggling heroically. Sadly, the attraction of the shares lies not in the company's trading outlook, but in the dismal prospects elsewhere.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Major attacks 'unjustifiable' salary increases Mr John Major yesterday condemned 'unjustifiable' salary increases for executives of privatised companies as Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said he was considering whether to forego part of a 75 per cent pay rise. The government's difficulties worsened as backbench tensions over Europe led to an unexpected backbench challenge to Sir Marcus Fox, a key supporter of the prime minister, for the leadership of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench MPs. The challenge, from Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the cross-party Commons defence committee, was widely seen by MPs as an attempt to punish Sir Marcus for his unswerving support for the prime minister. In a further blow to the government, around 25 members of the Euro-sceptic Fresh Start group last night discussed the possibility of mass abstention on the European communities finance bill, threatening the government's majority of 14. The group also considered tabling an amendment to the bill, which provides for an increase in UK contributions to the European Union. Mr Major has threatened to call a general election if the bill is defeated or substantially amended. In robust Commons exchanges, Mr Major said that excessive executive pay rises should be curbed by shareholders, but ruled out government interference. Mr Brown's pay rise was condemned as grotesque by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it was 'a V-sign' to gas consumers. Mr Blair later wrote to Mr Major urging the government to withdraw tax privileges for executive share options and give regulators power to limit price increases in industries subject to excessive salary rises. Mr Brown said that he understood the reaction to the company's announcement that his salary was to rise from Pounds 270,000 a year to Pounds 475,000. 'I will consider my options and discuss it with my colleagues and executive directors in the light of all that has been said,' he told Sky News. Tory backbenchers said the battle for the leadership of the 1922 committee could become a proxy contest between Sir Marcus and rightwingers seeking to destabilise Mr Major's leadership. Sir Nicholas said his challenge was 'categorically not an attack on the prime minister'. However, backbenchers said there was a desire to rebuke Sir Marcus for delivering a warning on behalf of the prime minister that the defeat of the EU finance bill would prompt an election.

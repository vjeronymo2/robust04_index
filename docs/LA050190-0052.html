			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: MESSAGE OF THE $600-MILLION MAN  </P> <P> One of the prosecutors in the Mike Milken case was very proud of the deal he  had cut with Milken's lawyers and announced happily, "We have sent a message to  Wall Street."  </P> <P> "That's good," my wife said. "I was hoping that sooner or later someone would  send Wall Street a message."  </P> <P> I told her, "I think they were much too tough on Milken. They want him to pay  $600 million as a penalty for what was nothing more than a third-rate  burglary."  </P> <P> My wife sounded concerned. "If he gives that much to the government, will he  have anything left for himself?"  </P> <P> "No more than a billion. I'm not suggesting that Milken can't live on a  billion, but he's going to have to cut back a lot on luxuries. That's one of  the messages the Justice Department is sending to Wall Street -- if you're  piggy about the stock market, you'll have to pay the piper."  </P> <P> "They don't have any pity for white collar criminals anymore," my wife said.  </P> <P> "If Washington shed any tears, then everyone on Wall Street would try to screw  the public. No one enjoys seeing a man like Milken in trouble, because without  him there wouldn't be junk bonds to start with.  </P> <P> "Nevertheless, someone has to say enough is enough, and if a man rapes the  stock market, we'll make him cry 'Uncle' no matter it costs him."  </P> <P> "What other message did the prosecution send to Wall Street?" she asked.  </P> <P> "The signal is that if you lie and perjure yourself and break the law, then you  have to get the best lawyer that money can buy. When it comes to white collar  crimes, the last thing the Justice Department lawyers want to do is negotiate  with a public defender. Mike Milken is the type of client that top-flight  criminal attorneys will kill for."  </P> <P> "Are you saying that Mike Milken got a better deal because he had the smartest  lawyers in the United States?"  </P> <P> "That's what the system of justice in this country is all about."  </P> <P> "Could someone in blue jeans negotiate the same deal?"  </P> <P> "Of course, if he had $600 million. In Milken's case he was a genius and he  made many people rich. For this reason he must be treated with respect.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying that Mike will not get jail for what he did -- but it won't be  hard time because the Justice Department hates to bring a federal case against  someone just because he wanted to make more money than anybody else in the  world."  </P> <P> My wife kept pressing. "Why aren't they going to force Milken to sing about the  others who also had their fingers in the junk bond jar?"  </P> <P> "Because that means they would have to keep making deals with Wall Street  crooks ad infinitum. The attorney general has much better things to do than  force Milken to sing the 'Barber of Seville' on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange."  </P> <P> My wife said, "I never did like junk bonds."  </P> <P> "Nobody ever liked junk bonds, but in the '80s it was the only junk to go  around."  </P> <P> "Are we finished with the message that the Justice Department sent to Wall  Street?"  </P> <P> "Yes -- we are now waiting for Wall Street to fax its reply."  </P></p>

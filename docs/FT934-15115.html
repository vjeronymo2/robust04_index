			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Recession hits Japanese retailers TWO leading Japanese retailers unveiled depressed interim figures yesterday, displaying evidence of the problems facing the industry as consumer confidence plunges following prolonged economic slump. Nagasakiya, a large supermarket chain, posted an unconsolidated pre-tax loss of Y1.7bn (Dollars 16m) for the first six months to August, compared with a loss of Y1.2bn a year earlier. The company was hit by the unusually long rainy season and cool summer. Sales for the March-August period fell 5 per cent to Y197bn, while after-tax losses totalled Y1.4bn against a profit of Y552m the previous year. The company, which paid an annual dividend of Y7.5 per share, will be forced to forego dividend payments for the current business year to February. Annual pre-tax losses are expected to widen to Y2.9bn from the previous year's Y539m, on a 3.5 per cent fall in sales to Y400bn. Takashimaya, an upmarket department store, suffered an 89 per cent plunge in pre-tax profit for the the first six months to August to Y380m, on a 9.5 per cent fall in sales to Y3.5bn. A fall in sales of mainstay items including clothing was caused by slack demand. However, after-tax profits surged 81.8 per cent due to revenue from land sales in Tokyo. For the year to February, the company expects pre-tax profits to fall 39.1 per cent to Y3bn on a 7 per cent fall in sales to Y730bn. Takashimaya plans to trim capital investment costs by 30 per cent as part of cost- cutting efforts.</p>

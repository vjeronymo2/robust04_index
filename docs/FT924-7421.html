			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Why Paris dare not annoy them down on the farm A jacquerie is what the French government fears would be the result of a Gatt farm trade deal on US terms. The term has nothing to do with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, so far considered in Paris to have done his best to hold the line against any cut in farm output beyond this summer's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. It refers, after the first jacquerie or revolt by 14th-century peasants, to the tendency of French farmers to show their discontent in public ways. They may not burn chateaux these days, but leave their tractors across road and rail lines, disrupting traffic, as they showed for several weeks after EC farm ministers agreed swingeing price cuts and set-aside requirements. After barely surviving, by three votes, a parliamentary censure motion, the government introduced a national aid package to appease the farmers. These provided for a cut in tax on farming land, incentives for producers of crop-based fuels, and debt relief on investment by French farmers to intensify production. Such investment included the giant tractors as handy in a street protest as on the land. If there is one element of consensus between France's fractious political parties, it is that the country cannot go beyond the CAP reforms it has already agreed to. Including its poor opinion poll showing, the ruling Socialist party has enough problems in the run-up to next March's legislative elections without provoking another jacquerie by Gatt concessions. Its survival until March depends, largely, on keeping in with the Communists who voted against it over CAP reform in the summer. Most French farmers vote to the right, but a substantial minority in the south shows allegiance to the Communist and Radical parties. Nor is there any reason to believe that, in the likely event they win the March election, the centre-right parties forming France's next government will want to be any more conciliatory on the Gatt farm trade issue. The neo-Gaullist RPR party is especially strong in the monde rural. So widespread is the sympathy for farmers that even industrial groups with everything to gain from an overall Gatt deal dare not be seen to criticise France's farmers. The chances are that if President Mitterrand is forced into newconcessions by a Gatt deal, he will seek to put the onus of responsibility on Brussels.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Blunkett backs work scheme to curb crime A citizens' volunteer service to encourage thousands of school-leavers to spend three months on community projects was backed yesterday by Labour's Commission on Social Justice. Most of the cost of a national Citizens' Service with places for up to 150,000 young people would be offset by a reduction in crime and an increase in the employability of young people, the commission says in a report to be announced today. The scheme would cost less than Pounds 2,000 per person including a weekly allowance of Pounds 50 for the volunteers. Mr James McCormick, a research fellow for the commission and author of the report, says: 'Improved employment prospects and reduced crime rates would pay back the investment. By its fifth year every Pounds 100 invested in a service covering 150,000 young people could yield savings of up to Pounds 25.' The scheme should not become a public works programme or be a means of substituting for paid labour, says the commission, a think-tank set up by the late John Smith at the end of 1992 to advise on social policy. Instead the scheme would bridge the gap between education and work, break down social and ethnic barriers, and encourage more involvement in public service. Sir Gordon Borrie, chairman of the commission, said: 'Almost 1m young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 are not in employment, nor are they training, nor studying. 'The costs of social exclusion for this group are all too obvious. Citizens' Service could give them and every other young adult a new stake in society. It would combine volunteer commitments with meeting community needs.' Labour is likely to strongly back such a scheme at the next election. The commission's scheme is echoed by a cost-benefit analysis from the Henley Centre, the independent forecasting organisation, which is also published today. It says that introducing voluntary service for young people could save Pounds 13.5bn over five years through a resultant fall in crime, and Pounds 298m by reducing long-term unemployment. The Henley Centre report, commissioned by the Community Service Volunteers charity, envisages a voluntary work scheme costing Pounds 300m with 250,000 places each year for people aged 18 to 21. It would pay them Pounds 20 a week plus a lunch allowance. The report adds that the estimates of savings are 'very conservative'. Mr David Blunkett, Labour chairman, yesterday said: 'There are 1m young people not in work, training or further education. We need to offer them some real hope.' Henley Centre report.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov article under the "Visits" rubric: "Will </F> the `Chinese Lantern' Show Us the Right Way? Russian Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin Begins Official Visit to PRC 26 May"]    [Text] Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation in  1992-1993 was fairly dynamic. Last year bilateral trade rose 30  percent to total $7.7 billion. China was Russia's number two  trading partner after the FRG. At the same time our country's  position is more modest in the Chinese "league table" -- it  comes seventh after Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, the  FRG, Taiwan, and South Korea.    During a recent visit to the PRC by a Russian State Duma  delegation led by Ivan Rybkin it was noted that by no means full  use is being made of the potential for broadening bilateral  ties. The Russian market is still experiencing shortages of food  and consumer goods, creating the preconditions for increased  imports from China, particularly to parts of Siberia and the Far  East. At the same time there is potential for increasing  exports of Russian machinebuilding output to China (it now  accounts for around 35 percent of all our exports to the PRC).    Early in 1994 Sino-Russian trade was seen to decline. In the  first quarter it dropped 44 percent compared with the same  period last year. Specialists think that the reason for the  slump was that trade predominantly in the form of barter has  exhausted its potential. A move to more modern forms of  economic production cooperation is what is needed, with mutual  capital investment and the creation of joint enterprises.    At the moment inadequate use is being made of this potential  and Russia is, moreover, clearly lagging behind in this field.  In 1992 300 Chinese missions and joint enterprises were  registered in our country while in 1993 the figure was around  500. In China there are just over 400 enterprises involving  Russian capital. Their contribution ($200 million) to the  Chinese economy as part of overall foreign investment (last year  credit and investment agreements were signed worth $110 billion)  is still a drop in the ocean.    Legal, organizational, and financial support from the state  is needed to change the situation along with the development of  a market infrastructure -- a transport network, banking system,  etc. State intervention is needed to restore equivalent  commodity exchange and monitor the quality of the output  supplied and contract deadlines. These matters are expected to  be discussed during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China.    The second important aspect of the Russian prime minister's  trip is to study the experience of Chinese reform. Over the  last 14 years China's economy has developed extremely  dynamically. In 1992-1993 the PRC was the world leader in terms  of the pace of economic growth (over 13 percent a year). In  1993 industrial production rose 21.4 percent, while investment  in fixed capital was up 50.6 percent. Industrial production is  rising fastest in the private sector and at enterprises  involving foreign capital (64.6 percent) as well as at  enterprises in collective ownership (39.8 percent).    The sphere of market relations in China is gradually  expanding. The proportion of planned output in total industrial  production has been seen to drop this year to 5 percent, while  goods sold at state prices account for only around 10 percent of  retail trade.    The Chinese securities market is developing successfully.  Stock exchanges are operating in Shanghai and the Shenzhen  special economic zone. Around 13,000 joint-stock and shared  enterprises of various types have been registered. Shares in  124 companies are quoted on the local stock market and shares in  nine on foreign exchanges. In 1994 there are plans to issue  shares worth 5.5 million yuan (one U.S. dollar is equivalent to  approximately 8.5 yuan). And 22 enterprises will be authorized  to sell shares abroad.    The liberalization of foreign economic activity is  continuing. New spheres of investment opened up for foreign  businessmen in 1993-1994 -- domestic trade, highway, railroad,  and airfield construction, legal services, insurance,  consultancy, auditing, etc. There are 93 banks and financial  companies based on foreign capital at work in China. Duties on  several thousand commodity groups have been considerably lowered  in preparation for joining GATT.    Experiments have begun to transform state enterprises into  joint-stock companies. The state's share of their capital will  gradually decline. It is planned that only purely defense  enterprises will remain in state ownership in five or seven  years. China has decided to renounce voucher privatization.    A new tax system has been introduced as of 1 January 1994.  The former turnover taxes have been replaced by value-added tax  (at a rate of 17 percent -- 13 percent for some commodities) and  excise duties. A single profits tax has been established for  all enterprises regardless of their form of ownership (33  percent). Income tax rates paid by individuals have been  unified. Some new taxes have been introduced -- on real estate,  inheritance, and the use of natural resources.    There have been changes in the system of tax payments into  budgets of various levels. The center's share of total  consolidated budget income will rise to 60 percent within five  years (now 38 percent).    Reform of the banking system has begun. The People's Bank of  China will be turned into a central bank responsible for  maintaining the stability of the national currency and  monitoring inflation. Three of the four specialized banks are  being commercialized and the functions of providing preferential  credit transferred to three new state banks specially set up for  this purpose. Joint-stock commercial banks will be extensively  developed.    As of 1 January 1994 the practice has been introduced  whereby  export enterprises have to sell all their hard-currency revenue  to authorized banks. A single market rate has been fixed for  the yuan. The circulation of foreign currency is banned in the  country. Import enterprises buy currency from the banks at the  market rate.    Despite what are by and large positive results of economic  reform, certain alarming symptoms have emerged in China too.  The country's economy is threatened with "overheating" due to  excessive investment and credit, which is to a considerable  extent covered by increasing the money supply.    Inflation has increased. Whereas in 1993 prices rose 13  percent, in the first quarter of this year they are up 20  percent. Over 80 percent of state enterprises are overtly or  covertly lossmaking, which has brought about a drastic increase  in defaults on payment. The high and uneven pace of industrial  growth across various sectors has created new imbalances in the  national economy. China's experience in combating these  negative phenomena -- in a country where there is still tight  state regulation -- could be extremely useful to Russian  specialists.    In particular, Chinese methods of giving support to the  agro-industrial complex deserve attention. The production of  highly important agricultural produce is lossmaking here and is  backed with income from rural industrial and service  enterprises. There are over 20 million of these enterprises.    The social orientation of Chinese reforms is an extremely  important aspect. Throughout the period of economic  transformations increases in citizens' real income and  improvements in housing conditions, medical services, and the  social insurance system have been recorded. All this ensures  extensive support among the population for the reform course.</p>

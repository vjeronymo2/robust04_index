			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mail order helps Farepak to Pounds 6m - Number of agents up 10% and marketing investment at Pounds 1.1m A 36 per cent rise in turnover at its core mail order business helped Farepak, which supplies about 1m Christmas hampers a year, to report a 22 per cent rise in profits. For the year to end April, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.98m to Pounds 6.08m on sales of Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 70.5m). The outcome was struck after extraordinary charges of Pounds 211,000 for the amortisation of interest on the deferred consideration for the Littlewoods hamper business acquired in April last year, and Pounds 136,000 of costs for joining the Official List. Profits at the mail order division rose from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.93m on sales up from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 44.6m. The increased turnover included a contribution of Pounds 5.4m from the Littlewoods acquisition. The average number of agents, which rose by 27 per cent to 70,000 in 1993-94, was 10 per cent up this year. The group had invested Pounds 1.1m in marketing and was looking for good growth in the current year. The food processing division reported profits of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 122,000) on turnover of Pounds 37m (Pounds 34.3m). Of the sales, Pounds 15.8m was made at no profit to associates, including Home Farm, the joint venture with Fine Art Developments, which contributed Pounds 1.57m to profits. A further Pounds 10m of sales were accounted for by Tranfood, the cooked meat supplier, which had cut losses but was still some Pounds 100,000 in the red. Customers start paying for Christmas hampers months in advance, providing a strong cash flow. However, a fall in average interest rates from 9.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent cut net interest receivable from Pounds 828,000 to Pounds 567,000. Earnings per share rose from 14.42p to 17.58p. A final dividend of 4.75p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.6p (5.75p).</p>

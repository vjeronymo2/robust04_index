			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Letter: A new broad curriculum exam needed Sir, Might I yet again suggest that the opponents and the supporters of the A-level examination are advancing arguments which are perfectly capable of practical reconciliation. Your Leader ('Exam results', August 20) points out that the only real function of A-levels is to select 'a small minority' of university entrants. It is vital, as the government argues, to maintain this 'gold standard'. What is absurd, however, is to maintain that here is a hoop through which all our young people must go, whatever their leanings. More absurd is the uniquely snobbish, but uneducated, insistence on the lower value of vocational qualifications - as though such disparate areas of talent, activity and assessment could be meaningfully compared. The absurdity derives from the egalitarian post-Robbins belief that everyone must have a university education and those who do not, or who cannot get one, are of lesser value. One in five A-level entries results in a fail grade, as your editorial points out. Supporters of the A-level should, thus, surely be quite happy to concede that we stop forcing pupils with other than high academic talents and interests into this channel. What problem would arise if the A-level examination remained an option for those suited to it, while a broader curriculum examination on the lines you advocate is introduced for the majority? Many schools, in any event, provide a broad range of options at fifth and sixth form levels. These options could be made generally available; and they would fail only if they ceased to be options and became obligatory. Artists will take to calculation if it is introduced sympathetically and with feeling] Peter Wood, Newbold Farm, Duntisbourne Abbots, Cirencester, Gloucestershire GL7 7JN</p>

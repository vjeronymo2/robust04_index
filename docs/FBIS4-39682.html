			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- Process of peaceful settlement  in the former Yugoslavia is nowadays in need of urgent  activization, Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian  Foreign Ministry, told a Moscow briefing on Thursday.    Though "the Contact Group", which communicates with the  belligerents directly, has made an important preparatory  contribution, it is still unable to supplant a meeting of  foreign ministers, he said.    "Moscow considers it necessary to accelerate preparations  for  holding a new meeting of foreign ministers. We believe the  meeting could take place within a week or two," the spokesman  said.    Moscow hails the fact that the warring parties in Bosnia  have  agreed through the mediation of the United Nations to suspend  offensive operations and other provocative acts for a month, he  said. The agreement comes into force tomorrow at noon (local  time).    "The most important thing at present is the fact that the  parties involved in the military conflict in former Yugoslavia  are actually prepared to carry out the reached agreement. The  vitality of the truce depends on their position, self-restraint  and political will," Karasin added.    Aleksandr Belyayev, a Russian soldier of the UN Protection  Force, who was fatally wounded in the beginning of this months,  died on June 7. A close investigation into the tragic accident  is now under way, Karasin told the briefing.</p>

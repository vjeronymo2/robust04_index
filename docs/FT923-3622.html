			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Many voices go into a Bundesbank utterance THE Bundesbank's slab-like headquarters on the outskirts of Frankfurt gives the German central bank the look of a monolith. However, the bank makes its views known to the outside world in a bewildering multiplicity of ways. This is primarily because of its pluralistic way of making decisions. When, as in recent weeks, a variety of Bundesbank views ricochet onto the foreign exchange markets from several different angles, the central bank can stand accused of inconsistency. Worse, when remarks from the centre of the Bundesbank appear to be contradicted by those from the periphery, the central bank can appear to be organising some form of conspiracy. The appearance of raggedness is an inevitable result of some deep-rooted ambiguities in the bank's management of Germany's current economic problems. On the one hand, the central bank welcomes the concept of stabilising exchange rates within the European Monetary System in a way which will maximise anti-inflation discipline. On the other, it wants the EMS to remain capable of organising occasional exchange-rate adjustments to allow for differing economic performances among member countries. Because its short-term priority is to keep exchange rates stable, the Bundesbank has no interest in furthering speculation that it is trying to engineer an EMS realignment. Nor does it want to strengthen the view that another increase in its Lombard rate may soon be on the cards. This is why Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, agreed at the weekend that the Bundesbank would not raise its interest rates 'in present circumstances'. Even though Frankfurt money market rates are just under the 9 3/4 per cent Lombard level, another increase in the rate looks unlikely, in view of strong signs of stagnation in the German economy. The Bundesbank is equally opposed, however, to creating the impression that it is allowing pressure from foreign finance ministers to dictate its anti-inflationary monetary policies. This explains why Mr Schlesinger this week has been at pains to point out that his Bath declaration added nothing to a statement already made 10 days earlier. An important reason why Bundesbank policy utterances can appear confusing is its federal structure. The central bank takes monetary policy decisions every other Thursday on the basis of majority voting by its 18-man governing council. Each representative has one vote - which means that each member theoretically carries the same weight in, effectively, determining interest rates around Europe. The 11 presidents of state (Land) central banks, at present reduced to nine by death and retirement, who sit on the council have become in recent years much more outspoken. Many of them now employ their own advisers and press spokesmen to make sure their frequent utterances are given play in the media. Some of them weigh their words less carefully than the ultra-cautious Mr Schlesinger. In addition, their remarks - either on or off the record - can be influenced not just by the criterion of maintaining monetary rectitude, but also by personal and political controversies around the council table. All this means that leaks and indiscretions about the Bundesbank's views on a possible EMS realignment are likely to continue. The Bundesbank has always been sceptical about whether Britain could accept the anti-inflation discipline inherent in the system. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Mr Schlesinger's predecessor, predicted two years ago that full British membership of the ERM could lead to 'mass unemployment and enormous payments problems' in Britain. As far as the chances for sterling or lira devaluation are concerned, the formal Bundesbank view, and the private feeling of most Bundesbank officials, is that the decision on realigning is basically up to individual countries. The Bundesbank can, however, hardly pretend that EMS tension is above all a problem for others, since its high interest rates are a principal cause of the present turmoil. The central bank is not hatching a conspiracy to bring the EMS to its knees. But, if the EMS does suffer a breakdown in the next few weeks, the Bundesbank can hardly claim to have been nowhere near the scene.</p>

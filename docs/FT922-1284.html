			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at TGI TGI, the audio equipment manufacturer, followed its return to profits in the first half with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.03m for the year to March 31, against losses of Pounds 820,000. The company said the results were encouraging but inadequate. All companies traded profitably with Audix improving from last year's significant loss to a modest profit, the directors said, and they are recommending a return to dividends with a final of 1p from earnings per share of 3.4p. The previous year there was an interim dividend of 2.2p when losses per share were 7.8p. During the period borrowings were cut from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 3.2m with gearing falling to 63 per cent at the year-end, against 180 per cent. Turnover was Pounds 35.6m, compared with Pounds 44.4m of which Pounds 9.7m related to the discontinued factored activities. The pre-tax profit this time included Pounds 451,000 from the gain on disposal of properties.</p>

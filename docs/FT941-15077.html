			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: UK manufacturing output should show a modest rise between October and November and grow 2 per cent compared with November 1992. Cold weather should have given a boost to energy output. Economists expect no acceleration in producer output prices despite Budget tax increases. Weak oil prices should help keep input prices low. Tuesday: An expected fall in Japan's private sector machinery orders in November would increase pressure for action to boost the economy. Wednesday: UK retailers had their best Christmas for years, fuelling expectations of a 5.2 per cent year-on-year increase in volume sales last month. Canada's lead indicator for December should point to continued steady growth, while November wage data should calm fears of inflation. Thursday: Anything more than the anticipated 1.43m of US housing starts in December would add to recent evidence of bumper fourth-quarter growth. Friday: City expectations of a Pounds 2bn increase in UK bank and building society lending in December would mark a strengthening of credit demand if fulfilled.</p>

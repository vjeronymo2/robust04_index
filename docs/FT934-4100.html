			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / BBC and Tussauds in theme park talks The BBC is looking at the possibility of building a multi-million pound theme park or exhibition centre in Britain which would feature some its best-known programmes. The project is being examined in conjunction with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tussauds Group, which runs Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures, Madame Tussaud's and the London Planetarium. Ms Juliete Simpkins of Tussauds Group said yesterday: 'I can confirm that we are involved in a study with the BBC on building a theme park. But discussions are at a very early stage. It would be a multi-million pound venture. The feasibility study is meant to find out what a theme park would cost. Ideas being discussed for a park could cover theme restaurants, special effects, and replica sets of the BBC's successful shows. These could include Dr Who with an exhibition of fights between Cybermen and Daleks, East Enders, with a reproduction of Albert Square and the Queen Vic public house. Other sets suggested are Birds of a Feather, Casualty and Noel's House Party. The BBC said: 'We are interested in building a theme park. We are talking to the Pearson group. But everything is at a tentative stage. I cannot confirm what the park would cost or that Pearson would pay for it.' Ms Simpkins said: 'The BBC theme park is one of a number of projects we are looking at. Another possible scheme is in New York, where we are thinking about a permanent show.' The Tussauds Group runs the largest number of paid-for attractions in Britain. These include Alton Towers in Staffordshire which last year attracted 2.5m visitors and Madame Tussauds with 3.2m.</p>

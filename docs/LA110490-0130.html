			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A' IS FOR AWFUL  </P> <P> Shearer doesn't seem to realize that a school is only as good as the community  around it. Unfortunately, parents just don't seem to care.  </P> <P> Anyone who has been in elementary schools lately would see that the teachers  are considered not educators but day-care providers. Children are often dropped  off at school 45 minutes before school begins -- when there is no adult  supervision -- and left to roam after school until parents return from work.  </P> <P> In short, we do not need people such as Shearer who sit around and complain  about public schools. We need people to get involved. Join the PTA, run for the  school board, or vote; the choice is yours whether or not our schools will  succeed.  </P> <P> KATHY MACK  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

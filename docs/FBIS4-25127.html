			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian cease-fire  talks between the warring factions started here today following  a confirmation of total withdrawal of armed Bosnian Serbs from  the U.N.-declared exclusion zone around Gorazde.    The talks, scheduled for June 2, were postponed because the  Muslim side refused to show up at the talks before the Bosnian  Serbs withdraw from the U.N.- protected area.    Earlier today, the Bosnian Army command and U.N.  peace-keeping force confirmed the pullout of the Serb troops  from the zone, clearing the way for the truce negotiations.    Akashi met Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic, Bosnian Croat  leader Kresimir Zubak and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic  separately today to discuss with them his draft proposal for the  cease-fire talks.    It was reported that Akashi was calling for a four-month  truce with separation of forces and withdrawal of heavy weapons  from conflict lines.    Face-to-face talks among the warring factions are expected  on  Tuesday [7 June].</p>

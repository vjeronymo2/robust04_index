			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Thais reluctant to seal Khmer Rouge border THAILAND'S civilian and military leaders have signalled a reluctance to impose economic sanctions on Khmer Rouge guerrillas in neighbouring Cambodia, one of the measures being considered by the United Nations in an attempt to force the Khmer Rouge to comply with a Cambodian peace plan. In Bangkok yesterday Mr Hun Sen, head of the Cambodian administration which is still engaged in sporadic fighting against the Khmer Rouge, met Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, and told him that the cross-border trade with Thailand was helping the defiant Khmer Rouge leadership. But Mr Chuan said after the meeting: 'I told him we can't erect barbed wire all along the border. . . People who live in the area are related so it is impossible to stop their contacts.' The Thai armed forces, which control the border zone and have profited from commissions on the trade, are equally unenthusiastic about sanctions. They say that the border is difficult to monitor and that the Khmer Rouge would in any case be able to survive a blockade. Gen Charan Kullavnijaya, secretary general of the Thai National Security Council, this week dismissed the sanctions as 'western style of thinking.' The Khmer Rouge is thought to earn at least Dollars 100m a year by selling gems and timber from their strongholds in northern and western Cambodia to Thai businessmen, who in turn sell oil and other supplies to the guerrillas. UN officials and western diplomats are considering the imposition of sanctions following the failure of the Khmer Rouge to comply with the peace plan that they and the other Cambodian factions accepted in Paris a year ago. Thailand has announced that it would obey whatever decision is taken by the UN Security Council at a meeting expected to be held later this month, but the Thais are making it clear they consider sanctions undesirable and impractical. While proponents of sanctions agree a blockade is unlikely to be watertight, they think it possible to stop truck-loads of timber from crossing the frontier. Monitoring sanctions against the Khmer Rouge will be difficult because the areas controlled by the four Cambodian factions are constantly shifting and poorly defined.</p>

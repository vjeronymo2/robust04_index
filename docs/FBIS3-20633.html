			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Zhang Zhiren [1728 1807 0088] and </F> correspondent Yan Santun [7051 0005 1470]]    [Text] The "1,000-ton prototype industrial production of  coal-based synthetic gasoline" key national S&amp;T project  undertaken by the No. 2 Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Pucheng,  Shanxi, is now producing oil.    Testing of this project still has 1,500 hours to go and the  completion of these tests will have importance for making  practical use of national energy resources by industrializing  the coal liquification process.    In the early 1980s, the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry Research  Institute began to study two new industrial processes for  coal-based synthetic gasoline, and an intermediate test was  conducted at the Daixian Fertilizer Plant in Shanxi with good  results. In 1990, the State Planning Commission gave the  go-ahead for an industrialization test for coal-based synthetic  gasoline. The test was undertaken jointly by the Pucheng No. 2  Chemical Fertilizer Plant and the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry  Institute. The test project was designed for an annual  production of 2,000 tons of oil and 7.5 million cubic meters of  coal gas. Altogether the central government, Shanxi Province,  and Pucheng Municipality invested over 22.33 million yuan.    On 16 December, after nearly three years of effort, the  researchers and technicians successfully completed the  chemical-starter test-vehicle mission, and when they reached the  oil production stage, they immediately launched into the  1,500-hour test and assessment stage.    Shanxi Province will build a pilot plant with a 50,000- to  100,000-ton output capability based on the outcome of this  industrial test.</p>

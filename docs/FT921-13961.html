			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Further results delay at Eurocopy EUROCOPY, the photocopier distribution and servicing group, is again postponing the publication of its results for the year to September 30 1991. Its shares slipped 2p to 80p on the announcement. The group said that it had not yet received the decision by the Office of Fair Trading on the investigation into its Consumer Credit Act licences. The OFT's legal notice came in August after press reports and parliamentary questions in autumn 1990 about practices at two of Eurocopy's subsidiaries. The group had intended to announce its results on December 17, believing, it said, that the OFT decision would have been known by then. It now believes that the decision is imminent and has said that it will release its results within seven days of the publication of the OFT findings. In August, Eurocopy said that the negative publicity had affected its trading and forecast profits for the year to end-September of Pounds 7.4m. Previously it had expected to make Pounds 12m.</p>

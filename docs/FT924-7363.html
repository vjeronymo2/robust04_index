			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Convincing argument Sir, Your leader 'Independence for the Bank' (November 12) makes a very convincing case. To a growing body of people in the UK it is becoming unacceptable for monetary policy to remain a political tool in the hands of politicians. Our record since the second world war, characterised as it has been by violent fluctuations in the economy, should convince the most sceptical that the time has come for institutional change. Without an independent central bank there is little hope of our achieving the stability essential to the prosperity of industry; and without a sound industrial base we are all dead, economically speaking. Thomas Welsh, 21 Bede House, Manorfields, London SW15 3LT</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Markets: Dealing with the emerging Chinese giant - Economic Eye Under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, the long slumber of China, home to a fifth of the world's population, has ended. This creates possibly the most important policy challenge facing the West. Significant decisions - over whether to renew China's MFN (most-favoured nation) status in the US, for example, and on what terms to let it into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - must soon be taken. The issues are expounded with clarity and common sense in a recent monograph by Mr Nicholas Lardy, professor at the University of Washington, and a well known expert on the Chinese economy.* Prof Lardy recognises the difficulty posed for the rest of the world by a country that is so large and economically dynamic, but remains under the control of a distasteful communist regime. Fortunately, experience elsewhere in east Asia suggests that democracy ultimately follows introduction of a successful market economy, though with a significant lag. Partly for this reason, the remarkable economic development under way needs to be supported. The Chinese economy grew at an annual average rate of 9.4 per cent between 1980 and 1991. The explosion in its foreign trade (shown in the chart) means that China's share in world exports rose from 0.9 per cent in 1980 to 2.3 per cent in 1992. In 1973, China was the world's 20th largest exporter; by 1985, it was 15th; and by 1992, it was 11th (10th, if Hong Kong's re-exports are excluded). Prof Lardy tries to assuage the alarm this performance has awakened. He argues, for example, that China is not yet and is not likely soon to become an economic superpower. Similarly, he notes that China is, in important respects, more open to the world economy than were Japan, South Korea and Taiwan at comparable levels of development. How large is the Chinese economy? The highest estimate of income per head at international prices is Dollars 2,600, which would make the economy second largest in the world. If recent rates of growth were extrapolated, China would overtake the US by 2010. Against this, Prof Lardy argues that China's real income per head is only about Dollars 1,000, no higher than India's. He also argues that supercharged growth is unlikely to be sustained after the year 2000. Should the growth rate fall to 5 per cent, China's output would not exceed that of the US until 2040. These arguments seem mutually inconsistent. If China's real income is as low as Prof Lardy suggests, its potential must also be greater. China would then only be where south Korea was a quarter of a century ago. Since then the latter's economy has grown at close to 10 per cent per annum. Furthermore, the handicaps Prof Lardy points to - high levels of public ownership, bankrupt banks and continuing dependence on foreign entrepreneurship and capital - suggest that the rewards of further reform could be huge. Much, however, depends on the rest of the world. Here Prof Lardy's arguments are more persuasive. He notes, for example, that China received an inflow of foreign direct investment in 1993 of Dollars 26bn, up from Dollars 5bn in 1991. In 1993, more than a quarter of China's exports were from foreign-invested firms, which accounted for 70 per cent of total export growth. Processing of duty-free imports into exports is also more important for China than for other east Asian countries. These facts, along with the role of Hong Kong as an entrepot, make the US administration's beloved statistics on bilateral deficits more meaningless than usual. A correction for US exports to China, through Hong Kong, and for the value-added in Hong Kong on US imports from China is shown in the chart. But suppose a US export is incorporated into something made in Taiwan that is further processed in China. US bilateral trade statistics would miss this altogether. It is interesting, therefore, that the US deficit with China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, taken together, has changed little since 1987. China has, in short, an increasingly open economy, one that specialises on the basis of its comparative advantage and imports as much as it exports. It needs to be encouraged to proceed further towards becoming a transparent, market-based economic regime. Such a regime would, of necessity, also increase the legal rights of the Chinese themselves, precisely what the West is supposed to want. Prof Lardy's recommendations include: abandoning the use of the bilateral trade imbalance as an indicator of the degree of openness of the Chinese economy; working for China's early entrance into the Gatt, preferably before the end of this year (which would make it a founding member of the World Trade Organisation); and providing China with permanent MFN status in the US. All this makes eminent sense. Withdrawing MFN, for example, could be catastrophic for US bilateral trade: the World Bank estimates China's exports would then have fallen by between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 15bn in 1990. But it would also be an act of economic warfare, devastating to those Chinese who are pushing for reform, or benefit from it. Furthering China's long-term integration into the world economy would increase its direct stake in stability and make it more likely that China would co-operate on noneconomic issues as well, argues Prof Lardy. Against this view, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, has designated China a 'backlash' state, along with Iran and Iraq. This is a ridiculous parallel, partly because the course of Chinese economic development promises something very different. More fundamentally, China cannot, like Iran and Iraq, be quarantined. The question is what sort of great power China will turn out to be. The China the West will experience is likely to be the China the West deserves. *Nicholas R.

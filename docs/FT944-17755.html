			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: France takes first step in Renault share sale The French government has taken the first step in the partial privatisation of Renault, saying it was launching the process to determine a group of stable shareholders in the motor vehicle group. The economy ministry said that from today , potential investors in the core shareholding group, who will hold a combined 5 per cent of Renault's shares, would be able to place their offers. The offer period will last for two weeks. Investors in the so-called group of shareholding partners will each have to buy a minimum of 2.4m shares, about 1 per cent of the company's capital. They will have to hold all the shares for three months and 80 per cent for the following 21 months. The sale of the 80 per cent of the shares will, however, be possible within the group of core shareholders. Core shareholders are expected to include Renault's industrial partners, such as Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Lagardere Group, the electronics and communications concern. The share sale will take place after a FFr2bn (Dollars 377m) capital increase. Overall, the French government plans to reduce its holding in Renault from 80 per cent to just above 50 per cent. The majority of the issue is to go to individuals and employees of the automobile group.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Southend Property disposal SOUTHEND Property Holdings yesterday announced the sale of a Bedfordshire shopping centre for Pounds 17m, writes Vanessa Houlder. The buyer's identity was not disclosed. The disposal will reduce Southend's gearing to about 108 per cent, on net debt of Pounds 120m. The cash element of the equation had stood at Pounds 21m before the sale. Southend said the move furthered its policy of creating cash resources to provide it with security and place it in a position to act immediately on favourable opportunities. The Quadrant Centre in Dunstable, which was constructed in the 1960s, is producing about Pounds 1.7m of rental income. It was included in Southend's accounts for the year ended March 31 at Pounds 17.5m.</p>

The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which holds  a  monopoly over 98 percent of the country's insurance business,  reported an overall income of 49.8 billion yuan, up 36.1 percent  over the previous year.    More than 26.1 billion yuan of the total income was yielded  from insurance premium income, and the pension fund income was  23.6 billion yuan, rising by 32.3 and 38.8 percent respectively  over the previous year.    According to Dai Fengju, vice-general manager of PICC, about  700,000 enterprises applied for enterprise property insurance,  while 350 million persons have become insured.    Moreover, 100 million-plus households have bid for family  property insurance. A special planting insurance has covered 30  million hectares.    Dai declared that PICC claims and pension payments reached  27.1 billion yuan last year. Payment from domestic property  insurance was 16.3 billion yuan, with personal insurance at 8.6  billion yuan and foreign affairs-related insurances at over 2.1  billion yuan.    PICC also established overseas companies in Hong Kong and  Britain, namely the China Insurance Hong Kong (Group) Company  and the China Insurance U.K. Holdings Company. So far PICC has  opened 115,000 agencies throughout the country.    Dai explained that in this year, PICC will mainly contribute  efforts to developing some major insurance policies.    For domestic property insurance, PICC will emphasize  developing of insurance for enterprise property, cargo  transportation and product liability.    Foreign-related insurance business, such as non-marine  insurance and aviation personal insurance, will still be a focal  point of development.    Others will include agricultural insurance on some  commercial, foreign exchange-earning and hi-tech projects, and  all kinds of pension insurance, health insurance and short-term  personal insurance.    Dai also pledged that aiming to meet the demands of entering  the international insurance market and developing China's  commercial insurance, PICC has decided to carry out a trial  operation of subsidiary companies.    A re-insurance system has been set up in PICC which ordered  branch companies to shift 20 percent of their domestic insurance  business to the general company. Moreover, branch companies are  asked to sign excess insurance contracts with the general  company, which demands that the two conduct domestic non-life  insurance together.    Dai said that besides these measures, PICC will separate  management on policy-based insurance business, which focuses on  export-credit insurance and agricultural insurance, from  commercial insurance items.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DION FAN OF HIS OLD HITS HIMSELF  </P> <P> Unlike other musicians, rock 'n' roll Hall of Famer Dion doesn't grumble when  asked to perform his old hits.  </P> <P> "I love doing old songs," said the 50-year-old Dion DiMucci, who performed this  week as part of the "Dave Edmunds Rock 'n' Roll Revue" at the Ulster County  Playhouse.  </P> <P> "In fact, they have more value to me as time passes," he said. "And I see what  they do to an audience. They love it. I get a big kick out of it."  </P> <P> In his latest tour, Dion mixes early 1960s material like "Runaround Sue," "The  Wanderer" and "Ruby Baby" with songs from a comeback album released last year.  </P> <P> "If the song is good, it's good," he said.  </P></p>

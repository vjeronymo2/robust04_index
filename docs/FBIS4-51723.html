			<p>BFN     [Text] A Singapore mission is visiting Myanmar [Burma]  this week, further cementing ties between the two countries.    The eight-day construction and development mission, which  begins today, is organised jointly by the Trade Development  Board (TDB) and Construction Industry Development Board.    Representatives of 21 Singapore companies will make the trip  to Yangon [Rangoon].    The mission follows a three-day visit to Myanmar in March by  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.    Singapore is Myanmar's second largest trading partner after  China.    Trade between the two countries increased by 19.4 percent  from $603.1 million [Singapore dollars] in 1992 to $720.3  million last year, and the growth was due mainly to an increase  in oil and non-oil domestic exports and reexports.    During Mr. Goh's visit, two Singapore companies signed  memoranda of understanding with Myanmar's Ministry of Hotels and  Tourism.    Keppel Group's Straits Steamship is developing a U.S. $50  million (S [Singapore] $79 million) international-class hotel in  Mandalay -- its second in the country -- and Kuok Singapore said  it would invest U.S. $150 million to develop two first-class  hotels in Yangon.    This week's mission is led by Mr. Fong Siew Heng, executive  director of Low Keng Huat. The chief executive officer of  Eastern Industries Pte. Ltd. [Private Limited], Mr. Chong Wai  Siak, is the deputy mission leader.    In a statement released at the weekend, the TDB said the  group aimed to cultivate and develop official and business  contacts in Myanmar and to meet the relevant authorities and  corporations involved in construction projects. Members also  hoped to explore areas for joint cooperation.    Said Mr. Fong: "The mission is largely exploratory in nature  as this will be the first trip to Myanmar for the majority of  the participants."    He expressed confidence that the visit would prove an  "eye-opener" for both parties.    Participating companies include major construction firms,  developers, architects, consultant engineers, building material  manufacturers, and a bank. Among them are Alfred Wong  Partnership, United Engineers Singapore, First Capital  Corporation, and United Overseas Bank.    The Singapore Contractors Association is also represented.    The TDB said business opportunities in Myanmar's  construction  sector were expected to increase with the opening up of the  economy and the resulting inflow of foreign investment.    State enterprises, which accounted for 89 percent of output  in Myanmar's construction sector in 1992/93, experienced strong  growth between 1989 and 1992 as a result of the government's  emphasis on infrastructure construction and rehabilitation,  particularly in the capital city of Yangon.    Public capital expenditure for the sector totalled 1,843  million kyat in 1992/3, or 12.5 percent of total expenditure.    Myanmar's imports of capital goods for the year 1991/2  totalled U.S. $249.9 million. These included construction  materials, machinery and equipment and transport equipment.</p>

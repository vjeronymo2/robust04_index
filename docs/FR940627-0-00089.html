			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. The Commission stated that it appears that providing signalling information from LEC tandems would require software upgrades to those tandems. In addition, the record indicates that tandem-provided signalling may be of less utility to TSPs than end office-provided signalling. Although some parties claim generally that tandem-provided signalling could provide a useful adjunct to other forms of interconnection, they do not explain with any specificity how they could use such an architecture, or how a two-tandem architecture could actually be competitively viable, either from a service quality or pricing standpoint. Therefore, based on the current record, the Commission did not require LECs to provide this service at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Commission clarified that in proposing access to LEC signalling information from LEC end offices and tandems, it did not intend to require LECs to reconfigure their SS7 networks. Thus, the Commission held that LECs may provide end-office-generated signalling information through STPs, and they may require TSPs that are terminating traffic to transmit signalling formation to LEC end offices through LEC STPs. The Commission recognized that STPs perform important network screening functions and did not require LECs to decentralize those functions by deploying them in every switch. Moreover, the record does not indicate that TSPs would seek to interconnect via SS7 at end offices, rather than at STPs. Rather, as some parties pointed out, it would be far more efficient for them to interconnect at STPs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Regarding billing of terminating traffic, the Commission stated that, consistent with its earlier expanded interconnection measures, the customer of record of the terminating LEC should be billed by the terminating LEC for services provided by that LEC. If the TSP is the customer of record, the LEC should bill the TSP directly. If the TSP's customer is the customer of record, then the TSP must provide the LEC with billing tapes so that the LEC may properly count and bill access minutes. The Commission rejected the suggestion of some LECs that all discrepancies between TSP-provided billing tapes and LEC billing records be resolved in favor of the LECs. The Commission stated that TSPs and LECs can and should establish fair and reasonable procedures to resolve billing discrepancies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The Commission stated that it does not base its decision that LECs must, in some instances, accept billing tapes from TSPs on a co-carrier model. It required LECs to make signalling information available to any third party, not just providers of competitive tandem-switched transport services. Thus, small IXCs may use signalling information as a way to aggregate their traffic on direct-trunked transport facilities purchased from a LEC so that they can enjoy the same scale economies as larger IXCs. In that situation, the IXC ordering the signalling and transport would be a reseller or aggregator, not a co-carrier. Indeed, if the meet-point billing model applied, TSPs would not be able to purchase direct-trunked transport from a LEC, since LEC tandem-switched transport rates to the ``meet-point'' would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Collocation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that physical collocation of switching equipment should not be required. Virtually every commenter that addressed this issue supported the tentative conclusion and the reasoning behind it. Thus, the parties agreed that there is no competitive or technical benefit to locating switching equipment in LEC offices; that switching equipment is too large and too heavy to be collocated in LEC space; and that interconnectors would prefer to place their switching equipment on their own premises for monitoring purposes. The Commission found that the arguments offered in support of mandatory collocation were not convincing. It stated that no one has shown why the line-drawing process between switching and transmission equipment would be unmanageable or that collocation is necessary to ensure fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of interconnectors by LECs. The Commission's tariffing and general nondiscrimination requirements should provide sufficient protection against unfair or unreasonably discriminatory LEC rates and practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Pricing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. The Commission concluded that LEC provision of CIC and OZZ data to TSPs from LEC end offices will constitute a new service under the price caps regime, which covers all Tier 1 LECs. New services add to the range of options already available to customers. While LECs currently transmit CIC and OZZ codes to their own access tandems, they do not provide this information to their customers. Therefore, these data add to the range of options of LEC customers and hence represent a new service. While LECs appear to be able to provide this new service without implementing new technology, the need_or absence of need_for new technology does not dictate the categorization of the service under price caps. Rather, this factor affects the costs and thus the price that LECs may charge for a new service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

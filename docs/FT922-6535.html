			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Names fail to win freeze on deposits NAMES failed yesterday in a new bid to obtain injunctions preventing Lloyd's from drawing down on their deposits to meet insurance losses. At the same hearing in the High Court, Lloyd's was granted its application to contest an earlier decision allowing the Names to apply for a judicial review of Lloyd's. Six Names connected with the Gooda Walker Action Group were seeking the review and had appealed for the injunctions pending its result. This is the second time within six weeks that Names have failed to win injunctions preventing Lloyd's from drawing on the deposits that all Names must lodge. Last month an application by more than 800 Names was rejected. A third group of Names in the Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group is persisting as part of a broader action. In the US on Thursday Mr Ronald Riley won a temporary injunction in Denver, Colorado, pending an appeal against a ruling in favour of Lloyd's. Mr Peter Nutting has resigned as chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party, which groups together representatives of action groups, after a dispute with advocates of more militant action.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING A NAME;  </P> <P> FARYNIARZ USES FAST START IN TRAINING CAMP TO BECOME A FAMILIAR FACE IN RAM  DEFENSE  </P> <P> Some questioned why the Rams opened rookie camp a week sooner than the rest of  the league with only one of their 14 draft choices signed, forcing some  second-year veterans to report a few days early just so the team had enough  players to run routine practice drills with faceless free agents.  </P> <P> What's the use? Why not save a week's worth of operating costs and use the  money, say, to sign some draft picks?  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson has a quick answer, though he can't spit out Brett  Faryniarz's name fast enough. You try it.  </P> <P> "All you have to do is realize, as I told these guys, that Brett Faryniarz was  in this group last year," he said. "Nobody knew how to spell his name. I still  don't."  </P> <P> Faryniarz (pronounced Fair-i-nez) was a free-agent outside linebacker from San  Diego State who ended up making the 45-man roster, a longshot comparable to  Orlando winning the NBA title next season.  </P> <P> With all the time and money pumped into scouting combines and draft research  these days, talented players rarely fall through the cracks.  </P> <P> But Faryniarz did. And if not for that first week of rookie camp, before  attentions were turned to high-priced draft choices and veterans, Faryniarz  figures he'd be in the real world today, working some 9-to-5 shift.  </P> <P> The first week of camp is a free agent's only real chance to make a name. Even  if it's a funny-sounding one.  </P> <P> "It may have been an attention getter to some extent, a name like that,"  Faryniarz said. "They refer to you as that guy over there with the weird name."  </P> <P> No one wants to be John Doe when there's a football team to be made.  </P> <P> So what's it like to be a new free agent in town, a player who never received a  signing bonus and was overlooked through 12 rounds of drafting scrutiny?  </P> <P> "Very lonely," Faryniarz said. "The day I flew in was the day I met my first  person on the team. You got all the young veterans, they know each other. The  rookies (draft choices) know each other from (mini) camp. All of a sudden  you're here, and everyone's talking to everybody. And I don't know anybody."  </P> <P> He remembers being issued uniform No. 63b, not even a linebacker's number. And  when exactly did they start using the alphabet on jerseys?  </P> <P> "That wasn't fun, but that's part of being a free agent, I guess," he said.  </P> <P> Faryniarz knew he needed to make some noise in a hurry. Getting pushed around  in practice was a one-way ticket out of camp. Faryniarz made sure he got  involved in a few scrapes, just to raise some eyebrows. Maybe he'd get lucky  and even get yelled at.  </P> <P> "I was thinking, whatever I do, I'm not going to let people push me around," he  recalled. "I'm going to have a lot of pride. I was trying to play intense and  show the coaches. I kind of picked up on what they wanted to see."  </P> <P> Slowly, he climbed the depth-chart ladder: 10th string, ninth string, eighth  string, seventh string. . . .  </P> <P> Luckily, Faryniarz, a converted defensive end and pass-rush specialist, arrived  at a time when the Rams were switching defenses to a five-linebacker scheme and  were in need of outside pass rushers.  </P> <P> If Faryniarz was anything, he was quick. He made a few big plays in a scrimmage  against Dallas. Another big break came when the Rams decided to release Woody  Vann, a special teams star who hadn't progressed much as an outside linebacker.  </P> <P> "I heard from a few vets that they let Woody go for me," he said. "Maybe it was  true. If it was, I was flattered at the time, because there were still three  weeks to go."  </P> <P> Three weeks until the final cut, that is. Faryniarz had somehow survived the  summer, helping himself with quarterback sacks in exhibitions games against  Denver and Houston.  </P> <P> As the countdown continued toward the final cut, Faryniarz was confident he had  impressed but, as he said, "Once the coaches get in that room, anything can  happen."  </P> <P> On Monday, Aug. 29, 1988, Faryniarz nervously awaited word on the final roster  decision. He was waiting at the Quality Inn in Anaheim with free agent David  Diaz-Infante. Faryniarz was sure both had made the team. Then Diaz-Infante got  a phone call telling him he'd been released.  </P> <P> "I was on my way out, walking down the hallway and I hear my phone ring,"  Faryniarz said. "Right when I picked it up, they hung up. So I put it down and  I went to the elevator, and there were about six guys in there with their heads  down, and I'm acting normal, thinking maybe I made the team. And they said,  'Yeah, we got the phone call.' And I go, 'Oh, bleep.' "  </P> <P> Faryniarz went to practice anyway, figuring he wasn't leaving until someone  ordered him off the complex.  </P> <P> When he arrived at the front gate, he saw Ray San Jose, the Rams'  administrative assistant in charge of giving players the bad news.  </P> <P> "He's at the front gate and comes walking up," Faryniarz said. "And I'm looking  at him. Now, he's either going to say, 'OK, Faryniarz, get your playbook,' or  he's going to say, 'Hey, how ya' doing.' And he said 'How ya' doing' and I  said, 'Just great!' "  </P> <P> Faryniarz walked through the gates into paradise.  </P> <P> "It was like walking down that aisle, where you go from the Russian border to  the American Embassy," he said. "I was thinking, 'Are they going to shoot me or  what?' "  </P> <P> They didn't shoot. Instead, they gave Faryniarz No. 51, a real linebacker's  number. Dick Butkus' number.  </P> <P> "It meant a lot because I wasn't just kept around because I was paid such a  high bonus or anything," he said. "They had no strings. I could have been  terminated as fast as they got me. It meant a lot to me that they released some  people that they put some money into to keep me. I've always been like an  underdog, and it's kind of fun."  </P> <P> He played mostly special teams during the season, but managed one game-saving  sack to preserve the Rams' 12-10 victory over the Saints in New Orleans.  </P> <P> On third and three at the Rams' 10, Faryniarz sacked quarterback Bobby Hebert  for a six-yard loss with 4:01 left, forcing the Saints to settle for a field  goal, which left them two points short of victory.  </P> <P> "That was the highlight play in my life," he said. "I had something like that  in college, but this is the pros. Everyone sees it."  </P> <P> Faryniarz is glad he never gave up on himself, despite the opinions of  well-paid draft analysts.  </P> <P> "I had my doubts as a free agent," he said. "I thought I should have been  drafted, but once they pass you by, you think, 'Well, maybe they do know what  they're doing when they draft, so you got to respect that.' But there are  always a few you overlook."  </P> <P> The few and the proud.  </P> <P> "I think I was missed because I was only about 215 pounds the spring before my  senior year," he said. "That's when the scouts came out and timed us and  weighed us, so they figured I was underweight as a pre-combine list or a future  draft choice."  </P> <P> That's old news. The important thing was that Faryniarz fought hard and made  the team. Maybe next year the coach will get his name right.  </P> <P> "Robinson still calls me FARINYERZ," he said, not complaining a bit.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The team added fifth-round cornerback Alfred Jackson and eighth-round guard  Warren Wheat to the list of signed draft choices, leaving seven unsigned. It's  a big seven, though, with two first-round picks and three seconds in that  group. The Rams also announced the signings of free agent tight end Gary  Knudson from Arizona State and runing back Vince Weathersby from the University  of Washington.. . . Until the arrival in camp of Greg Bell and first-round  choice Cleveland Gary -- and it may be awhile -- second-year runners Gaston  Green and Robert Delpino will share the tailback position. Delpino played  fullback last season, but Coach John Robinson wants to expand his options. "We  really want to see Delpino as a runner," he said.  </P></p>

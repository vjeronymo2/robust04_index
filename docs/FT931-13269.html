			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Secretaries' language skills 'not important' COMPANIES are increasingly unconcerned about whether their secretaries are able to speak a foreign language, a survey shows. The survey, by Gordon Yates Group, covered 500 employers in central London. It found that 34 per cent thought that linguistic skills are of 'no importance' in hiring secretaries. Only 16 per cent believed it was of 'considerable importance' while half said it was of 'limited importance'. The lack of interest shown by London's companies in employing secretaries who are versatile in a foreign language has grown over the past 12 months, according to the survey.

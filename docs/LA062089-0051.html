			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Weyerhaeuser Selling Unit: Tacoma, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser Co. is selling its  profitable gypsum wallboard business. The move is another in a series of sales  by Weyerhaeuser to divest itself of businesses that "fall outside the company's  desired strategic focus." The timber company announced at its April 20  shareholders meeting that many operations would be sold. The gypsum mine and  wallboard facility in Briar, Ark., is the third-largest such facility in the  United States, with annual production capacity in excess of 600 million square  feet and annual sales of more than $35 million. The plant employs 223 workers.  </P></p>

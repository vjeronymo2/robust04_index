			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PIRU;  </P> <P> 2-STORY 'BULLDOG' WATCHES MOVIE SET  </P> <P> Hollywood movie companies continue to turn rural Ventura County into their back  lot, this time by constructing a 24-foot-tall bulldog crouching beside a road  near Piru.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Pictures has re-created a 1930s eatery -- complete with bulldog  clenching a barrel pipe in its jaws and a sign that says, "Bulldog Cafe --  Eats."  </P> <P> The building at Newhall Ranch is a set for "The Rocketeer," a movie about a  young aviator. The picture, starring Bill Campbell, is scheduled to be released  next summer.  </P> <P> Production designer Jim Bissell said the studio came to Piru because it lacked  space on its lot. The ranch's vegetation made it a perfect location for the  set, he said.  </P> <P> Bissell said the set re-creates a street scene in the San Fernando Valley  during the 1930s, and the cafe is a replica of one once located at 1153 W.  Washington Blvd. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's very much in keeping with the kind of nuttiness that was L.A. in the  '30s," Bissell said.  </P> <P> The recently completed structure is composed of a durable foam material formed  over chicken wire and plywood.

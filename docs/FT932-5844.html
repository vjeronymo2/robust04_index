			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / US growth picks up after pause: Purchasing index shows weak expansion in manufacturing THE US purchasing managers' index climbed back above 50 per cent last month, indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding weakly after a pause in April. Separate official data for personal incomes and construction spending, however, showed no rise in April relative to March. The latest figures are consistent with consensus forecasts of a modest economic rebound in the second quarter, after weaker-than-expected growth at an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent in the first period. The first quarter's weakness was partly due to a sharp decline in net exports, which reduced the growth rate by nearly two percentage points. The rapid increase in imports in the opening period is expected to slow down in the current quarter, greatly reducing the drag from a poor trading performance. The purchasing managers' index rose to 51.1 per cent last month, against 49.7 per cent in April, but remained well below its average level in the first quarter. A reading above 50 per cent generally indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding. Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said the latest survey pointed to lower inflationary pressures and a modest rise in industrial orders. The level of order books, however, was not yet sufficient to support a vigorous expansion of production. Most components of the index were mildly encouraging. The index for production rose from 51.8 to 55.8 per cent and the new orders index climbed from 51.1 to 53.5 per cent. However, the employment index fell to 43.4 per cent, its lowest level since January 1992, suggesting that prospects for manufacturing employment remain dismal. The Commerce Department said personal incomes stagnated in April, after rising for the previous four months. Consumers, however, dipped into savings and increased cash spending by 1 per cent relative to March. Officials said the income figures were distorted by a fall in farm subsidies and by a rebound in rental incomes that had been depressed by winter storms in March. The underlying trend was for a gradual rise in personal incomes, but not at a rate to support rapid growth of consumer spending.</p>

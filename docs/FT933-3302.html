			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Poles' link with Nato will raise spending POLISH membership of Nato will necessitate growth in defence spending, according to a deputy defence minister. Mr Przemyslaw Grudzinski said yesterday that costs of re-arming Polish forces to match Nato's equipment would need an increase in defence spending to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, against a defence budget of 2 per cent of GDP at present. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato's secretary-general, said last week that the defence alliance was 'not a closed shop' and that the time had come 'to open a more concrete perspective to those countries of central and eastern Europe which want to join Nato and which we may consider eligible for future membership'. Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, made similar comments. Poland, along with Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, is pressing for a clear statement of intent on membership at the January Nato summit in Brussels. However, Mr Grudzinski warned any debate on the issue ahead of Polish elections on September 19 would hurt the country's chances of joining as it would signal a lack of resolve. 'The decision to press for Polish membership of Nato has already been taken and there is no alternative,' he said. Poland's defence budget stood at about 35 per cent of 1986 spending levels when Poland had an army of 450,000, Mr Grudzinski said. The armed forces now numbered 230,000. A mere 10 per cent of spending was going on new equipment, against about 36 per cent under the Warsaw Pact, he added. A spending increase in preparation for Nato membership would be a blessing to the country's hard-pressed defence industry. It would also mean access to western technology and companies.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo On the face of it, yesterday's fall in Lasmo's share price suggests that Enterprise's improved bid is expected to fail. If it were thought likely to succeed, Lasmo's share price would not stand at a 10 per cent discount to the value of the all-paper offer. Arbitrage would close the gap, either by pushing up Lasmo's share price or by driving down Enterprise's. But it is still early days and it would be a mistake to write off Enterprise's chances entirely. Lasmo shareholders will have to think hard before dismissing the offer. On the positive side, the new terms amount to offering Lasmo investors a 44.5 per cent share of the combined group. That compares with the 40 per cent offered in the original bid. Though independent analysts have different views about the relative asset values of the two companies, 44.5 per cent is at the top of the range. Enterprise will have its work cut out to persuade investors of the bid's merits. Lasmo shareholders will need good reasons why they should surrender paper in a company which is recovering from years of poor management and is highly geared to movements in crude prices. Moreover, overhanging the whole bid is Enterprise's inability to demonstrate any added value from putting the two companies together. That means either Lasmo's shareholders or Enterprise's look like suffering if the bid succeeds, and perhaps both.</p>

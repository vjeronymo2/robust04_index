			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Polish Election: 'Feel bad' factor threatens Poland's reformers - Despite economic success, free-market parties are trailing in the polls OVER the past four years Poland has been transformed from an economic basket case into what will almost certainly be the fastest-growing economy in Europe this year. Yet the two political parties which have done most to steer Poland through the grinding process of economic transformation - the Democratic Union (UD) of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister, and the free market Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) of former prime minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki - are both trailing in the opinion polls. Mindful of the Clinton campaign's exhortation to concentrate on 'the economy, stupid' both parties have sought, ineffectually, to capitalise on the positive aspects of Poland's economic performance. A stern-looking Ms Suchocka stares down from a poster with a caption reading weakly 'The economy comes first', while the KLD is running a campaign praising foreign investment and promising a million new jobs over the next three years. But, in spite of the overwhelming visual evidence of brightly lit shopping streets, a boom in new car, colour television and washing machine sales, a rash of new hotels and a million and a half private entrepreneurs hustling for business in a 60 per cent privatised economy, a bemused electorate is being bombarded by propaganda from a plethora of right- and left-wing opposition parties which portrays an economy in ruins run by criminals or incompetents. This bizarre dichotomy leaves Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister whose 1990 shock therapy reform strategy abolished subsidies, made the zloty internally convertible and set the economy on course for recovery, unsure whether to laugh or cry. 'The problem is that even successful reform carries a high price,' he sighs. Sitting in the spartanly furnished Warsaw offices of the Foundation for Economic Education, set up specifically to create greater economic awareness among non-specialists, the principal author and executor of Poland's reform programme adds: 'The shift from disguised to open unemployment alone generates much discontent.' In Poland's case official unemployment has risen from practically zero, when factories and offices were full of full-time smokers, drunks and tea-makers, to 15.4 per cent of the workforce, over 2.8m people in August. But even the high and still rising unemployment rate does not tell the full story. More than 8m Poles out of a population of 39m now receive a pension from the state. Pension subsidy payments have risen from 4 to 24 per cent of spending over the past four years. This is largely due to a sharp rise in invalidity pensions which were doled out to middle-aged workers in heavy industries such as steel and mining to smooth their dismissal. Such workers were formerly the proletarian heroes of communist propaganda, with higher than average pay and perks. Statistics showing that pension payments have risen simply do not wash with these unemployed former workers in the grim housing estates of the industrial cities. They are unable to buy the cornucopia of consumer goods now on offer and suffer the additional indignities of being splashed by the new rich as they zoom past the dilapidated tram stops in their shiny imported cars. But envy and relative deprivation are not the only factors working in favour of a resurgence in electoral support for the revamped former communists of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the dissipation of votes among a gaggle of hysterical nationalists, irrational populists and rabid anti-communists who will fail to leap the minimum 5 per cent vote hurdle needed to enter the new parliament. Around 40 per cent of Poles still live in rural areas. Farmers in particular resent the unfair competition from a European Community which restricts access to Polish farm goods by both tariffs and thinly disguised protectionist moves such as this year's ban on meat imports from eastern Europe after a small outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Balkans. The former communist-aligned Peasants party (PSL) is pulling in support on the basis of a pledge to build an EC-type tariff wall around Polish farmers to recoup their falling incomes and protect them from unfair subsidised EC competition. 'The EC has a doubly malign influence on Polish politics. Unwillingness to open the European market to sensitive goods like steel and textiles raises unemployment, while the level of EC protectionism permits critics of the pro-market Liberal Democrats (KLD) in particular to accuse them of naivety and ignorance of the real world,' Mr Balcerowicz says. The timing of the unplanned, early elections is also unfortunate for the ruling parties. The enormous political capital built up by the Solidarity movement by its victory over the communists in 1989 evaporated fast. Solidarity disintegrated in a welter of unseemly personal squabbles as realisation dawned that the institutional changes needed to consolidate the transition to a market economy would be both long and painful. For many, the pain still outweighs the gain. Rising output has been accompanied by soaring productivity gains of around 11-13 per cent this year. But growth only resumed a year ago after three tough years of overall decline. Real wages, which the World Bank estimates dropped by 3 per cent net of tax in the 12 months ending July, remain very low while prices have soared to world levels. The 'feel bad' factor cannot have been alleviated by economic developments since the dissolution of parliament at the end of May. On July 5 the caretaker government introduced valued added tax with a 22 per cent top rate and on August 27 it devalued the zloty by 8 per cent in an attempt to boost declining exports and compensate for the import boom which preceded the introduction of the tax. (A 27 per cent rise in imports and a 7 per cent drop in exports led to a record Dollars 1.4bn trade deficit over the first seven months.) Technically, the smooth introduction of VAT, and the broadening of the tax base which results from it, will help to improve the sustainability of the economic recovery. Higher revenues will also help Poland keep within the IMF guidelines necessary to attract foreign investment and finance a future Dollars 12bn debt reduction and rescheduling agreement with the commercial banks. In the short run however the combination of higher taxes and devaluation will add to the squeeze on incomes and make it difficult to reduce inflation from around 35 per cent a year at present. Which is why, as election day looms on Sunday, the government parties look gloomy, and the reformed communists are quietly expecting to become cock of the electoral roost.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (AFP)--China defended Thursday [17  February] its detention of five foreign missionaries, including  three US citizens, saying they had violated sweeping new laws  introduced this month to control religious activity. The three  Americans and two Indonesians had "conducted illegal religious  activities," in violation of new regulations governing religion  which took effect January 31 and restrict the religious  activities of foreigners in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin said.    Wu did not specify the nature of the activities, nor did he  refer to two Hong Kong Chinese who were also detained February  11 in central Henan province after attending an outdoor  Christian prayer meeting. All seven missionaries -- led by  Reverend Dennis Balcombe, a Mandarin-speaking evangelist and  pastor of the Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong -- returned  to the colony on Tuesday. The fate of three local Chinese  detained at the same time remains unknown.    Wu said the local security officials had carried out  "investigation, interrogation and detention" of the foreign  missionaries in accordance with Chinese law, and had issued  stern warnings. Balcombe, a frequent traveller to China, also  had his visa revoked, Wu added. In a statement Wednesday,  Balcombe said cash and property worth thousands of dollars had  been taken by police from the group during their ordeal, during  which the Hong Kong Chinese were also beaten and pulled by their  hair.    "These people have acknowledged that they had violated  Chinese laws and made guarantees that they would not conduct  such activities anymore," Wu said.    They were believed to be the first Christians detained under  the new regulations which prohibit foreigners from cultivating  religious disciples in China and setting up religious offices or  schools. While foreigners may bring in religious material for  their own use, any materials which have contents harmful to  China's social public interest are banned.    The regulations "embody the principle that China's religious  bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign  domination," Wu said, adding that foreigners would not be  allowed to "harm the social public interest or interfere in  China's religious affairs." Although freedom of religion is  guaranteed in the Chinese constitution, the communist government  has waged a constant campaign to prevent the spread of all  faiths and limit contact between domestic and foreign religious  organisations.    "As long as foreigners abide by the Chinese laws, they will  have no trouble at all," Wu said. Well aware of the important  role played by the church in the downfall of eastern European  communism, religious repression -- including torture and  detention of believers -- has intensified since early 1992,  international human rights organisations say.</p>

FDA has prepared this document as, among other things, an adjunct to regulations proposed by FDA on procedures for the safe processing of fish and fishery products.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments by April 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the ``Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide'' may be ordered from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161.

Kraemer, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;400), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;3885. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is in the process of developing a guidance document entitled ``Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide.'' The draft guide is now available to the public through NTIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The guide is designed to serve several purposes. First, FDA anticipates that it will help members of the commercial fish and fishery products industry identify and control potential hazards associated with the fish and fishery products that they handle and process. In addition to human food safety hazards and controls, the guide will address controls associated with quality, marketability, and economic fraud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guide also is designed to help members of the seafood industry develop and implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans for their operations, as will be required if FDA adopts the proposed regulations. The proposed regulations provide that seafood processors and importers must establish HACCP systems of preventive controls to ensure the safety of the food they produce. The guide provides information that processors and importers can use in the development of their HACCP plans. This information consists largely of an identification of hazards that can affect seafood and a discussion of the control measures that can keep these hazards from actually occurring or that can at least minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another purpose of the guide is to help consumers and the public to understand seafood safety in terms of the hazards that are presented by seafood and the controls that can be applied to those hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes that the guide will assist Federal and State regulatory officials in developing uniform and consistent regulatory strategies and controls for seafood. This guide should be useful in the evaluation of HACCP plans and systems by both State and Federal regulatory officials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments concerning the draft Guide were solicited with the announcement of the proposed regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 28, 1994. FDA will study the comments it receives, revise the draft guide as warranted, and then issue the guide. The agency intends to issue the guide by the time that the proposed HACCP regulations for seafood are issued in final form, should the agency decide to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this draft guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments and the draft guide may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received after April 28, 1994, will be considered in the drafting of subsequent editions of the guide, as the agency finds it necessary. FDA will publish subsequent editions based on public comments and as circumstances warrant, e.g., as new knowledge on hazards is obtained or new types of controls are developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael R.

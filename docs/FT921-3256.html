			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Killing turns spotlight on Mafia political links THE links between Italy's ruling Christian Democrats and the Mafia have become an important issue in the Italian election campaign following last week's assassination of Mr Salvatore Lima, the party's most influential politician in Sicily. Magistrates believe the killers of Mr Lima, a European parliament deputy, were Mafia gunmen. But the motives are the subject of intense speculation. The government maintains the killing was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the campaign for the April 5 election. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, has also suggested the murder was an indirect attack on himself since Mr Lima was his pro-consul in Sicily. Indeed, for the past three days Mr Andreotti has been on the defensive, justifying his friendship with Mr Lima and protecting the latter's good name against suggestions of links with the Mafia which are highly damaging to Mr Andreotti. The affair risks bringing under public scrutiny the long-standing Christian Democrat practice of relying on Mafia votes. Another theory for the killing is that the leading Mafia families wanted to show their displeasure over the authorities' tougher attitude towards organised crime. Since the Second World War, the Mafia has been used behind the scenes in Sicilian politics by the Christian Democrats to help fight communism and to maintain the party's share of votes. The collapse of communism has thus reduced the Mafia's political role, while the spread of organised crime throughout Italy has obliged the government to devote more energy and resources to fighting the Mafia. But the most commonly held view is that Mr Lima was murdered in a Mafia settlement of accounts. He is alleged to have long acted as an intermediary in the murky world where politics and organised crime meet. As a former mayor of Palermo, Mr Lima was responsible for the city's new urban plan in the Sixties which encouraged a speculative property boom dominated by the Mafia. At least four times in the Seventies, parliament unsuccessfully tried to investigate his links with the construction business and the Mafia. But he was the Christian Democrats' most effective operator in Sicily and had powerful friends like Mr Andreotti. Indeed, Mr Lima acted as if he was 'untouchable' and was one of the few politicians who felt a body-guard unnecessary. Two magistrates are expected to leave shortly for the US to clarify Mr Lima's connections with the Mafia, questioning Mr Tommaso Buscetta and Mr Francesco Marino Mannoia. The latter are prominent former members of the Mafia, who have been co-operating both with the US and Italian authorities in return for immunity.</p>

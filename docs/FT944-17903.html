			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Nigeria may rotate presidency A constitutional conference organised by Nigeria's military government agreed yesterday the national presidency should rotate between north and south, an issue at the heart of the country's prolonged crisis, Reuter reports from Abuja. The decision, which must be approved by the ruling junta, followed heated argument over power-sharing. 'In view of the controversy, it should therefore be enshrined in the constitution that the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria be rotated between north and south; this will be drafted appropriately in the constitution,' Justice Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, conference chairman, ruled. Northerners, often generals, have ruled Nigeria for most of the time since independence from Britain in 1960. A political crisis ensued after Mr Moshood Abiola, a business tycoon from the south-west, apparently won a presidential election in June 1993 which the general then in power annulled. General Sani Abacha, the present ruler, seized power last November and has touted the conference as a first step towards restoring democracy. Mr Abiola is on trial for alleged treason. Last week, southern states insisted that rotation of power among six ethnic groupings should be entrenched in the constitution. Northern states opposed this, saying it should be left to political parties to ensure they varied their choice of presidential candidates among the regions. Tribal and regional concerns are a delicate issue in the vast country, where more than 1m people died in the 1966-70 Biafra secessionist war. About 47m people live in the mainly Moslem north, compared with 41m in the largely Christian south. The country has more than 300 ethnic groups.</p>

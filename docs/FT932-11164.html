			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softer on US indicators THE DOLLAR remained soft against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday following another set of weak indicators on the US economy, writes James Blitz. In Monday's US trading, the dollar weakened against the German currency after the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported that its index, which measures manufacturing activity, had slipped below 50 per cent in April for the first time since September 1992. The gloom on the US economy was compounded yesterday by news that the leading indicators had fallen by 1.0 per cent, the sharpest decline since 1990. The dollar bottomed out at DM1.5690 before recovering a little to end at DM1.5710, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. In New York it ended steadier at DM1.5745. In Europe, most currencies remained relatively strong against the D-Mark amid continuing signs that the German economic situation was worsening. Western Germany's industrial production figures for March fell 0.6 per cent, while February's decline was revised down to 1.3 per cent from 1.0 per cent. Manufacturing output dropped 1.0 per cent in March, adding to speculation that the Bundesbank will have to cut interest rates aggressively to stimulate the economy. This data helped the French franc peak at FFr3.3670, its highest level since the autumn of last year. It later fell back to close at FFr3.373 from a previous FFr3.370. At the same time, the spread between three-month French francs and three-month D-Marks continued to narrow, and was yesterday at only 9 basis points. This is a strong sign of the market's confidence in the franc and its belief that the French currency needs to carry no premium against devaluation. At the same time, both the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder performed strongly relative to the D-Mark, indicating that investors prefer to invest in these currencies instead of the D-Mark. Both currencies were some 33 basis points above the D-Mark inside the exchange rate mechanism grid, having been some 29 basis points higher before the weekend. One strong exception to this trend was sterling, which drifted down against the D-Mark throughout the day. In part, this may have been due to new uncertainty about whether the UK would ratify the Maastricht treaty on European Monetary Union. Yesterday, the speaker of the House of Commons created a possibility for a vote to be held on the Maastricht ratification bill which, if it goes ahead, will almost certainly result in defeat for the UK government. There was some speculation in money markets that the UK might cut base rates again later this month. UK newspapers speculated at the weekend that the next unemployment figures in the UK could show a strong rise. The pound finished at DM2.4675, down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day.</p>

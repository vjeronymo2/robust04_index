Saiget: "Emphasis on Stability </F> Suggests Slower Pace of Reform"]    [Text] Beijing, March 22 KYODO -- The National People's  Congress (NPC) ended a two-week session Tuesday [22 March] with  the Communist Party leadership calling for the thorough  implementation of its central policies while noting the  importance of maintaining social stability.    This year's session, which many political analysts see as  one  of the most lackluster in recent memory, gave its routine  approval to Premier Li Peng's work report which heralded the  market-economic reforms adopted by a high-level party plenum  last November.    However the NPC's call for "the correct handling of the  relationship between reform, development and stability" has  apparently become the motto for what is likely to be a  painstakingly slow reform process, analysts said.    Zhou Zhengqing, a vice governor of the People's Bank of  China, China's central bank, at a NPC-sponsored press conference  last week gave an advance hint of this by saying banking reform  would proceed in tandem with enterprise modernization and that  these reforms would not occur "overnight."    Despite the much-talked-about plan to divide policy and  commercial functions in the five specialized banks, Dai  Xianglong, also a vice governor of the central bank, said that  loans to the loss-making state enterprise sector, a major area  of policy concern, would make up 85 percent of national bank  loans in 1994.    Such a high percentage of policy loans would make it  difficult for the banks to divide and establish commercial  policies, "capable of being responsible for their own risks,"  analysts say.    According to Chinese news reports in 1993, the loss-making  state sector received up to 75 percent of all bank loans and  fixed-asset investment while accounting for only 42 percent of  the country's gross industrial value.    Yang Qixian, a member of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which ended its two-week annual  session Sunday, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he felt it would take at  least until the year 2000 before state-run enterprises could be  called truly modernized.    According to Yang, vice president of the research institute  on China's market economy, total assets of China's state  enterprises amount to nearly 3 trillion yuan (about 350 billion  dollars), while they owe banks nearly 2 trillion yuan, or up to  70 percent of their value.    Dai refused to confirm the numbers, but a report by the  State  Economic and Trade Commission which surveyed state enterprises  in 16 major cities found that such enterprises were in aggregate  debt to the tune of 319.5 billion yuan, while their total assets  only stood at 447.1 billion yuan.    Yang put some of the debt burden on social costs, saying  that  between 20 to 30 percent of the work force at state enterprises  were redundant while up to 20 percent of the people on state  enterprise payrolls were actually retired.    Fast-paced enterprise reform would lead to widespread  layoffs, Yang said, so the reforms must go slowly and the  enterprises must continue to depend on central bank loans if  social stability is to be maintained.    Besides the state sector, the government also must worry  about the over 800 million rural workers, restless for a better  life and already descending on cities looking for jobs with  better pay.    Yang said the government is depending on the service and  private sectors of the economy to develop in such a way as to  absorb excess labor from both the state and rural sectors of the  economy.    He called on the further establishment of a share-holding  system at state enterprises and the sale and bankruptcy of  enterprises deemed incapable of surviving without government aid.</p>

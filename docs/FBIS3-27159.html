			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 21 (XINHUA) -- German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel said today that the NATO ultimatum to  persuade the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from around  Sarejevo had achieved its intended goal.    On a German radio program this morning, he said he was  satisfied with the developments in Bosnia which have seen  virtually all of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons either moved  to a location 20 kilometers or more from Sarajevo or controlled  by United Nations forces.    But the German minister emphasized that the action was just  a  minor step towards future peace and added that fresh political  talks should be resumed immediately.    He also called for vigilance in case the weapons moved away  from the Bosnian capital city appear in other war zones of the  country.    Kinkel expressed his hope that the progress achieved so far  would turn out to be the start of a total solution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict.</p>

The Sooners (18-3 overall, 5-1 in the Big Eight) moved up from No. 4 last  Monday.  </P> <P> "They did an outstanding job today," Sooner Coach Billy Tubbs said of the  Cowboys. "They're physically as good as anybody we've played this year."  </P> <P> Richard Dumas led the Cowboys (13-6, 4-2) with 19 points and 13 rebounds.  Thomas Jordan added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Byron Houston had 11 points  and 12 rebounds. Jordan had 7 blocks, Houston had 6 and Dumas 3.  </P> <P> "The big difference in the game, and to their credit, is they just beat us on  the boards," said Tubbs.  </P> <P> Oklahoma State didn't clinch the victory until freshman Darwyn Alexander made 2  free throws with 22 seconds left for the final points.  </P> <P> Tony Martin, who scored 22 points, gave Oklahoma a 73-72 lead on a basket with  2:50 left. Houston, also a freshman, tied the score with a free throw 13  seconds later.  </P> <P> After Oklahoma's Terrence Mullins missed the front end of a one-and-one with  2:14 left, Houston scored to make it 75-73 with 1:35 left.  </P> <P> Mookie Blaylock had a chance to tie the score with 1:22 remaining, but he also  missed on the first of a one-and-one. Jordan missed a jumper at the other end,  but Dumas got the offensive rebound and passed to Alexander.  </P> <P> Sooner center Stacy King scored 18 points, 6 below his average, and had only 4  points in the final 18 minutes.  </P> <P> Missouri 73, Kansas State 68 -- Gary Leonard's 22 points helped the No. 5  Tigers withstand a rally by the Wildcats in the Big Eight game at Columbia,  Mo., to become the first Division I team to win 20 games this season.  </P> <P> The Tigers (20-3, 6-0) have won 11 straight and are 15-1 since losing to North  Carolina Dec. 3.  </P> <P> Two free throws by Byron Irvin put Missouri ahead, 71-66, with 28 seconds left.

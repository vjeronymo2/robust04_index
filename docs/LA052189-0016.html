			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The powder used in the Iowa's 16-inch gun turrets, where an explosion killed 47  sailors on April 19, may have been stored at dangerously high temperatures  before it was loaded aboard, according to a published report. The  Virginian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star said that cannon charges were stored in  uncooled barges at the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station for five months last  summer while the battleship was undergoing repairs at the Norfolk Naval  Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va. A Navy manual states that exposure to such heat  dangerously accelerates the decomposition of chemicals used to keep the charges  stable. On board the ship, the powder is kept in cooled magazines. A spokesman  for the Naval Sea Systems Command told the Norfolk newspaper that the Navy  investigation was focusing on whether the months the powder spent sealed in the  barges caused it to become unstable.  </P></p>

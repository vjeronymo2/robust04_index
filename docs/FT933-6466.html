			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local authority contracts threatened by transfer rule Sir, One interpretation of the recent employment appeal tribunal decision in Wren versus Eastbourne Borough Council could be that the contracting out of local authority services will be caught by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations. If the local authority work is judged to be a transfer of an undertaking under the regulations, council employees who had previously carried out the work are automatically transferred to the contractor on their existing terms and conditions of service. Such an interpretation would have profound implications for contractors in areas such as building maintenance, and is, in my confederation's view, absolutely wrong. The tribunal's decision in the Eastbourne case simply emphasises the need to take into account the various European cases on the Acquired Rights Directive, from which the TUPE regulations are derived. Whether a transaction constitutes a transfer must be determined in accordance with the circumstances of each case. Both of these principles are already part of the legal framework of the TUPE regulations. Even if, the industrial tribunal currently reviewing the Eastbourne case finds that there was a transfer, such a decision is unlikely to mean that contracts for building maintenance work are any more likely to be caught by the regulations. This is because there are two important points of distinction between this case and the circumstances that apply to most building maintenance contracts: the contractor in the Eastbourne case employed over half the council's staff and took over its premises and vehicles. A transfer of employees and a transfer of assets are two of the most important factors pointing towards a transfer within the meaning of both the TUPE regulations and the Acquired Rights Directive. So it would not be surprising if the industrial tribunal concluded that a transfer had occurred. In any event, this case does not remove the serious concerns felt within the construction industry about the effect of the TUPE regulations on the government's compulsory competitive tendering policy. As things stand, far from protecting employment the TUPE regulations are having the effect of inhibiting contractors from taking on public sector work. This, in turn, is resulting in higher jobless figures in the construction industry. What is needed is the amendment of the European Acquired Rights Directive to make it clear that these regulations do not apply either to the contracting out of work by councils or to the taking over of contracts from insolvent companies. My confederation strongly welcomes government support for such an amendment and wishes to see early action by the European Commission to achieve this objective.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Song-chun] </F>   [Text] A medic of the 20th Infantry Regiment of the Second  U.S. Division, Private Kenneth Markle served in Tongduchon,  Kyonggi Province. If he had not gone AWOL from his unit on 27  October 1992, he would have returned home honorably as a U.S.  serviceman who had completed his duty in a dangerous area. On  that day, however, he committed a heinous crime which will not  easily be erased from the memory of Koreans. He killed a Korean  prostitute working for U.S. servicemen in Tongduchon by hitting  her on the head four times with a coke bottle.    As the mass media reported the atrocity of this incident,  which was referred to as the so-called "murder of Ms. Yun  Kum-i," the public was stirred and denounced the crimes of U.S.  servicemen. Some pointed their arrow of blame to the  authorities of the U.S. Armed Forces, while others held the  government responsible. Those with extraordinary interest in  this incident have even formed a joint committee to cope with it  in an effort to appeal for the revelation of details into the  truth of the incident. Lamenting Ms. Yun's death, the U.S.  Armed Forces authorities in the ROK have made clear that "if the  accused is convicted in an ROK court, we will help send him to  an ROK prison." On 29 April, Private Markle was finally  sentenced with the severe punishment of 15 years of  imprisonment by an ROK court, and he will soon be transferred to  an ROK prison.    Thus, the murder case of Ms. Yun Kum-i has been settled.  But, crimes by U.S. servicemen have not come to a complete end.  While the stir surrounding the murder case has died down,  however, such crimes which had been subdued for some time, are  showing signs of raising their head again. This is  substantiated by the number of cases involving crime by U.S.  servicemen as disclosed by the Report Center for Damages  Incurred From U.S. Servicemen's Crimes, the organization  affiliated with the Headquarters of the Movement for Rooting Out  Crimes by U.S. Servicemen in the ROK (co-chairman: Pastor Chon  U-sop).  <H5>  Writer Choe In-ho Is Also a Victim </H5>   The Report Center opened to provide legal aid activities for  victims of crimes by U.S. servicemen. With headquarters in  Seoul, the center opened on 1 April and keeps watch over U.S.  servicemen's crimes through its ten chapters in areas where U.S.  servicemen are stationed.    In April alone, over 20 cases of various crimes involving  U.S. servicemen were reported at the center. In one case, a man  suffered a broken nose while trying to mediate in a quarrel  involving bullying by a group of U.S. servicemen, and in  another, a man was hit by a hit-and-run car of a U.S.  serviceman. The common feature of these cases is that only the  victims have suffered.    Such a tendency has become more apparent recently. Mr. Cho  Chae-hak, a representative secretary of the Report Center, said:  "Before the first trial on Private Markle was referred to an  ROK court for sentencing, a bloodthirsty atmosphere prevailed,  and U.S. servicemen dared not commit a crime. The U.S. Armed  Forces authorities appeared to be trying to keep their  servicemen under discipline in a bid not to unnecessarily incur  the Korean people's displeasure. The situation has begun to  change gradually, however, and it seems that U.S. servicemen  have returned to their past attitude of callousness and  arrogance."    In fact, as long as the present status continues, we can say  that while U.S. servicemen's crimes become slightly subdued  under certain circumstances, we cannot say that they have been  reduced to the level of "extinction." This is because when a  crime involving a U.S. serviceman takes place, most  aspects--such as procedure and conditions of involvement by the  ROK and US sides, the investigation process, the treatment of  the accused, and retroactive compensation --are stipulated to  the advantage of the U.S. servicemen. This is all the more  convincing in light of the case of writer Choe In-ho who was  practically forced into an early end to his writing career due  to a car accident on the Yongdong Express Way on 21 March.    That accident occurred because the U.S. serviceman who was  driving the military truck on the expressway was dozing. Mr.  Choe In-ho's car could not avoid the charging vehicle as it  abruptly crossed the median strip. Mr. Choe suffered severe  injuries and was hospitalized for four weeks. Fortunately, Mr.  Choe recuperated and was discharged from the hospital some time  ago, but he has yet to be compensated for his completely damaged  car, not to speak of the medical costs incurred, because when  someone is involved in a car accident for which a U.S.  serviceman is responsible, that person must wait at least six  months for reparations such as medical fees.    While Mr. Choe is unlikely to suffer much unfairness  because,  as a leading ROK novelist, he has both the social stature and  ability to readily find the legal means to settle the case on  his own, what would happen to someone who didn't have the same  social status or ability? The answer is "there would be no  choice but to suffer."  <H5>  This Means That We Have Given Up Jurisdiction Ourselves </H5>   This is confirmed if we take a look at the status of U.S.  servicemen's crimes that occurred recently in the Tongduchon  area where six U.S. military camps such as Camp Casey and Camp  Mobile are located. A typical case was that of Mr. Pak  Kyong-nim, a standbar manager in Tongduchon.    Mr. Pak met with an accident last Christmas. After closing  his business that night, Mr. Pak and his co-workers went to a  U.S. servicemen's club in Posan-dong. He was severely injured  by a U.S. serviceman who stabbed the left side of his chin, his  right arm, and the his abdomen. He received 40 stitches. At  that time, Pak and his group were engaged in a gang fight  against the U.S. servicemen. The self-regulating civilian  vigilantes in Posan-dong caught two black servicemen who were  alleged offenders on the spot and referred them to the U.S.  military police detachment. But, that was the end of it. The  ROK prosecutor handed over jurisdiction to the U.S. military on  grounds that the case was minor, and the U.S. military side  released the suspects on grounds of insufficient charges. Far  from getting any compensation, at this point, Mr. Pak does not  even know the names of the offenders.    According to data submitted to the National Assembly by the  Ministry of Justice as part of the former's inspection of the  government administration in 1992, only 12 of a total 338 cases  of U.S. servicemen breaking the law on various occasions such as  in violence, car accidents, or thefts as compiled between  January and August 1992 received severe punishment such as going  to jail or a dishonorable discharge from the military. In view  of this, it is clear-cut what result will be meted out to the  Koreans who have suffered from U.S. servicemen's crimes. Mr.  Chang Tae-won, chief of the self-regulating civil vigilantes in  Posan-dong, Tongduchon, said: "We refer offenders that we  apprehend to the U.S. military police first, but, we have never  been notified by the U.S. Armed Forces of the outcome of such  cases."    Crimes involving U.S. servicemen are handled according to  the  provisions in the Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA] between the  ROK and the United States, which was revised in 1991. According  to this agreement, the ROK side has primary jurisdiction except  for in cases of "crimes committed against United States property  or security" or "crimes committed during the execution of one's  official duties." Therefore, in Mr. Pak's case, the ROK  Government even gave up its natural duty to its citizens.  According to experts, such contradictions originate from the  existing SOFA in which agreed upon provisions such as minutes  and items of understanding impair the legal effectiveness of the  main agreement.    For example, the agreed minutes, which are an addendum to  the  main agreement, stipulate that even if there is no request from  the United States, the ROK shall not ask for the primary  jurisdiction from the U.S. side "for swift handling of the  cases." This means that the clause for 'automatic  relinquishment of jurisdiction,' which was written out in 1991's  revision, has been revived. Furthermore, the agreed minutes  stipulate that "in the event that a representative from the  United States is not present, the statement made by a suspect or  the accused shall not be adopted as evidence for conviction."    Professor of International Law Yi Chang-hui (Hankuk  University of Foreign Studies) has firmly said that the 1991  revision of the SOFA is insubstantial. He said that, excepting  severe crimes such as murder or rape, the ROK Government is  still unable to exercise its jurisdiction and its rights to  direct investigation over U.S. servicemen's crimes because of  the various "exceptions," such as the minutes that were agreed  upon. While the stir surrounding the murder of Ms. Yun Kum-i  abates, crimes by U.S. servicemen are raising their head once  more as if to jeer the insubstantial SOFA provisions. Professor  Yi is going to hold a large-scale public hearing this July with  a view to attracting public attention to the revision of the  SOFA.</p>

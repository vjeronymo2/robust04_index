			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Feltrim Names reject Lloyd's settlement The prospect of any immediate settlement of the legal actions facing Lloyd's of London faded further yesterday when loss-making Names on the Feltrim syndicates voted overwhelmingly to reject the insurance market's Pounds 900m settlement offer. The Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market  -are the third large group of loss-makers to turn down the offer in the last two weeks. Their rejection makes it unlikely that Lloyd's will assemble the 70 per cent majority - by value of the offer - necessary for the settlement deal to be declared unconditional next month. Without this, Lloyd's will face continued legal actions. Names' leaders believe that errors and omissions insurers, who cover Lloyd's agents for negligence awards, would be able to fund improved compensation. The 1,650 Feltrim Names taking legal action have been offered Pounds 237.5m against losses to date of Pounds 599m. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, described the amount as 'substantial' and warranting 'serious consideration'. However, the absence of any cap limiting Names' liability for losses still to be reported was a 'structural deficiency'. In addition, Names who agreed to the deal would give up their rights to take legal action in the future. 'You will have no defence and be entirely at the mercy of Lloyd's,' said Mr Hook. The vast majority of about 1,000 Names at yesterday's meeting supported a motion that the offer was not enough to 'outweigh the risks and disadvantages of acceptance'. Mr Hook estimated that by pursuing legal action the Feltrim Names could obtain between Pounds 310m and Pounds 425m in damages. 'I have to believe that Lloyd's expects this offer to fail and have held something back in reserve for obvious areas of improvement,' he said. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, said last week that the offer was final. Earlier this week, more than 1,000 Gooda Walker Names voted to reject the offer by a majority of five to one.</p>

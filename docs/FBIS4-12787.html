			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--Exiled Christian opposition  leader Michel 'Awn has called for factions opposed to the  Syrian-backed Lebanon government to set up a congress in Paris,  in a move which could sour relations with France.    The congress would pave the way for a "legitimate  representative body for the Lebanese people because it is now  impossible to organise any political activity in Lebanon to  confront the occupation," General 'Awn told AL-NAHAR newspaper  on Wednesday [13 April].    "As long as Syria maintains its presence in Lebanon, the  country's stability will be in jeopardy," 'Awn was quoted as  saying by AL-NAHAR.    Supporters of 'Awn said the renegade Lebanese army general  announced earlier this month that a committee was to be set up  to prepare for a "Liberation and Renewal" congress to be held in  Paris on June 11.    A government official told AFP any political activity by  'Awn  would be a clear violation of an agreement with France, which  has granted him political asylum since 1991.    Lebanon feels that France is not respecting its engagements  and the relations between the two countries could suffer, said  the official who declined to be identified.    On Tuesday Lebanese pro-Syrian Labour Minister 'Abdallah  al-Amin said Lebanon was planning to ask France to extradite  'Awn, warning ties could worsen if Paris turned down the request.    'Awn was granted political asylum in France after he was  banished from Lebanon in 1991, on condition he avoided any  political activity.    The Lebanese army officer led a military government in the  late 1980s that had refused to step down after presidential  elections. He had fought Syrian troops in a "war of liberation."    But 'Awn was driven out of the presidential palace in a  joint  Syrian-Lebanese offensive, ordered to stay out of Lebanon and  refrain from political activity until 1996.    Syria maintains some 35,000 troops in Lebanon, where Israel  also occupies a self-declared "security zone" along the  international border.</p>

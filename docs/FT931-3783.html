			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Profits roll in - Directors' transactions DIRECTORS are seizing the opportunity of a buoyant stock market to take some very significant profits on their shareholdings. A classic example is Gresham Telecomputing. Michael Whitaker bought 600,000 shares at 10p last year, just before they started to motor. Since then, directors have taken profits repeatedly; Whitaker himself sold 100,000 at 56p earlier this year. The latest sales by Steve Purhase and Sidney Green were of 1m and 2m at 75p; they retain almost 50m between them. Tadpole Technology came to the market in December last year when the shares were placed at 65p. Its share price performance since then has been little short of staggering. With the company already capitalised at Pounds 56m, Howard Kitchner, a non-executive director, has sold 100,000 shares at 308p. Four weeks ago, he sold a total of 72,000 at around 290p, but he still holds 660,000.

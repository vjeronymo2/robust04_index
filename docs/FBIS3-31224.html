			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State Secretary Geza Entz, chairman of the </F> Office for Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, by Jozsef  Botlik; place and date not given: "We Cannot Count on a  Spectacular Breakthrough"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Botlik] Prime Minister Peter  Boross received representatives of ethnic Hungarians living  abroad on 11 February. How did the Office for Hungarians Living  Beyond the Borders participate in the preparation of this  meeting and what made this meeting timely?    [Entz] Given the nature of our office, it is our primary  task to keep contact with the organizations of ethnic Hungarians  abroad. Regular contacts are held with the heads of  organizations of ethnic Hungarians abroad at a prime ministerial  level and at the level of other government officials, and this  means the implementation of the constitutional obligation of  this cabinet. The fact that the mother country and the  Hungarian Government deal with the issue of Hungarians living in  the neighboring countries has a stabilizing effect in the  region. If we did not do this and failed to take up this  responsibility, the deterioration in their situation would carry  the danger of an advance of extremist forces, and this would  definitely destabilize the situation.    With the current meeting, the old-new government also wants  to express our political continuity, a continuity that cannot be  broken even by the upcoming elections, given the basic national  interests involved. [passage omitted]    [Botlik] Is there any division of labor between your office  and the Foreign Ministry?    [Entz] It is the task of the Foreign Ministry to keep  contacts with governments; our task is to cooperate with various  organizations of the civil society, namely with the Hungarian  communities living in the neighboring countries and with  Hungarian organizations and churches all over the world. We  regard these communities as partners in solving the  international and domestic administrative tasks that affect  them. It would be a mistake to treat the issue of ethnic  Hungarians abroad as a foreign affairs issue only, because it  practically affects the activity of every ministry in one way or  another. Naturally, we offer partnership to the neighboring  countries in these matters too, and there are countries that  accept this offer and there are countries that do not yet accept  it. Obviously, the decisions made in the various government  spheres must form a uniform whole. It is our main task to  coordinate these various activities. [passage omitted]    [Botlik] Where did you start from in analyzing the situation  of Hungarians living abroad?    [Entz] We cannot disregard the fact that, with the Trianon  Treaty of 1920, some 3.5 million Hungarians found themselves  citizens of neighboring countries. These Hungarian communities  are native inhabitants and have been playing an important role  in shaping the civilization of those areas for centuries. If  the real needs of this Hungarian minority are disregarded and if  the regime and logic of these states aim at eliminating these  communities by various milder or tougher forms of ethnic  cleansing, up to genocide, then one must declare that this is  the real source of the tension. It is also the fundamental  interest of the other nations that have been living together  with the Hungarians for centuries to treat the issue of the  Hungarian minority positively, because only this approach can  create the conditions for a fruitful cooperation and, in a wider  sense, the bases of equal European integration. [passage omitted]    [Botlik] Could a dialogue emerge between the government and  the Hungarian political parties in Slovakia?    [Entz] There are no realistic chances for such a thing in  the current situation; however, there will surely be such a  development in the long run. The Slovaks and Hungarians are  interdependent, and this must emerge in Slovak politics sooner  or later. We would like to see such a development as soon as  possible.    [Botlik] With what neighboring countries are there  possibilities of strengthening bilateral relations and improving  the situation of the Hungarian minority?    [Entz] We can hardly count on a spectacular breakthrough in  this respect. The current situation is the result of decisions  made in this century, decisions opposing the interests of  nations living in this region. It is characteristic of the  situation that, in our region, nations that came out as victors  in wars are now in the worst situation. This is definitely not  good for Hungary. The fact that most of our neighbors are more  unstable and their economy is also more unstable than ours  hinders the assertion of the nice principle of making the  borders traversable. This is not a matter of subjective  decision; this requires the implementation of considerable  market economy and social conditions. If these conditions are  not there, the borders will continue to be difficult to traverse.    [Botlik] The fate of the Carpathian Euroregion clearly shows  the problems....    [Entz] Yes, we can have no illusion regarding the complete  openness of borders in the near future. We do not have to fear  a Balkans-type conflict leading to armed violence in the region,  but we do have to consider an economic stagnation, something  that represents a constant crisis. This is mainly the reason  for difficulties in improving relations. On the other hand, the  extremist manifestations of national state ideas play a role in  the region, and this represents a serious political obstacle.    [Botlik] In view of your recent talks with the heads of  Hungarian organizations abroad, what chances do you see in  improving the situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad?    [Entz] For example, there is not a large-scale immigration  of Hungarians from Slovakia into Hungary, or brain-drain, or any  other negative process. However, the same type of problems are  of worrying size in Romania. Emigration from the Subcarpathian  region has also become considerable lately. Unfortunately, some  countries continue their traditional policy toward national  minorities. Serbia regards Hungary as a long-term strategic  partner, and this could work in peacetime. The need for  Slovakia and Hungary to cooperate is obvious.    [Botlik] The Hungarian public is mainly focusing its  attention on our eastern neighbor and Transylvania....    [Entz] Unfortunately, in the case of Romania, this need for  cooperation is not so obvious. For example, in the eighties,  when the CEMA was "flourishing" and cooperation was so  "excellent" that some people are sorry for the collapse, our  eastern neighbor occupied 16th place among Hungary's trade  partners, and the same position is valid today. Lasting  political trends can be clearly seen from economic indicators.  In this situation, when economic contacts are so insignificant,  every element of interstate relations easily becomes political,  especially if there are organizational frameworks for this.  This is why hysterical waves play an important role  occasionally in Hungarian-Romanian relations, just like in the  past. As long as there is no change in such basic issues, we  cannot expect much better things from the future either.  [passage omitted]</p>

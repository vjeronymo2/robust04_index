			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE SHOWED UP LATE BECAUSE HE HAD PRESSING PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Whenever a player from the Dominican Republic is late for spring training, the  patented excuse is that he had visa problems. Baltimore's Jay Bell, brother of  Toronto's George Bell, has come up with a new one.  </P> <P> Wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer when Bell finally reported a week ago Thursday:  "He told the Orioles he couldn't leave before then because his wife had sent  all of his clothes to the cleaners."  </P> <P> Gearing up: From ESPN's Chris Berman, who will step out of the studio to call  today's Dodger-Padre game (blacked out in L.A.): "It'll be like driving a  stick-shift car. I haven't driven one in 10 years, but I'll be able to find the  clutch."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What college has had three 70-foot shotputters?  </P> <P> What a kid: At the Loyola Marymount basketball banquet, Paul Westhead said of  Paul Westhead Jr., who served as a third assistant coach this season: "He came  up to me after our success this year and said, 'Dad, last year you had the same  players, the same staff and ran the same system. So I guess the only real  difference was me.' "  </P> <P> Add Westhead: Of departing seniors Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, he said, "They  took more shots than most teams. Correction, Jeff took more shots than most  teams."  </P> <P> More Westhead: As for next season, he said, "Well, for starters, we lose 87  points a game from three players, but then, as you might imagine, we've got  lots of players with lots of shots they are just waiting to get up."  </P> <P> From the baseball bible: From Moss Klein's 1990 forecast in the Sporting News:  "California's Mark Langston will have a decent year, probably in the 17-9 range  with a lot of strikeouts, but Chuck Finley will be the best left-hander in the  league."  </P> <P> No sweat: From Philadelphia's Charles Barkley, shrugging off Friday night's  114-104 loss to New York: "We don't have to worry about facing them again,  because if you know anything about sports, they won't get by Boston in the  first round."  </P> <P> No tears: From Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun, noting that the Indianapolis  Colts are getting little sympathy as they wrestle with the Eric Dickerson  problem: "When General Manager Jim Irsay said Dickerson's complaints were a  slap in the face to the fans, Bob Ley of ESPN said, 'Jim Irsay talking about  fans. Just thought you fans in Baltimore would like to hear that.' "  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Texas A&amp;M. Mike Stulce threw 70-6 1/4 indoors to join Randy  Matson (71-5 1/2) and Randy Barnes (71-9 1/2) as Aggie 70-footers.  </P> <P> Quotebook: San Francisco Manager Roger Craig, asked if the pot belly that  shortstop Jose Uribe added over the winter has affected his range: "No, but it  takes him a little longer to tie his shoes."

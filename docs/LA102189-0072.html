			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA GROUNDS PILOT WHO PASSED OUT AND CRASHED IN ATLANTIC OCEAN  </P> <P> The head of the Federal Aviation Administration has grounded Thomas Root, the  pilot who was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean after passing out at the controls  of his plane three months ago, the agency announced Friday.  </P> <P> Root, a Washington communications lawyer, said that he will comply with the  suspension of his medical certificate by FAA Administrator James B. Busey.  </P> <P> But he said: "I don't need the FAA to tell me it would be dumb to fly." Root  said he does not know what caused him to lapse into unconsciousness on July 13  while his plane flew on autopilot for 800 miles until it ran out of fuel.  </P> <P> Busey took the action because Root has refused to supply all relevant medical  documents, including psychiatric records from his treatment in Hollywood, Fla.,  after his flight, the FAA said.  </P> <P> Root suffered from a gunshot wound that he said must have occurred when a  pistol he kept in the cockpit discharged, apparently as the plane hit the water  off Bermuda. However, the gun's manufacturer has said it is not possible that  the gun could have discharged in that manner.  </P> <P> Root said that he no longer owns a plane and has not flown since the incident,  which occurred during a business flight from Washington, D.C., to Rocky Mount,  N.C.  </P> <P> "It would be a very foolhardy thing for me to do to go flying without knowing  what caused the blackout," Root said.  </P> <P> In a letter dated Wednesday, FAA counsel Donald P. Byrne ordered Root to  surrender his pilot's medical certificate, which is required, along with a  pilot's certificate, in order to fly.  </P> <P> Root's pilot's certificate was not suspended, and he said that, if allowed, he  would try to keep it current by flying with an instructor.  </P> <P> Byrne told Root that the administrator had ordered the suspension as an  emergency measure and that "safety in air transportation or air commerce  requires the immediate effectiveness of this order."  </P> <P> The letter said that Root had 10 days to appeal to the National Transportation  Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.  </P> <P> Root has challenged in court the board's effort to obtain his psychiatric  records, contending that Florida law protects their confidentiality. He said  that turning them over to the FAA probably would waive his right to deny their  use to the safety board, because both are government agencies.  </P> <P> Root's attorney, Gene Propper, said that the hospital had refused to release  the psychiatric records but had inadvertently sent them to the safety board,  along with other medical documents.  </P> <P> Propper said that the records cover a mandatory interview Root had with a  psychiatrist before he was released from the hospital.  </P></p>

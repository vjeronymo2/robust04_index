			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Just the sound of Bush's voice lifts stocks - Wall Street PRESIDENT Bush finally made an impression on the stock markets this week. Speaking to the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday afternoon, Bush outlined his 'agenda for economic renewal,' which included spending cuts and an across-the-board tax cut of 1 per cent. As soon as his words reached Wall Street, investors started buying stocks heavily, and by the close of trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average had registered a 33-point gain, its best showing since July. This was a distinct improvement on the last time the President made a big speech. That was back in mid-August at the Republican convention in Houston. Although his words that night raised spirits on the convention floor, they went down like a lead balloon on financial markets. The following day the Dow plunged 51 points and the dollar fell out of bed with a big bump. So what did the President do right this time? It was difficult to tell at first glance, primarily because his Detroit speech included little that he has not said before - spending and tax cuts have been at the heart of the Republican campaign since mid-summer. Rather than applauding what he said, the market seemed to be applauding the fact that he said it. Investors have been distressed these past few weeks by Bush's inability to make a big and sustainable dent in Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the polls. Concern about the outcome of the election has been one of the chief factors restraining enthusiasm for equities. To Wall Street, Thursday's speech showed that the President has finally hit on what could be his most potent weapon come polling day in November - the differences between his and his rival's fiscal policies. If the Republicans hammer away at the message that their man stands for tax and spending cuts, whereas the Democratic candidate stands for tax and spending increases, then the President has a decent chance of winning re-election. Nothing, of course, is that simple, least of all this year's election campaign, which has sent so many confusing signals that the investors have almost given up trying to make sense of it all. Uncertainty and confusion is the enemy of any financial market, and if Bush's speech can help focus voters' attention on the defining difference between the Republican and Democratic candidates, then a 33-point bounce is justified. Thursday's rally, however, was not just about the Bush speech. The dollar rose more than one pfennig to DM1.425 in the afternoon on reports that US aircraft had intercepted an Iraqi fighter over the 'no-fly' zone in northern Iraq. Although no shots were fired and the Iraqi aeroplane quickly withdrew, the incident was disturbing enough to send investors scurrying for the safety of the dollar. The currency's advance buoyed equity investors, who have been waiting for the dollar to stage a recovery from its recent bout of the blues. Stock market sentiment was also aided on Thursday by the latest falls in interest rates. During the week the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to just over 7.23 per cent, its lowest level since 1986. Although over the past year low US interest rates have not kick-started the economy as they normally would after a recession, investors have not completely forsaken their belief in the stimulative powers of cheap credit. Somewhere down the line, they say, low interest rates are going to feed through into economic growth. Even if investors were not overly impressed by the political and economic fundamentals of the market - the election, the dollar and interest rates - they could draw comfort from technical indicators. According to Investors Intelligence, a newsletter that tracks market sentiment, the number of investment professionals that are bearish about the outlook for the market rose sharply this week to the highest level seen so far this year. Given that increased pessimism among investors often precedes a market rally, the latest figures on sentiment may be a sign that the market is ready to break out of its summer doldrums. It did not go unnoticed that the last time bearish sentiment was stronger than this week's measurement was mid-December last year. That low point turned out to be the market's floor for 1991, and within a week investors went on a buying spree which lasted more than a month and sent the Dow to a succession of record highs. A repeat performance would be most welcome, although conventional wisdom suggests that the chances of the market engineering a sustained bull rally in the last two months of a confusing, and probably close, presidential election campaign are slim.  -------------------------------- Monday       Closed Tuesday     3260.59  -  21.34 Wednesday   3271.39  +  10.80 Thursday    3305.16  +  33.77 Friday      3305.70  +   0.54  --------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] received a North Korean message on Friday  but its contents were deemed insufficient for the IAEA to send  inspectors to observe the changing of fuel rods at the  5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, spokesman Hans Meyer said.    Pyongyang sent the message in response to IAEA  Director-General Hans Blix's letter to North Korean Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam urging the communist state to accept the  agency's conditions for the presence of IAEA inspectors during  the refueling process.    As of Friday, the IAEA had no information on whether North  Korea had already changed nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt  reactor, Meyer said.    Meyer confirmed that the North Korean message from Foreign  Minister Kim addressed to Blix came by telex Friday.    Based on the message's contents, however, the IAEA could not  send inspectors to North Korea, Meyer said.    "The North Korean response to conditions (set by the IAEA)  was unsatisfactory," he said. "And it did not provide grounds  for the IAEA to send inspectors to North Korea."    The IAEA will study the Kim Yong-nam message in detail and  take follow-up steps, he said.    Meyer added, however, that he did not know whether Blix  would  send another letter to North Korea.    Asked to confirm a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement  that the country planned to go ahead and change the fuel rods  and whether the work was already underway, Meyer said he had no  information on these matters.    In his letter to Kim Yong-nam last Tuesday, Blix warned that  if North Korea changed the fuel rods without an IAEA presence,  it would constitute a grave violation of the nuclear safeguards  agreement.    IAEA sources noted some progress in IAEA-North Korean  negotiations, saying Pyongyang told the agency it was willing to  allow additional inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory  and maintenance work on equipment the IAEA installed last March.    But such headway means nothing if the problem of inspecting  the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor remains unresolved, they  said.    Although IAEA observation of the refueling at the 5-megawatt  reactor was not specifically mentioned in the statement issued  by the U.N. Security Council president, the work constitutes "a  core item" in the nuclear safeguards agreement.    Therefore, if the IAEA cannot witness the changing of the  reactor's fuel rods, it will not be able to check the true  nature of North Korea's nuclear program, diplomatic sources said.    The agency reportedly feels it has reached a dead-end in its  negotiations with North Korea and that the United States must  find a breakthrough in dialogue with Pyongyang, they said.</p>

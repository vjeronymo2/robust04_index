			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / GEC Avionics wins Pounds 300m stealth jet computer order ORDERS WORTH more than Pounds 300m to supply flight computers and cockpit display equipment for the next generation of US stealth fighter aircraft will be announced today by GEC Avionics. The deal will make the company the only large British supplier for the new US Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) to be built by a consortium including Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, which was selected by the US Pentagon on Tuesday. It also comes on the heels of another contract announced yesterday by GEC Avionics, which is the aerospace subsidiary of the General Electric Company. That contract is to supply the primary flight computer system for Boeing's new wide-bodied commercial airliner, the 777. Mr Brian Tucker, GEC Avionics managing director, said the potential value of the combined ATF and Boeing 777 contracts was more than Pounds 500m over 15 years. He added that the orders were initially worth Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m for the fighter work and more than Pounds 45m for the Boeing 777. Boeing has so far received launch orders for the 777 from United Airlines and All Nippon Airways. The US is planning to commission 650 ATFs, expected to cost Dollars 65bn (Pounds 38bn) over the next two decades, which would make it the largest ever aerospace contract. 'The ATF deal places us on both the next generation US tactical fighter programme and the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme,' Mr Tucker said. The UK company has been contracted to supply display and flight control systems for the EFA and has prime responsibility for the European three-nation Tornado military aircraft flight control system. It also supplies computer systems for the European Airbus commercial aircraft programme. GEC-Avionics, which is based at Rochester, Kent, where it employs 5000 people, will develop and supply the ATF's pilot's head-up display system, the pilot's side stick controller and the vehicle management system which includes the computer fly-by-wire flight controls, hydraulics and environmental control. GEC Avionics has become the world's largest supplier of head up display systems, which enable pilots to see at eye level all their flight manoeuvres and weapon aiming. Mr Tucker said the US, the world's biggest aerospace market, now accounted for about 60 per cent of his company's exports. Two other British companies, Smiths Industries and Hawker Siddeley, have won this month substantial orders to supply components for the new Boeing 777.</p>

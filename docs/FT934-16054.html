			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Injunction over Ladbroke lifted THE High Court yesterday lifted an injunction obtained by Ladbroke, the hotel and leisure group, against The Mail on Sunday after the newspaper undertook not to publish certain allegations without giving the company written notice. Ladbroke obtained the injunction on September 25 after it had discovered that rumours were circulating regarding the group's relationship with its bankers and the circumstances of the recently announced retirement of Mr Cyril Stein, its chairman. The group said the rumours were 'entirely false' and 'highly damaging'.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Perfect pitch for the Associated Board Richard Morris (left), until last year a managing director of Hodder and Stoughton, is taking over as chief executive of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (AB) from the beginning of next year. He succeeds Ronald Smith, a former County of Avon schools music inspector, who will have been in the job 10 years when he retires at the age of 64. 'We were looking for someone who combined a rather greater commercial experience with a deep and genuine musical interest' says Sir John Burgh, AB chairman. A charitable body, the AB sets music exams in the UK and overseas, and now has an annual turnover close to Pounds 12m. With his unusually varied career, Morris, 47, tunes in well with the Board's requirements. A qualified solicitor, who spent five years in corporate finance at S G Warburg, he moved in 1979 to Hodder, the independent book publisher with a line in popular fiction including Jeffrey Archer and Stephen King. He rose to become joint managing director in 1989, responsible however for the educational and academic publishing side. He left last June - three months after a major wave of redundancies at Hodder - saying he felt he had 'reached a ceiling'. Hodder is still run by direct descendants of the Hodder family; Philip Attenborough is chairman and his brother Michael was the other md when Morris was there. Also a professionally trained operatic bass, the AB's future boss has been on the council of Kent Opera, and 3 years ago co-founded Almaviva Opera, which introduces children to classical opera. Hence his interest in 'becoming the chief executive of something that had an educational purpose'. The AB made considerable strides under Smith's stewardship - including expanding the number of pupils taking exams and broadening the range of instruments examined. Morris wants to build on a new training and advisory side, as well as to expand abroad - particularly in America, where, in contrast to the success in South East Asia for instance, the Board has yet to make its mark.</p>

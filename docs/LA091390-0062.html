			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FURLOUGHS URGED TO LIMIT JOB CUTS IN TORRANCE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Torrance school officials and two unions representing non-teaching personnel  are exploring a furlough program as a way to minimize layoffs of blue- and  white-collar workers in the Torrance Unified School District.  </P> <P> The issue arose as the district trimmed nearly $1.5 million from its nearly  $80-million budget and eliminated 39 jobs. Meanwhile, contract talks are  continuing between three unions and the district.  </P> <P> Public discussion of furloughs -- days off without pay -- as a cost-saving  mechanism came up at Monday's board meeting, attended by dozens of grim-faced  school workers who crowded into the room or watched on a television set in a  nearby hallway.  </P> <P> At the end of the meeting, the board authorized a cost-cutting package that  included axing the 39 jobs, some through attrition and the rest through  layoffs. It also voted not to fill two other jobs and demoted 12 employees.  Thirty-day notices to the workers being laid off will be mailed shortly,  administrators said.  </P> <P> No teachers were affected by the cuts. Teachers must be notified by March 15 of  staff cuts in the coming school year.  </P> <P> The furlough system, which would have to be negotiated between the unions and  the district, received some support during and after the meeting, although  trustees rejected an effort by board member John Eubanks to have it adopted  immediately.  </P> <P> Verna Font, leader of Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union,  which represents 291 maintenance, custodial, cafeteria and other workers in the  district, said: "I highly recommend that (the furlough concept) be brought to  the negotiating table."  </P> <P> And board member Ann Gallagher said in an interview after the meeting: "It's  something that I would think seriously about."  </P> <P> However, board President Owen Griffith and district administrators expressed  caution, saying furloughs are not a cure-all and could create new problems.  </P> <P> To cut $1,459,500 from the proposed 1990-91 budget, the board also dropped most  high school bus transportation and some field trips, reduced the hours of some  classroom aides, cut money for conferences, and suspended behind-the-wheel  driver training.  </P> <P> It was the second major budget cut in months. In March, the board trimmed $1.5  million, eliminating 20 positions and reining in other spending.  </P> <P> The board approved most of Monday's cuts by a wide margin, but before the votes  were taken, workers went to the podium and urged the board to consider  alternatives to layoffs.  </P> <P> "Our aim is to keep our schools a clean and safe place where our children can  learn," said James Pepper, an assistant grounds foreman with the district for  21 years. He said the staff cuts could result in hazards such as broken glass  in play areas and sandboxes.  </P> <P> Some board members, in turn, were apologetic.  </P> <P> "I don't for a moment want to do what I'm proposing to do," David Sargent said  after moving that seven clerical jobs be cut.  </P> <P> Administrators said this week's budget slashing was made necessary by several  factors, including reduced state funding, rising health-benefit costs and a new  county fee for tax services.  </P> <P> In a memorandum, Harvey Oelkers, assistant superintendent for business  services, warned that Los Angeles County may now charge school districts for  the cost of collecting and distributing property taxes -- a fee that could cost  the Torrance district as much as $440,000 a year.  </P> <P> And Gov. George Deukmejian has set the cost-of-living adjustment for school aid  at 3% instead of the 4.76% approved by the Legislature -- a $995,000 loss for  the Torrance district, Oelkers wrote.  </P> <P> On the furlough concept, it is unclear whether board members and union  representatives see eye to eye.  </P> <P> Some workers this week immediately endorsed the idea of furloughs as an  alternative to layoffs. And a few said they would forgo a raise if it meant  that their co-workers could keep their jobs.  </P> <P> "I'd be willing to give up that raise. I think everyone would," said Steve  Ragsdale, a school maintenance mechanic.  </P> <P> One union officer said that last week, at the bargaining table, his union  suggested forgoing a raise and accepting a 10-day furlough -- which would in  effect be 10 days without pay.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, it was a viable proposal. They didn't seem to be  interested," said James W. Durham, first vice president of Chapter 19 of the  California School Employees Assn., which represents district clerical and  technical workers. He said the district prefers "doing away with jobs."  </P> <P> As for the raise, Durham said the district's offer of 1% for clerical and  technical workers is unacceptable.  </P> <P> Supt. Edward Richardson declined to comment, saying: "All of that is a matter  of negotiations. We haven't said publicly what we have on the table."  </P> <P> The district is negotiating with three unions whose contracts expired June 30:  Local 99, Chapter 19 and the Torrance Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TORRANCE SCHOOL BUDGET CUTBACKS  </P> <P>  The almost $1.46-million in budget cuts made by the Torrance school board this  week and the amount saved include:  </P> <P>  * Abolishing nine grounds maintenance jobs: $173,000. Mowing will be done  every other week; trees will be trimmed once every three years instead of  annually.  </P> <P> * Abolishing 15 custodian and master custodian jobs and demoting 12 head  custodians: $295,000. Classrooms will be cleaned less frequently.  </P> <P> * Abolishing six maintenance mechanic jobs: $127,500.  </P> <P> * Abolishing seven clerical jobs: $106,500.  </P> <P> * Reducing hours of instructional assistants in kindergarten through third  grade from 10 to eight hours: $175,000.  </P> <P> * Canceling some field trips for grades kindergarten through 12: $45,000.  </P> <P> * Eliminating virtually all high-school bus service by offering it only to  students living more than 2.25 miles from school: $85,000. The limit is now two  miles.  </P> <P> * Cutting instructional supplies budgets by 10%: $85,000.  </P> <P> The board, in a separate action, suspended behind-the-wheel driver training  because of funds withheld by the state.  </P></p>

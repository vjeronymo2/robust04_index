			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretaries agree with the commenter that there are many existing vehicles, such as Targeted Jobs Tax Credits, of which employers can avail themselves in the context of their involvement as partners in their States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. In the course of providing technical assistance to the various States receiving funding under this competition, the Secretaries plan to inform States of any additional Federal resources, programs, or initiatives that may assist States, partnerships, and members of partnerships, in meeting the goals of the initiative and in implementing their State School-to-Work Opportunities plans. Importantly, there may be instances where it will be possible to use Job Training Partnership Act funds to pay for work-based activities for economically disadvantaged students. Funds awarded under this competition may be used by employers to cover costs associated with the work-based learning component of the program_for example, the training of mentors. In addition, States may develop their own package of State incentives to make participation more feasible or attractive for employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretaries strongly believe that the connecting activities authority will provide significant support to participating employers and to education institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that the notice should permit students to receive some of their school-based instruction in the workplace, regardless of whether the learning experience is paid or unpaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the School-to-Work Opportunities program, students receive academic instruction from teachers at the school setting, while receiving hands-on, work experience, including paid work experience, from workplace mentors at the job site. The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is intended to break down barriers between school and work and to provide States and local partnerships with flexibility to design programs that contain the basic program components within the local context. Assuming that requirements of the three core components are otherwise satisfied, some degree of overlap between the work-based and the school-based learning components, would not necessarily be impermissible, and may, at times, be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that, to serve students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, the Secretaries should add, after ``paid work experience,'' the phrase, ``including supported employment.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See discussion regarding paid work experience and the flexibility surrounding it as well as previous discussions regarding the requirement to ensure opportunities for all students, including disabled students. Also, as previously discussed, funds awarded under this competition may be used to help employers provide necessary support to students, including disabled students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter felt that States should be required to show a broad and industry-wide commitment from employers to ensure that students get the necessary industry-wide exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretaries agree with the commenter that a demonstration of industry-wide commitment to the School-to-Work Opportunities program by any participating State is important toward ensuring that employers are seriously committed to their State's program and that all students are provided with adequate industry-wide exposure. Conversely, employer involvement is important in ensuring that School-to-Work Opportunity programs are responsive to business needs. However, under the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' selection criterion and the ``Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners'' selection criterion, the notice already addresses the commenter's concerns. Under these criteria, States must demonstrate and describe the commitment of employers and of State agency officials responsible for job training and employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that current co-op initiatives in community colleges should be recognized and promoted in the notice. The commenter believes that these initiatives have the established infrastructure to implement school-to-work initiatives, including networks of co-op administrators, job developers, faculty coordinators, career counselors, and employer site supervisors. The commenter stated that community colleges are positioned to link co-op programs between secondary and postsecondary institutions and to improve their quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN READY TO NEGOTIATE, FRENCH TV SAYS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: BUT THE MITTERRAND GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONFIRM THE REPORT. KUWAIT  REFINERIES ARE WIRED WITH EXPLOSIVES, U.S. SOURCES SAY.  </P> <P> French television said Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told  President Francois Mitterrand he is ready to discuss Kuwait, but government  officials said they could not confirm the report.  </P> <P> And in Washington, Bush Administration sources said the Iraqi invaders have  wired Kuwait's refineries with explosives so they could be blown up if the  Iraqis are forced out of the emirate.  </P> <P> The network La Cinq reported in Paris that Hussein sent a letter to Mitterrand  ahead of the French leader's scheduled talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev in Paris on Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> But a Mitterrand aide said he could "find no trace of a letter" from the Iraqi  leader, whose troops took over Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Razzak Hashimi said he had no comment on the report or  on the French government reaction.  </P> <P> "The Iraqi president said he hoped Francois Mitterrand and Mikhail Gorbachev  will spare no effort to find a solution to all the problems of the region, in  particular the Palestinian problem," the television report said.  </P> <P> "He added that he is open to all ideas, to all comments by Mitterrand and  Gorbachev on the situation in the region, including the problem of Kuwait."  </P> <P> It quoted Saddam Hussein as saying: "You will find Iraq ready henceforth to  respond positively to the international community to find a just and peaceful  solution."  </P> <P> It said Hussein had reiterated his "initiative of Aug. 12," which has been  rejected by the international community. It calls for a global solution to all  major Middle East problems but fails to promise an Iraqi withdrawal from  Kuwait.  </P> <P> In Washington, the Administration sources said Iraq has wired Kuwait's four oil  refineries with plastic explosives capable of knocking out the emirate's entire  refining capacity.  </P> <P> Iraq also has placed explosives at other key Kuwaiti oil installations,  including pipeline pumping stations, oil-processing centers and oil wells along  the Persian Gulf, said the sources, who spoke on condition they not be  identified.  </P> <P> The moves appear to be part of a "scorched earth" strategy by Hussein to  devastate Kuwait's economic base in the event his occupying army is forced to  withdraw by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the region, the sources said.  </P> <P> Iraq also is removing large quantities of chemicals, pipes, meters and other  oil-processing and production materials from storage areas in Kuwait for  apparent use in Iraq, the sources said. There is no evidence, however, that the  Iraqis are dismantling oil refineries by removing operational parts, the  sources said.  </P> <P> Members of the exiled Kuwaiti government have said their country's oil industry  is being severely damaged by Iraqi forces, but few details had come to light.  </P> <P> One Administration source said U.S. spy satellites had provided photographic  evidence of Iraqi forces moving Kuwaiti oil industry equipment and materials  across the border into Iraq.  </P> <P> "It's a wholesale cannibalizing," said one American oil industry source who  requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The plastic explosives attached to Kuwait oil facilities would, if detonated,  knock out all refining capability for at least six months, the sources  estimated. It would take at least two years to get the facilities back to full  capacity, they said.  </P> <P> Details about the installation of plastic explosives at refineries and other  Kuwaiti oil facilities have come from Kuwaitis who escaped into Saudi Arabia  and from released foreign hostages, the Administration source said.  </P></p>

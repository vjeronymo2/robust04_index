			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Garcia from "The Nation Radio Newspaper" </F> newscast]    [Text] The National Police [PN] confirmed this afternoon  that two people have died and two others were seriously injured,  all Hondurans. A police report states the dead as Carlos Mejia  and an unidentified Honduran woman, and the injured as Hondurans  Abel and Lorena Dubon Pazos.    The tragic accident occurred 7 km on the Northern Highway,  which was blocked by a bus belonging to the Unidos  Transportation Cooperative, license plate GB-0109. The bus was  participating in a three-day-old strike called by transportation  personnel against the Chamorro administration. The name of the  bus' owner that caused the fatal accident is still unknown.    Commander Franco Montealegre, PN inspector general,  presented  a final count of those arrested in the wake of violent  disturbances involving transportation carriers, which started  early today and lasted until noon today at the PN Station No. 6,  when the relatives of those arrested opposed their transfer to  police installations. The police leader reported 206 arrested so  far. He added that 19 minors, between the ages of 13 and 14  years old, were released.    The cooperatives with the largest number of arrested members  are: the 2 August Cooperative with 12; Jorge Salazar  Cooperative, 22; Ricardo Morales Cooperative, 31; (Arlensiu)  Cooperative, 36; and Democratic Efforts Cooperative, 20. The  police report states that 12 of those arrested do not belong to  a cooperative.    Commander Montealegre categorically denied that the police  fired on the relatives of those arrested at noon today at the PN  Station No. 6. He also denied the police attacked media  representatives:    [Begin Montealegre recording] [Words indistinct] it is said  they used excessive force. Quite the contrary, they faced heavy  resistance during the operation [words indistinct] there are no  injures, as they claim. That is, the police acted prudently. The  police acted in a legitimate fashion. The transportation  carriers' actions [words indistinct] they violate the rights of  others. [end recording]    There are still roadblocks in front of the Sandinist  Barrales-Vallejo Cooperative headquarters at this time. A police  cordon, which was established about 100 meters from the  roadblock erected by the Sandinist cooperative, is still in  place. The military controls the main roads. Police checkpoints  are still in place, and groups of transportation strikers are  still picketing the area.</p>

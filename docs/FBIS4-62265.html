			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of 480 Tajik refugees returned to their  homeland from Afghanistan Thursday via a check-point in Nizhny  Pyanj.    INTERFAX was informed by the Tajik parliament's commission  for refugees that this was the first time in the last three  weeks that refugees had been sent home.    The repatriates are from the Khotlon region (formerly  Kurgan-Tyube) in southern Tajikistan.    The refugees commission said that at least 25,000 Tajik  refugees are still in Afghanistan.</p>

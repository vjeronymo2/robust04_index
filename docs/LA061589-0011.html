			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW TURNOUT IN L.A. ELECTION  </P> <P> If someone told us we couldn't vote, we would be up in arms. Yet on election  day (June 6) I worked at the polls from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and we had 128 voters  out of a precinct of over 650. Truly a disgrace.  </P> <P> On the other hand . . . where do we go wrong? Why doesn't the electorate get  out to vote? Should we have election day on Sunday? Should election day be a  special holiday? I don't know the answers, but it seems to me that there is a  terrible waste of time, effort and money to have a turnout of less than 20% in  our precinct and less than 10% citywide.  </P> <P> MARJORIE L.

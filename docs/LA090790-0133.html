			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COOK WITHDRAWS FROM COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> Former City Administrator Paul E. Cook said Thursday he is out of the City  Council race, even though it is too late to remove his name from the Nov. 6  ballot.  </P> <P> "I'm out, and if by some fluke I were to win on Nov. 6, I won't serve," Cook  said.  </P> <P> "It's a job I do not want. I got talked into becoming a candidate in the first  place, and this week I realized that I just do not want to be on the City  Council."  </P> <P> Until he retired in February, Cook was the city administrator -- the equivalent  of city manager and thus the top-ranking non-elected official in Huntington  Beach city government. A strong advocate of redevelopment, Cook is credited by  the current City Council with getting the gears moving for the building now  under construction in downtown Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Cook said Thursday that business leaders were among those who urged him to get  into the City Council race. "With John Erskine not running again, and the lack  of business-oriented candidates, I was urged to run," he said. "I'm still very  interested in seeing redevelopment go forward, but I don't want to spend  $50,000 of other people's money campaigning for a job I really don't want."  </P> <P> Cook said he still plans to speak out for redevelopment projects, "including  the controversial ones," as a private citizen. He said he believes the  pro-business community needs to be represented, and added that he will be  appearing at City Council meetings and other civic sessions to speak on behalf  of downtown development.  </P> <P> Cook's withdrawal leaves a total of 10 candidates vying for four City Council  seats in the Nov. 6 election.BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico further weakens Equities fell a further 1.7 per cent yesterday as nervous investors continued to take profits on the back of Wednesday's political assassination. Traders said the Mexican Stock Exchange suffered another declining session as no concrete motive for the killing of Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, came to light. Selling of Mexican blue chip ADRs on Wall Street also drove the market down. The IPC index closed 47.31 points lower at 2,717.51, but volume dropped to a moderate 90.3m shares, valued at 1.12bn new pesos. Brazil Sao Paulo rallied 3.1 per cent as domestic and foreign investors returned to the market on bullish sentiment ahead of Brazil's presidential election on Monday. The Bovespa index finished 1,655 ahead at 54,426.</p>

And the pillars of the universe have been  shaken by the gravity of Palestinian suffering and the deep  Palestinian wound, which, whenever about to heal, opens up again  to pour out hot blood [words indistinct] amid bloody sacrifices  to wash away the shame of the world. [words indistinct] who  abandoned God and humanity. May they be cursed. Having them  uprooted from the land has become a duty. [words indistinct].  God is great. The Palestinian blood was spilled in the  courtyard of the Ibrahimi Mosque while those who kneeled for  their God in prayer [words indistinct]. Then, the Zionist  hatred poured down on them in the ugliest form, the lowliest  way, and [words indistinct].    In front of the Israeli Army and under the sponsorship of  the  Israeli Government, and in accordance with accurate planning,  Zionist soldiers and settlers stormed the Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron. They volleyed their machine gun fire on the crowds of  worshipers, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Fifty-three  were martyred instantly and hundreds were wounded. When people  hurried to hospitals to (?rescue) their wounded, the Israeli  Army besieged them, especially in the courtyard of the al-Ahli  Hospital. Five others fell martyrs and dozens were wounded.    Afterward, rage broke out throughout Palestinian territory  --  in Gaza and Jerusalem, in Dayr al-Balah and Janin, in Khan Yunus  and Ramallah, in Rafah and al-Birah, in Nabulus and Bethlehem,  and in all towns, villages, and camps. There, Palestinian wrath  broke out. The Zionist Army and the herds of settlers were lying  in wait. They wounded dozens of people with their treacherous  bullets.    God is great. God is great. This is a black Friday in  Ramadan. This is an ugly massacre in Ramadan. This is an  appalling crime in Ramadan. It was committed by the Zionists --  government and settlers, soldiers and terrorists; all are the  same. They have committed this premeditated crime, knowing that  [words indistinct] that their withdrawal from our territory is  imminent and their days over our soil are numbered.    God is great. God is great. [words indistinct] the wound of  the Ibrahim mosque tells the Zionists: You will inevitably  leave. You will leave. [words indistinct] Long live Palestine.  Glory to the martyrs. Glory to the resisting arms. God's  victory is imminent.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Intercare ACQUISITIONS helped Intercare Group, the healthcare products supplier, increase sales by 63 per cent and pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the six months to April 30. Turnover came to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 10.8m) and profits to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.4m). Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the drop in margins reflected the acquisition of the less profitable optical business, tighter market conditions and the impact of recession in Europe. However, all existing business had lifted sales by at least 10 per cent. The biggest division, which makes mobility scooters for the elderly and disabled, increased trading profits from Pounds 659,000 to Pounds 727,000. Mr Cowan said the division continued to perform well, in spite of the general downturn throughout Europe. This had delayed the development of export markets outside the Netherlands, in particular Germany. The optical products side moved ahead from Pounds 388,000 to Pounds 503,000. This reflected significant expansion of Pennine Optical, and a full six-month contribution from Birmingham Optical. Medical products expanded from Pounds 348,000 to Pounds 446,000. The group has extensively reorganised SAFA, which supplies first aid and healthcare products to large corporate customers, since acquiring it last year. Earnings per share dipped from 4.2p to 4.1p while the interim dividend is increased to 0.7p (0.6p).</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Giordano back in BOC chair BOC Group surprised the market by appointing Mr Richard Giordano as non-executive chairman - only two years after the American stepped down as chairman and chief executive of the UK-based industrial gases and healthcare company. Best known during the early 1980s as Britain's most highly-paid executive, Mr Giordano, 59, started work in January as the Pounds 450,000-a-year non-executive chairman of British Gas. His other non-executive directorships include Grand Metropolitan, RTZ, Lucas and Reuters, although he intends to reduce this number. BOC said his principal activities and office would remain at British Gas. BOC has appointed Mr Giordano, who had continued on its board as a non-executive, because of next month's early retirement of Mr Patrick Rich, 62, due to health problems. Mr Rich, who had intended to stay on for two more years, recently gave up the post of chief executive to Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer, a 61-year-old American with 30 years' experience of the international gases industry. Analysts said Mr Giordano 'knew BOC inside out', but the appointment looked stop-gap and did not answer longer-term questions about the succession. While at the helm of BOC, Mr Giordano improved productivity and expanded into the Asia-Pacific region, but also made two acquisitions which proved expensive mistakes. BOC last month reported first-quarter losses as a result of an Pounds 85m restructuring provision. The group said pressures on industrial gas profit margins would remain intense until recovery gathered strength. Healthcare profits also suffered. BOC said Mr Giordano's salary 'would entirely reflect the non-executive and part-time nature of the appointment'. Observer, Page 17</p>

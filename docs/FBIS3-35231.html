			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Informed sources said late last night that the  assassin of Jordanian diplomat in Beirut Na'ib 'Umran  al-Ma'ayitah has been handed over to the Jordanian security  organs, which began interrogating him in Amman.    Eyewitnesses told AKHIR KHABAR that a private plane landed  at  Amman International Airport yesterday afternoon. Total secrecy  surrounded the arrival of the plane and its passengers.    Reached by telephone, Interior Minister Salamah Hammad  denied  this report and said: I have heard this from you. I have  absolutely no knowledge of that. He ruled out this development  and said: Thus far, this news report is totally untrue. We are  very busy receiving the brotherly Yemeni delegations in order to  sign the unity treaty.</p>

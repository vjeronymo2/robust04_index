			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: CI shares tumble on trading setback SHARES OF CI Group, the steel and engineering combine, yesterday fell 7p to 14p on news of the planned sale of Societe Metallurgique de Brevilly, its French-based steel rolling mill subsidiary, and a trading update. The decision to dispose of SMB was taken in the light of the current downturn in demand in the European automotive industry. Some 70 per cent of SMB's output is directed to that market and for several years the offshoot has incurred losses. The sale will result in a balance sheet write-down of some Pounds 2.3m. Group trading in the second half had recently shown a 'marked downturn', directors said. Demand and margins for the group's products sold into the late-cycle construction industry had fallen in both the UK and continental Europe. In order to reduce overheads a programme of redundancies had been implemented at a cost of Pounds 250,000. In addition increases in raw material prices had put further pressure on margins across the group. Overall, the directors expected continuing operations to remain in profit for the year to end-January.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Sculpture of the 'savages' - Susan Moore admires a Parisian celebration of Black African art IN THE 19th century, the Nazarenes in Germany and the Pre-Raphaelites and their precursors in England looked to the art of the so-called Primitives as a means of regenerating the art - and society - of the present. In panels and frescoes painted before the invention of complex illusionistic devices of lighting and perspective, they found a sincerity and vigour deemed lacking in contemporary art. The group of 'Primitifs' in JL David's studio in Paris had similarly rejected the polished classicism of their day and advocated a return to a simpler form of art. A century later, comparable reaction to the facile virtuosity of Salon painting and the over-attenuated decadence of Art Nouveau prompted the Paris avant-garde to appropriate African sculpture. Its formal language and expressive power provided a way out of the perceived impasse of Western realism. To ethnologists such as the late William Fagg, it was a 'rude misappropriation'. The Modernists had never been interested in learning from the tribal art that was gradually filling up the new ethnographical museums of Europe. They had simply seized on one of the most conservative and traditional of arts to serve their anarchic and iconoclastic ends. Certainly the Fauves, Cubists and members of Der Blaue Reiter seemed to care little about the function or significance of African sculpture, or to distinguish between works of art and something knocked out for the tourist trade. It is, however, primarily thanks to these artists that objects which were initially viewed as curiosities or artefacts made their way out of the ethnographical museum and into the art gallery. In 1920, the critic Roger Fry, reviewing an exhibition of Negro art in London, probably spoke for an entire shocked and bedazzled generation when he felt forced to admit that so-called savages had produced sculpture that was greater than anything produced here, even during the Middle Ages. It is purely on aesthetic grounds that we are invited to admire the 65 choice pieces of Black African sculpture selected by Ezio Bassani currently on loan to the Musee Dapper in Paris. This exhibition, a version of that shown at the Forte Belvedere in Florence in 1989, is not meant to be comprehensive or didactic. It is a celebration of masterpieces. To that end, considerable care has been taken to show each piece to its best advantage, in both this beautifully, if somewhat theatrically lit exhibition and in its lavish catalogue. (Le Grand Heritage: Sculptures de L'Africa Noire, Fondation Dapper, FFr263). This delectable visual feast opens with a small section of ancient or early sculptures, from Akan terracotta heads and Benin bronzes to the extravagant Afro-Portuguese ivory salts made by the Sapi peoples in Sierra Leone 1490-1530. Disappointingly, there is not one of the great Ife heads that rank among the finest sculptures ever made. The first of many compensations is the imposing and imaginatively stylised Nok terracotta head from 500BC-AD200 Nigeria, glinting with the specks of mica ingeniously fired in its clay. Its technical sophistication seems even more wondrous when one realises that this head was probably once part of a life-size figure. Such is the innate vitality of these and many of the more recent figures and masks that they seem to be imbued with a life of their own. It makes no difference whether the sculpture is naturalistic and particularly expressive of personality, or simplified and abstracted to the austere geometries of Mbole and Ngbaka wooden masks and to the Mahongwe and Kota bronze reliquary figures from Gabon. No wonder the Modernists looked on covetously. The representation of the human figure is the predominant theme of African sculpture. We find ancestor figures created to make contact with the world of the dead and to affirm the right to land or power, and images of spirits or divinities which are characterised by their frontality, a rigorous symmetry and, not infrequently, a considerable serenity and dignity. It is in the ritual masks, however, that the sculptors seem to be allowed their greatest freedom of expression. Bassani has purposely restricted his selection in order to demonstrate the richly varied modes of expression adopted by individual ethnic groups. The show is, more generally, glorious witness to the African sculptors' formal inventiveness and to his instinctive ability to conceive form in three dimensions, emphasising or diminishing volume at whim to create the desired rhythm and effect. A piece such as the remarkable Bangwa seated figure from Cameroon, like all the best sculptures, is interesting from almost every angle and compels us around it. The sculptor showed no qualms about massively elongating the heavily bangled left arm that supports the head: he wanted his figure to remain appropriately erect. Perhaps even more extraordinary to our Modernist-trained eyes is the economy of the top of a headpiece used by members of the Ogbom secret society, where the figure's torso and flanking arms are reduced to three parallel arcs of wood of equal width. There is comparably sophisticated use of 'negative' space in a Kwele mask framed by band of light and air, and in the Mbole figures from Zaire. The latter were hung up on walls as a warning to young initiates of what would befall them if they betrayed the secrets of their 'Lilwa' society. Torso, arms and legs have been pared down to the narrowest of rough, tubular forms. The verticality of these male figures, and the sharp angles of neck, shoulder, arm and knee joints convincingly evoke the posture of hanged men. Le Grand Heritage continues at the Musee Dapper, 50 avenue Victor Hugo, 75116 Paris, until September 15. Tel: (1) 45 00 01 50.</p>

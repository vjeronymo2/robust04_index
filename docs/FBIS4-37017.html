			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay, Gid'on Alon, Eytan Rabin, and Aluf </F> Ben]    [Excerpts] "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO  chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed in their meeting in Bucharest two  weeks before the Cairo agreement was signed that 'Arafat would  visit Temple Mount," Palestinian sources said yesterday.    According to these sources, the agreement was preceded by  exhausting negotiations in which 'Arafat repeatedly raised his  request to visit Jerusalem escorted by armed Palestinian  policemen. The Israelis initially refused his request, but  finally agreed to allow 'Arafat to hold a ceremonial visit to  Temple Mount, perhaps even accompanied by flag-bearing  Palestinian policemen.    Peres stated yesterday that Israel had not received a  request  from 'Arafat to visit Jerusalem. "We do not rush to give  answers to unasked questions," said Peres, who is currently  visiting Ukraine. Sources in his entourage noted that to the  best of their knowledge the reports about an agreement reached  between Peres and 'Arafat during their meeting in Bucharest  concerning the PLO chairman visiting Jerusalem escorted by  flag-bearing Palestinian policemen are not true. [passage  omitted]    Security sources noted yesterday that Jibril al-Rujub, head  of the Palestinian secret service in the territories whose  activities have been confined to the Jericho area, visited East  Jerusalem and the Old City on several occasions over the past  few weeks. The sources expressed their concern about this  occurrence, noting that these visits might cause security  damage. [passage omitted]</p>

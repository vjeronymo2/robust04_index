Civil No. 94&hyph;00345 WDB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response of the United States to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (the ``APPA''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(h), the United States hereby responds to public comments to the proposed Final Judgment submitted on May 25, 1994, for entry in the civil antitrust action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action began on May 25, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the Defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by maintaining and enforcing licenses and other agreements that unreasonably restrict the construction and operation of float glass plants and the use and transfer of float glass process technology within the United States and around the world. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Defendant Pilkington plc violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by wilfully acquiring and maintaining a monopoly in the world market for the design and construction of float glass plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the same day, the United States and both Defendants filed with the Court, pursuant to Section 2(b) of the APPA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b), a Stipulation submitting for entry a proposed Final Judgment, and a Competitive Impact Statement. The proposed Final Judgment embodies the relief sought in the Complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 60-day period provided by Sections 2(b)&hyph;(d) of the APPA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(b)&hyph;(d), which expired on September 1, 1994, the United States received three comments concerning the proposed Final Judgment. The United States attaches hereto a copy of each comment and of each individual response that it made thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the comments were submitted by counsel for PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') and International Technologies Consultants, Inc. (``ITC''), the respective plaintiffs in two civil actions against Defendant Pilkington plc  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> currently pending in this Court. The third comment was submitted on behalf of an unidentified client by a Minneapolis, Minn. lawyer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PPG comment asserts that ``[w]hile the Proposed Final Judgment does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue these [trade-restraining] practices *&blank;*&blank;*. the public interest counsels modification or clarification'' thereof in accordance with eleven specific proposals. The ITC comment states that ``[t]he proposed decree represents an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible license provisions, but unfortunately it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitively eradicate the Pilkington cartel *&blank;*&blank;*'' and proposes two specific changes in it. Both comments quote press statements by Pilkington in justification of their proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to both of these comments the United States initially points out that the sole issue currently under consideration is whether it is in the public interest to enter the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation. Entry is in the public interest if the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bechtel Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1979&hyph;1 Trade Cas.

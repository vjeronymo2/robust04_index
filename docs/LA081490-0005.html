			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRA MURDER OF BRITISH M.P. IAN GOW  </P> <P> The editorial about Northern Ireland and Irish Northern Aid (Noraid), was  confused. Having once shared those convictions, I understand how they  originate: with the British government's disinformation campaign.  </P> <P> When I began writing about the conflict in 1985, British officials were quick  to inform me that Noraid members were just "sentimental." In fact, I found  Noraid members considerably better informed than their critics and that it is  the Irish political establishment which romanticizes the War of Independence  (which was more ruthless than today's revolt).  </P> <P> The British also claimed that Noraid was funding the IRA. When I asked for  evidence and investigated what I was given, I discovered there was not a shred  of proof to support the assertion. There is a very simple reason why Noraid has  never given a penny to the IRA: It is unable to raise more than a fraction for  the needs of the families of prisoners of war.  </P> <P> The only ones hurt by editorials calling for the defunding of Noraid are the  prisoners' families, since the group's critics do not provide this aid (even  though they know that many prisoners are innocent victims of a perverse legal  system). Nor is Noraid registered with the Justice Department as an "agent of  the IRA": This judgment was reversed on appeal because it lacked any supporting  evidence.  </P> <P> This does not mean individual Americans do not contribute to the IRA, but a  statement in Parliament by a former director of British intelligence indicated  that the amount of money from the U.S. is negligible (most coming from the  Irish in Britain whose political outlets are suppressed). The editorial  sanctimoniously invoked the images of democracy, rule of law and the value of  human life to condemn those supporting the insurrection in Northern Ireland but  these same words were used by the political establishment, clergy and media to  condemn the IRA of the 1920s.  </P> <P> The compromises starting with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 have only  perpetuated the tragic illusion of "peace in our time."  </P> <P> SCOTT S. SMITH  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

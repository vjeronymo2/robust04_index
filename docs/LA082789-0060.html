			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT HEAT: THE TALK-SHOW COMPETITION SIZZLES;  </P> <P> AN EXPANSION OF AD REVENUES PROMISES TO ADD EVEN MORE PROGRAMS TO THE  LATE-NIGHT TV AIRWAVES  </P> <P> It's late. The streets are quiet. Doors are locked, teeth are brushed, the cat  has been put outside for the night. Sleep beckons.  </P> <P> But in millions of homes across the country, Americans are shunning sleep,  shunning books and magazines, perhaps even shunning their sleeping partners.  People in more than 25.5 million homes, the vast majority drawn from that  upscale, young-adult, consuming-crazed demographic that advertisers prize, are  spending the midnight hour basking in a blue, iridescent video glow. And the  networks, programmers, syndicators and advertisers are waking up to this fact  in a big way.  </P> <P> As Arsenio Hall, one of the top guns in this war against sleep, might describe  the blossoming late-night scene if it was a guest on his own show: "Johnny  Carson is here tonight. Pat Sajak is here. Ted Koppel is here. David Letterman  is here. Bob Costas is here. Arsenio Hall is here." Hall's energetic,  MTV-generation, in-studio audience would then bark, "Rooof, rooof, rooof," and  collectively crank their fists in the air as Hall chanted his monologue-ending  trademark, now as familiar to some late-night addicts as Carson's golf swing:  "So, let's . . . get . . . busy!"  </P> <P> The late-night television galaxy is busy. Two new stars have joined the fray so  far this year and, with advertising dollars pouring in, it's about to get even  busier. ABC plans to launch its own midnight talk show by next summer, and next  month, "After Hours," a late-night syndicated magazine program from the former  producers of "Eye on L.A.," specifically designed as an alternative to the  nightly talk shows, will premiere locally on KTTV Channel 11.  </P> <P> Statistics from the A.C. Nielsen Co. show that the number of people watching  television between 11:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. has remained relatively constant  over the past two years -- at about 25.5 million homes each night. But with  Sajak and Hall joining Carson, Letterman and Koppel in the battle for viewers  and advertisers, most of that audience -- more than 18.5 million households a  night -- is now watching the unending parade of celebrities and news makers who  troop across the talk show sets.  </P> <P> Advertisers are happy because these programs are luring the young,  free-spending viewers they want their commercials to reach. The networks and  syndicators are happy because the advertisers are paying more for shows that  are relatively inexpensive to produce. And once and future talk show hosts are  happy because soaring ad revenues generate more talk shows (see accompanying  story).  </P> <P> Once upon a time, there was Johnny and only Johnny. For nearly 27 years,  Carson's "Tonight Show" has been king of late night. Would-be challengers,  including Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, Dick Cavett and Alan Thicke, have come and  gone.  </P> <P> Then, in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, ABC discovered that  serious-minded viewers would stay up until midnight for some in-depth analysis  of the day's top news event, and "Nightline" was born.  </P> <P> Exploiting "The Tonight Show's" stranglehold on the late-night audience, NBC  launched "Late Night With David Letterman" in 1982 and discovered that there  was an audience that would stay up until 1:30 a.m. to watch wacky stunts, gags  and insult-ridden celebrity interviews.  </P> <P> Fox tried to break into the world of late night with three different shows,  including one starring Joan Rivers. All three burned out like a wet match.  </P> <P> Looking for a way to solidify its late-night supremacy, NBC then debuted "Later  With Bob Costas" (weeknights at 1:30 a.m.) last summer.  </P> <P> "Late night was a dormant area prior to two years ago," said Michael Brockman,  president of daytime, children's and late-night entertainment at ABC. "It was  taken for granted that NBC had a lock on the majority of the audience. ABC had  been successful with 'Nightline' but that played to a whole different  sensibility. CBS was floundering and decided that it had to do something to tap  into the enormous potential that late night has."  </P> <P> Brockman, who held a similar post at CBS before moving to ABC earlier this  year, developed and launched "The Pat Sajak Show" on CBS last January. At the  same time, Paramount retooled the one glowing element from Fox's late-night  wreckage (Arsenio Hall had had modest success as the short term successor to  Joan Rivers on Fox) and debuted "The Arsenio Hall Show" in syndication all over  the country.  </P> <P> The result: Carson, Letterman and Koppel have slipped a fraction from a year  ago. Sajak is sputtering but surviving. And Hall has become a media superstar  and perhaps the biggest reason why there is a new buzz of late night  excitement.  </P> <P> Though it is difficult to compare ratings for these programs because none of  them actually go head to head in the same time period all over the country,  over the last seven months "The Tonight Show" has averaged a 5.5 rating,  "Night-line" a 4.8 and "Letterman," "Sajak" and "Arsenio" have all registered a  3.2 (each rating point represents 904,000 homes). But "Arsenio" has been  building momentum, beating both Sajak and Letterman with an average nationwide  rating of about 4 in recent months, and occasionally, in some markets on some  nights, beating Carson head to head.  </P> <P> But while there is some spirited competition to be the first to book certain  guests, the shows claim not to be at war with one another. "Nobody is fighting  anybody," says Robert Morton, producer of "Late Night With David Letterman."  "There have always been several other shows on against us and I think they just  bring more people to late night. It helps everybody out. There is no reason why  you can't have two or three shoe stores on 5th Avenue."  </P> <P> Arsenio's Audience: Young, Ethnic and Hip  </P> <P> "In syndication, you have to identify a specific viewer need and then go after  that audience," said Steve Goldman, executive vice president of Paramount  domestic television. "It's like marketing soap. You decide if there is a need  for a specific product and then you try to fill that need. That's what we did  with 'Arsenio.' We identified a specific audience that wasn't being served by  the other late-night shows and went after it."  </P> <P> Young, urban, ethnic and hip -- and apparently waiting for a decidedly def talk  show host -- that audience is buying Paramount's latest box of syndicated  "soap."  </P> <P> "Arsenio" is the show where viewers learn the latest lingo from the world of  rap music. It is the show where Sally Kirkland and Ana Alicia ogle and then  jump into the lap of their debonair host. It is the show on which the host can  get away with asking Brooke Shields if she is still a virgin and author Jackie  Collins can get away with grilling the host about his own sexual history. It is  the show where black celebrities such as Tone Loc, Kool Moe Dee and Dave  Winfield can talk with their host as if they were two black men sharing  confidences in the privacy of their own back yards.  </P> <P> The show has caught on so fast that Paramount has already added a sixth night  each week, a repeat, for stations to broadcast on the weekends. And in several  markets, stations have upgraded the show to earlier time periods where it has  pulled even bigger numbers. In New York, for example, WWOR recently moved the  show from 12:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and it has beaten Carson several times.  </P> <P> Why is Hall, whose show airs locally on KCOP Channel 13 at 11 p.m., thriving in  a marketplace in which so many other would-be-Johnnys have failed?  </P> <P> "Arsenio is the show," said Marla Kell Brown, the program's producer. "He is  such a different talent that there was room for him in the late-night  marketplace. His comedy is so different. It is more physical and has more of an  edge to it. There wasn't much on television for the young audience, especially  in late night.  </P> <P> "Letterman has a young audience but not as young as ours. The only shows with  this kind of youth appeal were on Friday or Saturday nights or MTV. Arsenio  says that it's the kids of Johnny's viewers who are tuning in. In one room the  parents are watching Carson and in another the kids are watching us. We're not  really competing with Carson. It's just another audience."  </P> <P> "This is the audience that goes to movies and buys (records, clothes and  sneakers,)" Goldman said, "and our success in reaching that audience has  finally been perceived by the advertising community. At first the advertisers  were skeptical. They didn't believe we could do as well as Letterman and we had  to scrounge around for sponsors. Now they are calling us. We are virtually sold  out for next season, and I think it's clear that we have brought some  advertisers into late night who weren't here before."  </P> <P> Goldman said that in this blockbuster summer movie season, the studios have  been spending as much advertising money on "Arsenio" as on "The Tonight Show,"  even though Carson attracts at least 50% more viewers.  </P> <P> A Tradition-Minded Sajak Is Struggling  </P> <P> The story of Pat Sajak's talk show is not so jolly, and certainly not so  lucrative. Many television executives say that CBS was making more money with  the hourlong action dramas it aired in the time slot before Sajak, the "Wheel  of Fortune" nice guy, debuted in late night last January. Ratings for Sajak are  significantly less than what the CBS dramas pulled a year ago in such markets  as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sajak, for example, registered only a 2.3  rating and a 10% share of the L.A. audience in last May's sweeps. The previous  May, CBS' late-night dramas scored a 3.6 and a 15 share locally for the same  time period.  </P> <P> Even the optimistic Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, conceded  that revenues for that time period are about the same. But he quickly added  that, with Sajak, the network is in a potentially more profitable situation  because the talk show is less expensive to produce than the action shows.  </P> <P> "And it is a better situation all around for CBS because Sajak creates an  identification for the network," LeMasters said. "NBC has had an advantage for  a long time with Carson and Letterman, and ABC with Ted Koppel. Sajak can build  that sort of identification for us." The question is: How long can CBS endure  mediocre to bad ratings in late night while everyone around them prospers?  </P> <P> "Sajak," the network's first foray into late-night talk since Merv Griffin  tried a show in 1969, opened to good ratings as the curious and his many fans  from "Wheel of Fortune" tuned in to see what the show was all about. But after  a couple of weeks of Carson-like numbers, the audience has been slipping --  down to a recent plateau of a 3 rating each night. One week last month, the  show slipped to a 2.8. Carson gets close to twice Sajak's audience; Hall and  Letterman also outdraw him and have a far more desirable demographic makeup to  boot.  </P> <P> The CBS affiliates who carry the show are antsy. About half delay the program  half an hour, rather than airing it at 11:30 p.m. when late-night audience  levels are at their highest. And in some major markets, including Detroit,  Cleveland and Atlanta (three of "Arsenio's" strongholds), the CBS stations have  decided not to air "The Pat Sajak Show" at all.  </P> <P> Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, recently warned that  Sajak could be pulled from the schedule by year's end.  </P> <P> When talking with a reporter about the condition of his program, Sajak  maintains the same "aw shucks" attitude he presents on screen. "Our goal was to  put on the best show we could, find our core audience and build from there. I  think we have done that," Sajak said. "For us to be a long success, we do have  to demonstrate growth. The leveling out of our audience has happened and I  don't know if it is at a level that CBS or the affiliates will stick with. But  we're not going to make any radical changes. It's not like we touched a hot  stove and we're backing off.  </P> <P> "We wanted to put on the kind of talk show that I grew up watching, Jack Paar  and Carson, fairly traditional. And anyway, there are only so many cosmetic  things you can do: Do I have a couch or a few chairs? Do I sit behind a desk or  not? (Carson, Letterman and Sajak do, Hall doesn't.) Most talk of doing  something different deteriorates into a discussion of furniture."  </P> <P> But Sajak's contention that you can't reinvent the talk show is why many  industry observers believe his show is struggling. His program is just too much  like Carson's.  </P> <P> "We wanted a durable format for the show that would last, one with no tricks,"  CBS' LeMasters said. "We weren't going to start with barking elephants up  front. But maybe we were going head-to-head too much with Carson and allowing  the audience to graze through us to him. We cannot force Pat to go toe-to-toe  with Carson in the monologue. It's an unfair burden we put on him. If he is  forced to compete directly against Arsenio and Johnny, it requires a certain  joke level and timing that probably is not his strength. Pat is warm,  intelligent, a good interviewer, but his personality goes against those  rim-shot jokes."  </P> <P> So changes are in the works. Sajak has already scrapped his opening monologue,  and after a brief "hello," he goes straight to his desk and brings out the  guests. The show has also begun using taped pieces -- something Letterman has  done with great success -- such as Sajak giving a wacky tour of the CBS studio  to two silly tourists. And, LeMasters said, they are going to try a number of  "theme" shows, such as taking the entire program to Washington, D.C., for two  weeks in December, in an effort to force some attention Sajak's way.  </P> <P> LeMasters insisted that despite Stringer's warnings and affiliate skittishness,  Sajak is not going to get the same sort of quick hook that struggling  prime-time shows inevitably receive.  </P> <P> "As long as we stay around a 3 (rating), we're OK," LeMasters said. "If we  slipped down into the low 2s, then we would have to make radical adjustments in  format. We're all neophytes when it comes to late night. And we are going to  take our time and make sure that any changes we make have a long-term benefit  for the show and the network."  </P> <P> Carson and Letterman Leave NBC Smiling  </P> <P> Meanwhile, NBC, the long-reigning champion of late night, watches, worries a  little, checks out its revenues and then, like Mike Tyson, proudly proclaims,  "Bring 'em on, we'll beat all-comers." NBC pulled in more than $200 million in  ad revenues for Letterman's and Carson's two hours of late-night talk in 1988,  according to Arbitron's broadcast advertisers report, and even with the  increased competition, NBC expects to do better this year.  </P> <P> "Our programs have held up," said Bob Niles, a research and marketing executive  at NBC. "Arsenio's success doesn't cannibalize from us. His audience doesn't  come out of our turf. In fact, I think Arsenio and Letterman actually help each  other. They have a similar appeal and the fact that his show is on earlier in  many markets (including Los Angeles and New York), might encourage viewers who  would not have had the incentive to stay up until 12:30 a.m. to watch Arsenio  and then stay up and watch Letterman."  </P> <P> Niles said that Letterman's audience had slipped a bit last year, before  "Arsenio" and "Sajak" hit the air. But the new competition has done nothing to  accelerate that slippage, and this summer, Niles said, Letterman's audience has  grown back to what it had been the past several years. And that young, yuppie  audience is so prized by advertisers that even though Letterman garners just  over half the total audience Carson does, individual spots on the show sell for  only about 25% less.  </P> <P> "We are basically doing what we've been doing for the last 7 1/2 years and  paying little attention to the other shows," said Robert Morton, producer of  "Letterman." He insists that while "Sajak" and "Arsenio" are talk shows,  Letterman's is a comedy program that often features scripted comedy sketches.  Letterman's is not the show where guests are pampered and their latest project  is hawked. Letterman's TV living room is the place where Nastassia Kinski's  funky hairdo is mercilessly ridiculed and where Shirley MacLaine and Cher are  provoked into cussing out their admittedly obnoxious host.  </P> <P> No one from "The Tonight Show" would agree to discuss the current state of the  show or the competition. Fred de Cordova, the program's executive producer for  nearly 20 years, merely typed out this statement: " 'The Tonight Show'  continues to put on what we hope will continue to be the most interesting  guests available; the major stars of motion pictures, television and the  musical world. There have been no changes in this method in all the years I  have been with the show and I see no reason why any change should be made in  the future, because, after all, the prime asset of 'The Tonight Show' sits  behind the host's desk and continues to happily keep a firm hold on the  public's interest and its sense of humor."  </P> <P> The consensus among those involved in late-night television is that no matter  how hot Arsenio Hall gets, no matter how many stories are written about Hall,  Sajak, Letterman or any new challenger, Johnny Carson will be king for as long  as he continues to host his show. This October, Carson will celebrate 27 years  behind "The Tonight Show" desk. There is nothing to suggest that he plans to  give it up any time soon.  </P> <P> Viewing Late Night Through a Crystal Ball  </P> <P> As for the future of late-night talk. . . .  </P> <P> Jay Leno, who hosts "The Tonight Show" one night a week, is ready to take over  on the day Carson decides to retire. More immediately, ABC will roll out its  own talk show, to follow "Nightline," sometime next year. ABC's Brockman said  it will be a "personality-driven" program (read: it will have a host just like  all the others) that will attempt to woo the prized young-adult audience.  </P> <P> ABC had tested a late-night show called "Days End" for two months earlier this  year on several of its stations, including KABC Channel 7 in Los Angeles. The  show was designed as a companion to "Nightline" with both serious and  lighthearted commentary and interviews about the day's current events. It  flopped, and Brockman dumped the experiment.  </P> <P> "The young-adult audience is the most available and most salable at that time  of night," Brockman said, "and the way to win them over is with a compelling,  stimulating program that is driven by a compelling and exciting personality.  The profile of the ABC network shows a healthy mix of that young-adult  audience, so if we can find the right kind of personality for them, we will  have the air time (in prime time) to promote the personality and a good chance  of getting that audience to carry over into late night."  </P> <P> He said that ABC will test several ideas over the next several months before  finally settling on a host and a specific format around the beginning of the  year.  </P> <P> "We will certainly have to come up with something that differentiates us from  all the competition," Brockman said. "It will be a tough battle. ABC has tried  valiantly and struggled in this time period for years. But I believe there is  still a large, untapped audience out there that will enable several more shows  to thrive."  </P> <P> No one knows how many shows can survive in the current late-night environment.  Just a year ago, many would have said there was room for only Carson and  Letterman. Now programmers and advertisers are singing a different tune. Just  two weeks ago, Fox began distributing its late-night Saturday stand-up comedy  show, "Comic Strip Live," to all of its affiliates nationwide. Dennis Wholey  has his own "intimate" call-in talk show, "LateNight America," on 147 public  television stations, including KCET Channel 28, Saturdays at midnight. Byron  Allen, formerly the co-host of "Real People," will debut his own Saturday-night  talk show in syndication next month. And KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman will get  his own show next month too. Even with the odds stacked against them, everyone,  it seems, wants in on the act. And why not? It's a great gig if you can get it.  Just ask the beleaguered Pat Sajak.  </P> <P> "It's only television, and there is no firing squad standing by in case you  fail," Sajak deadpanned. "And it sure beats loading trucks for a living. I get  to come out and sit behind a desk and people I respect and admire come out and  call me Pat. It's pretty neat. I recommend that everyone get their own talk  show. And if things continue as they're going, soon everyone will."  </P></p>

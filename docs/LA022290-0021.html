			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTS OF PASSAGE;  </P> <P> SINCE BEGINNING LIMITED SCHEDULE RUNS LAST SEPTEMBER, THE WINE TRAIN HAS  BROUGHT TOURISTS AND CONTROVERSY TO THE NAPA VALLEY  </P> <P> As the waitress poured the Champagne into the glass, she proudly noted that it  was from Paul Masson. To many residents of the Napa Valley, serving a non-local  sparkling wine, as much as anything, seems to sum up what the Napa Valley Wine  Train is all about.  </P> <P> The excursion train that runs through the famed wine country is a handsome  throwback to an earlier, more relaxed time, when travel meant relaxation,  excellent food and a break from the pressures of the world.  </P> <P> But since it began running last September, the Wine Train has been under siege  from just about every entity in the area. The reasons are many, but most  opponents say the train interferes with the way of life.  </P> <P> During the past few years, the Napa Valley has wrestled with the question of  exactly what a winery is. Residents compare excessive traffic with the desire  for tourist dollars, and conflict between the Mammon of development with the  desire to keep the county agriculture-rural.  </P> <P> Into that charged atmosphere roars the Wine Train, representing to many locals  the worst of evils: development, tourism, noise and hype. Not to mention higher  taxes. And thus the decision of the Wine Train to serve a non-Napa Valley  sparkling wine at brunch smacks of arrogance, said one Napa Valley winery  executive.  </P> <P> "In a nutshell, that sums them up," said the executive, who asked for  anonymity. "They claim they're here to help the Napa Valley preserve  agricultural integrity and yet when it comes time to pour a wine of their  choice, it's something cheap from another wine-growing region. They have no  one's best interests at heart except their own."  </P> <P> "They've just come in here and thrown salt in our wounds," said Norm Manzer,  head of a group trying to legally derail the Wine Train. "To threaten someone  with the type of project like they have is bad enough, but then they did it  without so much as talking with us. From day one it was full steam ahead,  'catch us if you can.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manzer, a State Farm Insurance agent whose office is "within spitting distance"  of the train tracks in St. Helena, and many others are sure they can catch the  train and stop it dead in its tracks. They feel an Environmental Impact Report  will show that the train would destroy the way of life in the Napa Valley.  </P> <P> The Wine Train started Sept. 16 on a temporary schedule, running the 21 miles  from the city of Napa to St. Helena, in the heart of the valley, then back  again. The original idea was to permit visitors to see the vines and wineries  without clogging the roads with cars. Visitors would be able to disembark en  route to visit wineries.  </P> <P> The idea of an idyllic, turn-of-the-century excursion immediately met  resistence from residents in a rare show of unity. It's been said that no two  wine makers can ever agree on so much as the time of day, so the Wine Train is  being seen as unique: the first subject on which almost everyone agrees.  </P> <P> Protesting the smoke from the 1954 Diesel engines, the clatter of the steel  wheels on rails, the whine of the engine's mournful horns, the danger at dozens  of track crossings, the cost to taxpayers and other irritants, locals rebelled.  </P> <P> The winery executive said matters were exacerbated when Wine Train officials  "never talked to us. They just decided to ram this down our throats, whether we  liked it or not." He said Wine Train officials have been arrogant and distant.  </P> <P> "If anyone ever wanted to write a book on how to do bad community relations,  these guys already wrote the book," said one winery owner, who asked for  anonymity because he didn't want to create animosity with neighbors.  </P> <P> John C. (Jack) McCormack, president and chief executive of the Wine Train,  acknowledges the opposition by groups such as Manzer's Friends of the Napa  Valley, which was formed expressly to oppose him. He says the company's timing  was simply wrong.  </P> <P> "Some of the wineries took opposition to the Wine Train to take the heat off  the winery definition question," said McCormack, noting that when the Wine  Train project began in 1985, the winery definition issue was just heating up.  "If we had started a couple of years earlier . . . ," said McCormack, implying  that the train would have been widely accepted.  </P> <P> "Even now you don't find as much opposition (to the train) when you talk to  wine makers individually as when you talk to them as a group," he said.  </P> <P> There is no guarantee the Wine Train will ever run a full schedule, and faces  the possibility its present limited schedule will also be terminated. Local and  state groups are challenging Wine Train's existence in both the State Supreme  Court and in a federal court in Washington.  </P> <P> In a case already extremely complex, the State Supreme Court is to rule soon  over whether the state has the authority to require an environmental review of  the train. And the Interstate Commerce Commission is reconsidering its original  ruling that it has jurisdiction over the train.  </P> <P> One of the key issues is whether the train must submit to the California  Environmental Quality Act. Wine Train officials say that if Southern Pacific,  which owned the right-of-way before 1987, had wanted to expand service here, it  would have been able to do so without scrutiny of an EIR.  </P> <P> Early last year, the ICC ruled that it had jurisdiction over the Wine Train.  This would have given Wine Train the right to operate without restrictions from  the California Public Utilities Commission. Under ICC jurisdiction, trains are  subject to virtually no controls, operating under regulations established in  the past century.  </P> <P> Among the rules that Wine Train officials relish is the one that would not  require the filing of an EIR.  </P> <P> Friends of Napa Valley and the PUC appealed the ICC ruling to the U.S. District  Court of Appeals in Washington. Before that appeal could be heard, the court  last summer ruled in a case involving a small rail spur in Illinois. The court  reversed the ICC decision and gave jurisdiction over the spur to the Illinois  Commerce Commission.  </P> <P> The ICC then requested that it be allowed to review its decision in the Wine  Train case, leading to speculation it will reverse itself.  </P> <P> Evelyn Kitay, an attorney with the office of the general counsel of the ICC,  said the Illinois case is unrelated to the Napa case, but "we issued an order  to reopen the Napa decision in light of the Illinois case," she said, adding  that there "might be a reversal" of ICC's earlier decision. Or ICC could rule  the same way based on new grounds.  </P> <P> A critical question for the Wine Train, Kitay said, is: "Is there a nexus to  interstate commerce?" If not, federal control may not be warranted, she  indicated.  </P> <P> McCormack argues that Wine Train is a carrier of goods in interstate commerce  as well as a feeder line for Amtrak passenger service, and thus it should be  ruled by ICC -- which would free it from having to file the EIR.  </P> <P> Opponents fire back that there is no rail service from the Wine Train terminus  to the nearest Amtrak station at Martinez, some 20 miles south; passengers must  take a bus between the lines. And that there hasn't been a passenger train in  the Napa Valley since the 1920s.  </P> <P> Manzer's group feels that the EIR will show that the train would make a  negative impact on the valley. "If ICC gives jurisdiction back to the PUC, we  will kill the train," said Manzer. "We know that the things that will be found  in the EIR will be unmitigateable."  </P> <P> Because of the crucial nature of the EIR, a group was formed 18 months ago at  the suggestion of the St. Helena City Council called ALERT -- Alliance for the  Environmental Report on the Train. ALERT includes the city of St. Helena, the  town of Yountville, Napa County and five local trade groups -- Napa County Farm  Bureau, Napa County Grape Growers Assn., Napa Valley Vintners Assn., United  Napa Valley Associates and Friends of the Napa Valley.  </P> <P> ALERT attorney Michael Riback said the thrust of the ALERT argument is simply  that Wine Train is not a means of transportation as much as it is a tourist  line.  </P> <P> "In the eyes of ALERT, the Wine Train is not a transportation or commuter  operation," said Riback, "it is a tourist operation akin to the monorail at  Disneyland, where you're taking the ride for the ride's sake, not to get to a  particular destination."  </P> <P> Manzer calls the Wine Train "nothing more than a bar and restaurant on wheels,  plowing its way through the agricultural preserve of the Napa Valley." And he  pointed out that in the local Yellow Pages, Wine Train is listed under  "restaurants."  </P> <P> The EIR, which is being done for Wine Train by a San Mateo company, is due by  August.  </P> <P> In the meantime, a series of public meetings has been scheduled to hear  questions about Wine Train's impact on residents, municipalities, businesses,  the tax structure and the agriculture of the region.  </P> <P> At a meeting last Thursday night at the Yountville Town Hall, about 40 persons  showed up to hear Earth Metrics, a San Mateo company doing the environmental  report on the train, discuss its Proponent's Environmental Assessment.  </P> <P> Then representatives from Napa County, the town of Yountville and the city of  St. Helena all made inquiries of Earth Metrics, asking the company to address  concerns not mentioned in the PEA report. Further meetings were scheduled.  </P> <P> One of the key problems as far as Manzer and others are concerned is the cost  of the train to taxpayers. Friends of the Valley says taxpayers will foot a $6  million bill to pay for improvements to the line, including gate crossings and  a rerouting of traffic along State Highway 29 at Trancas Street in Napa, a  particularly knotty intersection at the north end of Napa.  </P> <P> McCormack, aware of all the arguments against his train, says his organization  will make every effort to keep the valley exactly as it is.  </P> <P> "It is not in our best interests to see the valley turn into a bedroom  community of San Francisco," he says. "We have as much of a stake in keeping  the region agrarian as they do."  </P></p>

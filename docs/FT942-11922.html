			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Probe of attacks on US policy Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ordered an inquiry into public criticisms of US policy towards former Yugoslavia by senior UN officials in Bosnia that were the subject of a sharp protest by the Clinton administration. Mr Boutros Ghali told Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN mediator, that his suggestion the US had become 'afraid, timid and tentative' since the Somalia debacle, was 'completely unacceptable'. In an exchange of letters made public last night, Mr Boutros Ghali informed Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate to the UN, that he shared her 'profound concern' over the affair. Mr Akashi had been told to 'take every measure to ensure that there are no recurrences' on his part or that of other UN officials.</p>

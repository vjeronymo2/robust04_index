			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / S African election talks deadlocked Talks between right-wing leaders, the South African government and the African National Congress appeared to have broken down last night, increasing chances the Inkatha Freedom party will boycott April's all-race elections. Talks are due to resume tomorrow, but negotiators from the government and the ANC said privately they did not expect an agreement. They had hoped to reach a compromise before the weekend, when an Inkatha party conference will decide whether to participate in the poll. If the talks fail again tomorrow, it is likely Inkatha's Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will try to persuade the conference to boycott the elections. Many senior Inkatha negotiators are believed to favour participation, but Chief Buthelezi has said he would boycott the poll unless the constitution is amended to strengthen regional powers. Last night's talks broke down over this issue, with Inkatha insisting regions be granted 'exclusive' powers which could not be overruled by central government, while the ANC wished to maintain overriding powers for the centre in certain circumstances. Inkatha and the white right wing Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) participated in the talks, with delegations from the ANC and government. ANC and government officials left the door open to further talks, even after the weekend. Mr Roelf Meyer, government chief negotiator, said 'the process never stops'. But once the Inkatha conference has taken a decision, it would be difficult to reverse it; with only 90 days before the poll, the party loses valuable campaigning time with any further delay. Negotiators last night held out hope that separate talks with the white right wing might still yield an agreement which would prevent conservative Afrikaner parties from boycotting the poll. They said progress had been made towards agreeing the Afrikaners' demand for a 'volkstaat', or homeland, with the ANC agreeing in principle on a state with some autonomy. The government will also pursue separate talks with the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on self-determination for the Zulu nation. Pretoria hopes to woo the king with promises of protecting his salary and position under a new constitution. In exchange, he would endorse the elections against the wishes of Chief Buthelezi. National party officials argue that an endorsement from the king would significantly undermine an Inkatha boycott, as many Inkatha supporters are conservative rural Zulus whose allegiance is to the Zulu monarchy. Sources close to the king say a separate peace is unlikely. He has followed the political lead of his uncle, Chief Buthelezi, since assuming the throne and is unlikely to break decisively with him now.</p>

Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, on an official  visit to Turkey, held a meeting with General Dogan Gures, chief  of the General Staff. Pointing out that there existed an  agreement on military training between Azerbaijan and Turkey,  Gasanov added that he will hold meetings on this issue.    The guest minister later departed Turkey. Seeing the guest  minister off, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Azerbaijan  was entering 1994 hurt and with problems. Cetin said:    [Begin Cetin recording] If the Armenian forces think they  will hold on to the territories they occupied by force, they are  wrong. We hope they will withdraw from the territories they  have occupied. If they do not withdraw peacefully then one day  they will have to leave those territories under other  conditions. It is impossible that they will hold on to  Azerbaijani territory they occupied by force in violation of all  international regulations. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Lautro reports low standards A QUARTER of the companies inspected by Lautro, the life insurance industry's watchdog, in the year to June 1992 did not have procedures adequate to ensure that suitable advice was provided to clients. Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro's chief executive, said: 'I don't think standards are where we want to get to.' He added that the shortcomings of companies had often come from lack of understanding rather than deliberate neglect, but added that after five years of the self-regulatory regime '25 per cent is too high a failure rate'. The annual report of Lautro's monitoring committee also shows that complaints increased by 17 per cent from the previous 12 months, from 4,069 to 4,763. The number of 'significant' complaints passed to Lautro members for action increased from 1,332 to 1,999, the report shows. Lautro's findings are the result of its programme of 136 periodic inspection visits to members during the 12 months covered by the report. Most of the companies inspected were life insurance companies because the regulator's main concern at present is with sales forces. The total number of sales representatives registered by Lautro to give investment advice has declined in the past year from nearly 200,000 to about 170,000. A new series of inspection visits will start next month, and continue for 30 months. Mr Jebens said the figures pointed to a considerable improvement in standards in the industry, and added: 'While it is impossible to guarantee that no salesperson or member will ever put a foot wrong again, we can say with some confidence that the probability is greatly reduced and that the quality of advice and client handling has improved very significantly.' He cited an independent report into one life company's client questionnaires as evidence. The report said that in mid-1988 75 per cent of these questionnaires had been inadequate to provide financial advice. By last year this had fallen to 20 per cent.</p>

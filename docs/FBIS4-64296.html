			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, has said that the Turkish Cypriot Government  and Assembly must reassess the Cyprus policy together with  Turkey.    Addressing a visiting delegation from the Turkish Cypriot  Fighters Association, Denktas said that the failure to reach an  agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] shows that  as long as it is recognized as the legitimate government of  Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Administration will not sign an  agreement with the Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas said that it was wrong for UN special envoy Clark to  have declared the collapse of the talks on the CBM's while in  the Turkish Cypriot sector. Denktas recalled that the Turkish  Cypriots conveyed their proposals on four main issues to the  Greek Cypriots, but the latter rejected them. Denktas said:  The announcement about the collapse of the talks should have  been made in the Greek Cypriot sector.</p>

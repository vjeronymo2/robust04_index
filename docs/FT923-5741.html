			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is always room on the schedules for a soap based in a hospital and Nurses could provide another hit for Channel 4 and its policy of buying the best of American soaps. The first of 22 episodes goes out at 10 pm and in its favour is a script by the undisputed Queen of the genre, Susan Harris, whose previous credits include the eponymous Soap and The Golden Girls. This one is set in the casualty ward of a Miami hospital and its success depends upon whether you get hooked on the well-differentiated, slightly oddball, characters. Tax concessions have covered much of northern Britain with conifer trees. Survival Special (ITV, 8 pm) penetrates these new forests to track one of the rarest of our indigenous birds, and the largest true hawk, the goshawk, which in its protected environment successfully swoops down and eats other animals. So rare is the goshawk that the producer keeps the site of the filming secret. Edinburgh Nights on BBC2 at 11.30 pm should boost the Fringe takings of Louise Rennison whose show is a witty monologue about her 1960s' youth in Leeds, New Zealand, and swinging London.</p>

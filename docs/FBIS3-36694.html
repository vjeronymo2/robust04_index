Having found no common  ground on the question of reforming the republic's authorities,  Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin decided to close the  session. After a 30-minute break he opened another, the 19th  session. It will be as memorable as the previous one, with  Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev's publicly calling on  parliament to hold repeat elections for the Federal Assembly on  13 March.    Discussions in Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet on reforming the  authorities have been going on since 18 October 1993. Yesterday  proved that even this time was too short for the two  parliamentary commissions to come to an agreement on two  versions of the draft law.    The dragged-out discussion on reforming the authorities  augured a heated atmosphere, something neither the Supreme  Soviet chairman nor the president wanted at all in connection  with what Mintimer Shaymiyev was going to say in parliament.  This is perhaps why the session was urgently terminated.    The statement that followed came as a total surprise for  many  deputies, especially those who represent Tatar national circles.  "Proceeding from the course of the negotiations with the Russian  Federation, I consider necessary the presence of Tatarstan in  both the State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia. I am  confident that the republic's population will support me by  their active part in the 13 March elections," the president  said. This address obviously came in response to Vice President  Vasiliy Likhachev's successful negotiations in Moscow.  Attesting to their positive result is also the fact that Mr.  Shaymiyev did not arrive in Moscow Saturday although his visit  had been expected, according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights.    In the meantime, many deputies speaking for the local press  right before that had no doubt that the president sided with  those who support the line toward Tatarstan's going it alone,  and urged him to demand that Moscow grant special status not  only for the republic but also for its representatives in the  Federal Assembly. Radical nationalists demanded that only  Tatarstan observers rather than its full members of the senate  and the Duma be present there.    Mr. Shaymiyev also stated, having in mind the interstate  treaty between Moscow and Kazan: "Being born is a document  hitherto unknown in practice, which will provide a testimony to  a renewal of the federation on democratic principles, a  guarantee of our republic's statehood." The deputies' reaction  to the president's words remained an enigma for Russian-speaking  journalists because debates were called off at the  parliamentarians' request following two speeches in the Tatar  language.    Local observers believe that at least 60 percent of the  republic's citizens will come to the polls on 13 March with the  blessing of Mintimer Shaymiyev. In all probability one should  expect in the coming days an official communication on Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev himself and Supreme Soviet Chairman  Farid Mukhametshin joining the election campaign for a seat in  the Federation Council.</p>

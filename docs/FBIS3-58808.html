			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bad Luck Dogs Airbus"] </F>   [Excerpt] One after another, incidents are affecting the  newest aircraft produced by the European consortium currently in  service among French airlines. An Air Inter A330 periodically  refuses to retract its landing gear, and an almost brand new Air  France A340 was destroyed by fire on the ground yesterday.    Once again, malfunctions occurred with the first Airbus A330  delivered to Air Inter. While all the test and air trials were  carried out normally, the aircraft -- put into service early  this year by Air Inter -- is demonstrating a bad attitude. Last  Monday [17 January], after taking off from Orly airport en route  to Toulouse, the crew noticed that the landing gear was not  retracting normally. The aircraft landed and the passengers  were sent on the next flight, while the plane was subjected to a  battery of tests supervised by technicians from the airline as  well as from Airbus Industrie. Since nothing suspicious could be  found, the aircraft was put back into service Wednesday.  <H5>  A340 Destroyed on the Ground </H5>   Nevertheless, while the first flights of the morning went  off  without the slightest incident, the crew noticed just after the  takeoff of flight IT-423 that the same symptoms were back. Once  again, the landing gear refused to retract into its housing.  One might think that the aircraft had become allergic to  Toulouse, its place of birth. Since last September, Air Inter  has performed many test flights without the slightest incident.  According to Airbus Industrie, the incidents that occurred  Monday and Wednesday are probably only due to a "simple  adjustment." The fact remains, however, that this makes a bad  impression. The Air Inter A330 is the first one delivered and  put into commercial service, and the French airline still has  yet to receive 15 units out of a total of 118 aircraft ordered  from Airbus. The A330 is very similar to the A340, the only  difference being the number of engines fitted onto the planes.  The Air Inter twin-engined aircraft, planned for use on the  busiest routes, are configured to carry 412 passengers.    The incidents that arose on the A330 following the two  takeoffs from Orly are, however, completely different and less  serious than the incident that affected a four-engined Air  France A340. This is the long-haul version of the aircraft  manufactured by Airbus Industrie, 117 units of which have been  ordered and 22 already delivered and in put into service. The  airplane, which had just been through one of its periodical  technical checkups, was brought out of the maintenance hangar  around 0100 [2400 GMT]. Four hours later, a fire broke out.  Air France firemen, assisted by firefighters from Aeroports de  Paris, brought the fire under control after fighting it for half  an hour. Nevertheless, the fire had no impact on the airlines  traffic, despite the fact that the aircraft was scheduled to fly  at midday. The cause of the fire remains unknown, and the air  transportation gendarmerie has taken charge of the  investigation. [passage omitted]</p>

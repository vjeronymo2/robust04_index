			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Three Palestinians involved with the evolution of dispute mechanisms within the autonomous authority would travel to the United States for a one-semester internship with an American arbitration group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> American Republics (AR)_Nicaragua and Guatemala Only <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA will accept separate proposals designed to support conflict resolution in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Proposals targeting other countries in the region will not be accepted. The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $65,000 for Nicaragua or $35,000 for Guatemala. For technical information, interested organizations may contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> E/P Program Specialist Ben Cromer at (202) 619&hyph;5326. USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background for Nicaragua <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nicaraguans historically have found it hard to resolve their own conflicts. They have often tried to enlist outsiders, frequently from the U.S., as partisans in their disputes, or turned to them for mediation and arbitration when all else has failed. This dynamic has been a source of instability for over 150 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some Nicaraguans recognize this failing and are trying to remedy it. In the past year, two university-linked research institutes have been formed to study conflict resolution. A local environmental group sponsored a workshop organized by professional U.S. mediators on resolving environmental disputes, hosted by the new binational center. Still, if Nicaraguans are to complete this process successfully, they need training and support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. policy today is to encourage Nicaraguans to resolve their internal conflicts without looking to the U.S. for assistance and/or intervention. With this in mind, the Post proposes a project to strengthen Nicaraguan conflict resolution. USIA will work with the grantee and local organizations to identify a bipartisan (the only conceivable approach) pool of trainees who could conduct conflict resolution training for other Nicaraguans and provide mediation services and related activities (fact-finding, curriculum development, etc.). This program would respond to a historic need in Nicaragua. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please address inquiries to the Public Affairs Officer; USIS_AmEmbassy Managua; Unit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2714; APO AA 34021; Tel. 011&hyph;505&hyph;2668234, Fax 011&hyph;505&hyph;2663861. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background for Guatemala <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Guatemala's 33 year-old civil war has cost more than 100,000 lives, has severely hindered democratic and social development in the country, and has adversely affected the fortunes of every government of Guatemala since the war's inception. Although heated constitutional and political battles dominate daily headlines, this conflict continues to cast a long shadow over the country's future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Media co-sponsorship would be desirable, such as by the centrist daily Siglo XXI and its publisher, Jorge Reuben Zamora; the issues-oriented talk show ``Libre Encuentro'' and its host, Dionisio Gutierrez; and Guatemala's newest daily, La Republica, which, though it probably has the smallest readership, is well-written and tightly edited, and is supported by the media family, Marroquin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Post envisions meetings and workshops at a neutral site, such as Miami, which is both easily accessible to Guatemalans and equipped with the resources necessary to support such a program. A site such as Miami, which is also home base to many CentAm beat reporters, would likely generate considerable regional coverage and encourage the participation of key participants such as Rigoberta Menchu and Frank LaRue, as well as younger members of the URNG. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program must focus on specific issues (i.e. refugee resettlement, land tenure, political participation by the URNG), and be managed by professionals. Innovation is absolutely necessary to avoid the dry and meaningless ``round tables'' and seminars that are so common in Guatemala itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please address inquiries to: Public Affairs Officer; USIS_AmEmbassy Guatemala; Unit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3318; APO AA 34024; Tel. 011&hyph;502&hyph;2&hyph;311&hyph;541, Fax 011&hyph;502&hyph;2&hyph;321&hyph;549. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> East Asia and the Pacific (EA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA will accept proposals for the development of exchange programs to support conflict resolution in the East Asia and Pacific region. Exchange programs may include but not be limited to conferences or symposia. The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $200,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. foreign policy in Asia is receptive to the concept of regional security consultations. The ASEAN&hyph;U.S. dialogue has been expanded to include security discussions through the ASEAN Regional Forum (AFR), for example. Russia has been invited to participate in ARF, along with China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. The USG has also welcomed the holding of symposia sponsored by the private sector on Northeast Asia security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

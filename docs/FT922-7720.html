			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: Why the best is bound to be absent THE WEATHER has been kinder to Chelsea flower show exhibitors than in any of the last three years. It is the first green spring for much too long and no doubt the sights will be wonderful - both the flowers and the gardening public in the flesh. Certainly, garden accessories will be ever more in evidence, although I know before I start that I will never bring myself to afford a pseudo-Victorian greenhouse. Before we are all swept away with Marquee Madness, I would like to put in a word for things which will not be there. They are not only the large numbers of gardeners who cannot face traffic-jams and do not like coaches. They are fields of unattended buttercups, now at their best; the last of the Pheasant Eye narcissi among cow parsley and long grass; huge lilacs bulging over urban walls; woods of bluebells which refute the notion that our world is already warming; clouds of flower on the best of all late-flowering cherries, the white Prunus longipes, with blossom dangling on long stems, like cherries, fit to be worn as earrings. Nothing mature can be shown at Chelsea, nothing as tall as the off-white Staphylea, which is dominating one of my local bus-stops, nor the huge bulk of single-flowered white Rubus Benenden, the stems have such a freshness throughout the summer. Chelsea is artificial, a suspension of disbelief. This weekend I can still disbelieve it, especially when looking at the daphnes in my garden. Of all the noble families, daphnes are particularly ill-suited to flower-shows. I have never seen a really happy daphne at Chelsea, except for a female namesake, and I doubt if we ever shall. Right now, some of the best forms are at their peak, but daphnes would refuse to move to a show because their roots detest disturbance. Whatever you see next week, it will not be fully indicative of May's best shrubs. Over the years I have grown about a dozen varieties, killed a few of them, and left others behind when moving house. I have tangutica progressing slowly but healthily from cuttings; my retusa is less than one foot high and wide after nine years; I no longer have the scented white-flowered blagayana, which hugged the ground for five years and threw off a wonderful sweetness until it died, as usual, before reaching middle-age. I have had Daphne odora - both green and golden forms - in pots and under windows, often developing those bare lower stems and rather pale buds, which never match the bushes beside other people's doors. This golden-leaved daphne is one of the essential plants, easily rooted from cuttings. Its master, the late E A Bowles, once wrote that it needs 'a corner outside by kitchen and chimney, the sort of place where the cat goes to bed and where blue bottles sit on the wall in late autumn.' There are no flies on the cats who visit from neighbouring gardens. These daphnes are not all easy, but I have at last found the best for my type of gardening, late in my progress through the family. It is not the tall, easy Daphne Somerset which is leafy and makes a broad, unusual hedge. It is the daphne from Naples, which reached England in the Regency era and has behaved with quiet good sense ever since. I seldom notice it in other gardens, except in the forecourt of Jenkyn Place, near Alton, Hampshire, where I first woke up to its merits. It grows about two feet high; it is completely hardy; its rather dark leaves are evergreen and vaguely reflect light; it will grow on any soil, hot, acid or not, so long as the drainage is sharp and the roots are free from interference. It seems to revel in rotted pig manure, and its flowers are a muted rose-pink, which lasts for about a month, until late May. It has a glorious scent, especially on cold evenings. For impact, exhibitors would probably prefer my other performer, a ruby-red mat of flowers, which is known as Daphne Cneorum eximia. I am hesitant about the name because all our true eximia derives from a wonder plant, owned by the late A T Johnson, one of those rare gardening columnists who added as much to nursery-lists as to the newspaper columns. His daphne hugs the ground and has flowers of a rich red with a notable scent. Some of the forms on sale seem to me to be paler than others: the founder-parent is said to have grown to the amazing width of 6 ft. I can almost vouch for this size on a plant in a previous garden: it grew in full sun and the rich soil which this easy variety likes. It derived from a cutting of a marvellous parent, still to be seen this month on the old rock garden at Waterperry, open to the public, near Oxford. I have never seen the Neapolitan daphne near Naples. I have never seen Cneorum, except in the Dolomites among powder-blue alpine clematis. In the Pyrenees, there have been reports of a plain Daphne Cneorum, which is even more sumptuous. This weekend, I would settle for the easy eximia, one of those scented shrubs which exhibitors may show in miniature on a table for alpines at Chelsea, but which will never be seen on exhibition at its true width and glory. Some of the best things in life cannot be shown off: it may help to remember this law of nature when you struggle to see through the crowds what exhibitors can still display at its best.</p>

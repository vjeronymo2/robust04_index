			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan eases rules on forex dealing TAIWAN will allow foreign and local brokers to enter the island's foreign exchange market, the Central Bank of China (CBC) announced yesterday. In a move which signals the end of a monopoly on forex brokering by the non-profitmaking Taipei Foreign Exchange Market Development Foundation, the island's central bank has issued a set of rules, which took effect on August 11. A CBC official said the move was partly aimed at attracting overseas brokerages to the market and so give the island access to worldwide forex marketing networks. This, in turn, would help Taiwan's plans to develop into an international financial centre. Under the new rules, overseas forex brokers will have to be limited liability stock companies. They will be able to set up branches in Taiwan with a minimum capital of TDollars 100m (USDollars 3.7m). Local brokers will face a similar capital requirement. Overseas investors will be able to hold up to 50 per cent in Taiwan forex brokerage houses. The rules also limit local monetary institutions to a maximum 10 per cent investment in any single brokerage, and a 20 per cent limit on holdings by other local investors. The central bank did not plan to impose restrictions on the number of overseas or Taiwan brokers allowed to enter the market.</p>

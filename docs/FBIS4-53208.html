			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 December 1959, a ship carrying 975 Koreans  residing in Japan took off from Japan's Niigata port. It was the  SS (Tovlsk) of the former Soviet Union, the first ship to  repatriate Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea. North  Korea rented the ship from the former Soviet Union. Since then,  the SS (Tovlsk) carried Koreans from Japan to North Korea on 157  occasions. On 20 August 1971, the Mangyongbong started its  first voyage. The Mangyongbong was a 3,573-tonne passenger boat  and served until the Mangyongbong-92 set sail in February 1992.    These ships were named after Mangyongbong, which is located  at Mangyongdae, Kim Il-song's birthplace. This was reportedly  intended to make Korean residents in Japan remember Kim Il-song  and his birthplace.    The Mangyongbong-92 is 123.13 meters long and 20.40 meters  wide. Its average speed is 20 knots (37 km) and its maximum is  23 knots. It takes 27 hours to sail between the ports of Wonsan  and Niigata, which are 1,000 kilometers apart. Even though it  is a 9,339-tonne ship, it cannot sail in strong winds and high  waves.    The ship has first class, second class, and third class. It  can accommodate up to 220 passengers and a crew of 60 to 90  people.    Every year, the Mangyongbong-92 carries 10,000 family  members  of Koreans who have already been repatriated to North Korea;  goods to be sent to North Korean relatives of Korean residents  in Japan; and businesses cargo controlled by the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan. It can carry up to  1,000 tonnes of cargo, including 10 large buses and 30 passenger  cars.    It was learned that each Korean resident in Japan must pay  Y200,000, which covers the fare, accommodations, and  transportation during their stay in North Korea.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: NFC The market has lost its patience with NFC. The stock was supposed to be a recovery play. Yet with its main markets out of recession, year-on-year operating profits in the fourth quarter dropped 23 per cent. Particularly worrying was the continental European operations' plunge into loss. This was where NFC was supposed to generate its future expansion. NFC's underlying businesses appear to be in trouble: lower growth rates, better organised competition, and increasingly price-conscious customers are undermining the economics of the group's operations. Management has not reacted fast enough to the new environment. Costs need to be cut sharply if NFC is to compete with low-overhead competitors. It also needs to focus on its core expertise, disposing of the low-margin BRS truck rental business and Lynx parcel service. Apart from Eurotunnel, NFC has been the transport sector's worst performing stock this year, down 48 per cent from its peak. The shares are unlikely to go much lower given the 6 per cent yield. But the group is not bid-proof: its employees' double voting rights provide less protection than before, given they now command only 11 per cent of the shares. Nor do its customers' contracts, which permit renegotiation if NFC has new owners, provide an insurmountable barrier. The new chairman and his soon-to-be-appointed chief executive cannot afford to add to NFC's mistakes.</p>

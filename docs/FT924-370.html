			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Tessa turns three - but pays less TESSA enters her third year of existence from January 1, and those who opened an account from that date in 1991 or this year will be able to deposit a further Pounds 1,800. Tax-exempt special savings accounts allow taxpayers to save a total of Pounds 9,000 over five years totally tax-free. The maximum that can be deposited in the first year is Pounds 3,000. Thereafter, the annual maximum is Pounds 1,800 and the maximum in the final year is Pounds 600. Depositors can top-up their Tessa only on the anniversary of opening it. Net interest can be withdrawn during the five-year period, but drawing on the capital means loss of the tax break. When Tessas were introduced, base rates were close to historical highs at 14 per cent. They have since halved, but what has happened to the top-rate Tessa rates paid by some banks and building societies? The National Counties and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester societies were paying over 15 per cent at launch (others, such as Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper also paid over 15 per cent, but this included a one-point bonus payable during the first year). C&amp;G closed its Maxi-Tessa (which paid 15.3 per cent) for new accounts in February 1991; it now pays 7.5 per cent, which is no longer highly competitive. National Counties, which launched its Tessa with a rate of 15.4 per cent, is now paying 9.6, a reduction of only 5.8 percentage points compared with a base rate reduction of 7 points. The only snag with the National Counties' Tessa is that you have to open a separate feeder account - which must have enough in it to transfer the maximum permissable to the Tessa on the anniversary of the opening. Those institutions paying 15 per cent on their Tessa at launch included Cardiff's Julian Hodge bank, and the Cambridge, Tipton &amp; Coseley, Birmingham Midshires, Universal, West Cumbria, Britannia (Platinum), Stroud &amp; Swindon and Principality building societies. Julian Hodge bank has maintained its competitive edge by paying 9 per cent today. Tipton &amp; Coseley is paying 8.65 per cent, Stroud and Swindon is paying 8.25 per cent while Cambridge has dropped its rate to 8 per cent. The rest have all dropped below 8 per cent gross and have reduced rates by more than the seven-point base rate cut. Several societies were paying 14.5 per cent and over at the launch of their Tessa. Those over were Yorkshire building society (14.8), Mansfield BS (14.8) and Allied Trust Bank's Premier Tessa (14.7). Those on 14.5 were the Woolwich, Manchester, Leeds &amp; Holbeck, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Tynemouth BS, Haywards Heath, Scottish BS, Dudley BS, Hanley Economics BS, Confederation Bank and Cheshire BS. Yorkshire has dropped its rate nearly seven percentage points to 8 per cent and Mansfield is now paying 7.75 Allied Trust Bank's Premier Tessa is offering one of the highest rates at 9.49 - but this can be obtained only if you produce the full Pounds 9,000 upfront by placing the maximum permitted in the Tessa and the rest in a feeder account paying 7.23 per cent gross. None of the institutions which paid 14.5 per cent has exceeded the seven-point base rate cut but Haywards Heath, paying 8.75 per cent, has only fallen by 5.75 points. This rate will be reduced to 8 per cent from December 31, though. Three of the four top-rate Tessas today are from institutions which were paying the highest rates at Tessa's launch, according to Moneyfacts. Others have been overtaken. West Bromwich building society, with a Tessa rate of 9 per cent, is now paying more than those - apart from National Counties and Allied Trust Bank - which offered the highest rates when Tessas began. West Bromwich launched its Tessa with a rate of 14.25. Despite the reduction in base rates, Tessas still represent a good investment for taxpayers, particularly since providers are in general still competing to maintain good rates.</p>

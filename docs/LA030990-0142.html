			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> BONHOMIE COMPENSATES FOR KITCHEN  </P> <P> Where do two restless, hungry, dressed-up single women want to go on a Thursday  night in Sherman Oaks? Stanley's, of course. Kate and I drive over, only to  find that all the other dressed-up restless have beaten us there. Stanley's is  so crowded that we are asked to wait outside until the inside waiting room  becomes available.  </P> <P> It's too cold to stand around in nylons and miniskirts, and we're too restless,  so we take a walk and find ourselves down the street at Cafe Cordiale, which is  also doing a spirited business. There's no wait, we're told, for the smoking  section. We're too hungry to pass it up. Moments later, we have a warm table  and are busy filling up on hunks of hot Italian bread.  </P> <P> The decor is a little corporate -- pink linens, gray walls, store-bought  posters: Cafe Cordiale most resembles an upscale, trendy coffee shop. Its menu  reads like an encyclopedia of every '80s food trend: pasta, pizza, dim sum,  satay, risotto, blackened this 'n' that, Maui onions . . . . There's a bar  here, too, and a lounge area, and, although there are two women sipping white  wine and a lone man with an algae-green Midori, I don't sense much of a bar  scene. Still, Cafe Cordiale is a very comfortable, casual . . . cordial  restaurant with a lively mixture of people of all ages.  </P> <P> At our little table, squeezed between two other tables along a banquette, we  are so close to our neighbors that we can't help but overhear their  conversations. On one side is a complainer: "I hate the takeout food you find  these days." On the other side is a confider: "I was crazy for him," she says.  Reading the diverse menu, let alone conducting our own conversation, requires  great concentration.  </P> <P> As eclectic and trendy as the menu appears to be, the food at Cafe Cordiale is  more familiar than not, and often very ordinary. The mixed green salad isn't,  for example, mixed greens: Except for a token shred of radicchio, there's  nothing but good old romaine in it -- no oak leaf lettuce, no mesclun, no trace  of lettuce infanticide. The cream of asparagus soup is a thick puree with a few  stringy stalk-ends of asparagus floating in it. Our favorite appetizer is the  fried dumplings: Light and well-spiced, they come with a head-clearing mustard  and a snappy sweet-and-sour sauce.  </P> <P> A pasta special, angel hair with chicken breast, asparagus and mushrooms, is  winy and pretty good except that, again, the asparagus is all stalk -- I find  one nubbly tip section in the whole dish. Kate's sauteed shrimp are garlicky  and cooked to hardness, but she has a swell time dipping the garlic bread in  the butter and cream sauce. After-dinner cappuccinos are very good.  </P> <P> When we return for lunch a few days later, burgers with fries and salads in big  glass bowls are rolling out of the kitchen as fast as the waitress can carry  them. Of the blackened swordfish salad, which comes with butter, lettuce and  more asparagus stalk, Kate says: "I'd come in and eat this any time." The veal  and turkeyburger is hefty and well-dressed with perfectly grilled Maui onions.  On the other hand, a risotto, made with basmati rice, is inedible: Coated with  tomato sauce and melted mozzarella, it tastes like rice pizza or, more  accurately, like dried oregano, of which it contains handfuls.  </P> <P> The service is rushed at times. But the waitresses, even as we nag them for  butter, ice water, salad dressing, are staunchly good-natured.  </P> <P> If I think of Cafe Cordiale as a fun, unusual, better-than-average coffee shop,  I don't mind the lapses in cooking so much. It's a good, basic, friendly place  to go for a bite to eat, to be among fellow humans, to seek refuge when there's  no admittance to the hot spot up the street.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: fried dumplings, $4.95; blackened swordfish salad, $9.95;  veal and turkeyburger, $7.25.  </P> <P>  Cafe Cordiale, 14015 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks.

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allied Group chief steps down MR LEE Ming-tee, the controversial chairman of Hong Kong's Allied Group, yesterday announced his resignation in the wake of a Hong Kong government report alleging wide-ranging corporate misconduct by Mr Lee. According to the Allied group, Mr Lee 'needed time to deal with the allegations made against him in the Financial Secretary's report, which he intends to contest. He recognises that to do so will take time and may detract from his ability properly to perform his duties.' The government report provides indications of false accounting, market manipulation and a number of breaches of the stock exchange listing and takeover rules. The stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Exchange (SFC) are considering taking further action. Allied has said it plans to contest the report. Mr Lee remains the largest single shareholder in the group, with a 30 per cent holding in the flagship company, Allied Group. He will retain a consultancy role for Allied's businesses in China. Mr Lee remains on the board of UK financial services group Aitken Hume, but is expected to resign from that post.</p>

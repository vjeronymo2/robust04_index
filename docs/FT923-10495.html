			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD see-sawed in a volatile and extended fixing session, climbing to Dollars 359 a troy ounce and then tumbling to fix at a 12-day low of Dollars 356.20 in what appeared to be a move by US investment funds to extricate themselves from an overheated market. The price closed in London at Dollars 356.85 an ounce, down Dollars 1.60 on the day. Dealers said the recent strength of the gold market had been futures-driven on the back of US fund buying, with the spot price lagging and weighed down by producer sales. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices extended Tuesday's chart-inspired technical fall to close at Dollars 1,313.50 a tonne, down Dollars 14 on the day. A rally in London's COCOA futures market ran out of steam, apparently without having attracted producer delling. The September price touched Pounds 617 a tonne before slipping back to close at Pounds 612 a tonne, up Pounds 13 on the day. Dealers thought a sharp fall in SUGAR futures might have been sparked by talk of a sugar freight enquiry from Cuba to Morocco which was interpreted by some as suggesting that sugar was beginning to emerge from the Latin American country. The fall gathered momentum with heavy stop-loss selling.</p>

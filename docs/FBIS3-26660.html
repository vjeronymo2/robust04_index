			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Officials Optimistic About 1994 U.S. Trade"] </F>   [Text] Despite possible skirmishes, China is optimistic  about its trade with the United States this year, according to a  senior Chinese official.    "Sino-US trade volume will see double-digit growth over the  $27.7 billion in 1993," said Sun Zhenyu, director general of the  American &amp; Oceanian Affairs Department at the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).    As evidence, Sun pointed to a string of positive signs,  including the settlement last month of bilateral textile  disputes. However, he warned against potential one-sided  pressure from the U.S.    Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead a delegation of Chinese  Government and business leaders to the US in April to promote  trade.    Apart from attending the eighth session of the Sino-US Joint  Commission on Commerce and Trade, China will hold two large  trade conferences in Los Angles and New York, Sun revealed.    "Our business delegation will enter into purchase contracts  with U.S. businesses and invite them to invest in China during  the conferences ," he said.    But Sun declined to disclose which sectors are likely to  close major deals on imports and investment.    In a parallel move, Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister  of the State Science and Technology Commission, will attend a  bilateral conference on scientific co-operation in New York.    During Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's recent visit to  China, the U.S. has agreed to provide technical help for China's  transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented one,  which Sun described as an indication of improved relations.  However, Sun urged the U.S. to relax its controls on  hi-technology exports to help reduce its trade deficit with  China.    "The U.S. competitive edges on the world markets lie in its  hi-tech items," Sun said. "If their exports to China are  relaxed, it would be good to both sides."    The U.S. claims it had a $23 billion trade deficit with  China  in 1993, counting Chinese exports via Hong Kong. But Chinese  customs put China's surplus at only $6.2 billion.    Sun said Minister Wu Yi and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron  Brown  had agreed to set up a working group to resolve the difference.    "Both sides should enhance mutual understanding and resort  to  consultation on an equal footing so that our co-operation can be  strengthened," he said, adding that any unilateral sanctions  would be self-defeating.    Sun urged better understanding by the U.S. of China's  situation regarding intellectual property rights protection,  textile trade and other issues.    "And it's unreasonable to link human rights with trade  issues, such as the extension of the most-favoured-nation (MFN)  status," he asserted.    "We must get rid of the long shadow cast by the MFN issue,  which has hampered what could have been a quicker development of  bilateral trade."    If settled once and for all, Sun explained, U.S. businesses,  especially those of medium and small size, could draw up  long-term strategies towards the Chinese market.    "But if the U.S. should revoke MFN for China, it would deal  a  blow to the entire course of China's reforms and opening to the  outside world and cause equal damage to the U.S. investors," he  said.    Sun also urged the U.S. to keep its promise of giving China  "staunch support" in resuming its membership in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The U.S. will send a  delegation to China this month for further negotiations on this  matter.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / People: Ombudsman Osmotherly Forsaking a career in Whitehall that looked likely to take him to the top post in a government department is Edward Osmotherly, who becomes one of the three local government ombudsmen on November 1. Osmotherly, 51, is currently deputy secretary at the Department of Transport, where he is Principal Establishment and Finance Officer. Before that, he was in charge of the department's public transport and research activities, including responsibility for British Rail and London Transport. He achieved temporary notoriety in 1990, when a memorandum warning of the dangers of wholesale privatisation of BR found its ways into the hands of the opposition. After leaving Cambridge, Osmotherly joined the civil service in 1963 in the ministry of housing and local government. He had several periods dealing with local authorities, notably preparations for the local government reorganisation in 1974. In 1972-73 he was a Harkness Fellow, studying federal, state and local government relations in the US. Osmotherly was seconded to British Rail in 1979, before becoming head of machinery of government in the old Civil Service department between 1980 and 1982. There he promulgated the rules for civil servants appearing in front of parliamentary select committees which have born his name since. He went to the Transport department in 1982 as under secretary. For Osmotherly, the ombudsman post offers the chance to do a 'thoroughly valuable job' helping ordinary people find their way through the labyrinth of local administration to get justice. He succeeds Frederick Laws, and will be responsible for local authorities in the South West and West of England, the West Midlands, East Anglia and parts of Southern and Central England.

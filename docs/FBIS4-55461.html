			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pal Csaky, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement Deputies Club, by Jana  Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "Revising the Borders  in Europe Is Not Involved in the Stability Pact"]    [Text] The Hungarian parties in the Slovak Republic have  been accused by the opposition of wanting to take part in the  negotiations of the European Union (EU) on the so-called  Stability Pact, whereas only Slovak constitutional officials  should represent sovereign Slovakia; otherwise, the Slovak  Republic's sovereignty and borders would be endangered. In this  context, we asked P. Csaky to discuss the Stability Pact and  assess the views being expressed about it.    [Csaky] The Stability Pact is being formulated at the level  of the EU and the East European states, and its initiator is  French Prime Minister Balladur. I understand some of the  approaches adopted by Slovak politicians who want to savor the  decisionmaking on the Slovak Republic's political orientation.  The Stability Pact is intended to prevent possible conflicts in  our region. It is not oriented against the sovereignty of any  state. If the status of the minorities is also to be discussed  in association with it, we would like to put forward our point  of view. However, at the moment, it looks as though the  minorities will not participate directly in the negotiations.    [Pankovcinova] Opinions are being expressed by the current  opposition that the Stability Pact could also mean a certain  revision of the borders in Europe....    [Csaky] I can reject this unequivocally. I know in detail  the text of the Stability Pact and the European Union's  proposals. Nothing is said there about any such eventuality.  This is merely an old formula for defining the Slovak  Republic's enemies. The EU is becoming unified, it has accepted  another four members, and it has expressed its interest in  further unification. We are also declaring our endeavor to  enter Europe and come closer to the EU. If this is really the  case, there is no point in just talking about it; we have to  adopt specific measures, take part in the negotiations on the  Stability Pact, and sign it. Thus, we would be making a  specific commitment toward a united Europe.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gilles Senges: "Aerospatiale Recapitalized by </F> Fr2 Billion"]    [Text] Aerospatiale, which has been expecting for some  years a significant gesture from the French Government (which  holds 80 percent of its capital in conjunction with Credit  Lyonnais) from whom it was asking Fr3 billion, was just  allocated Fr2 billion, to be taken from the global budget of  Fr2l billion reserved for public companies in the 1993 and 1994  budgets.    In a joint communique, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and  Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery explained their decision  citing their "confidence in a company with great potential which  has acquired in each of its products lines a leading global  position" and which, "as is the case with most aircraft  manufacturers has been affected by the situation of airline  companies and the reduction of military purchases."    The two ministers, noting the efforts the company has made  to  adapt since 1992, estimate that this sum, part of the 1993  budget, "will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully from the  progressive recovery of its markets." The group, whose  activities include defense (missiles), civilian aircraft,  (Airbus, ATR, Eurocopter), and space (Ariane), seems satisfied  with the allocated funds. "It is a breath of air which will  guarantee existing programs and those to come," employees were  saying acknowledging that in view of French economic  difficulties, the effort by the government could not be more  important.  <H5>  Few Hopes for 1994 </H5>   The company is currently considering new programs with its  European partners including launching a military transport plane  (FLA) derived from the Airbus (A330 and A340) and from ATR  (ATR52 and ATR82); the development of a second generation of  supersonic jet and a superjumbo jet; and the renewing of the  classic and ballistic missiles line. At the partnership level,  Aerospatiale, which has subsidiarized its helicopter business by  merging with Deutsche Aerospace within Eurocopter, must now do  the same, with the same partner, in its missiles and satellites  business.    Prior to the state allocation the group, which lost 2.38  billion French francs [Fr] in 1992 on sales of Fr52.3 billion,  only had Fr6 billion in shareholders equity with a debt of Frl3  billion. Yet its debt had been reduced Fr3 billion in two years  thanks to reducing expenses (12 percent) such as reduced  expenses for operating costs, for certain leasing operations,  and selling stakes in some companies (Sextant, SEP). After  having reported a loss of Fr870 million in the first half of  1993, Aerospatiale is assured of having reduced its losses "in a  substantial manner" for that year and has announced it expects  to break even "at the latest in 1995."    SNECMA, which has already received Fr750 billion; and GIAT  Industries, that is to say SNPE, should be the next to benefit  from the money earned from privatizations this year and from  some possible financial consequences of Defense Ministry  negotiations over the next military program law, which leaves  Aerospatiale little hope of receiving the remaining billion it  wanted.    If a return to the private sector is not the order of the  day  for 1994 and 1995, Aerospatiale President-Director General Louis  Gallois has suggested recently "a partial opening of capital" to  minority shareholders, which could happen more rapidly since the  state would keep 51 percent of the shares.</p>

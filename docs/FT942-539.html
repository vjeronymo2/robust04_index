			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Unilever's chief attacks EU policy Sir Michael Perry, joint chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, last night accused European Union leaders of showing 'astonishing lack of focus' in tackling the region's flagging economic growth and competitiveness. Many governments were 'hell-bent on creating and preserving rigidities', instead of helping their economies adapt to the challenge of fast-growing Asian competition, he said. 'I don't believe governments have begun to address the issues.' His criticisms of EU policy failures - in a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London and in an interview - are among the toughest recently by a top European industrialist. They were part of a generally bleak assessment of Europe's economic performance, which underlined the threat to its prosperity from Asian rivals. He dismissed as 'alarmingly irresponsible' suggestions that Europe could return to full employment this decade. Sir Michael said governments should 'stop continually shifting burdens on to employers in order to avoid what should properly be hard political choices about public spending priorities'. The EU was imposing too many costly and unnecessary regulations on business which, he said, were exemplified by its recent Works Council Directive. 'What amazes me is that anyone should think it is going to make the slightest contribution to solving the central economic question of today - making Europe more competitive,' he said. European companies must embrace change by improving innovation and quality, cutting costs and entering new markets, he said. Their most urgent task was to persuade employees of the need for more flexible working practices. The EU needed to stimulate efficiency by implementing the Uruguay Round trade deal and pressing ahead with its single market. However, Sir Michael feared growing resistance to industrial restructuring. 'One is concerned that governments are less willing to accept the full consequences of driving costs out of the economy than when the single market was set up,' he said. Governments should seek a partnership with business to improve education, re-skilling and infrastructure, and not engage in 'pseudo-activity by attempting to second-guess industrial decisions'. He said the UK political climate was more positive than in some continental countries: 'We in Britain reckon our government is listening to business needs more closely than in other parts of Europe.' However, Europe's unemployment would probably not fall below 6 per cent for the rest of the decade, even if annual growth averaged 3.5 per cent. 'That is why I find the glib talk about 'full employment' . . . in some political circles alarmingly irresponsible,' Sir Michael said.</p>

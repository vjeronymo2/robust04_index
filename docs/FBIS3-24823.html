Having resolved the question of the national police force, the  two sides are now discussing national reconciliation. UNITA  says the important thing is the decentralization of power. Its  spokesman, Jorge Valentim, has demanded important government  ministries for the organisation:    [Begin Valentim recording] If the people are really to  believe that we are advancing towards national reconciliation,  it is necessary that we be placed in charge of significant  ministries. I think that the government is revising its  attitude. And if this proves to be the case, it will be a  positive development. Besides, 1994 is not 1992. We have  evolved, all of us. So we shall come to an agreement, as we  have done with regard to the army and the police. [end recording]</p>

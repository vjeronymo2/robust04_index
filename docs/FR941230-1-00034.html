Pursuant to a take or pay contract having a term equal to the useful life of the facility, J sells 15 percent of the output of the plant to Corporation K, an investor-owned utility. Under the license issued to J for operation of the plant, J is required by federal regulations to construct various facilities for the preservation of fish and for public recreation. J issues its obligations to finance the fish preservation and public recreation facilities. The financed facilities provide no direct benefits to J or the purchasers of the electricity produced by the plant. Because K has no primary legal or contractual obligation to provide the financed facilities, the facilities are not used for a private business use by K under paragraph (b)(8) of this section. Under this paragraph (e), however, the fish preservation facilities, but not the public recreation facilities, are treated as used by K because they are functionally and integrally related to the generation plant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> De minimis exceptions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Short-term leases and similar arrangements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use by a nongovernmental person pursuant to a lease, management contract, or similar arrangement does not result in private business use if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The agreement may not be renewed or extended beyond the period described in this paragraph (f)(1); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Following the expiration of that agreement the facility subject to the agreement is not used for a private business use (determined without regard to this paragraph (f)(1)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The term (or in the case of an agreement entered into prior to, and not in connection with, the issuance of the bonds, the remaining term) of the agreement does not exceed the least of (A) 1 year, (B) 10 percent of the remaining economic life of the financed facility (determined at the time the arrangement is entered into), and (C) 10 percent of the remaining term of the bonds; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Except in the case of a lease, management contract, or similar agreement entered into prior to the issue date (or contemplated issuance) of bonds financing the acquisition of the property, the agreement must be an arm's-length, fair market value agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Temporary use by developers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use by a developer of an improvement that carries out an essential governmental function during an initial development period does not result in private business use if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The issuer and the developer reasonably expect on the issue date to proceed with all reasonable speed to develop and sell the related property to members of the general public and covenant in the bond documents to do so with due diligence; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The issuer and the developer reasonably expect on the issue date that the related property will be sold to members of the general public within 3 years of the issue date; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Bonds of the issue are not required to be retired in connection with the developer's sale of property to members of the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incidental use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Incidental use of a financed facility is disregarded to the extent that that use doe not exceed 2.5 percent of the proceeds of the entire issue.

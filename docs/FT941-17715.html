			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Government seeks to salvage fishing policy The government is seeking an urgent meeting with the European Commission in the new year to try to salvage its fisheries conservation policy after being forced to suspend its unpopular scheme limiting the time vessels can spend at sea. Ministers will ask Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, what alternatives would be acceptable to enable the government to meet its commitment to reduce UK fishing fleet capacity by 19 per cent by the end of 1996. Government policy has been left in disarray by the High Court decision last month to refer to the European Court a challenge by fishermen to the 'days-at-sea' restrictions. The restrictions had been due to come into force today. But the government, acknowledging that the court's move cast legal doubt on the operation of the scheme, has suspended its introduction until the European Court judgment. This usually involves a long wait and Britain will be asking the commission to speed things up. Ministers may also ask the commission to allow a delay in the 1996 deadline for achieving fleet capacity cuts, arguing that their hands are tied by the court case. The restrictions, the cornerstone of the government's programme, were designed to achieve up to 8.5 per cent of the overall cut, with a Pounds 25m decommissioning programme and tighter licensing of vessels accounting for the rest. Fishermen, jubilant at what they see as a victory over the government, want ministers to adopt their package of 'technical' conservation measures instead. These include larger mesh sizes to allow young fish to escape, and closing some areas to fishing when spawning is taking place. Mr David Pessel, a Plymouth fisherman and an executive member of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations which brought the High Court action, said such measures, unlike the days at sea limits, 'directly aid conservation of fish stocks'. But government scientists doubt they would be enough to cut overfishing of endangered stocks. The European Commission has also been sceptical about whether such measures are effective in the European-wide effort to reduce capacity. Ministers are outwardly confident the European Court will back its days-at-sea policy. But Mr Pessel, who helped organise a blockade of Plymouth harbour and a demonstration in London, said: 'We believe the days-at-sea issue is stone dead. If they ever did try to resurrect it, we can assure them they'd face the same scenario.' A way out of the government's quandary, hinted at by ministers, would be for the European Commission to adopt EU-wide restrictions on time at sea. Mr Pessel said: 'If it was genuinely enforceable and fair, I don't think anybody could argue against it.'</p>

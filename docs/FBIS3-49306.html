			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Novotny: "RDP Group: `The Aim of Our </F> Activity Is Coordination'"]    [Text] Prague--The RDP Group, the shareholding company  comprising arms, engineering, and metallurgical plants, has the  task of coordinating among its members a course of action for  developing and implementing new products. Its capital of 40  million korunas, otherwise quite negligible in this field,  merely supports the company's relevant activity, said RDP Press  Spokesman Jiri Vich in an interview with us.    The RDP Group does not have an actual plan of activity. Its  foreign trade ventures are regulated by the business law and the  other laws the government has adopted in this sphere. In view of  the delicate nature of the arms production issue, he stated that  "substantial and regular" consultations are held with the  Foreign Ministry. Furthermore, Deputy Trade and Industry  Minister Radomir Sabela takes part in all of the board meetings.  It cooperates with Jan Ruml's ministry in testing new products.  "We ensure that our activity is clean and above board," says  Jiri Vich.    As far as the customers for our arms plants' products are  concerned, the Czech Army apparently is interested in 200 of the  modernized CZ 2000 tanks. However, the military will have a  clearer idea about the kind of hardware it needs sometime in the  middle of this year. The RDP is keeping in touch with the  Defense Ministry and its experts. The governments of the Baltic  republics are also potential customers. The first contacts were  forged with them during Foreign Minister Zieleniec's official  visit. "We are looking for serious customers that are not under  an embargo," concludes Jiri Vich.    The RDP Group is not a trust and has no ambitions to become  one. According to its press spokesman, it is trying to "keep  together the special teams of experts we have." It believes that  the chances of success in the market environment, first and  foremost, for the smaller enterprises with a high percentage of  special (read military) production will increase in a "geometric  sequence" by means of advantageous cooperation. "We are their  entrepreneurial device," said the spokesman, when he described  his company's relationship with its shareholders.    Apart from modernizing the T-72 tank (the new product is  called CZ 2000), the RDP Group is planning the "Overland"  project. This is a military all-terrain vehicle with a Peugeot  engine and transmission produced in cooperation with a French  partner. At the moment, it is being tested by the Interior  Ministry. Meanwhile, a secret product, "MARREL," apparently  should make a contribution to the environment. So, to civilian  production. Jiri Vich emphasized that the RDP Group wants,  prospectively, to coordinate only 20 percent of military  production up to the year 2000. Current production is dual,  which means that some elements can also be used in the civilian  sector.    Jiri Vich commented that the RDP Group is negotiating, first  and foremost, on the transfer of "know-how" and new technology  to the Czech Republic. Let us hope that weapons will not journey  in the opposite direction toward regions where the entire  democratic world does not want to see them.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Former Bestwood chairman accused of theft MR TONY COLE, former chair-man of Bestwood, the industrial and property holding company, appeared at City of London Magistrates' Court yesterday charged with false accounting, perjury and thefts totalling more than Pounds 1.1m. Mr Cole was arrested on Tuesday by City of London Police working in conjunction with the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO has been investigating the affairs of Bestwood since 1990, when the case was referred to it by inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI began investigating the company and Atlanta Fund Managers, one of its former subsidiaries, in June 1989. Mr Cole faces 13 charges, including five of theft. One charge involves Pounds 212,305 allegedly taken from Atlanta Fund Managers, and routed to the Swiss account of a Jersey company, Mamro Ltd, with which he was connected. Two allege the theft of Pounds 300,000 from the trustees of the pension fund of British Drilling and Freezing, another Bestwood subsidiary, and two allege the theft of Pounds 602,500 from Bestwood itself. He is also charged with stealing share certificates for 450,000 shares in Aitken Hume International, the financial services group, belonging to Atlanta Fund Managers. He faces other charges that he concealed his connection with Mamro from Bestwood's auditors, and committed perjury by concealing the connection both during a High Court hearing and while giving evidence to DTI inspectors. Mr Cole was remanded on bail of Pounds 150,000 until March 19 on condition that he surrendered his passport, did not apply for travel documents, did not travel outside Essex or Greater London, and reported to a police station twice a day. Four other people were charged last year as a result of the SFO investigation into Bestwood and are awaiting trial at a Crown Court. They are Mr Charles Wilkinson, of London, a senior partner in solicitors Lawrence Graham, charged with offences under section 395 of the Companies Act 1985; Mr Jeremy Colson, a financial director, of Nadderwater, Devon, on similar charges; Mr Peter Southgate, an accountant, of Colchester, Essex, on charges of theft, aiding and abetting an unauthorised loan, and false accounting; and Mr William Collins, a stockbroker, of Egham, Surrey, charged with theft and false accounting. Mr Southgate and Mr Collins face joint charges with Mr Cole. Mr Cole bought into Best-wood, which then had little more to its name than a printing subsidiary and a stake in a drilling company, in early 1985 and became chairman soon afterwards. Between 1985 and 1988, he built it up by acquiring substantial stakes in a number of companies. He created a mini-conglomerate with interests ranging from drilling, contracting and property development to motor bike financing. Bestwood, which suffered heavy losses after the 1987 stock market crash, went into receivership in April 1990.</p>

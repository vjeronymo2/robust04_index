			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Transatlantic struggle of derivatives titans - Tracy Corrigan on charges of vested interest against Chicago's trading system The deadlocked discussions between Liffe, the London-based futures exchange, and Globex, the 24-hour electronic trading system, drew a volley of criticism over the structure of Globex from European exchange chiefs at last week's annual industry gathering in Burgenstock, Switzerland. Globex was developed by Reuters, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but is run as a joint venture between the two Chicago exchanges. Concerned European exchange officials said that the vested interests of the Chicago exchanges were proving an obstacle to other exchanges joining the system. Since the launch of Globex last year, only one other exchange, France's Matif, has listed its products on the system. The Matif transferred its existing after-hours telephone trading to Globex, and now contributes around 80 per cent of the system's volume. This gives the Matif a stronger voice in Globex affairs. But other exchanges are concerned that membership of Globex would give control of their products to their rivals. 'We would be a lot happier if we thought we would have direct control,' said one exchange head. The balance of power in the futures markets has shifted since Globex was conceived in 1987, when the two Chicago exchanges dominated trading. Several officials pointed out that other Reuters trading systems are controlled solely by Reuters, which contributed the bulk of Globex's Dollars 80m development costs. Despite an invitation to resume talks last week from CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor, there seems little immediate prospect of Liffe and Globex settling their differences. Negotiations broke down last month when the CBOT said that under the Globex contract it had exclusive rights to trade Bund futures on the system, even though it has not yet listed the product. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, said that Liffe would only re-enter negotiations if the listing of Liffe's bund contract on the system were 'back on the table unconditionally'. But Mr Arbor specified that the CBOT would reconsider its position on the bund contract only if two other issues were resolved first. Reuters and the CME both wrote to the CBOT following the collapse of talks last month, expressing concern over the CBOT's position. Reuters officials declined to comment last week, except to express the company's long-term commitment to Globex, saying that the negotiations are in the hands of the joint venture company. However, the split between the two Chicago exchanges over the negotiations points to some deep-seated concerns about the future of the system. 'Reuters has a long-term view, but we (at the CBOT) are traders, we take a short term view and we have to begin to see some return on our investment,' Mr Arbor said in a recent interview. The slow start to trading on Globex and the apparent reluctance of other exchanges to join the system could force a re-examination of the company's structure. The issue of exclusivity - that only one instrument based on one underlying product can be listed - was described by the two Chicago exchanges last week as central to the Globex philosophy and necessary to maximise the liquidity of any contract on the system. But several non-US exchange officials said that they did not see why rival contracts, which vie for volume every day in the futures pits, could not similarly compete on Globex. Flex options were first listed earlier this year by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as stated in Monday's Risk and Reward Column.</p>

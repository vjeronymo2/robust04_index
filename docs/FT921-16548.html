			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Chasing cash By a process of elimination, it may turn out that 1992 is a good year for the UK investor to be in cash. At any rate, that looks a prudent strategy for the opening months of the year. The UK will be in the fallow period before an election. In the US, it is not yet clear that there will be a speedy reversal of the 'deep-seated concern' among the population which the chairman of the Federal Reserve last month claimed not to have seen in his 65-year lifetime. The obvious risk is that the markets will scent recovery again and race off on their traditional January rally. But having done so a year ago, they may be the less ready to fall for the same one again. In a parochial UK context, investors might do well to consider how often they have told themselves that the construction sector or the more bombed-out retailers could not fall any further. The whole argument for a sharp rise in equities a year ago was not merely that the economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic was imminent, but that it would be conventional in form. It now seems unlikely to be either.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec 15 KYODO -- A government report on toxic  chemical residues in the environment in 1992 claims the  Environment Agency's restrictions on use of toxic tin compounds  in paint on boat keels are beginning to have an effect.    The compounds are blamed for contaminating marine life.    The report, submitted to a subcommittee on chemical  substances within the agency's central council for environmental  pollution control, said there has been a slight improvement in  the level of contamination from the compounds in the two years  since the introduction of the restrictions.    But the report also said contamination from toxic  substances,  including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dioxins, though at  low levels, is still continuing.    In a survey of 17 potentially harmful substances, eight,  including the herbicide simetryn, were found in water and fish.    The substances are only mildly toxic and were detected in  small amounts, but the report said more investigation is  required since simetryn is reportedly capable of affecting  marine plants at even low concentrations.    The report also said PCB was detected in 37 of 72 samples of  sea bass and other fish taken from Tokyo bay and other parts of  the country.    Dioxins, some known for their high toxicity, were present in  silt at the bottom of Tokyo, Ise, and Osaka bays. The densities  and frequency of occurrence were the same as in 1991.    A spokesman for the agency said they are unlikely to have an  impact on humans, but noted that there is a need to assess the  distribution because of the apparently wide area in which they  are found.</p>

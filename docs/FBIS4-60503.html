			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F> Jean-Marc Varaut in Tunis; date not given: "Toward a State  Based on the Rule of Law"]    [Text] A modest cottage in the outskirts of Tunis. A  number of easy-going Tunisian soldiers and suspicious-looking  Palestinian bodyguards were scrutinizing the visitors, who,  during the night, had been summoned from their hotel, where they  had been waiting for the indefinite hour of the interview  granted by the chairman of the Palestinian National Council.  This is the name of the new authority ruling over the Gaza and  Jericho autonomous territories. With my friend Bernard Regnier,  we waited for a long time for the "Open sesame!" to be announced  by one of 'Arafat's faithful companions. It was no longer the  liberation movement leader who received me, and who, last  October when we first met displayed a Lorraine cross which he is  said to have worn for the past 27 years, but Palestine's new  president.  <H5>  French Model </H5>   Although his black eyes were circled with red, betraying the  fatigue felt by this indomitable man, 'Arafat laughed willingly.  He laughed when I quoted Max Weber: "A state is recognized  when it has the monopoly of legitimate violence." If we add  autonomy (that is to say, etimologically speaking, the power to  decree its own laws), a territory over which a single authority  now rules, and international recognition (by 127 countries, as  'Arafat himself pointed out), we have all the constituent  elements that go to make a sovereign state. However, his answer  was a cautious one: "I am now the president of an independent  country, but only after a number of years will this state have  all the attributes of its sovereignty, as well as a  fully-fledged role in the United Nations Organization."    Yet, the signs of sovereignty are unmistakable: There is a  Parliament, which will be renewed in October, following  democratic elections based on electoral constituencies,  including both Palestinians in the liberated territories and  Palestinians abroad, who are still not authorised to come back;  a government is in the process of being formed, and will include  three Christian ministers; Yasir 'Arafat showed me the "decree"  which he had just signed by which a Supreme Court had been  created: "The judges are already on site in Gaza, Jericho, and  the West Bank." He stressed the fact that the judges, once  appointed, are independent and irremovable. The division of  powers is ratified by the founding chart, which he ordered be  brought to him, framed and illuminated with the Palestinian  flag's colors.    On three specific issues which Palestine must now address --  the Constitution, human rights, and Islam's place within the  state -- he gave firm, clear-cut answers. To begin with, he  confirmed that the Palestinian constitution will be of the  presidential type, inspired by the French model. Yasir 'Arafat  handed me the draft provisional Constitution for the interim  period, drawn up in Arabic, as yet unpublished, and which is to  be submitted to the Palestinian Parliament as soon as the latter  is constituted. He also confirmed Palestine's unreserved  adherence to UN ideals, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, and the 1966 agreements on civil and political rights as  well as economic, social, and cultural rights: "There will be no  discrimination between Muslims and non-Muslims, or between men  and women, who will have equal rights... Palestine is the  fatherland of all Palestinians of all comunnities."    He reminded me that the 1988 declaration of independence was  already based, in his view, on the principles of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, and that the National Palestinan  Council considers human rights a source of inspiration for  future legislation: "The ideals of justice, solidarity,  consultation, and accountability of those who govern, which form  part of the Arab cultural identity, are not contrary to the  Western ethos on which the 1948 Declaration is based."  Switching to French, 'Arafat repeatedly stressed that he would  like to see the spirit of tolerance prevail over the revanchist  spirit.    "There is a time to convince, and a time to build." This is  why he broached the question of using French, which he wishes to  promote as opposed to the dominant practice of speaking English,  which was the language of the [British] mandate. He indicated  that President Mitterand gave him assurances that the Sorbonne,  where Yasir 'Arafat's wife was a brilliant student in her youth,  will sponsor a Palestinian Humanities and Sciences university.  Furthermore, he warmly gave me his agreement to arrange for  French law professors and the Paris bar to contribute to the  development of the Palestinian judicial institutions and  legislation.    Unified Legal System    I reminded him of the role of French jurists in drawing up  Turkish, Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian legislation. With Nabil  Sha'th [adviser to 'Arafat], we discussed the pervasive  Anglo-Saxon influence on Israeli and Palestinian criminal law,  and the current opposition between the legal systems based on  the Napoleonic codes and those based on British Common Law.    During the interim period, Jordanian law will be  provisionally applied at the West Bank, and Egyptian law in the  Gaza Strip, but Yasir 'Arafat is in favor of rapidly unifying  the legal system. The aim is to rationalize Islamic law and to  assimilate Western law without grating on Palestine's sense of  identity or childishly imitating existing models.    Fortunately, Yasir 'Arafat is not liable to the temptation  to  resolve political and economic problems through a surfeit of  legislation. He confirmed that Palestine had opted for the free  market and that it had rejected state-socialism and its  paralysing and stifling bureaucracy.    We ended our long conversation by my asking him about  Islam's  place in the new state. I reminded him that, out of 19 Arab  states that have a constitution, 13 adopted Islam as a state  religion (in Saudi Arabia, moreover, it is the sole religion),  whereas five states do not establish any formal link between the  state and Islam (Lebanon, Somalia, Djibuti, Libya, and Syria).  On this point he referred me to the decision to be reached by  the Palestinian National Council. However, he ruled out that  the new state would be an Islamic state. Religious freedom and  the right to practice any religion are affirmed by Article 3 of  the provisional Constitution, as is the right to set up private  schools within all the different communities. Christian  Palestinians, who constitute an important minority, will enjoy  the same rights as Muslim Palestinians. Thus the new political  establishment, which professes to be democratic, liberal, and  pluralistic, will be nondenominational.    Nevertheless, two of the draft Constitution's articles  contain the germs of potential discord with Israel, just as they  may, conversely, lead to agreement. Indeed, Article 5 states  that Jerusalem is Palestine's capital, even though during the  transitional period the Palestinian Government's seat can be  located anywhere else in the Palestinian territory. The 13  September 1993 agreements, in fact, have left unaddressed the  question of Jerusalem's status. However, Article 31 suggests a  rapprochement: "Jerusalem is a holy city for all three  religions. Palestine, faithful to the spiritual tradition, will  ensure the cohabitation of the different religions both in  Jerusalem and in Palestine as a whole."</p>

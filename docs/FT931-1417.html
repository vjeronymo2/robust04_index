			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Foodcorp improves in first half FOODCORP, the food processing subsidiary of Gencor's manufacturing arm, Malbak, overcame difficult trading conditions to post real earnings growth in the six months to the end of February. Foodcorp, one of three leading food groups in South Africa, was formed last April when Malbak reorganised its food interests by merging Fedfood and Kanhym. Comparing Foodcorp's results with the combined Fedfood-Kanhym performance in the same period last year, turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.3bn (Dollars 406m) from R1.21bn. Lower finance costs offset a decline in operating income, so pre-tax profits were unchanged at R72m. A lower tax bill helped lift attributable profits to R46m from R40m. Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 95 cents from 83 cents, but the dividend was cut to 23 cents from 32.4 cents per share in line with a new policy that dividends should in future be paid on a 40:60 interim to final ratio. Mr Dirk Jacobs, chief executive, said the first half had been characterised by weak consumer demand resulting in lower volumes and tighter margins as selling prices could not be increased to compensate for higher input costs. Rationalisation benefits and productivity improvements had allowed margins to be maintained. Mr Jacobs said the market for the group's products was likely to remain depressed for the rest of the year. However, he forecast that the rate of earnings growth achieved in the first half would be maintained for the full year.</p>

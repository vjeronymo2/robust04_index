			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A session of the Green Party of Ukraine took place  on 20 January apropos the signing of the tripartite statement by  the presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on  eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In particular Vitaliy  Kononov, chairman of the party, and Sergey Kurykin, chairman of  its political council, took part in the session. The "greens"  evaluated favorably the document, which had been signed. "The  agreement gives a new impulse to making external ties more  vigorous and strengthening them, which in its turn will  stimulate potential foreign investors to become more active,  Vitaliy Kononov noted. The reservation lies in the fact that  compensation for nuclear weapons in the shape of fuel for  operational Ukrainian atomic electric power station is not  grounds for their further development."    The concern of the Green Party of Ukraine is evoked by the  conditions for processing and burying radioactive waste.    Regarding the proposal of the Kharkov "greens" to nominate  Leonid Kravchuk for the Nobel Peace Prize for steps toward the  non-nuclear status of Ukraine, Kononov replied that the Green  Party of Ukraine is still going to examine this issue, because  at present they do not have information about the mechanism for  granting this prize.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Prime Minister Dhuqn al-Hindawi has asserted  that Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Husayn,  placed the Yemeni issue at the top of its priorities, both  before and after the pledge and accord document was reached.    During his meeting at the Prime Ministry today with the  Yemeni parliamentary delegation headed by deputy Muhammad  'Abdallah al-Kibsi, al-Hindawi said that all Jordanians want a  return to national dialogue and a cease-fire so that fraternal  Yemen can emerge from its crisis safe and healthy and direct its  energies and resources toward progress and prosperity. The Arab  nation, he said, more than ever needs its sons' energies and  solidarity in a world of cooperation and blocs to achieve the  interests of nations and all humanity.    The acting prime minister was then briefed by the guest  delegation on the current crisis in Yemen and ways of ending the  infighting among the sons of the one people and returning to the  unity's constitution, which was endorsed by the people, so that  unified Yemen can remain an asset for the Arab nation and a  factor for progress and development in it.    In a statement to journalists following the meeting,  al-Kibsi  said: We have accepted a cease-fire and a return to dialogue  within the framework of unity. He added: It is untrue that we  want to impose unity by force. Rather, we support legitimacy  and the Yemeni people's will and options regarding their unity  and democratic policy. He pointed out that during the meeting,  Jordan stressed its firm and principled position toward the  Yemeni crisis and called for halting the infighting and  returning to dialogue and negotiations.</p>

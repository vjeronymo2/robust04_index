			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] will strengthen its  monitoring of inspectors of the three financial supervisory  organizations to root out irregularities alleged to be prevalent  between auditors and financial services companies. The MOF also  asked the Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory  Board and the Insurance Supervisory Board to regularly gather  opinions from financial institutions on the attitude of  inspectors.    If inspectors are found to have been engaged in such  irregularities as receiving kickbacks, influence-peddling and  favoritism, they will be subject to disciplinary action, the MOF  said.    Heads of the three supervisory organizations will be  directly  involved in weeding out unethical and rule-breaking inspectors,  the MOF said. Auditing departments will be under the direct  control of the heads of these regulatory organizations.    The MOF yesterday unveiled a program to reform financial  market supervisory system as complaints have been growing over  the attitude of financial inspectors. The action also follows a  directive from Chongwadae last year, which called on the MOF to  come up with ways of reforming the nation's financial  supervisory organizations. But many analysts said the reform  move may discourage inspectors from safeguarding the soundness  of the financial system.    When inspectors show an arrogant and high-handed attitude in  their inspection of financial institutions, they will face  reprimands, it said.    To root out irregularities, the MOF has called on the  supervisory organizations to stop engaging in "inspections for  revelation or demonstration purposes," it said. The focus of  the supervision will be placed on helping financial institutions  improve their managerial performance or to take preventive  action, the MOF said.    Regulators will limit their inspections mostly to head  offices and inspection of branches will be made on an  exceptional basis. Inspectors will be discouraged from making  personal visits to financial institutions and instead they will  devote their auditing to combing through documents the MOF said.    The three supervisory organizations will develop computer  systems to expand document-oriented inspections of financial  institutions, the MOF said. Regulators will no longer specify  the degree of punitive action against junior staffers who are  found to have violated rules. Instead, they will notify  financial institutions of staffers who violate rules and permit  financial institutions to take their action at them.    The regulatory agencies will be told to bolster the function  of units which solve complaints from consumers. For scientific  and rational audits, inspectors will be given the opportunity to  go overseas to observe practices in foreign supervisory  organizations, the MOF said.    The three supervisory organizations will soon initiate  revamping of their units and structures for raising the degree  of efficiency and modernization the supervisory system.    The MOF's assistant finance minister will meet each month  with heads of the three financial supervisory organizations.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: More to be done in order to contain derivatives risk Sir, Your report 'GAO rings alarm bells over danger of derivatives' (May 19) concludes with references to the recommendation of the General Accounting office in the US that regulatory attention should be paid to the accounting and disclosure regime for derivatives. While many different accounting recognition and measurement issues related to derivatives remain to be resolved both in the US and elsewhere, more could quite quickly be done in the disclosure field internationally to ensure that investors are made aware of companies' strategies for risk management and their exposures to both credit and market risk, as a minimum. Progress has already been made in some countries in this field. The examples already set could usefully be followed by others and the UK is one of those where there is ground to be made up. But accounting standard sectors from various countries and the International Accounting Standards Committee are meeting this month in Edinburgh to examine this subject. It is to be hoped that advances can usefully be made there on the priority issue of disclosure, even if agreement on accounting proves to be more elusive.

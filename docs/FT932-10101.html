			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords agree to more judges THE LORDS last night agreed an order to increase the maximum number of High Court judges from 85 to 98. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, said it would help to cut growing backlogs in the courts. Ten judges would be appointed soon and another three could be added if required. Future increases should be based on 'appropriate levels of productivity and increases in workload'.</p>

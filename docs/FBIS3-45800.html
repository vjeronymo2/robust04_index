			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the beginning of this year, some commodity  prices rose in the province. Some people misunderstood that the  price rises were caused by the new taxation system. On this  issue, a person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau  pointed out a few days ago that taxation system reform would not  cause price hikes and that localities should take measures to  stop the practice of raising commodity prices at will.    The person in charge cited some examples to explain this  problem. The new taxation system preserves enterprises' previous  tax rates. Apart from this, to reduce fluctuations resulting  from taxation system reform, the state has worked out a  necessary transitional policy. Therefore, it is groundless to  think that the new taxation system has caused a new tax burden  on enterprises or price hikes. Why did some commodity prices  rise? This person said that some tax payers did not act  properly and some people even purposely raised their commodity  prices by taking advantage of taxation system reform.  Therefore, the person in charge of the provincial taxation  bureau hoped that people in all circles would supervise this  malpractice and report it promptly.</p>

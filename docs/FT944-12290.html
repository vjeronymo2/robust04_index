			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not so blameless on pensions Sir, Mr R S Parkin (Letters, October 27) is perhaps a touch too quick in pointing the accusing finger for the personal pensions scandal solely at the life insurance industry, while placing the occupational pension plans on a blameless pedestal. While correct in recalling the predictions made at that time by pension fund managers and consultants, he should also remember that this same group took no initiative to provide the customers (the employees) with what they really wanted. This was a simple, clear, easy to understand 'pension account' - ie, such as provided by money purchase/defined contribution plans, where what is paid in by and on behalf of an individual remains identifiable and quantifiable and is not diverted to supplement early retirement pensions and executive top-up pensions of other colleagues. If the occupational pension fraternity had taken steps in the mid-1980s to accommodate the market demand 'in house' by providing alternative or supplementary defined contribution plans, most employees would never have spared a moment to consider personal pension plans. However, by insisting on a 'one size fits all/father knows best' policy of final pay plan the experts only hastened the stampede of misinformed but frustrated individuals who were thus encouraged to taste the forbidden and therefore exotic fruits of personal pensions.

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / No. 10 remains wary of ceasefire The government yesterday said it needed more evidence that the IRA ceasefire was permanent but acknowledged that it had been encouraged by progress in the two weeks since the ceasefire was declared. As pressure continued to mount on London to depart from its cautious stance, Downing Street said that there was a continuing need to 'be clear that the IRA's violence had ended for good'. It said ministers would 'keep the situation under close review'. The comments followed the first full meeting of the cabinet since July, at which ministers were briefed on the Ulster situation by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr John Major is expected to visit the province soon. Meanwhile Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, last night fuelled speculation that the six-year-old broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, might be lifted. He said: 'The time may soon come when it is right to lift the ban.' Ministers are thought to have agreed in principle that the ban should go. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urged London to accept the IRA ceasefire as permanent 'as soon as they can', warning that any delay might be used by loyalist paramilitaries as an excuse for violence. But he accepted that the timing of the decision had to be taken by London 'and they have to bring the unionist population with them'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused Mr Major of 'trawling around for excuses not to get involved'. Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein into the political process within three months of a permanent end to violence. A poll for The Guardian by ICM published today showed that only 13 per cent of those questioned believed the violence would cease for good. Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (27): Little cause for celebration - Recession and dramatic changes in European exchange rates are not helping France's renowned champagne house / Company profile of Moet-et-Chandon FOR decades the champagnes from the vineyards around the cities of Reims and Epernay in eastern France have been among the most profitable and prestigious areas of French exports. One of the chief catalysts of champagne's export success has been Moet-et-Chandon, the grand old Epernay champagne house that now belongs to LVMH, the powerful luxury goods group. Moet, which was founded in 1743, has devoted years to establishing its brand as the world's best-selling champagne. Moet-et-Chandon, like the rest of the champagne industry, has had a tough time in recent months, not least because of the effect of the dramatic changes in European exchange rates on its export sales. The company has had not only to grapple with the effects of the recession on worldwide demand for champagne, but has also had to revise its pricing policy because of France's franc fort policy of maintaining a strong franc. The problems of Moet are illustrative, not only of the particular difficulties of the champagne trade, but also of the general pressures on other French exporters since last autumn's currency crisis strengthened the franc against other currencies. Exports were, until recently, one of the chief sources of growth for the French economy. For most of last year French companies were able to compensate for the low level of domestic demand by winning market share in other countries. The value of French exports rose by 6.5 per cent in 1992, according to the economy ministry, and the trading account swung from a FFr29.6bn deficit into a FFr30.6bn credit. But last autumn's currency crisis, which strengthened the franc against other European currencies - notably the lira, peseta and sterling - made life more difficult for French exporters. Their problems began in the final quarter of 1992, but intensified early this year. The trading account has stayed in the black: but only because of a sharp decline in imports. Champagne, already struggling against the parallel problems of weak demand and over-production, has been one of the most vulnerable areas of French industry. Champagne exports peaked at 94.3m bottles in 1989, according to the Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne, but then fell steadily to 73.8m bottles in 1992. The franc's strength after the currency crisis was the final straw for the industry. Exports levels seemed to rally in the first half of this year - reaching 25m bottles against 23.6m in the same period of 1992 - but only because of the steep increase in sales of cheap petits champagnes at the expense of the established brands. Moet, which represents around 7 per cent of the total champagne market, has suffered with the rest of the industry. By the first quarter of this year it was acutely concerned not only about the low level of sales in recession-struck France, but also that the strong franc was making its product seem too expensive in other countries. LVMH announced in February that it was 'temporarily' cutting the wholesale price of Moet - and also of Mercier champagne - by 10 per cent in France, Germany and Switzerland to try to rekindle demand. Under ordinary circumstances it would almost certainly have cut prices by the same amount elsewhere in Europe. But the franc's strength also raised the risk of an influx of parallel imports of Moet into France and Germany, from countries with weaker currencies, such as the UK, Spain and Italy. Instead of trimming its prices in those markets, LVMH was forced to raise them by 5 per cent. The decision to revise Moet's pricing policy was not taken easily. Moet, like every other champagne house, was anxious about the effect cutting prices would have on the prestigious image of its product. It was also concerned that its wholesale customers in France, Germany and Switzerland might not pass the reductions on to their retail clients. As a result it would have reduced its own margins and imperilled the status of its brand without gaining from higher sales. Further, the need to raise prices in the UK, Italy and Spain raised the risk of further depressing sales in those markets. This was one of the factors that prompted Moet this spring to announce a job-cutting plan which has brought it into fierce conflict with the trade unions. In spite of these difficulties Moet has stuck to its new policy. It says that demand is still weak in most European markets, although it has detected a slight improvement since the franc's fall following this summer's ERM crisis. However, there are more encouraging signs in the US as the recession ends, and in the UK, even after the price rises.</p>

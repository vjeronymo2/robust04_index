			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] has not yet produced a proposal on a two-ballot  option, but if such a move will bring the Freedom Alliance [FA]  on board, the government will accept it, says Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer.    He was asked on Thursday [3 February] for comment on reports  that the ANC National Executive Committee had given its  negotiators a mandate to offer the double ballot to the FA in a  further round of constitutional talks scheduled for later in the  day. "At present there is no firm proposal yet. When it comes  we will have to look at it," he said.    Mr Meyer did not deny that the proposal was in the offing,  but said much depended on the context within which it was made.  He said the government in principle had always favoured a  double ballot, "but for pragmatic reasons we favour a single  ballot in this election".    "However, if a double ballot will bring about an all  inclusive settlement, then we will support it," Mr Meyer told  SAPA while attending the NP's [National Party] one-day federal  congress at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park.    Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel and Home Affairs  Minister  Danie Schutte said they understood the two-ballot offer was  imminent and that ANC negotiators had even more to offer than  just the compromise on the ballot. Both men were confident that  progress would be made in what may be the last round of  three-way talks between the parties in Pretoria.    "I understand the ANC negotiators have been given an ample  mandate and that we will be able to do something," Mr Schutte  said.    At a news conference on the NP's [National Party] election  manifesto, NP leader F.W. de Klerk confirmed the government's  position on the ballot issue, saying its commitment to a single  ballot came about as a result of more important concesssion  having been "traded" with the ANC [African National Congress] in  December.    There were other issues at stake, however, and the  government  would present its own package of proposals to Thursday's talks.  He said the government had started out in favour of a double  ballot and was therefore not against it in principle. "But in  the final throes of the negotiations here (at the World Trade  Centre) the negotiation council reached agreements on points of  difference which were more important to us than the double  ballot. And because we got important concessions, we said we  would accpt one ballot. If we move back to a double ballot  then, in a sense, we will get what we wanted originally."    Mr de Klerk said that his signing of the the election  promulgation on Wednesday did not proclude further amendments to  the constitution. "It is a wrong perception that we cannot  change the constitution anymore -- I had that specially checked  -- but there are time constraints. We cannot do so in March,  but we can do so in the next week to ten days," he said.</p>

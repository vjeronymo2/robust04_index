			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sumitomo Mining down 38% at halfway SUMITOMO Metal Mining, the Japanese gold and copper producer, has reported a 38 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Y6.37bn (Dollars 52.2m), from Y10.28bn a year earlier, as orders from Japanese industrial companies slowed in tandem with the domestic economy. Sales slipped 4.3 per cent to Y228.5bn, from Y238.68bn, with nickel sales down 28.9 per cent, and smaller falls of 2.6 and 2.3 per cent for copper and gold. Electronic equipment material sales slid 15 per cent, while those of building materials rose 12.3 per cent, reflecting a mild increase in new housing starts in recent months. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, a member of the Mitsui group of companies, blamed weak demand from carmakers and electrical equipment producers for a 64.3 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Y1.4bn on sales down 30 per cent at Y135.97bn. Mitsui Mining plans to reduce capital spending this year from a targeted Y10.5bn to Y9.1bn. For the full year, Sumitomo Metal Mining is expecting a 27.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y12bn on sales 7 per cent lower at Y440bn. Mitsui Mining forecast a 28 per cent fall in sales to Y262bn and a pre-tax profit of Y3.2bn, down 41 per cent.</p>

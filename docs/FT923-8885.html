			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Federal figures fail to fool financiers - Wall Street AFTER a tense week waiting for the July employment figures, there appeared to be something for everyone in the report when it finally came out yesterday. Taking the headline numbers first, the national unemployment rate - the most politically sensitive number in the economic calendar (especially during an election year) - fell from 7.8 per cent in June to 7.7 per cent last month. The second most important component of the report, the non-farm payrolls, showed an increase of 198,000 in the month. Finally, June's horrible 117,000 decline in non-farm payrolls (remember, this was the figure that panicked the Federal Reserve into slashing interest rates and sent President Bush's poll ratings into even steeper decline) was revised to show a drop of just 63,000. On the surface, these were good numbers. Although modest, the fall in the unemployment rate was welcome, even if it is too early yet to tell whether a sustainable downward trend is developing. The big jump in payrolls, the largest one-month gain since December 1991, looked great but the number came with a big asterisk alongside. The payrolls data included a one-off boost from a federally-funded summer jobs programme for teenagers. Without this, payrolls would have been up 123,000 - a decent number but not quite the near headline-grabbing rise that White House spin doctors hailed as so encouraging. One Treasury official, Sidney Jones, the assistant secretary for economic policy, went so far as to say that the 198,000 jump in payrolls, plus the revision to the previous month's estimates, proved that the damaging June employment report was 'somewhat misleading.' No mention from Jones, of course, that this month's report was also somewhat misleading. The financial markets were not fooled that easily. The fact that bond prices rose sharply after the unemployment figure was released indicated that Treasury investors saw little in the report to dissuade them from the notion that the economic recovery remains anaemic (to use Bush's own words). A closer look at the jobs report revealed several reasons why the bond market liked it so much. There was a big drop in construction and durable goods manufacturing jobs and the average of factory hours worked was flat, as were monthly earnings. These figures confirm that the economy's engine is barely turning over, even with the lowest interest rates in three decades. The stock market, meanwhile, all but ignored the data, which was neither good enough to offer real sustenance nor bad enough to warrant a major sell-off. Equity investors have had their attention focused on corporate earnings this week and, generally, they did not like what they saw. Disenchantment at various second-quarter performances lopped more than 50 points off the Dow between Tuesday and Thursday. General Motors topped the list of disappointments. The giant car-maker reported a net loss of Dollars 357m, but that was after a previously announced Dollars 749m restructuring charge at its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. Ultimately, the pre-charge profit was below the average of analysts' forecasts, but what upset the market the most was what the GM chairman had to say about the outlook for the rest of the year. Robert Stempel warned: 'Sustaining the rate of progress we experienced in the first half of this year . . . appears extremely challenging." This says a lot about the economy which, if it were in a normal post-recession pattern, should be on a steady upward growth path by now. If GM expects to find it difficult maintaining its first-half improvements in the second six months of the year, the economy obviously is stumbling when it should be lengthening its stride. GM's share price was quick to reflect the new-found pessimism about the company's earnings outlook. By midday yesterday it had fallen Dollars 5 on the week, or 12 per cent, to Dollars 36 3/4 amid heavy selling. The second big corporate disappointment of the week was Hewlett-Packard. The computer group announced late on Thursday that it expects its latest quarter results to come in well below analysts' estimates because of uneven demand across all its business lines. The warning shocked the market, which had been delighted by Hewlett-Packard's exceptionally strong previous two quarters. Consequently, the company's shares took a savaging, falling Dollars 11 5/8 , or 16 per cent, to Dollars 59 7/8 in just two hours of trading yesterday.  ----------------------------------- Monday         3395.40 +  1.62 Tuesday        3384.32 - 11.08 Wednesday      3365.14 - 19.18 Thursday       3340.56 - 24.58 Friday         3332.18 -  8.38  -----------------------------------</p>

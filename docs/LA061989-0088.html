			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DRIVER CHARGED IN CAPISTRANO CRASH  </P> <P> The driver of a pickup truck that flipped over on Interstate 5 near San Juan  Capistrano Sunday -- injuring seven people, including 3 children -- has been  charged with turning too sharply onto the shoulder of the freeway.  </P> <P> Lauro Montoya, 27, of Los Angeles, was charged in the accident, which occurred  shortly after a tire on the truck blew out, according to Officer Carl Twigg of  the California Highway Patrol. Montoya apparently panicked and swerved onto the  left hand shoulder, Twigg said, causing the truck to overturn and crack open  the camper shell in which five women and three children were riding. (Story,  Part II, Page 1.)  </P> <P> One of those passengers, 29-year-old Manuela Perea, was in critical condition  today at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Elizabeth  Perea, 3, was in satisfactory condition at Mission Hospital with a fractured  pelvis and right leg. Melissa Bailon, 10 months old, suffered a skull fracture  but was in satisfactory condition at the Mission Viejo hospital.  </P> <P> One passenger, Janet Perea, 1 year old, was in stable condition at San Clemente  Hospital. The other injured were treated at San Clemente Hospital and released,  a spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

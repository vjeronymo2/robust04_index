			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sector revival sparks surge at Stora Higher volumes, cost-cutting and capital gains brought a dramatically improved performance at Stora in the first half, enabling Europe's biggest pulp and paper group to lift profits to SKr1.51bn (Dollars 200m) from SKr30m. Helped by a long-awaited revival in the pulp and paper sector, group volumes climbed 5 per cent, and capacity utilisation reached 92 per cent. However, the company has still to feel the impact of the higher prices which are gradually feeding through into most product areas. Mr Lars Ake Helgesson, chief executive, said local currency prices had generally been lower in the first half than a year ago. Although the group has achieved higher prices for sawn timber and fine paper, a firm upturn in prices for newsprint and magazine paper grades is still awaited. The SKr865m underlying improvement in the group's performance was enhanced by SKr617m in one-off gains. On the plus side, the divestment of the Tarkett flooring material unit, Akerlund &amp; Rausing, and forest assets in Chile brought in SKr914m in capital gains. However, these were offset by a SKr200m provision against a possible write-down of a Canadian pulp mill and a SKr105m provision for a fine imposed by the European Union for breaching competition rules. Stora says it may appeal against the EU decision. Sales were SKr23.1bn, up 6.5 per cent after adjusting for divestments. The pre-tax figure benefited both from a stronger operating performance  - where income rose to SKr2.14bn from SKr840m - and from reduced financial expenses of SKr625m, against SKr810m. The group has benefited from lower interest rates and a SKr4.7bn reduction in net debt. Nearly all the group's divisions improved their operating performance, with power, pulp, sawn timber and technical office paper units all returning to the black. However, the group's financial services unit was unable to repeat last year's exceptionally strong performance, and profits slipped from SKr385m to SKr173m.</p>

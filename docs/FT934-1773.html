			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / IRA internal talks aim to prevent split The IRA and its political wing Sinn Fein were yesterday continuing a series of consultations within their own ranks in an effort to avoid a damaging split over the Major-Reynolds proposals. Sinn Fein yesterday made its second statement in two days, underlining the need for more detailed consideration of the proposals and warning the public not to expect a 'quick-fix' response from the IRA. The Provisionals themselves had by last night not made a statement, but hardline IRA members are believed to remain unconvinced that the pressures emanating from Dublin and London are anything other than an attempt to force them into an unconditional military surrender. Yesterday in the IRA heartland of south Armagh, next to the Irish border, the hurdles to be overcome still seemed enormous. In the staunchly republican town of Crossmaglen, the only war memorial is to the IRA dead. Republican tricolours fly above the rooftops. Army helicopters circled overhead as troops ran through side streets. Seven members of the security forces have been shot by IRA snipers here in the past year. A local security source said: 'The prime ministers might have signed their peace deal, and the IRA army council might be considering it, but the terrorists here on the ground are still waiting to kill us.' Two IRA groups are believed to operate in south Armagh, comprising 40 men and women. Among the people of Crossmaglen yesterday, a feeling of war-weariness was matched by a conviction that the IRA should not allow itself to be forced into a permanent ceasefire without further concessions guaranteed by the government. Local publican and former civil rights activist Mr Paddy Short said: 'The terrorists here are not the IRA but the British army. The troops should go back to barracks first.' Ms Margaret Caraher, whose husband was shot by the British army three years ago, said: 'I go along with the temporary ceasefire to see what comes out of the talks between Sinn Fein and the government. But at the moment I would feel like a sitting duck to be picked off by loyalist paramilitaries if there was a permanent ceasefire.' Only when she was joined by her four-year-old son Brendan did she contemplate peace in the long term. 'I grew up with the troubles and no way do I want Brendan to have the kind of memory I have. We have to try to prevent this happening to the next generation. I think it would be unforgiveable if everything collapsed, and there are some people in the IRA who realise that.'</p>

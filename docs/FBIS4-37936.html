			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has declared  alert in its Northern Command and in south Lebanon in  anticipation of terrorist attacks by Hizballah in the wake of a  series of IDF operations over the past few weeks. Dozens of  terrorists were killed in those operations. [passage omitted]    Senior Army sources said the IDF continues initiating  operations against terrorists in south Lebanon. Great  apprehension prevails among the terrorists, most notably the  senior ones, who have been sleeping in safe houses away from  their own homes ever since the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani.    The IDF fears that suicide Hizballah squads will try to  carry  out attacks inside the security zone. The attacks may be either  car bombs or infiltration to Israel through the northern border.  The IDF has beefed up its patrols in south Lebanon, and troops  have been instructed to be alert.    An SLA [South Lebanese Army] patrol came out unscathed last  Friday when a powerful bomb exploded as the patrol was moving  through the western sector last Friday.    Army sources have announced that Hizballah's terrorist  attempts in south Lebanon registered a rise over the past three  months. One of the sources noted that the recently adopted  terrorist technique of operating out of houses and the outskirts  of villages, in which civilian population lives, encumbers the  IDF activities. In addition to Hizballah's attempts to attack  the IDF and the SLA, a rise has been noted in similar attempts  by other bodies, such as Amal and George Habash's organization.  [passage omitted]</p>

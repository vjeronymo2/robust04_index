			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Self-interest of Berlusconi allies holds key to his fate Premier Silvio Berlusconi's increasingly desperate appeals for support may reach some receptive ears among Italian television audiences, especially those watching his three Fininvest channels, but they are unlikely to sway deputies in today's debate in parliament on a confidence vote. They will be influenced by self-interest and the perception of Mr Berlusconi's future as a political leader. The anti-government vote in the chamber of deputies must be assured of 316 votes to win a majority in the 630-seat lower house. The present coalition is made up of Forza Italia, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The minor partners are the small right-wing rump of the old Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD) and the Radicals of Mr Marco Pannella. Mr Bossi has decided he can no longer co-habit with Mr Berlusconi and his right-wing allies, and has turned to form a Liberal Democrat axis with opposition parties in the centre. The League's desertion immediately reduces what has been a substantial majority in the chamber of deputies to a minority. In the Senate, where the government has at best enjoyed a majority of one, the majority would disappear even more dramatically. The extent to which Mr Bossi's defection cuts Mr Berlusconi's parliamentary backing will only become clear with the confidence vote, probably as late as Friday. The League is divided and reportedly as many as 40 in both houses are not prepared to walk away from the coalition. These MPs argue they were elected with the help of Forza Italia votes and that a shift from the coalition would mean embracing a deal with the dominant opposition force on the left, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Mr Bossi needs the loyalty of a good 60 deputies to demonstrate he still commands the bulk of this northern movement, which is committed to a more federally governed Italy. Yesterday he was indicating he had about 80 deputies and all but a handful of the League senators. If this is the case, Mr Berlusconi would find himself at the head of a minority government and be forced to resign. Even if he were to scrape by the vote in the lower house, another motion would be brought in the Senate, which the media magnate turned businessman could not survive. Mr Berlusconi, sensing an inevitable defeat, now appears determined to seize the initiative and is almost certain to introduce his own confidence motion. The premier's tactic is to try to force early elections once he falls. In the current parliament it would be difficult for Mr Berlusconi's opponents to form an alternative government as the majority of the electorate in the March elections voted centre right. A centre left government could at best muster some 325 seats, insufficient to guarantee a stable legislature. Equally Mr Berlusconi, without the bulk of the League, would lack the necessary numbers, and the opposition centre parties would be unlikely allies. The coalition and its broadening to the centre would only stand if Mr Berlusconi himself were to step aside - and he is set on clinging to power. Indeed, the only stable majority would be a broad coalition of all the parties: or all those parties excluding the extremes of Reconstructed Communism on the left and the MSI on the right. However, such an outcome is against the express policy of Mr Berlusconi and his closest allies, who will not easily forego their demand for early elections. They could even force this conclusion by resigning en masse from parliament.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       POSSIBLE ALLIANCES IN THE CHAMBER: 316 NEEDED FOR MAJORITY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Current coalition          373   Northern League, Progressives,     325 Coalition + popular party  406   Popular party, Segni Northern League,           305   Grand coalition without            486 Popular party,                   Reconstructed Communism Progressives                     or MSI/National Alliance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill incurs Pounds 4m loss PROVISIONS against possible settlements in a number of legal disputes, heavy reorganisation costs and slow growth in its new business yesterday plunged Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, into the red. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.92m for the six months to end-June surprised the market and explain a cut in the interim dividend to 3p (4.25p). The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 6.23m, was the first recorded by SBJ which has grown rapidly since its launch on the market in the mid-1980s and is prompting a round of job cuts. Mr George Boden, chief executive, who described the trading performance as 'very poor', said at least 70 of the group's 860 staff would lose their job, 45 of them immediately. Underlying trading profit, including investment income was Pounds 3.52m. But provisions of Pounds 4.39m were made for the expense of reorganising back office and other operations and Pounds 3.05m for the cost of possible legal settlements. Mr Boden said half of the legal provision related to one particular dispute. The group has not made any extra provision for any costs it might incur as a result of any out-of-court settlement to the litigation between Names and agents at the Lloyd's market. After tax losses per share amounted to 7.62p (earnings 8.77p). Slow progress in the group's core marine markets, especially in the marine reinsurance and offshore energy sectors, depressed turnover. Broking revenues fell to Pounds 23.37m, 4.8 per cent below the level achieved in 1992. After stripping out the impact of exchange rate movements and the impact of acquired businesses which did not operate for the first six months, underlying growth was down by 8 per cent. Competition in the energy market, especially from the US on both price and policy wordings, was described as 'continuing and persistent'.</p>

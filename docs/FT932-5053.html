			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): B&amp;B doesn't apply to land MY WIFE and I own a site that could be given planning permission for development. If that happens, we could get a Pounds 40,000 capital gain. We also own a commercial property that we bought for Pounds 100,000 but is now worth only about Pounds 60,000. Is there any reason why we should not bed and breakfast the commercial property at Pounds 60,000 to crystallise the loss, and use that loss to offset the potential capital gain on the development site? Alternatively, rather than bed and breakfasting, is there any reason why I should not transfer the commercial property into my name at Pounds 60,000 to crystallise the loss and avoid the capital gains tax? Unfortunately, you seem to have missed our article about bed and breakfasting on March 7 last year. The closing paragraphs would have warned you that land cannot be bed and breakfasted: 'It is worthwhile to re-state the basic principles of traditional bed and breakfast for listed shares . . . There must not be any agreement on day one (the day of the 'bed' sale) that a 'breakfast' purchase will take place on day two. Full beneficial ownership must pass to the counter-party on day one. These basic principles are readily satisfied on the stock exchange, of course, but they make it virtually impossible to do an effective B&amp;B outside the exchange.' Transferring property from the joint ownership of husband and wife (either as joint tenants or as tenants-in-common) to the sole ownership of one spouse does not produce an allowable loss (or a chargeable gain), because of section 58 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The rules are outlined in the free pamphlet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples). Furthermore, a simple sale of the commercial property would not produce a usable allowable loss if it was sold to a 'connected person', as defined in section 286 of the TCGA (including a parent, parent-in-law, sibling or sibling-in-law), because of section 18(3). You should consult your solicitor on the possible application of section 776 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (Transactions in land: taxation of capital gains) to the sale of the development site. If this section is applied - and it looks likely, from the bare facts given  -then there could be no offset of a CGT allowable loss in any event. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

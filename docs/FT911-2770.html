			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Bush optimistic on Middle East peace PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday expressed optimism about peace prospects in the Middle East although 'some sticky problems remain.' 'We're going to continue to try to bring peace to that troubled corner of the world,' the president said.' Mr Bush refused to elaborate on the cause for his optimism. The president said he had telephoned Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, who yesterday cut short his talks in Israel after hearing of his mother's death. Mr Baker's trip was interrupted at a key moment in his latest Middle East mission as he sought to nudge Israel into regional peace talks. However, his two weeks of roving diplomacy have produced two accomplishments: Egypt's agreement to participate in a peace conference and a Soviet pledge to play co-host. News of his mother's death reached Mr Baker while he was meeting Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, on his second trip to Israel in a week. He had arrived in Israel on Thursday night from the Soviet Union. He also met leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the week. Both Israel and the US are anxious to give the impression that the peace process is still alive, despite disagreements between them. Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said the two countries reached agreement on five issues, including the co-sponsorship of the conference by the Soviet Union. But two key issues that have yet to be resolved are Palestinian representation at the conference and a possible role for the United Nations. Israel rejects the participation of Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and opposes a role for the UN in the conference, as demanded by Arab states such as Syria. Both Israel and the US see the regional peace conference as a means of laying the groundwork for bilateral talks between Israel and Arab states and between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli officials said Moscow's co-sponsorship of the peace conference was dependent on the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Israel. The other points agreed on, according to Israeli officials, were that Europe would play a yet to be defined role in the peace conference; the conference would not have the authority to reach or impose decisions; Israel would have veto power over the conference reconvening to hear progress reports; and the conference could be used to discuss other regional issues such as water, development and arms cuts. Because of his departure, Mr Baker was unable to meet defence minister Moshe Arens and prominent Palestinians.</p>

As we were told in the press center of the FCS's city  administration, the detained are suspected of committing a  premeditated murder and, according to the city procuracy data,  of other crimes as well. Criminal proceedings have been  initiated, and the necessary investigation conducted. It appears  that the detained will be formally charged in the nearest future.    P.S. The Great Russia electoral coalition is waiting to see  how events develop. This was announced by the bloc's  coordinator, Leonid Isakov. He hopes that it has all been a  mistake and that Nikolay Bondarik will soon be free to go. At  the same time, the bloc coordinator pointed out that Mr.  Bondarik's arrest affects first and foremost the Russian Party  rather than the Great Russia bloc. He also expressed hope that  accusations against Bondarik are not related to Great Russia's  political positions. In the opinion of representatives of the  city electoral commission, the fact of detention and initiation  of criminal proceedings cannot serve as grounds for barring  Bondarik from going on the ballot for a deputy seat in the City  Assembly.</p>

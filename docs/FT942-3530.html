			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sprint telecoms alliance nearer The French and German state telecommunications operators are set to announce an enlargement of their international alliance today, which is believed likely to include a co-operation agreement with the US operator Sprint. Sprint, the third largest US long distance telecoms carrier, has been in negotiations with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom since the spring about an alliance geared to the international business telecommunications market. The talks have extended to the terms on which the French and German carriers might inject capital into Sprint, in return for its co-operation in the development of joint international telecoms services for multinational companies. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom formed an Ecu1bn (Dollars 1.16bn) alliance last December geared to integrating their international data telecommunications networks. In September the two state-owned operators launched a joint venture - Eunetcom - to exploit the international 'outsourcing' market, estimated by analysts to be worth about Dollars 1bn a year. The Franco-German link-up, which has still to be sanctioned by the European Commission, followed the signing of a Dollars 5.3bn deal between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US carrier, last June. The state operators of Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands also have a joint venture, called Unisource, aimed at the international telecoms market. Unisource has been in talks with AT&amp;T, the largest US carrier. Executives of the French and German operators have been seeking a US partner for their international activities for more than a year.</p>

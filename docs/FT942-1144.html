			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kodak hires Sculley as part-time adviser Mr John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple Computer, has been hired as a part-time marketing adviser by Eastman Kodak, the photographic products group in the throes of a shake-up. Mr Sculley, who resigned as chief executive of Apple in June last year, built the computer company into a leading global brand. He helped do the same for PepsiCo, the soft-drink manufacturer, where he was a senior executive before joining Apple in 1983. Mr Sculley, who runs his own consulting firm in New York, will spend about 25 per cent of his time on Kodak business, building its digital imaging and brand marketing strategies. Mr George Fisher, the former chief executive of Motorola, the electronics group, who took over as Kodak chairman late last year, said he had worked closely with Mr Sculley for the past 10 years. 'I am confident John can help Kodak develop a more aggressive marketing approach,' he said. Yesterday's appointment is good news for Mr Sculley, who suffered embarrassing publicity earlier this year when he resigned from Spectrum Information Technologies, a wireless communications group, after less than four months as chairman, alleging that he had been deceived about accounting problems. Mr Fisher is making sweeping changes at Kodak, which has suffered for years from lacklustre financial results. He is keen to push the company aggressively into digital electronic imaging, which in the past has been overshadowed by the group's traditional silver halide photographic technology. Kodak is still looking for a new senior executive to lead its digital operations and is said to have been holding talks with Mr Don Strickland, Apple's vice-president of imaging and a former Kodak employee.</p>

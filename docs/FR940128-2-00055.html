A designated, developed swimming beach is properly signed, buoyed and delineated in accordance with established design and safety requirements contained in EM 1110&hyph;1&hyph;400. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Payment of this fee entitles the user to use any developed beach at any Corps operated recreation area at any Corps project on that day, with the exception of swimming beaches located within fee campgrounds and reserved exclusively for the use of campers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daily User Fee Exclusivity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The daily boat launch ramp and swimming beach user fees are mutually exclusive. Payment of a daily boat launch ramp user fee does not permit swimming at a designated beach, and vice versa. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual Day User Fee Pass.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An annual pass may be purchased for $25.00, which permits the holder and all accompanying passengers in the vehicle to use any or all boat launch ramps and/or designated, developed swimming beaches at any Corps operated recreation area at any Corps project for that calendar year, except at facilities located within a fee campground and reserved exclusively for the use of campers. A sample annual pass is shown in Appendix D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paid Camping Permits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A paid camping permit will entitle the holder to use any or all day use facilities without paying additional day user fees at the same project, on any day for which the permit is valid. In certain instances, some form of vehicle pass may be required for campers who have more than one vehicle or where the camping unit is also the mode of transportation. A separate pass, locally printed for this situation, is acceptable. Resource managers should consider local situations when determining applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lessees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Lessees may not charge a fee for Corps operated facilities.

Cost of Collection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since day user fees will be collected only at facilities where revenue significantly exceeds cost of collection, strict attention must be given to tracking costs associated with the collection of day user fees at designated facilities. An annual analysis of revenues versus cost of collection, including amortized implementation costs, must be available for review by Major Subordinate Commands and by HQUSACE by 30 December of each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Dates for Fee Collection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> District commanders will assess seasonal visitation patterns of individual fee areas to determine the period during which a fee program will be in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Signs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All areas designated as recreation user fee areas will be marked with appropriate signs that provide necessary instructions to users of the area with regard to collection of fees.

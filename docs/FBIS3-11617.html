He  added: "Other aspects, not included in the pact, may be  incorporated."    Menem said yesterday: "This electoral process is known  throughout Argentina and the world, it is known that the  Constitution will be reformed." He denied there is public  indifference toward the move.    Menem asked: "In the past, people were either concerned or  unconcerned saying: after all the government party will impose  its will. Now there is consensus and the people are saying it  has all been prearranged. What do the people really want?"    In an interview in the "Haddad and Longobardi" program [not  further identified], Menem reiterated: "Absolutely nothing has  been prearranged. A pact has been signed, and based on it the  constituent members will work to carry out the reform."    Menem is optimistic about the result of the upcoming 10  April  elections. He says the Justicialist Party "will increase the  percentage obtained on 3 October, although I may be wrong."    He added: "The Radical Civic Union will also do well." In  the federal capital it "will fight with the Justicialist Party  for first place."    Regarding the position of minister coordinator, Menem said  the position will be in force "when the Constituent Assembly  approves it. It is its decision." [passage omitted]    Regarding his talks with U.S. Vice President Al Gore,  President Menem denied any pressure to approve the patents law.  He said he asked Gore for a similar attitude regarding the U.S.  policy on subsidies on agricultural products.    Menem hinted that Gore's message was: "Without a patents  law,  it will be a bit difficult for you to join NAFTA."    Regarding the case of the Argentine Airlines, Menem said the  agreement has not yet been signed. He added: "There is an  agreement in principle, therefore I don't want to comment on  something that has not concluded."</p>

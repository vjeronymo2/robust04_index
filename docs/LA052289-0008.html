			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBING OUR LOTTERY FEVER  </P> <P> The column on curbing lotteries was excellent, especially for its inclusion of  seven suggestions for lessening today's gambling craze.  </P> <P> However, in his listing of our assorted lottery "rashes" he neglected to  mention the most image-damaging, heart-breaking, hard-work canceling, unfair  lottery that could possibly be imagined that was announced recently by none  other than our State Department in Washington.  </P> <P> A Times report (Part I, May 10) declares that more than 3 million people from  around the world, all eligible, have applied for visas to live in the United  States. Have their names been taken in the order in which they applied? No.  There is to be a computer visa lottery for 10,000 of them in 1991, and for  another 10,000 the following year.  </P> <P> It would appear that now we are making U.S. citizenship possible as the product  of an addiction! Move over, drugs, alcohol, tobacco and gambling.  </P> <P> Washington, for shame!  </P> <P> BEMI DeBUS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fewer ITV channels bad for advertisers Sir, I am glad to be able to agree with one or two things in Greg Dyke's letter (December 8), but I have to say that I disagree with rather more of it. Certainly,the TV airtime market is changing and, certainly, it is in everyone's interest, including the advertisers, that ITV remains a strong channel. No problems with either of these statements. However, I must take exception when he says that 'advertisers already have real choice in the TV market'. How can we say that a regional advertiser, or a company with regional brands, has any choice at all? If Britain wants to encourage medium-sized companies to grow, then we must make it more possible for them to use television and the other dynamic media. These companies will themselves all be operating in competitive markets, but they will not be able to buy television air time in a competitive market. For example, anyone who wants to advertise in Lancashire really has only one TV company available. If they want to advertise in Merseyside alone (or the Birmingham area alone, or south Yorkshire alone etc), then their choice is even less. What advertisers need, therefore, is more commercial stations, offering increased regionality - not less. Mergers will do nothing for advertisers - and I suspect they will do nothing for viewers either. For Greg Dyke to talk about 'ITV's fragmented advertising' is really to put the cart before the horse. Where combined operation matters is in the programming, and the existence of the ITV Network Centre should have taken care of the need to have a national plan for ITV programming. Advertising sales, however, remain an entirely different subject. While companies sometimes want to buy advertising on a national scale, more often they want to buy it regionally or with regional variations. This is not 'fragmented' but 'realistic' and 'flexible'. In other words, the sales arrangements are organised to look after the needs of the customers - not to please the sellers. What Greg Dyke appears to want is a sales regime which suits the ITV companies, the sellers, but is quite prepared to ignore and override the needs and wishes of the customers. Funnily enough, this is exactly how monopolies and cartels normally behave. Kenneth Miles, director general, Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, 44 Hertford Street, London W1Y 8AE</p>

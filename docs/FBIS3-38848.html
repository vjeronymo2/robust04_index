			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Below is the text of the statement made by Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe on Sunday 6 February.    "The massacre perpetrated on Saturday 5 February in Sarajevo  market is a turning point in the Bosnian drama. No one can fail  to be disturbed by what we have witnessed. The international  community would have to hang its head in shame if it were to let  such an act of barbarism occur again. A UN inquiry is underway  to determine the source of the attack. However, our reaction  must not be conditioned by the results of the inquiry. What is  important is that we make a fresh attack impossible, that is, by  putting an end to the siege of Sarajevo.    "Since yesterday, and with the agreement of the president of  the republic and the prime minister, we have been consulting  with our partners -- the U.S. secretary of state, our partners  in the European Union, and, above all, those countries with  troops on the ground.    "A consensus has been reached to convene the North Atlantic  Council as soon as possible. At this meeting, France will push  for the following ultimatum to be put to the belligerents in the  clearest terms possible:    "1) The siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, meaning that all  Serbian troops must pull back to a distance making renewed  shelling of the town materially impossible. In particular, all  Serbian and Bosnian heavy weapons in a radius of 30 km around  the town must be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  control. This measure will be the first stage in establishing  UN administration over Sarajevo, one of the components of the  European Union peace plan which was accepted in principle by all  parties.    "2) If these two requirements are not met by a deadline set  by the allies, all resources, including air force, must be  implemented to enforce them.    "3) The means of implementing this action, if it is adopted  by NATO, will be defined and applied in consultation with the  United Nations and its secretary general."    For his part, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in a  statement: "At present (...) it is not possible to determine  the origin of firing. This emphasizes, moreover, the extreme  difficulty of managing this crisis militarily, if this were  necessary. However, we all agree that it is the siege itself  that is the cause of all these deaths. Today, Sarajevo has a  death toll of approximately 10,000. This siege cannot be  tolerated and we must put an end to it (...).    "The use of force, whether in the air, at sea, or on the  ground, for us has always been secondary to a political  settlement. Air strikes, which are of course the subject of so  many comments, are not in themselves or by themselves a  response. They are and remain a tool for making reason heard.  We have never, and even less today than yesterday, abandoned  this method. I remind you that the 3,000 soldiers on the ground  in Sarajevo, some 75 percent of whom are French, are on a  humanitarian protection mission based on a series of UN  resolutions. We regularly see them carrying out their mission  with exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice, and I want to again  stress this point to you. I merely note today that, from now  on, their task will be made even more difficult than before."</p>

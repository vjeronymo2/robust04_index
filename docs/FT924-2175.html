			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mapic warns members to expect sizeable additional calls for money MAPIC, the accountants' professional indemnity insurance mutual, has warned its members of possible substantial additional calls for money in response to sharply rising litigation against the firms. Mr Roger Pedder, chairman, says in the report for the year to June 30 that members should make provisions of 6 per cent for 1990-91 and 7 per cent for 1991-92. The report warns that if the adverse trend of greater claims continues, underwriting rates may have to rise when they are next renewed. Claims paid by Mapic rose 51 per cent to Pounds 520,000. Contingent claims almost doubled to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 1.61m) in the period; the company estimates these will be settled for Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 848,000). The underwriting summary says there was 'dramatic claim inflation' in 1990-91, reflecting a litigious climate and the state of the economy. There has been a growth in claims against accountants for failing to detect 'misappropriations' by employees. Typical claims concerned failures in tax advice, particularly in relation to capital gains. There were also claims for alleged failure to detect fraud on audit.</p>

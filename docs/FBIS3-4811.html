Hashimoto said at the Foreign Corrrespondents' Club of Japan  that the ruling coalition has not demonstrated support for the  idea, which has been pressed by the LDP.    He also said it would take considerable time for the next  general election to be held if it is conditioned on firm  establishment of the new electoral system and sufficient  promotional activities targeting public opinion.    He said no one should completely rule out the possibility of  the House of Representatives being dissolved and new elections  being held under the current electoral system.    Asked about Japan's chronic and mounting trade surpluses,  Hashimoto suggested it could be ameliorated somewhat if Japan  were to procure materials from Europe and North America to use  as aid for particular regions of the world.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / The Blair project and the pot of gold: Can the Labour leader overcome the Tories' bribe and become the next conservative prime minister? Look around the House of Commons and you see at once who would make the best leader of the Conservative party. There he sits, just opposite the first lord of the Treasury, a sense of destiny suppressing his usual nervous smile. Can you doubt it? Tony Blair, Tory prime minister, would romp home with a majority not seen since Margaret Thatcher left the stage. Admittedly, the fact that he is leader of the opposition is an obstacle. It can be overcome by standing the Labour party on its head, affixing the word 'new' to its title, and 'educating' the voters. That is the essence of what Mr Blair calls his project. He could of course abandon the conservative image that he conjures up in the electorate's mind. To do so would be to waste an invaluable asset. The erstwhile socialists behind him must therefore fall in line, a few stubborn dissenters being the only permissible exception. Mr Blair is apt to observe that he would not want his present job on any other terms. When you see the disgraceful way in which the Tories are making his choice of school for his 10-year-old son a political issue you wonder why he, or anyone else, goes into politics at all. We must assume, however, that he knew what he was in for when he bid for the leadership. The way I read him, his plans for the further development of his project are startling. Let the people's party embrace the prevailing free-market ideology. Let it be the proponent of the dynamic market economy, competition, choice, capitalism. A touch of regulation is needed, no more. Capitalism? Surely not. Well, no. I was getting a bit carried away there. Mr Blair is not in the habit of advertising himself as a capitalist, although he has used the other previously taboo Tory words to describe 'new Labour' and its supposedly continuing values. This week the formulation was 'competitive market economy with a strong industrial and wealth generating base'. The least we capitalist-roaders can expect is something along those lines in the revised statement of party aims and objectives called for by the party leader at the conference in Blackpool in October. Anything less, and Labour's internal debate about scrapping Clause IV of its constitution will have been a waste of time. The consultative paper endorsed by the national executive committee would not be 'historic', as Mr Blair claimed on Wednesday, but just another piece of trash. The details of this consultative exercise can be tedious, but the essence of the matter is central to British politics in the 1990s. Clause IV is laced with pious hooey about securing for 'the workers by hand or brain the full fruits of their industry'. It speaks of doing so 'upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange'. This dotty quasi-Marxist invocation was appended to Labour's constitution in the same month as the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. It has not been a success, not as a guide to policy and certainly not as a vote-winner. It has never been put into practice, not wholeheartedly, not even by the nationalising Labour government of 1945-51. If it had been, Britain would long since have been packed into containers and driven in lorries to eastern Europe. Nobody, not workers by hand or brain nor anyone else, has benefited from the clause, the most famous passage of which is printed on every Labour party membership card. The single exception is the Conservative party, which has used it as a weapon of counter-propaganda. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since Hugh Gaitskell lost his battle to have Clause IV dropped. He died before he could 'fight and fight and fight again' to save the party he loved. The poison clause was left intact until April 1992, when, after losing four elections in a row, it became clear that it would have to be removed. The late John Smith was unconvinced, even when in March last year Jack Straw produced a pamphlet arguing the case for amendment. Mr Straw's proposed substitute clause mentions markets, but demands that they be the servants not the masters of the community. The latter 'should intervene through appropriate measures of regulation, control and public ownership'. Since he managed Mr Blair's campaign in the leadership election after the death of Mr Smith, Mr Straw's ideas presumably carry weight. Labour would be better served by a constitution that omitted any mention of public ownership, such as the Fabian Society draft produced in summer 1993. Best of all would be the version produced by Stephen Pollard, and published by the Social Market Foundation a fortnight ago. It includes the formulation: '. . . all relevant decisions should be taken according to the workings of the market'. State control, says this optimum Clause IV 'is only justified where other forms of ownership are incapable of delivering the efficient allocation of resources'. It may be that the party will not swallow anything so stark. Mr Blair is attempting to bedazzle his followers by surrounding the core issue - the wholehearted acceptance of the market - with clouds of rhetoric about what other parties in other countries do. These are speckled with talk about 'social justice, freedom, opportunity, equality, democracy and solidarity'. His central idea, which is that people owe a duty to one another as well as themselves is, however, appealing. You could say that he sees the 'me' generation of the 1980s being succeeded by the 'we' generation in the 1990s. He had better get a move on. Labour has a huge lead in the opinion polls today, but that must be set against the mountainous bag of our gold that Kenneth Clarke is stashing away in order to bribe us to vote Tory when the election comes. The chancellor has two budgets ahead, enough to dissolve any poll lead. Mr Blair will understand better than anyone that talk of community values is a hard sell against reductions in taxes on incomes. Mr Clarke stood up twice in the House of Commons this week, performing at his best as the prime minister sat slumped on the seat beside him. He is the only potential Conservative leader who might be a match for Mr Blair.</p>

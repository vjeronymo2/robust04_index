The chief of General Staff, according to the paper said the  report of the Japanese weekly was based on a rude and open false  document and it was a clear provocation motivated by the  intention to throw a shadow on the Ministry of Defence and the  general staff of Russia.    The paper said:    At the same time, the chief of general staff did not rule  out  that this would be beneficial only to those who seek to  complicate the relations between Russia and North Korea.    That is right. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is  now presenting itself as a very crucial matter. As was stated  recently by a high-ranking Russian diplomat, we consider the  sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on  which some countries insist are the worst means. Worse still,  there are people who are trying to turn the complicated process  of talks into an open pressure on Pyongyang.    It is not good to them to accuse Russia now of having helped  the DPRK possess nuclear weapons. Is it?</p>

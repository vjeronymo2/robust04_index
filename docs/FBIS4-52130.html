			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan's imports of semiconductors have risen  sharply. Japan is a major memory-manufacturing nation turning  out 4-megabit DRAM (dynamic random-assess memory); however, as a  result of growing export demand from American personal computer  manufacturers, Japan has been in short supply of memories, which  has resulted in boosting their imports to make up for the  shortfall. The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has  "unexpectedly" served to meet a "20- percent share of  foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese chip market" under  the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, known as being typical  of a numerical target.    The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has been noticeable  since early this year.    According to trade statistics compiled by the Finance  Ministry, Japan imported a total of 99,764,510 memories during  the January-March quarter, a jump of 1.5 times over the same  period of last year. Japan's memory imports during the first  three months this year exceeded its total memory imports for  1988. The view is already surfacing that Japan's memory imports  this year will certainly exceed last year's all-time high of 313  million memories.    South Korea has become a top supplier of memories to Japan  in  terms of volume and amount, and most of the memories are  believed to be 4-megabit DRAM. Against the background of the  economic recovery in the United States, such major Japanese  semiconductor manufacturers as NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd., and  Toshiba Corp. have exported nearly 70 percent of their 4-megabit  DRAM that is used in the manufacture of personal computers,  thereby triggering the short supply in Japan. The Electronic  Industries Association of Japan has said, "Japanese personal  computer makers and memory users have coped with the short  supply by importing South Korean-made memories."    The trend of high memory prices at home has forced the  Japanese personal computer makers and memory users to import  memories from abroad to keep their businesses profitable.  Japanese personal computer makers have aggressively imported  foreign-made EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) and  other memories that are technologically superior to domestically  made memories, and this has become a factor in Japan's growing  imports of memories.    A researcher at the electronics group of the Nomura Research  Institute, who is well versed in the domestic and foreign  semiconductor situations, has said, "As Japanese semiconductor  makers have increasingly shunned the production of DRAM, South  Korean semiconductor manufacturers, who increased their supply  capabilities, needed to boost their semiconductor exports to  Japan so Japan's imports of DRAM's are expected to grow in the  future."</p>

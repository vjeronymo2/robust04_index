			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "No Disruptions Seen in Flow of Foreign </F> Capital"]    [Text] A senior trade expert associated with the central  government is optimistic that foreign capital will continue to  flow into China this year despite the contraction in real estate  business.    Although the property boom has been muffled by the  government  clampdown on credit, other opportunities may compensate for the  loss.    "Foreign investors are expected to have a foothold in  certain  new sectors like agriculture and banking, while bringing about  larger-scale projects," said Li Yue, Vice Chairman and  Secretary-General of the China Association of Enterprises with  Foreign Investment.    The association is under the leadership of the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), and helps  advise the ministry on policy-making.    Li said construction of major infrastructure projects will  remain constant through the year.    For instance, Li said, many giant international companies  want to set up joint ventures making power equipment.    "China is the world's largest market for power  construction,"  he said. "but the quality of domestically-manufactured power  equipment leaves much to be desired."    Li added that metallurgy, too, will need more foreign  investment as domestic consumption expands along with the  economy.    The automobile spare parts industry is another magnet for  foreign investment, as China will raise production of  automobiles this year.    For example, Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint  venture  which turned out 100,000 cars last year, is expected to increase  production by 50,000 in 1994.    "The production of raw materials and basic machinery and  electronic components is lucrative, too," Li said.    He cited General Electric Co (GE) and the Shell Co as big  businesses poised to invest in China. GE and Shell would like  to produce engineering plastics and other chemical products in  China.    Aside from infrastructure, Li said, agriculture and the  service sector are also expected to benefit from more foreign  investment.    He expressed hope that the State will give more favourable  treatment to foreign investors when it comes to high-risk  sectors like agriculture.    The State now monopolizes export of agricultural products,  but Li thinks foreign investors should be permitted a role.    "The current monopoly, which fails to promote the quality of  agricultural and sideline products, has caused our share of the  Hong Kong market to shrink," he pointed out.    Li said that if an approaching national working conference  on  the use of foreign investment proposes new policies regarding  agriculture, the prospects for more foreign capital will  brighten. He did not mention when the conference will be held.    Li also suggested relaxing controls on how the service  sector  uses foreign investment, especially in regard to finance and  telecommunications.    For example, foreign banks now can open branches only in the  coastal regions. But Li said foreign banks should be allowed to  open branches inland on a trial basis to expand investment,  especially for mining.    "Moreover," Li said, "China should permit foreign banks to  deal in renminbi business if it wants to enhance the yuan's  credibility among international financial institutions."    This way, he said, the renminbi could be helped on its way  to  becoming a freely convertible currency.    On another subject, Li said the China Association of  Enterprises with Foreign Investment will help address a number  of major problems plaguing foreign investment ventures.    Among these problems are the large number of enterprises  that  lose money, the slow flow of foreign capital, and growing  disputes between foreign managers and Chinese employees.    Because his association has many joint ventures as members,  it can help foreign investors find Chinese partners, and vice  versa.    Li added, "We will also help certain enterprises involved in  anti-dumping cases to prepare for lawsuits this year."</p>

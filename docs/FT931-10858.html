			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Acute strains forced action as krone sank - Exchange Rate Mechanism FOREIGN exchange dealers saw the interest rate cuts as a clear signal that the German central bank would do whatever was necessary keep the European exchange rate mechanism intact. But some said the moves could sow doubts about the credibility of the Bundesbank's commitment to control inflation at home, while driving a wedge between the remaining 'core countries' in the ERM and those on the periphery such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which have been forced to devalue in the past three months without the help of a Bundesbank interest rate cut. Foreign exchange analysts said this week's acute strains inside the ERM, following the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, caused the Bundesbank to ease policy yesterday. On Wednesday, the Danish krone fell sharply to its floor against three ERM currencies - the Irish punt, Dutch guilder and D-Mark - in a burst of speculation. Yesterday morning's 2 percentage point rise in the Danish deposit and discount rates to 11.5 per cent indicated that the krone was looking increasingly like another devaluation candidate. A worrying feature of the selling of the krone on Wednesday afternoon was that much of it appeared to be by Danish investors. Selling by domestic investors is often seen as an indication that a currency is particularly weak. There was growing speculation that a devaluation of the krone would result in pressure on the French franc, whose parity with the D-Mark is seen as pivotal to the ERM. In the light of yesterday's events, some economists suggested that the French authorities might have played a crucial part in behind-the-scenes discussions leading up to the Bundesbank move. The Bank of France's decision to re-introduce its 5-to-10 day short-term borrowing facility on Tuesday was seen yesterday as indicating a prior awareness that Germany might be prepared to ease its rates to protect the ERM. The French authorities are thought to have put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease monetary conditions, partly because high interest rates were causing problems, for French banks. US rating agencies have already cast doubt on the creditworthiness of French banks. An unexpectedly weak performance by the Belgian franc, a currency which is closely tied to the D-Mark, was also causing alarm on Wednesday night. In recent months, 3-month Belgian francs have traded at a premium to 3-month D-Marks on the assumption that the franc is in the hard core of European currencies. On Wednesday, however, the cost of 3-month Belgian francs soared some 20 basis points above 3-month D-Marks. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, the Belgian currency was having to carry a premium against the possibility of the ERM collapsing. Yesterday, both the Danish krone and Belgian franc were performing more strongly.</p>

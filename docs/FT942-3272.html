			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: MetLife and Travelers combine operations Metropolitan Life and Travelers, the US insurers, are combining their health insurance businesses in a joint venture company, marking a further consolidation in the US managed healthcare industry. Together, the two provide health insurance to 13m people and have annual premiums in this area of Dollars 17.6bn. The companies hope to reduce unit costs and force bigger discounts from healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs companies. The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica financial services group took over Travelers last year, to sort out some parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations. Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as companies sought to make themselves more efficient. Under a separate agreement yesterday, Travelers said it would sell its group life insurance business to MetLife for Dollars 350m. MetLife and Travelers have been slower than some other leading insurers to develop managed care operations. These take various forms, but generally involve a company setting up networks of doctors and hospitals and negotiating discounts, rather than simply processing claims forms. Only 391,000 of the 13m people insured by Travelers and MetLife are in health maintenance organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are serviced by a prescribed network of doctors and hospitals. All US insurers are attempting to move people from fee-for-service plans into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of providing healthcare cover. HMOs are popular among US companies that pay their employees' health insurance. Buying coverage for the average person in an HMO cost Dollars 3,520 last year, compared with Dollars 4,370 for traditional health insurance.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: US and French in joint bid for Czech telecoms group Bell Atlantic of the US and France Telecom have joined forces in the contest for the Czech Republic's state telecommunications company which could be eastern Europe's biggest privatisation. Initial bids for a 27 per cent stake in SPT Telecom - worth up to Dollars 1bn - are due in December. N. M. Rothschild, the UK merchant bank acting for France Telecom, said yesterday it had 'the best client and consortium going forward'. But stiff competition will come from a grouping understood to include Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN) of the Netherlands, AT&amp;T of the US and Swiss Telecom. Two other contenders, Deutsche Telekom, the German national operator, and Ameritech, the regional Bell company, are considering continuing the partnership which won last year's bidding for Matav, the Hungarian state telecommunications company. The US-French partnership starts from a strong position in that Bell Atlantic has an existing mobile phone operation in the Czech Republic and France Telecom has provided technical assistance to SPT. KPN's privatisation earlier this year is an attribute but rivals doubt that it is ready to enter a tough bidding war. The Czech government is sensitive about German economic influence, and Deutsche Telekom's involvement in Hungary, where it promises to set up a regional communication hub, will inhibit its claims to do the same for the Czech Republic. As important as the composition of the consortia are the identities of their advisers and in hiring N. M. Rothschild, France Telecom has got one of the most experienced specialists on telecommunications privatisation N. M. Rothschild was mandated by the Hungarian government for the privatisation of Matav and was one of the most sought-after advisers by bidders for SPT. It is believed that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has built on a relationship with KPN, established during its privatisation, to work with the Dutch operator in its Czech effort. Ameritech is thought to have retained the other leading US advisory firm, Morgan Stanley.</p>

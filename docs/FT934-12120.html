			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Application of Euro laws 'over complicated' BRITISH government bureaucracy is creating complex additions to European Community employment law that run counter to the idea of deregulation, a leading personnel official warned yesterday. Mr Roger Farrance, president of the Institute of Personnel Management, told its annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, that the government was repeatedly 'going over the top when it comes to applying legislation arising from (European) Commission initiatives'. Mr Farrance said: 'The recent maternity leave and maternity pay proposals are crazily over-complicated. Employers would much rather have a simple, easy-to-explain system than anything so far proposed.' He criticised new health and safety regulations, which he said had been made far too complicated. Mr Farrance said the institute shared government wishes to avoid new costs and impositions from Europe, and pointed to the institute's opposition to 'rigid works council proposals'. When implementing EC legislation, said Mr Farrance, the government was adding new and complex requirements that ran counter to its de-regulation philosophy. Bureaucracy, he said, was also muddying UK-bred employment initiatives such as the training and enterprise councils and the local enterprise councils, which he said were clouded in mystery. Mr Farrance also attacked corporate cost-cutting policies that were based on the belief that 'headcount slashing is the best way to raise profits'. He added: 'There are better ways.' The pay of personnel managers has risen about 4 per cent over the past 12 months, similar to pay rises for other managers, and down from 6.6 per cent the previous year, according to the annual survey by Reward Group and the IPM. The survey says that senior and middle managers are paid up to 13 per cent more than their management colleagues, while junior staff are generally paid about 8 per cent less. Personnel directors at board level are paid much the same as their colleagues.</p>

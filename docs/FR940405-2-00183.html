			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Perform a formal assessment of each potential program participant's deficiencies in performing the ADLs. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy of the informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Clarify that any program participant needs assistance in at least one ADL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Perform a regular reassessment and updating of the supportive services plan of all frail elderly participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Replace any member of the PAC within 30 days after such member resigns. A PAC should not perform formal assessments if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has yet to be replaced by the HA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Notify the HA and program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period on which to review and comment, prior to adoption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in the selection of Multifamily Project Demonstration participants, with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin or type of disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) In addition to the foregoing, the PAC procedures should ensure that any frail elderly person has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process. In the case of refusal of services, the PAC must determine the person's continued ability to live independently without the recommended service, with this determination being a consideration for the individual's entering into/remaining in the Multifamily Project Demonstration. In situations where an individual requests additional service(s), not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether this request is legitimately a needs-based service which can be covered under the Multifamily Project Demonstration supportive services grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transition from multifamily project demonstration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The HA/PAC must develop procedures for providing for a program participant's transition out of the Multifamily Project Demonstration to another setting. Such a transition is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by that individual to continue to live independently. A program participant may be transitioned out of the Multifamily Project Demonstration under the following circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under the Multifamily Project Demonstration; or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Refuses to pay rent and/or supportive services fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (11) Service Coordinator and Case Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A full-time service coordinator should be able to serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 50&hyph;70 program participants. The service coordinator may be hired directly by the HA or contracted through a case management agency on a fee-for-service basis. If the service coordinator is a contracted-out function, the service coordinator may not work for the service provider which will provide supportive services to the HA for the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service coordinator contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the selected HA proposes to contract out to a third-party agency for a service coordinator, the contract must include provisions containing, at a minimum: Beginning and end dates of the contract; number and responsibilities of staff hired; rates of pay/costs of services to be provided; location of office(s) and an agreement to provide HUD access to the files; other documentation pertinent to the Multifamily Project Demonstration; and other items necessary to conform to 24 CFR 85.36 (procurement requirements for Federal grants). Any contract awarded under this subsection must conform to the policies and procedures stated at 24 CFR 85.36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualifications of service coordinator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A service coordinator's work and educational experiences should meet the following minimum guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A Bachelor of Social Work or degree in a related field such as gerontology, psychology or counseling. An HA may propose justification for hiring a person without a degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Two to three years of experience in social services delivery with senior citizens or demonstrated working knowledge of supportive services and other resources for senior citizens in the jurisdiction where the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to be located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Ability to advocate, problem-solve and provide results for the elderly served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Demonstrated writing and organizational skills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Functions of the service coordinator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The functions of the service coordinator include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To provide general case management and referral services to all applicants for the Multifamily Project Demonstration. This involves intake screening upon referral of those income eligible frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons from the HA, and preliminary assessment of frailty and near-frailty, using a commonly accepted assessment tool. The service coordinator then will refer to the PAC those individuals who appear eligible for the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To establish linkages and professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community; develops a directory of providers for use by demonstration program staff and program participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) To complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment processes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) To implement the case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

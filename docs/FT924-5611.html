			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Pressure on franc begins to ease Pressure on the French franc lessened yesterday on news that France's trading account stayed in the black in October after September's currency crisis, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The trading surplus of FFr1.07bn in October was well below the FFr3.71bn achieved in September, but brought the overall surplus for the first 10 months of 1992 to FFr23.86bn, against a FFr27.38bn deficit in the same period last year.</p>

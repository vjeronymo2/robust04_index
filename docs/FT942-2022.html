			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Canada issue to replenish its reserves Fresh volatility in European government bonds brought new issuance in the eurobond market to a virtual standstill yesterday, the only deal of note being a Dollars 2bn issue of three-year eurobonds from Canada. Syndicate managers said that while the pricing of the issue was correct, they feared that the market would have difficulty in absorbing the bonds in view of the latest sell-off in the markets and worries about the dollar. They also questioned whether there was enough retail demand for short-dated dollar bonds to ensure swift placement. The Canadian finance ministry said the size of the offering would enable it to become the new three-year benchmark in the eurodollar sector and would ensure a liquid secondary market. The proceeds will replenish the country's foreign exchange reserves following its recent sales of US dollars in the foreign exchange market to protect the Canadian currency. Lead managers Deutsche and UBS reported steady sales to investors in the Far East and Europe. However, syndicate managers expected loose bonds coming back into the market, especially from banks within the syndicate, to cause the yield spread on the bonds to widen, even though the joint leads would be under pressure to defend the spread. At launch the bonds were priced to yield 17 basis points over three-year Treasuries and when they were freed to trade the spread remained unchanged. The market is looking ahead to Fannie Mae's first global bond offering, due to be launched tonight to coincide with Tokyo trading hours. Pricing of the Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon London time. They are likely to be priced to yield around 23 basis points over Treasuries. Later in the week, UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire of France, is likely to raise Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m through an offering of mortgage-backed bonds through its special-purpose vehicle, Leo 2. J. P. Morgan is believed to be handling the issue. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has affirmed the long-term debt ratings of Barclays Bank and its units (double-A for senior debt, double-A minus for subordinated debt and single-A plus for junior subordinated perpetual debt) and removed them from CreditWatch, where they were placed in March. The rating outlook is stable.</p>

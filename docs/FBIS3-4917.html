A blaze that started on a mountain in the demilitarized zone  in Torasan-ri, Changso-myon, Paju-kun at 4:00 PM engulfed a  260-hectare area in 20 hours before dying out at 11:30 PM.    During the fire, some 50 mines buried in the DMZ exploded,  witnesses said.    When the fire became stronger around noon, army posts to the  south of the Military Demarcation Line started a counter blaze  to keep the flames from spreading further.    In Towon-ri, Chongun-myon, Yangpyong-kun, the province's  second mountain fire of the day broke out at 2:25 PM, destroying  an area of 3.5 hectares. The blaze was brought under control in  three hours, thanks to a Forestry Administration helicopter and  100 villagers.    The third fire started on a mountain in Chinjung-ri,  Choan-myon, Nam Yangju-kun at 6:00 PM and destroyed 0.5 hectares  in about an hour.</p>

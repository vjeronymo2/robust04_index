			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF is consolidating these sections with the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional changes. ATF proposes to revise the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glassware to include similar containers made of materials other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than glass. Currently, &sect;6.89 enumerates the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tapping accessories which can be sold, at cost, to a retailer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, the regulation also specifies that the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member must pass on the cost of initial installation to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retailer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would expand the original coil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning service exception currently in &sect;6.97 to cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled spirits, as well as wine and malt beverages. Keeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coils clean and free of contamination is clearly in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest of public health. Therefore, it is in the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest to allow such services without a dollar limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulation allows industry members to sell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon dioxide gas to retailers. The regulation does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the sale of other gases, such as nitrogen, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are used in various existing alcoholic beverage dispensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. ATF proposes modifying this regulatory section to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow industry members to sell any gas to a retailer provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is used in a beverage dispensing system. This proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be viewed as sanctioning treatment which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change still wine to sparkling wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.91, Samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current section allows an industry member to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or give samples of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a retailer. The petitioners recommend amending this section to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that industry members may furnish a maximum of 750  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milliliters (mls.) of distilled spirits samples to qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retailers. The 500 milliliter (ml.) container is no longer an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized size for distilled spirits. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners suggest that ``750 ml.'' should be substituted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``500 milliliters'' in the second sentence of this section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the third sentence of this section should be eliminated in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF agrees with the petitioners that the reference to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obsolete 500 ml size be replaced, but proposes a maximum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 liters for either distilled spirits or wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF also proposes amending the current regulation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting the number of commonly owned retail establishments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (not to exceed four per retailer) which can be given samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment would allow for a control State or chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retailer to receive sufficient samples to determine whether to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase a product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.93, Combination Packages <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, &sect;6.93 addresses combination packages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where an industry member packages a non-alcoholic item with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages and, in particular,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c) requires that the cost of the combination package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be passed on to the retailer. The petitioners recommend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleting paragraph (c) of &sect;6.93 because they feel the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition imposed by the paragraph is really a pricing decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of ATF's regulation under the FAA Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF proposes removing all the conditions currently imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on combination packages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.94, Educational Seminars <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF proposes to clarify the final sentence, ``This does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize an industry member to pay a retailer's expenses in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with an educational seminar.'' by adding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanatory phrase ``(such as travel, lodging, and meals).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.98, Advertising Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners recommend adding the clause ``except where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exclusive retailer in the state is a state agency'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``&sect;6.98 Advertising service <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The advertisement does not also contain the retail price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the product, except where the exclusive retailer in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state is a state agency, and *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners do not believe that the objectives of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 105(b) of the FAA Act are served by prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry members from advertising control States' prices. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners' proposed revision would permit an industry member  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to advertise a control State's state-wide retail prices as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by that State for product sold within the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners feel that in such circumstances, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of any ``inducement'' or ``exclusion'' that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contravene the intent or purpose of the FAA Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF proposes amending the current regulation in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the industry request, modified to reflect situations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the sole retailer in a jurisdiction is a State or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency. ATF also proposes to delete the condition that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertisement placed by an industry member may not mention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events or promotions at a retail establishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.99, Stocking, Rotation, and Pricing Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners recommend revising this section to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry members to also ``recommend shelf plans.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners feel that this revision would permit an industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member to provide services to a retailer consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present day marketplace realities. ATF proposes to amend this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section in line with the petitioners' proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> COUNTY CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PUTS ON THE DOG FOR ORANGE CONCERT  </P> <P> The Orange County Chamber Orchestra closed its Sunday concert with a bow. Two  bows. Actually, two bow-wows. They were listed in the program, along with  musical personnel, under Hunde: Kaela, die Hunde Principal; and Bruno. And,  though the orchestra and the day's featured guests Jeanne and Sidney Weiss gave  their polished all, it was a dog day afternoon at St. Joseph Center in Orange.  </P> <P> The occasion for Kaela and Bruno's contributions was Leopold Mozart's "Hunt"  Symphony, a good-natured romp that sports an opening movement full of barking  hounds and gunshots (in this case, cap-gun shots from toy rifles wielded by  jungle fatigue-clad marksmen). But for this performance, presumably remembering  the adage that animal acts are hard to follow, music director Micah Levy  swapped this movement with the closing minuet.  </P> <P> The chamber orchestra backed Papa Mozart's shenanigans with implacable elegance  and a dignity that belied the hilarity yet to come. Horns -- Jon Titmus, Mark  Adams, Diane Muller and Kurt Snyder -- handled the obligatory parallel calls in  the first and third movements with admirable control of intonation and  ornamentation even after the workout they had just finished in Handel's  Concerto for Two Choirs.  </P> <P> The horns had already met the challenge of typical Baroque stratospheric lines  in Handel's showcase for antiphonal wind ensembles. Here, the wind choirs --  led by oboists Peter Scott and Marni Hougham, hornists Titmus and Muller, and  bassoonist David Muller; answered by Kathy Del Russo and Electra Reed, oboes,  Adams and Snyder, horns, and Andrew Kline, bassoon -- conversed in crisp,  energetic dialogue. Scott, in particular, distinguished himself with a stylish,  engaging oboe solo in the Larghetto section of the third movement (which Levy  led as an Allegretto contrast to the movement's introductory Andante).  </P> <P> In contrast to the clean, light balance that marked the second half of the  program, Chausson's Concert for Piano, Violin and String Quartet was muddled by  performance with string orchestra rather than quartet. By exploiting  pretensions to concerto status, this arrangement sacrificed the inherent  transparency of chamber music, exchanging, for example, ponderous bottom lines  for what should have been lush, dark underpinnings.  </P> <P> Moreover, the replacement sent the soloists into unfortunate competition with  the strings. In the Sicilienne, Jeanne Weiss' piano was lost while Sidney  Weiss' violin fought for supremacy in what is otherwise a lilting, poignant  song. And while far from insensitive to interpretive demands, the Weisses  proved themselves ill-matched for this work by contrasting a wide Romantic  violin sweep against a too-delicate pianism.  </P></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sema sells I-Linie software for Pounds 1.5m Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, has abandoned attempts to succeed in the marketplace with I-Linie, the manufacturing management software it hoped would be the cornerstone of its packaged software business. The directors said yesterday that the company had sold the I-Linie business to CGI, a French subsidiary of International Business Machines, for about Pounds 1.5m cash. The deal is subject to the approval of the German competition board. Sema, which had turnover last year in excess of Pounds 500m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.9m, acquired I-Linie through the purchase of ADV Orga, a German software packages company in 1989. It has since spent several million pounds of research and development funds, in conjunction with IBM, to develop the product. I-Linie, a financial, accounting and human resources package was seen by Sema as competition for R3, a successful package from SAP, the German software house. Sema's corporate plan calls for the company to achieve 60 per cent of turnover from systems integration, 25 per cent from facilities management and 15 per cent from software packages. The company's packages business, excluding I-Linie, currently accounts for 5 per cent of turnover. The directors stated that the company would retain a presence in the software packages which it continued to see as strategic to its development.</p>

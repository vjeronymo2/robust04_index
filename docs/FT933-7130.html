			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Joint strategy to boost image of London THE Corporation of London and the London Docklands Development Corporation are to make a joint promotion of London as a business district. Next month's presentation in Hong Kong will be the first time two separate London authorities have joined in promoting the capital since the formation of London First, the business-led organisation set up last year. Both participants claim the new development as a significant breakthrough in the attempts to find a coherent new strategy for boosting the capital's image. The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, said: 'It is important more for the fact that the two authorities have been able to organise themselves than for what they will actually get out of it.' It admitted that organisation had been easier because party politics had not played a part, and that wider promotion of London could 'fall down' due to difficulties in organisation. Both Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation of London's policy chairman, and Mr Michael Pickard, LDDC chairman, will address the 17th International Urban Development Association conference. They have two purposes: To increase interest in development and property opportunities in London. To make a 'generic' promotion of London as a business centre. They aim jointly to address the misconceptions about London held by businesses in the Asia Pacific region. These include fears about the threat of terrorism, the introduction of the new regime for advance corporation tax, and increasing fears outside Europe that the community has become more protectionist since the European summit in 1991.</p>

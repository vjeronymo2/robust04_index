			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F> Ivica Milosavljevic in Belgrade on 6 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Milosavljevic] The proposal of the law on budget  was endorsed at the session of the Republican Government today.  We asked Mr. Mirko Marjanovic to give an exclusive statement on  the occasion for the Radio and Television of Serbia.    [Marjanovic] Well, this is as follows: The proposal of the  law on the budget of the Republic of Serbia for 1994 was drafted  in conformity with the basic program of monetary reconstruction  and the strategy of economic development of the country, and  particularly in conformity with the government program adopted  at the latest session of the Serbian Assembly when the  Government was approved. One should also stress here that,  according to the proposal of the law on the budget for 1994,  public spending in Serbia is lower by more than 30 percent  compared to the planned level of public spending in the  consolidated balance on the level of the country. Now here is  what that means: That means that the planned deficit in the  basic program has been reduced from 1.9 billion dinars to 780  million and we can claim with full confidence that we have  completely realistic sources of income for covering this budget  deficit. We can also claim with confidence that with this  reduction of public spending by almost two-thirds we have  established a basis for a normal program and for the realization  of the program of economic recovery of the country.    I can also stress here that the social program for Serbia  was  also included in the budget and that with the basic principles  and strategy of the budget established in this way, we in fact  enabled the further removal of the burden on the economy and  citizens, which should also be pointed out.</p>

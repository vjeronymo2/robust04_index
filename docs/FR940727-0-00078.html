The mere presence of one or more of these indicators does not, by itself, require reporting under paragraph b of this section. Reports should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspicion of procurement fraud or irregularity or the procuring agency refers the matter for investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) ``Procurement Flash Reports'' will be transmitted by FAX directly to PFD whenever a PFI Coordinator or PFA receives notice of a PFI involving the Army. To facilitate filing, a separate sheet should be used for each case reported. These reports will provide a succinct summary of the following available information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Name and address of contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Known subsidiaries of parent firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contracts involved in potential fraud. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Nature of potential fraud. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Summary of pertinent facts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Possible damages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Investigative agencies involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Local PFAs (name and phone numbers). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any of the above categories that cannot be completed will be annotated as ``unknown at present.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When a report is required by DFARS or is requested by PFD, the provisions of DFARS 209.406&hyph;3 (48 CFR 209.406&hyph;3) will be followed. That paragraph provides the basic content and format for PFI reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All personnel will cooperate to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of procurement fraud are completed in a timely and thorough manner. Requests for assistance from federal prosecutors should be processed through the local PFA whenever possible. Requests for federal investigators will be processed through the supporting USACIDC and the PFA will be notified. When the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions conflict with the progress of procurements, reasonable deference will be given to criminal investigators and prosecutors whenever possible. Any serious conflict that cannot be resolved at a local level will be immediately reported to the PFI Coordinator or PFD for action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) PFI Coordinators and PFAs may request access to information obtained during criminal investigations that is not protected by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and use this information to assist them in taking appropriate administrative, contractual, and civil remedies. Requests for this information should be made directly to the appropriate federal investigative agency. The investigative organization may withhold requested information if release would compromise an investigation. Difficulties in obtaining information which cannot be resolved locally will be referred to PFD for appropriate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) USACIDC will notify, in writing, local PFAs as well as PFD within 30 days, of initiation of a significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to Army procurement activities. Such notification will include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Case title. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) USACIDC Report of Investigation number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Responsible investigative agency or agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Office of primary responsibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Date opened. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Summary of facts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Suspected offense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The transmission of the information in f above may be delayed if the Commanding General, USACIDC, or the head of another DOD criminal investigation organization determines the transmission would compromise the success of any case or its prosecution. The prosecutive authorities dealing with the case will be consulted, when appropriate, in making such determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) USACIDC will obtain the following information at the earliest possible point in an investigation of fraud or corruption that relates to DOD procurement activities, whenever possible without reliance on grand jury subpoenas: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The individuals suspected to be responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The suspected firm's organizational structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The firm's financial and contract history. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Contingency plans smooth the aftermath for some MANY CITY businesses have seen carefully laid contingency plans work smoothly, although a few were considering their future in the Square Mile. Mr Hamid Noorizadeh , assistant general manager of Tokai Bank, a Japanese wholesale and commercial bank, said: 'We set up a disaster contingency plan. That is why it is working so well for us now. We have been working on this since yesterday morning flat out.' Tokai's headquarters, which occupied three floors in the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building, is moving temporarily to the offices of a subsidiary in nearby Finsbury Square. It has about 50 dealing positions, eight of which have moved to Safety Net Trading Places, a company which offers emergency dealing facilities. Mr Noorizadeh said: 'We drew up a comprehensive disaster plan back in July 1992 and it went very well. It will be business as usual from Monday morning.' Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan also had a contingency plan and has successfully moved to King William Street. Banque Indosuez, part of the French group, was yesterday negotiating dealing space at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank. The response of many foreign institutions is likely to calm fears that London's status as an international financial centre could be undermined by the bombing. Mr Takeshi Kadota, managing director of Mitsubishi Corporation Finance, which has moved to premises on Cheapside, said: 'Our business will not be fully operational for at least one week because we do not like to start up with an unsatisfactory infrastructure and uncertain market information. But it is not our idea to move from the City.' Others feel differently. Saudi International Bank, which has found alternative premises, said it would consider its future location 'carefully'. Mr Richard Wilson, chief operating officer, said: 'We were bombed out last year. At that stage we had a contingency plan of sorts but we tightened it up considerably following the first bomb.' He said the bank had not yet decided whether to stay in the City. 'We will have to wait and see. It is something we are going to have to think about very carefully. Obviously security will be an issue.' Few said they believed London was now more dangerous than other locations. One executive said: 'These things happen. You could be in the World Trade Centre in New York and a bomb could go off.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Deputy General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood </F> Mustafa Mashhur: "Yes to the Boycott... No to Normalization."]    [Excerpts] Talk has recently intensified about normalizing  ties with the Zionist enemy and ending the Arab boycott. This  has happened since the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as if this  agreement has abolished all barriers and the Zionist enemy has  become an Arab country with which one can deal without  restrictions or inhibitions. Some Arab countries might even be  eager to deal with the Zionist enemy even though their relations  with other Arab countries are not quite all right or are even  hostile.    We all remember that when President al-Sadat concluded the  Camp David Accord with the enemy, this aroused the anger of the  other Arab countries and prompted them boycott Egypt, declaring  that Camp David was a catastrophe in the full sense of the word  because it prevented Egypt from confronting and fighting the  enemy and at the same time rendered the remaining Arab countries  unable, even combined, to fight the enemy without Egypt.  [passage omitted]    What has befallen some Arab countries to make them now alter  their attitude? We now see some of them preparing to abolish the  boycott and normalize ties with the Zionist enemy, although the  latter has not changed its hostile designs, particularly its  goal of establishing an Israel extending from the Nile to the  Euphrates. Neither has the enemy stopped oppressing the  Palestinians -- killing them, driving them from their country,  demolishing their homes, and usurping their land.    We also see the U.S. commerce secretary visiting several  Arab  countries, hinting that the boycott has begun to unravel, and  calling for its abolition while claiming untruthfully that this  will serve the interests of the Arabs. We know that there are  three levels of boycott: boycotting the enemy's companies and  its products, boycotting foreign companies that have  partnerships with the enemy, and finally boycotting foreign  companies that deal with the enemy. The current talk is about  abolishing the third kind, followed by the second, and finally  the first.    I hereby declare: We have prior experience of dealing with  the Jews. We saw how they were planning to control our trade  and economy, how they had a monopoly over several basic  commodities, and how they manipulated prices to serve their  interests at the public's expense. The Jews have not changed.  Shall we now give them another opportunity to control the Arab  economies as a prelude to their political and, eventually,  military hegemony over us? [passage omitted]    The United States is calling for an end to the boycott  against its companies that deal with the Zionist enemy because  it wants to turn the Arab world into a big market for its  products while at the same time ensuring the Zionist enemy  remains an industrial base equipped with technological know-how  and a sophisticated infrastructure. We see the United States,  and the Zionist enemy behind it, claiming that the boycott  threatens the prospects of peace. They pretend to forget that  the boycott decision was unanimously adopted by the Arab  countries in 1950 as an expression of the rightful Arab claim to  Palestine and to protect the Arab economy from being infiltrated  by the enemy, who opposes Arab economic and industrial progress.    The United States pursues its own financial gain, even at  the  expense of other nations. By assisting the Zionist enemy, it is  ignoring the Palestinians' rights, including their right to  their land. This causes it to be the target of the hate and  hostility of the Islamic nations, because the Palestinian cause  is the cause of all Muslims which they will never abandon no  matter how long the issue lasts or how many sacrifices are  needed. Despite the current cruel pressures and the tyranny of  the greedy, U.S. and Zionist hegemony will not last.    We tell the Arab countries: Do not abandon the boycott.  Do not respond to the pressures. The boycott is a political  and economic tool to boost the Arab world's economic growth and  protect Arab investment and workers. This boycott has its roots  in the depths of Arab patriotic and religious sentiments. It  must remain rigidly airtight, impervious to any attempts to  smuggle Zionist goods to Arab markets via third countries after  changing the labels that attribute them to the Zionist enemy.    O Arabs, do not bear the onus of terminating the boycott and  the disastrous consequences it will bring to future generations,  who will undoubtedly curse you for it. [passage omitted]    When he concluded the Camp David Accord, al-Sadat said he  wanted to eliminate the hostility and thaw the icy barriers  between Egyptians and Jews. However, the Muslim Egyptian people  who were angered by the usurpation of Palestine's blessed land  rejected this normalization despite the government's attempt to  impose it on them in various spheres of activity. Only a few  biased opportunists, disloyal to their nation and religion, went  along with it. Furthermore the attempted normalization has had  several adverse effects: Some Jews have been involved in  narcotics and counterfeit currency cases and have attempted to  spread AIDS or sow sedition between Muslims and Christians. We  ask those who advocate normalization: What will its benefits  be? It will bring no benefits; it is entirely bad.    Our Arab countries must protect themselves from this evil,  which will corrupt our young people, ruin our economy, and spoil  all spheres of life. The creed followed by our Muslim people  imposes a duty on us: to evict these gangs from Palestine. We  must learn that appeasement will enable them to occupy our  countries and pursue their quest for a greater Israel extending  from the Nile to the Euphrates, and indeed as far as the city of  the Prophet [Medina], may God's peace and prayer be with him.    Current events increase our pain. The United States, Rabin,  and others are putting pressure on Yasir 'Arafat to accept the  enemy's conditions to complete this humiliating agreement.  'Arafat believes it will lead to the establishment of an  independent Palestinian state. Rabin, on the other hand, wants  it to be a Jewish colony where Palestinians run the service  sector. We recently even heard Yasir 'Arafat saying that he  does not want a Palestinian state-- thereby arousing the anger  of many around him--but a confederation with Jordan.  Additionally, it is not in the Jews' nature to keep promises or  covenants. They break them if that is to their benefit.    Arabs and Muslims, you must abide by this principle: "Yes to  the boycott, no to normalization." You must then work and carry  on a jihad to liberate all Palestine from the river to the sea.  God will give succor and victory comes only from him.    "No" to those who say that the boycott can be ended after  peace is attained, for there will be no peace, but surrender and  subservience. The Muslims will not submit to the enemies of God  and humanity.</p>

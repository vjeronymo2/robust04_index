			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["An Informant's Letter Leads to the Cracking of 11 Cases" </F> (by reporter Zhu Kang (2612 1660)]    [Text] Acting on a letter from an anonymous informant, the  tax prosecution office of the New Pudong District procuratorate  recently uncovered 11 cases involving a total of over 500,000  yuan in evaded taxes, of which more than 400,000 yuan has so far  been recovered.    In mid-March, the office received a letter containing  information about Xu Peide [1776 1014 1795], a worker of the  Gaohua Engineering Company who was temporarily transferred to  the job of port supervisor at another unit. Xu was accused of  illegally operating a restaurant named Xiaosha in Gaoqiao for  eight months; he opened the restaurant in April 1993 but applied  for a business license only in December. Even after he began  running the restaurant legally, Xu continued to evade taxes by  issuing fake receipts. At the same time he secured a business  license he also secured special receipts for traders at the  Fengjing Shopping Mall. He then made use of the preferential  tax break for the Fengjing Shopping Mall to write receipts for  others who intended to evade taxes and charged them a  "management fee."    Chen [7115], chief of the tax prosecution office's  investigation team, went to Gaoqiao with his subordinates, Pan  [3382] and Zhang [1728], to investigate the case and found some  two dozen fake receipts written by Xu Peide. Later, they also  discovered that Shen Wenhu [3088 2429 5706], a nonpermanent  resident of Shanghai, had, by using receipts issued by a  tax-free unit, evaded 10,000 yuan in taxes payable for a 100,000  yuan project he contracted for at the Baohua Ready-Mixed  Concrete Plant. That evening, Shen Wenhu's case was placed on  file for investigation and prosecution.    Next, the public prosecutors learned that Xu Peide had  collected 11 unused receipt booklets in less than one year after  he opened the restaurant in April 1993. They took swift and  fierce action against Xu. Xu first gave the names of six buyers  of his fake receipts that evening, and disclosed two more names  while under investigation. In the course of investigating the  eight cases, the public prosecutors uncovered two more serious  cases each involving over 50,000 yuan in evaded taxes.</p>

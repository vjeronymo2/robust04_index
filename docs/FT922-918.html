			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Toshiba pulls the plug on audio equipment business - A look at the challenge the Japanese group is facing as a new president takes over TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics combine, has discreetly pulled out of making radio-cassettes, compact disc players and other kinds of audio equipment. No factories have been closed or jobs cut. The operations have been quietly subsumed into the group's television and video products business. Nevertheless, a famous name has disappeared from hi-fi stores the world over. Toshiba's move out of audio is a sign of the way in which even the largest Japanese groups are being forced to respond to a worldwide recession in the electronics industry and a sharp increase in the cost of capital. Moreover, Toshiba, which operates in information processing and power engineering as well as consumer electronics, has been hit particularly hard by the rapid onset of technological change in the computer and semiconductor industries. In the late 1980s, it reaped bumper profits from pioneering new ranges of memory chips and portable computers. Today, it is under pressure in both markets. Toshiba still prides itself in a wide product range, high research and development spending, and its technological prowess. But these boasts are hedged by a new-found concern for husbanding resources, particularly capital. 'Our basic philosophy is to meet the needs of the people,' says Mr Fumio Sato, who takes over as president tomorrow. 'However, before we used to make anything that would sell. Now we must consider quality. That means, among other things, our profit margins.' Mr Sato, a softly-spoken mechanical engineer, was chosen by a group of senior directors headed by the out-going president, Mr Joichi Aoi. He plans to develop his predecessor's strategies rather than make any radical breaks with the past. Yet he believes that, over time, companies must 'evolve structurally in order to avoid becoming out-of-date'. This challenge is particularly urgent today. After growing rapidly in the late 1980s, Toshiba faces stagnant sales and falling profits, while the need to keep pace with technological innovation demands greater investment. The group's consolidated profits fell in the year to March by 44 per cent, and sales were flat. The current year is unlikely to be much better. Toshiba is trimming consolidated capital investment and research and development spending by a few percentage points to Y480bn and Y310bn respectively - but is not planning any large cuts. Mr Sato says that following the decline in the Tokyo stock market, the company's cost of capital has risen, so greater attention is being paid to increasing capital efficiency. He gives the example of the clean room, the building where the critical stages of making semiconductors are carried out in an ultra-pure atmosphere. Building clean rooms is so expensive that Toshiba is examining ways of cramming more machines into a smaller space inside the clean room, for example by removing control panels and housing them outside the clean room. Cutting costs by pulling out of a business, as with audio, is a last resort. The company prefers to move production overseas, particularly in Asian countries where labour costs are low. If necessary, production can be transferred entirely to local partners. This policy is unaffected by the recession in the industry: even though Toshiba has cut the Japanese parent company's capital investment budget for this year by 25 per cent, the group total, including overseas subsidiaries, is down by just 1 per cent. Mr Sato believes Toshiba's future rests firmly in computer and semiconductor manufacture, which account for about half the group's sales. However, he acknowledges the group faces serious problems. In semiconductor manufacture, Toshiba, like other Japanese makers, is losing money, since prices for memory chips have plunged due to weak demand and intense competition. This is in sharp contrast to the late 1980s when Toshiba stole a march on the rest of the industry by pioneering the mass production of IM D-Ram memory chips, a top-selling product, and reaped profits from being first into the market. However, the race to produce the next generation memory device, the 4M D-Ram, resulted in no clear winner and wafer-thin margins. Similarly, in computers, Toshiba beat other manufacturers in bringing to market in the late 1980s a mid-priced portable laptop machine equipped with many advanced features. But other manufacturers have since followed Toshiba's lead, driving down prices and paring margins to the bone. Laptop machines, a luxury five years ago, have become a commodity. Mr Sato says Toshiba is planning to launch a new range of laptops later this year, but declines to give details. Mr Sato believes that to stay abreast of technological change Toshiba must seek partners - as well as continuing to invest heavily in its own R and D. Yesterday, the group announced a venture with Apple, the US computer maker, for the joint development of multi-media - products which combine computing, television and audio technology. It already has a joint venture with IBM, the world's largest computer company, for making colour liquid crystal displays for computers. It is considering a second agreement with IBM for the joint development and production of flash memories - a new generation microchip which could replace the hard disk memory. These partnerships are not restricted to hardware. Last year, Toshiba paid Dollars 500m for a 6.25 per cent stake in the film and television interests of Time Warner, the US entertainment conglomerate. Toshiba also took a 25 per cent stake in Time Warner Enterprises Japan, a Tokyo-based company which will control Time Warner's Japanese businesses. The complex structure of the deal reflects Toshiba's innate caution, as does the relatively small size of the investment, which pales in comparison with the multi-billion dollar acquisitions of Hollywood film and television companies made by Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial. Mr Sato says modestly that consumer electronics is a business about which he still knows quite little. It is clear that his interests lie in the solid virtues of engineering rather than the capricious delights of Hollywood. Last year he served as the president of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. Among the society's main concerns was recruiting enough young Japanese into engineering. To the chagrin of industry, many engineering graduates turned their backs on manufacturing in the late 1980s for the high salaries of financial services. However, Mr Sato, says that more recently young people seem to be changing their minds. 'The collapse of the bubble economy has led young people to re-evaluate the merits of manufacturing.' Manufacturing is very dear to Mr Sato. He is convinced that, even though the current downturn in the Japanese economy is severe, recovery will come eventually because Japanese industry retains its international competitiveness in manufacturing. 'As far as manufacturing is concerned, Japan will stay in a strong position for some time to come.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOSHIBA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Consolidated figures, year to March 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Sales     %       Operating profit                           (Ybn)   change    (Ybn)   % change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Information technology    2,501       -1    55.2         -70 Power engineering         1,053        5    48.1          33 Consumer electronics      1,548        3    15.2         -62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

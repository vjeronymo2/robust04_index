			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS--Russian Defence Minister Grachev  said that Russia may join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme  within two to three weeks.    Speaking at a meeting with visiting parliamentary state  secretary of the German Defence Ministry Michaela Geiger,  Grachev said that the final date of signing will depend on how  soon Russia's proposals are considered and approved by NATO.    Grachev stressed that the results of his visit to Brussels  and his speech at the NATO headquarters have been approved by  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He added that technical  aspects of Russia's accession to the programme will be ironed  out through diplomatic channels.    He expressed the confidence that Geiger's visit will help  boost Russian-German ties, especially in the military sphere.  "Strong German-Russian relations will guarantee stability in  Europe, because in terms of military might Germany is second  only to Russia in Europe," Grachev said.    Speaking about his recent visit to Brussels, Grachev said  that Russia's position was met with understanding by NATO  leaders, adding that he was "pleasantly surprised" by the  positive reaction to Russia's proposals from the Baltic states.    He stressed that Russia will not seek to take part in  discussions on NATO internal issues. It only wants to  coordinate with NATO on matters concerning peace-keeping  operations and prevention of conflicts.    The talks with Geiger were also attended by First Deputy  Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. During the visit, Geiger will  tour one of the military units, a Moscow aircraft plant and a  space training centre.    Russian governmental circles confirmed on Monday that no  concrete date when Russia will sign the Partnership for Peace  programme has been named so far. They said it will depend not  only on Moscow, because the NATO leaders need to study Russia's  proposals concerning key elements of partnership.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: The Challenge THE quest for new life in the musical continues. The Mercury Workshop, formed in April, is a group of songwriters committed to furnishing new work for the musical stage, over two dozen of them. Their patron is Stephen Sondheim, with whom many of them have studied. This collective's first project, The Challenge, was given on Sunday night at the Shaw Theatre, where it was handsomely performed and rapturously received. As The Challenge proceeded, I became reluctantly grateful for its professionalism, for the fact that it relied little on scenic effects, and for its intention to keep entertaining its audience by intelligent means. The oddest feature of The Challenge is its subject. It tells the tale of Daedalus, the arch-craftsman of mythological Crete, who: constructed an artificial cow in whose framework Queen Pasiphae could copulate with her husband Minos's prize bull; planned the famous labyrinth which would hide the resulting progeny, the monstrous Minotaur; devised wings so he and his son Icarus could escape from Minos, but lost Icarus, who flew too near the sun. Needless to say, lyricists had a field-day with the dirty thoughts suggested by Pasiphae and the bull. My loudest laugh came after Daedalus had used the word 'lovable' to Pasiphae. Kit Hesketh-Harvey had her song: 'Love a bull? Funny you should say that. . .' Boy-girl romance has to wait till Theseus and Ariadne in Act Two, but then receives a pretty flood of pop ardour with Eric Woolfson's 'If I ever see that face again.' When they meet a second time they start to reprise this tune but - felicitous touch - the chorus shut them up. The Challenge doesn't relieve my gloom about the state of the musical, because, like the rest of them, it just isn't musical enough. Still, in every way it already surpasses dozens of musicals professionally presented in recent years on either side of the Atlantic.</p>

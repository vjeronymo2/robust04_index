			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Perrier and earnings recovery hopes boost Paris - France has outperformed Europe, and the UK in particular, so far this year If the French are said by their leaders to be depressed and moody these days, you would hardly believe it to look at the recent progress of the stock market. The Paris bourse has given investors one of the best rides of any major European market since the turn of the year, spurred on by a mixture of takeover fever and anticipation of earnings recovery. Its rise has tailed off in recent days, but most analysts think that this is only a pause for breath. By Friday, the CAC-40 index stood at 1,947.05, some 10.3 per cent ahead of its level at the start of the year, well outperforming London, and European averages. Several analysts believe that another 10 per cent rise is possible by the end of the year, bringing the index through the 2,000 barrier and just above the record high of 2,129.3 reached in April 1990. The big event on the takeover scene, of course, has been the protracted struggle between Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, and Italy's Agnelli family for control of Source Perrier, the mineral water group. By the end of the week, Source Perrier's shares stood at FFr1,636, a cool 34 per cent per cent ahead of their level at the start of the year and well above the Nestle bid price of FFr1,475, which is thought likely to be increased. The Perrier battle could help to sharpen foreign investors' interest in French equities. It has underlined the market's increasing openness to foreign bidders, and shown that takeovers are now being fought in the field, rather than through secret negotiations between the finance ministry and the country's leading banks. The government has not lifted a finger to stop this symbol of corporate France passing into foreign hands. So, the argument goes, it might take an equally liberal stance if any other blue chip comes under attack. The reforms to takeover rules being considered by the finance ministry would further liberalise the market; for example, abolishing the rule which allows a predator to make a bid for only two-thirds rather than all of its takeover victim, and rationalising the conflicting bourse authorities. Market professionals expect the two-thirds rule to be changed within a month or so. Beyond this, analysts expect the main bull point in the coming months to be a pick-up in profits, especially among companies in cyclical industries which respond first to an economic recovery. Earnings growth for the top 40 companies in 1992 is variously estimated at between 14 per cent and 15 per cent after a year of stagnant or falling earnings. However, these forecasts could be downgraded, since the long-expected recovery has yet to show. 'We won't really know where we are on the recovery until the second or third quarter,' warns Mr Stephen Moir, head of international sales at BZW Puget Mahe. The earnings upturn should be export-led, believes Mr Bruno Le Chevallier, strategist at James Capel in Paris. Certainly, the fact that French inflation remains under control and that the budget deficit is overshooting less than in Germany or Britain, are good signs for the country's economic health. Yet domestic demand is still slack, and Insee, the state statistics institute, stresses that its latest forecast for a 2 per cent growth in French gross domestic product this year, is linked to a 'possible' world economic recovery. French businesses are today better equipped than in the past to take advantage of a foreign recovery, on the grounds that their heavy restructuring of recent years has made them more price competitive abroad, says Mr Chevallier. This new competitiveness is, incidentally, an important factor in the recent decline of the trade deficit, which Insee expects to narrow to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.75bn) this year, after widening to just over FFr30bn in 1991. The big uncertainty remains the extent of any recovery in the US economy, to which France's top companies are more sensitive than ever before. 'After their big takeovers of recent years, the CAC-40 companies have something like 25 per cent of their sales in the dollar zone. So if the US recovers, they will too,' says Mr Le Chevallier. In the months ahead, the market will be awaiting further news of the efforts by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, to relaunch long-delayed reforms of the savings system. This could encourage the growth in France of powerful UK-style institutional investors and so increase the demand for equities. Mr Beregovoy has been consulting unions on the introduction of private pension schemes in order to supplement the state pension scheme, which faces a large and growing deficit. Also under consideration are tax incentives for employee share ownership and for individual equity investment plans, similar to personal equity plans in the UK. The unions pose a problem, through their resistance to any change in their traditional state pension rights. So it is uncertain how far the government will dare to push these reforms. All should be revealed in the next few months: the government hopes to push through the legislation in the spring, so that the reforms could take effect from July. One possible drag on the market could come from further partial privatisations, following the FFr3.4bn raised by the government from the sales of stakes in the oil group, Elf Aquitaine, and Credit Local de France, a local authority bank. Mr Beregovoy has warned that more sales are on the way. However, the sales of equity in state-owned companies should not be a serious burden for the market. The 1992 budget estimates that FFr5.6bn will come from partial privatisations this year, a small bite compared with the FFr40bn of new paper the French stock market digested last year.</p>

Earlier in the day, the delegation met with German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss security questions in the  context of the NATO summit. The Polish side said it hoped  Germany would support Poland during negotiations on the  Partnership for Peace agreement.    Polish deputies met also with managers of the Association of  Polish Servicing Enterprises in Germany, who pointed to their  economic problems stemming from the fact that Polish  construction firms were pushed off the east German market.  According to the Bonn authorities, such a situation was caused  by high unemployment in the former GDR, whereas in the opinion  of Poles there is enough demand for construction workers in that  region. The management of the association appealed to the  delegation to take care of the case.    The Polish delegation was officially bidden farewell by  Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth.    A speech at the German Foreign Affairs Society in Bonn  delivered by Jozef Oleksy was last on the agenda of the four-day  visit by the Polish Sejm delegation.    Oleksy stressed there were good investment conditions in  Poland which was a politically stable country that reported an  economic growth.    The meeting was attended by representatives of German  industrial and financial circles. Present were President of the  Krupp Foundation Berthold Beitz, Deutsche Bank President Wilhelm  Christians, head of the East German Economy Committee Otto Wolff  von Amerongen, and Deputy President of the European Investment  Bank and SPD [Social Democratic Party] economic expert Wolfgang  Roth.</p>

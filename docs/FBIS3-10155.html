			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shining Path [SL] top leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso,  who personally conducted the organization for 13 years of blood  and terror in his insane idea of "conquering power," has become  the "executioner" of this terrorist group by creating a deep  split among the organization members. This split was a result of  Guzman's letters calling for "a peace accord" to end the  "fratricidal war."    The "II Party Congress," which will be held in March  somewhere in Lima, will debate the proposals made by the  opposing factions. The possibility of giving up violence in the  near future, however, is discarded.    One of the factions is the "Right-Wing Opportunist Line  (LOD)  [Linea Oportunista de Derecha]" or "Revisionist" faction, which  is comprised of individuals who support the SL top leader and  agree with his decision.    Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, Nelly Evans Risco de Alvarez  Calderon, and Osman Morote Barrionuevo, aka "Remigio" -- who are  some of the subversive group's best-known members -- also are  part of this faction.    By adopting this position, they seek to avoid an inexorable  defeat. Before this occurs, they believe they must abandon their  principles to preserve the movement.    The other faction is the "Left-Wing Liquidationist Line  (LLI)  [Linea Liquidacionista de Izquierda]," the members of which are  known as "Perfidios." This faction is comprised of the so-called  "Recalcitrantes," who do not support or agree with the "peace  accord." They thus ignore the obedience and subordination vows  they made to "Presidente Gonzalo."    According to documents seized and recent SL "Central  Committee" re-transmissions, as well as testimony by captured  terrorists, the SL "hard" line on 7 February started the "second  offensive" of the "second campaign."    The escalation of violence began with an attack against the  Peruvian Air Force's central barracks on 28 de Julio Avenue on  that day.    This faction is supported by Catalina Adrianzen S., wife of  SL ideologist Antonio Diaz Martinez; and SL leaders Alberto  Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano;" Margie Clavo Peralta; and  Isabel Rengifo Saavedra; among others.    Other terrorists who also support this faction are: Laura  Zambrano Padilla, aka "Meche;" Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa;"  and Teresa Durand Araujo (Osman Morote Barrionuevo's wife);  among others.    Many of the criminals being held at the Chorrillos women's  jail also belong to the "Recalcitrantes" faction. The same is  true of a few criminals held at "Miguel Castro Castro" jail in  Canto Grande.    The "hardness" of the "Perfidios" in these two jails has not  changed as a result of visits made to them in the last few  months by high-ranking SL leaders such as Elena Iparraguirre  Revoredo, aka "Miriam," or Abimael Guzman Reynoso.    Guzman's Message Found    Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources reported the  discovery  of a message Guzman handed to Martha Huatay Ruiz, aka "Rosa,"  when she visited him at the Navy prison in Callao Port.    Huatay hid the message in her genitals and handed it to a  relative who visited her at the "Yanamayo" jail in Puno. This  relative was finally arrested by the PNP.    The message, which was written on a small piece of paper,  said among other things: "My arrest is a turn in the path. Join  the masses; the people will win."    This report has not been confirmed or denied by the PNP. It  shows, nonetheless, the way Guzman is using the government  officials who have been trying to end the violence that has been  reigning in the country for the last 13 years.</p>

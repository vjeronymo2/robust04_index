			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / EC threatens sanctions on Yugoslavia EUROPEAN Community med-iators, on the eve of a hazardous mission to Sarajevo, warned last night that sanctions might have to be imposed to try to stop the fighting in newly independent Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fresh warning - directed at Serbia and the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav federal army - came from Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary, and Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister of Portugal, which currently holds the EC presidency. Both vowed, in TV interviews, to go ahead with a trip to the Bosnian capital today, even though rival ethnic groups have stepped up street fighting. They hope to meet leaders of the feuding Serb, Moslem and Croatian communities at Sarajevo airport, considered one of safest locations in the city. They plan to fly on to Belgrade for talks with the Serbian government and then to Zagreb, the Croatian capital. Lord Carrington said it appeared Serbia was trying to carve out a Serbian enclave in Bosnia. If negotiations failed to halt the strife, 'I think that you have to go down the road of some sort of sanctions whatever they may be,' he said. The Portuguese minister said the EC must take a tough line. Economic and other sanctions must be applied if necessary. Street-by-street fighting in Sarajevo yesterday was concentrated in the Ilidza district, where Moslems launched an offensive against Serbs who had taken control. Some reports said more than 20 people were killed in the city yesterday and at least two elsewhere in Bosnia. A hotel in Ilidza housing 60 EC ceasefire monitors was riddled with bullet holes. Mr Colm Doyle, an EC official, said: 'This is mindless violence. Using a hotel with the EC and journalists in it and a hospital with patients as targets is not encouraging.' Witnesses said the Moslem-dominated old town was still under bombardment by Serb forces, but in some districts a few people ventured out after more than a day in shelters. Most workers remained at home and schools were closed. There were conflicting accounts of which side was prevailing in the fighting. One witness said: 'By using street battles, Moslem forces appeared to gain the upper hand on Serbs, who rely on heavy artillery on the hillside above Sarajevo.' Another witness said: 'It is chaos. It is not clear who is controlling the situation.' The federal army appeared to be staying out of the fray in the city of 525,000 inhabitants, 49 per cent of whom are Moslems. Bosnia's Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of the 4.35m population, oppose the republic's independence from Yugoslavia, while Moslems and Croats, making up nearly two thirds of the population, support independence.</p>

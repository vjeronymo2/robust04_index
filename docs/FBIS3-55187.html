Speaking at a meeting with the deputies of the State Duma  from autonomous entities in Moscow on Wednesday, Shakhray said  that "there have been attempts by large election blocs to  predetermine the fate of the State Duma behind the back of the  majority of deputies." He stressed that the Party of Russian  Unity and Accord is ready for forming a broad coalition in the  Duma "at least on the basis of a common approach towards the  principle of election of the duma chairman." This would ensure  the equality of all deputies. Additionally, all Duma leaders  should be elected individually by secret ballot, Shakhray said.    He pointed out that a faction in the State Duma can include  not less than 14 people which equals the number of seats each  bloc has in the house if it has cleared the five per cent  threshold. Shakhray added that a "faction begins to exist only  after it has been registered by the Duma secretariat."</p>

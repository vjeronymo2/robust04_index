During the session, a few  reports were heard and five draft decrees presented by the  minister of interior and national security. [passage omitted]  The government postponed the examination of the drafts until the  next meeting when additional information will be provided.    Before rounding up the session, the government made the  following clarification: For some time now, groups of  demonstrators have decided to systematically sequester cabinet  members and senior state officials and have been making  (?threatening) statements. The government is aware of the  miserable conditions in which the Central African people are  living. It is a well-known fact that this situation was  inherited from the defunct regime.    As everyone knows, the new government is consistently trying  to gradually put an end to the pains inflicted by that regime  and then to put the country back onto the path to development  and social welfare. For this reason, the government maintains  that it will not yield to any blackmail or any kind of threat.  There are legal procedures that each citizen must follow to  exercise his right to make demands, instead of resorting to  anarchy.    The government once again pledges its openness to dialogue.  It however reminds those who prefer violence and blackmail that  Ordinance No. 81/027 of 22 May 1981, which punishes acts of  violence and vandalism perpetrated by groups, is still in force.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

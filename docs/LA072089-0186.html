			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOO GOOD?;  </P> <P> HARVEY BLAMES HEALTHY ARM FOR WILD TIMES THIS SEASON  </P> <P> The smoke seldom clears when Bryan Harvey pitches anymore. That's because Angel  Manager Doug Rader keeps lighting up, cigarette after nervous cigarette, while  Harvey goes through his new routine of working counts full and then the bases  full.  </P> <P> Fourteen walks in his past 10 appearances. Four of them in his most recent  outing -- an excruciating eight-batter stint last Saturday that only set the  scene for Mike Devereaux's incredible foul pole-bending home run. If Harvey  were a starting pitcher, he'd be averaging nearly nine walks per complete game.  </P> <P> A year ago, he was the American League's rookie of the year runner-up. This  year, he's only bidding to become the next Don Stanhouse, the former Baltimore  Oriole and Dodger wild man who used to go by the apt nickname, Full Pack.  </P> <P> So, Bryan Harvey, ace of the Angel bullpen, what gives?  </P> <P> "It's my arm," Harvey says. "It feels too good."  </P> <P> Come again?  </P> <P> Come along, Harvey says, as he prepares to take you on a brief travelogue of  his five-year professional pitching career.  </P> <P> In 1985, Harvey broke in with Class-A Quad City and struck out 111, walking a  mere 37, in 81 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> "My arm hurt," Harvey said.  </P> <P> In 1986, Harvey saved 15 games for Class-A Palm Springs, walking 38 in 57  innings.  </P> <P> "My arm hurt again," Harvey said.  </P> <P> In 1987, he saved 20 games for Double-A Midland, striking out 78 and walking 28  in 53 innings.  </P> <P> "I started the season on the DL," Harvey said.  </P> <P> And in 1988, Harvey led the Angels in saves with 17 while walking just 20 in 76  innings.  </P> <P> "I ended the season on the DL," he said.  </P> <P> Harvey was placed there last September for the purpose of having bone chips  removed from his pitching elbow. Surgery and rehabilitation complete, Harvey  returned to the Angels this spring pain-free -- and, often in recent weeks,  control-free.  </P> <P> "Now that I ain't hurtin'," Harvey complains, "I can't find home plate."  </P> <P> According to Harvey, his arm feels so good, so strong, that he can't help but  overthrow. The arm now knows no boundaries, including that of the strike zone.  </P> <P> "It kinda does feel like a new arm," he says. "Now, when I rare back and cut  loose, I know there's nothing back there. I can go wide-open now.  </P> <P> "Maybe last year, that's why I stayed under control a little more."  </P> <P> Aside from some frayed nerves and some jammed ashtrays, the Angel coaching  staff doesn't appear overly concerned with Harvey's recent walk on the wild  side.  </P> <P> Just the opposite, it's become kind of a running gag among them.  </P> <P> The other day in the visiting coaches dressing room in Toronto, bullpen coach  Joe Coleman trotted out the routine for a reporter.  </P> <P> 'If he keeps struggling," Coleman said, "we're going to have Dr. (Lewis) Yocum  put the bone chips back in."  </P> <P> "Yeah," Rader interrupted. "Bone-chip reversal."  </P> <P> And from the back of the room, pitching coach Marcel Lachemann chimed in with,  "It's the first time that surgery's ever been done. We're waiting for a  transplant. I've got a bone spur he can have if he wants it."  </P> <P> Harvey plays along, too, kidding about the pair of one-inning stints he  completed last week without walking a batter.  </P> <P> "Two innings without a walk," Harvey said in mock amazement. "A record."  </P> <P> Of course, the Angels remain tied for first in the AL West, so there is no real  urgency surrounding Harvey's wanderings yet. As Coleman points out, "He's still  saved 12 out of 16 opportunities. That's still one of the best marks in the  league."  </P> <P> And from Rader: "He's had a few awkward outings, but they're going to come.  Look at (Cleveland's) Doug Jones. What did he give up the other night -- four  runs in the ninth? Everybody does it.  </P> <P> "He's not going to succeed every time he goes out there. I imagine there are  some, oh, modifications he'll need to make in his delivery, because his arm  feels different.  </P> <P> "But we just have to keep plugging him in there. Everybody goes through bad  times. You just have to persevere and stay the course."  </P> <P> And hope Harvey's new souped-up fastball does the same.  </P> <P> "The thing of it is," Harvey says, "I haven't really been hit around lately. It  could be a lot worse than it's been. I'm just walking guys.  </P> <P> "I haven't been this strong in a while and I haven't been able to find a good  groove. But I'm gonna find it. I thought it was (getting) close till  Baltimore."  </P> <P> One less walk by Harvey in Baltimore and maybe Devereaux never gets a chance to  bat in the ninth ... and maybe umpire Jim Joyce never has to make a can't-win  judgment call ... and maybe Rader never has to say all those inflammatory  things about Frank Robinson's relationship with certain AL umpires.  </P> <P> "I got the fire goin', didn't I?" Harvey said.  </P> <P> For Rader's sake, Harvey realizes he soon has to start putting fires out. This  trip down Tobacco Road must end some time.  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Western Mining dives into the red WESTERN MINING Corpora-tion, the Melbourne-based nickel, gold and aluminium group, dived into the red in the first half to December following a ADollars 20m (USDollars 14.9m) write-down of its mining assets. The company yesterday reported an interim turnround to a ADollars 60.5m net loss from a ADollars 141.9m net profit on a 15 per cent slide in revenue to ADollars 799.4m from ADollars 956.5m. The interim dividend has been cut to 6 cents a share from 13 cents. In line with revised accounting standards, Western Mining directors have reviewed the value of all non-current assets. They represent the second leading Australian board to do so in as many weeks, following the ADollars 558m write-down by CSR, the sugar and building products group. 'Directors have adopted a conservative attitude in reducing the value of mining properties, primarily gold operations, by ADollars 180m pre-tax,' the board said. 'In addition, directors have decided to add ADollars 20m pre-tax to the existing provision for environmental rehabilitation.' Even excluding the write-downs, which were treated as abnormal items, Western Mining's earnings were well down in the half. Operating earnings fell 34.3 per cent to ADollars 114.3m from ADollars 173.9m before a tax credit of ADollars 24.7m compared with a ADollars 29.6m payment previously. The fall was even bigger on an equity-accounted basis, with the group's associates contributing a ADollars 18.4m deficit against a ADollars 81.5m premium. This produced a 57.4 per cent fall to ADollars 95.2m in equity accounted net earnings from ADollars 223.4m. The equity decline largely reflected a fall in contribution from the company's 48.08 per cent-owned aluminium offshoot, Alcoa of Australia, to ADollars 77.8m from ADollars 177.7m. Gold was Western Mining's biggest profit earner in the half, with a ADollars 40.8m contribution, followed by ADollars 31.2m from oil and gas and ADollars 19.5m from nickel. Canadian operations lost ADollars 8.7m. Directors said that although gold production fell 14.4 per cent in the half, tonnage treated rose by 11.3 per cent, while unit costs rose 5.9 per cent. Nickel prices fell by 17 per cent while exploration expenditure was cut from ADollars 81.4m to ADollars 45.4m. Depreciation charges rose to ADollars 135.6m from ADollars 115.8m. TNT, the diversified Australian transport group, has executed its previously-announced flotation of stock in its US arm, TNT Freightways Corporation, with a public offering on Nasdaq, the over-the-counter market. The company is offering 12.5m shares in TNT Freightways at USDollars 19.50 each. Directors said the issue, with dividends payable, would raise about ADollars 400m and TNT would retain a 20 per cent to 25 per cent interest in the offshoot on completion.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Italian bank to expand in France ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian bank which floated some of its shares earlier this year, has confirmed its interest in expanding in France, possibly by acquiring Centrale de Banque, the lossmaking retail banking chain owned by Societe Generale. The French bank has said that San Paolo was 'interested' in buying the unit. However, a spokesman for San Paolo denied reports that negotiations on a purchase were already taking place. San Paolo, which raised L1,525bn (Dollars 1.4bn) by listing 20 per cent of its shares last March, has a 50-branch network in France through its Sanpaolo Banque subsidiary. Most of its branches have come through the acquisition in recent years of Banque Vernes and Banque Francaise Commerciale, two small retail banking operations. However, the company has indicated that it sees 100 branches as representing the minimum size for an acceptable retail banking presence in the French market. Centrale de Banque has 730 employees and 50 branches, and it is thought their locations would fit well with Banque Sanpaolo's network.</p>

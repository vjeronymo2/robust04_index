			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 3 Apr (INA) -- Taha Yasin Ramadan, Ba'th  Party National Command member and deputy prime minister, has  stated that the new order championed by the United States will  inevitably fail because it is based on hegemony, exploitation,  and aggression.    In a speech at the opening of the cultural season organized  by the secretariat of Arab students in Baghdad, Ramadan said  that the dissension among the UN Security Council members on the  question of the embargo imposed on Iraq is a positive element in  Iraq's interest. He said this positive stand can be viewed as a  victory for the Iraqis who have scored it thanks to their  steadfastness, struggle, abidance by their principles and  rights, and their rallying around Saddam Husayn, the leader of  the brilliant march.    Ramadan urged the oppressed people to resist injustice and  hegemonistic policies. He said the Iraqis alone shattered the  myth of U.S. monopoly of the world and showed how false is the  belief that there is a united stand against Iraq which the  United States had created through its deceptive and misleading  policies and its colonialistic blackmail methods.    Ramadan said that by distancing themselves from the United  States and Britain, some UN Security Council members have  exposed the falsehood of the U.S. claims and how they are  violating international laws and conventions to achieve their  designs and interests at the expense of other people and  countries.</p>

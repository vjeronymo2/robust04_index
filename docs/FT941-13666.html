			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: German chemicals giants target China More than five years after Chinese politicians first talked seriously about opening up their economy, German chemicals companies are at last starting to invest serious money in the People's Republic. Late last year, for example, Bayer signed an umbrella deal, committing a preliminary Dollars 200m (Pounds 135.1m) to half a dozen joint manufacturing ventures and licensing deals to make products ranging from fly sprays and Agfa film to engineering plastics. It capped the agreement with the establishment of a holding company in Beijing to take care of central administration and steer negotiations with future joint venture partners. BASF, making a similar push, is pressing on with further investments in dyestuffs to feed the booming Chinese textiles industry. A joint venture deal with its 49 per cent partner, Shanghai Dyestuffs, will start production next year. The company is also ready to invest in new capacity to produce monostyrene and polystyrene, suitable for numerous applications in consumer and industrial markets. The company will sign the joint venture contract early in February. Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, is reluctant to discuss the scale of his spending plans, divulging only that the investment would be more than DM100m (Pounds 39m). However, he made the tendency plain late last year when he said that his new medium-term investment programme for the company's chemicals business (excluding gas) allocated 35 per cent of the total to German operations, compared with 45 per cent in the five years to the end of 1993. Both Bayer and BASF, which already have annual sales of around DM500m each in China, have concluded that political and business conditions make early investment essential. 'Exports from Europe are not economic if you consider them on a full-cost basis,' says Mr Strube. Far Eastern chemicals suppliers, such as those in Hong Kong and Singapore, which increased their annual exports into world markets by an average 22 per cent and 17 per cent respectively during the 1980s, are far more conveniently placed. But China also wants inward investment both to supply its home market and earn foreign exchange. With the likes of Du Pont and Shell busily examining prospective joint-venture partners, the Germans cannot afford to be left behind. Political uncertainty remains a concern, and continued economic growth at recent rates cannot be assured. But on the basis of market considerations, the time is right to move, says Mr Strube. 'China has the capacity to absorb a huge amount of chemicals. Plant for many of our products requires minimum capacities to be competitive, and it is only in the past two years that demand has reached a scale which makes investment economic,' he adds. Although he refuses to discuss planned polystyrene capacity, he notes that China's current requirements are mostly imported and that there are almost limitless possibilities for applications in packaging and industrial and consumer products in a developing industrial nation. However, Mr Strube acknowledges that there are still hurdles to be overcome, including some set up by western industry in the past. 'China in the past was always a market where people exported their excess capacity. The competition was very stiff and the Chinese have always been very good entrepreneurs,' he says. 'The trouble is they are used to buying chemicals at low prices and they find it very hard to give that up.'</p>

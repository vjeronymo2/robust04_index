			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tax - the dog that failed to bark / Richard Evans finds Tory candidates surprised by voters' apathy over the new property assessment 'PEOPLE are so fed up with recent changes in local taxation that they don't seem to care what happens any more . . . the boredom factor has really set in.' This cynical comment from a senior local government official sums up a widespread view. Predictions of a renewed political storm over the introduction of the council tax have not been borne out during the campaign. Leaders of the three main political parties in Cambridgeshire, for example, have found it is way down the list of priority issues encountered on the doorsteps of Peterborough, Cambridge and surrounding villages. 'Considering it is the first year of the new tax, and given the history that preceded it, it is remarkable how little it has been featuring,' says Mr John Horrell, Conservative majority leader on the county council. Cambridgeshire has a relatively modest council tax precept of Pounds 390, and about 65 per cent of householders are set to gain from the tax compared with the community charge. Cambridgeshire has what seems a comfortable Tory majority, but it was run jointly by Labour and the Liberal Democrats between 1985-89, and would be lost by the Tories on a 6 per cent swing. Voters are certainly not ecstatic about the new property-based tax, but they regard it as a substantial improvement on the poll tax, the introduction of which led to rioting in Trafalgar Square. Local Tories, although relieved that the new tax has generated very little overt hostility, are worried about the impact of the tax on one important category of voter - traditionally Conservative single pensioners, whose fixed incomes are not related to the value of their homes. Mr Peter Lee, the Liberal Democrat group leader, has picked up this concern while canvassing, despite the low interest shown generally in the tax. 'The one group that is angry and upset is the single pensioner, as they only get a reduction of 25 per cent on the full tax. In almost every case they will be worse off compared with the poll tax, and it is definitely an issue that is turning some of them against the Tories.' He has also found a smaller, less cohesive group of relatively poor people who now have to pay the full council tax compared with only 20 per cent of the poll tax. 'The exemptions under the council tax do not seem to be as generous and flexible.' Mr Lee's overall impression is one of confusion over the new tax, particularly the transitional arrangements to cushion its introduction, together with a weariness over the whole subject of local finance. 'It is not a big issue, partly because many people are better off under it, and partly because people often can't remember exactly what they paid under the old rates or the poll tax.' Mrs Janet Jones, the Labour group leader, agrees. 'My impression is that it's having very little effect, and many people are still more concerned about the poll tax. I don't think many people really understand what is going on.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H3>  International Agreement and New Standards for Software and  Genetics Targeted </H3>   On 21 June, the Patent Office announced the revised  examination standard for patents which, for the first time,  includes guidance on evaluating the novelty of an invention. The  objective is to seek international agreement in the application  of the patent system. New standards were also set forth  concerning ideas on protecting computer software and genetic  engineering. The importance of the ``embodiment'' in the  interpretation of the claims (scope of the patent) which has  been strongly criticized by the United States and European  countries, will be revised; patents will be flexibly judged with  claims given priority and broad rights will be recognized. This  standard will apply to applications dating from 1988.    In the guidelines for guaranteeing the fairness and  reliability of the examination, the patent examination procedure  consists of industry-specific standards and a general standard  common to all technical fields.    The first standard was developed 30 years ago. The  initiation  in recent years of trilateral meetings involving Japan, the  United States, and Europe had the objective of agreeing on a  system, its operation and revision, and accumulating precedents  involving patents. This time, this situation is taken into  consideration and a full-scale revision was made.    The novelty of an invention is decided based on the standard  of whether a skilled person having ordinary knowledge of a  technical field would easily think of the invention. While in  the new standard, the examiner does not reject novelty when the  idea of ``easily comes to mind'' based on documents in similar  technical fields cannot be demonstrated.    As for computer software, the conditions of using natural  laws in information processing based on software and the  inseparable link with the hardware were clarified.    Accordingly, program trading of stocks and game software  that  simply substitute the brain activity of humans in a computer are  not the objects of patents. In addition, an invention of the  recording medium that stores a program is not applicable to  patents.    In contrast, in genetic engineering, the standard prepared  concerning the novelty of inventions related to DNA  (deoxyribonucleic acid) that contains specific base sequence  that form protein are:    (1) When the protein is original and advanced, it is novel.    (2) When a protein is known, but the sequence of amino acids  is not common knowledge, the sequence of amino acids that forms  the protein is not novel if a skilled worker, a person  possessing ordinary knowledge of the same technical field, can  easily determine the sequence.    (3) When the amino acid sequence is common knowledge, if the  effect is exceptional for DNA that forms a protein compared to  DNA that has another base sequence, the novelty is recognized.    Concerning the interpretation of claims, since it is nearly  impossible for the applicant to prove the realization of the  invention in the section for the detailed explanation of the  invention in the specifications by describing every important  embodiment, the judgment is not based only on the embodiments,  the invention is understood centered on the claims. As a result,  even if the embodiment is not described in the section for the  detailed explanation of the invention, the completion of the  invention by the applicant is recognized from the description of  the claims, and rights are granted.    In addition to announcing the revised examination standard  in  a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) report, it  has been published by the Invention Society.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF AMERICAN-MADE VEHICLES PLUNGE 20.4%;  </P> <P> AUTOS: LIGHT TRUCK SALES, WHICH ARE SENSITIVE TO HIGHER GAS PRICES, PLUMMET  28.5% IN LATE NOVEMBER.  </P> <P> Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks plummeted 20.4% in late  November, reflecting a continued slump in the auto industry and sagging  consumer confidence, auto makers and analysts said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Particularly hard hit were sales of light trucks, which dropped 28.5% in the  Nov. 21-30 period compared to the same time last year. Trucks, including  pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, aren't as fuel efficient as cars  and are more vulnerable to rising oil and gasoline prices.  </P> <P> Car sales during the period dropped 15.2%.  </P> <P> The 10 major U.S. auto makers reported selling an average of 29,510 cars and  trucks a day during the period this year, compared to a daily rate of 37,062  during the same time last year.  </P> <P> "It's at a 5.3-million annual rate, which is the weakest 10-day period that I  can find since October, 1982," said auto analyst David Healy of the investment  banker Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York. "It's the first weak period since  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, so it looks as though the big drop in consumer  confidence and the looming recession are finally having an effect.  </P> <P> "Until now, sales were holding up pretty well," Healy said. "My guess is they  won't stay that low, but it is kind of a warning shot."  </P> <P> For the month of November, with imports from major overseas auto makers  included, combined car and truck sales were 4.3% behind last year's pace. Car  sales fell 1.5% and truck sales were off 9.6%.  </P> <P> The Big Three auto makers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler  Corp. -- held 68.3% of the market for the month.  </P> <P> "Both the home builders and the automobile industry seem to be well into the  recession with the rest of the economy just starting," Healy said. "Our  (economic) guru thinks it's going to be a steep one, but it will be over by  midyear 1991."  </P> <P> The auto industry, preparing for a softening economy, has cut production  schedules for the rest of the year.  </P> <P> GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel said last week that he expects that the giant  auto maker's fourth-quarter earnings will decline significantly from the third  quarter, when the company earned $109 million excluding a $2.1-billion one-time  loss for closing plants.  </P> <P> Through the first 11 months of this year, total car and truck sales in the  United States stood at 13,151,749, down 4.9% from the same time last year.  </P> <P> The industry's slump began in the third quarter of last year and generally,  sales rates for 10-day periods have been lower than year-ago periods.  </P> <P> Ford suffered the most of the Big Three in this year's late-November reporting  period for North American-made cars and light trucks. Auto makers report sales  of imported vehicles only on a monthly basis.  </P> <P> Ford's combined sales of North American-made cars and trucks for late November  were down 30.1% compared to last year.  </P> <P> Company sales analyst Joel Pitcoff said part of the downturn stemmed from fewer  fleet orders from rental car companies, law enforcement agencies, taxi  companies and big corporations.  </P> <P> "But throughout the month, we saw a progressive decline in retail traffic,"  Pitcoff added.  </P> <P> "The accumulated bad economic news and uncertainty finally seems to be taking  its toll on the retail market," he said. "I think we can expect some fairly  grim numbers to look at for the industry in the near future. And to top it all  off, we never do well competing with Santa Claus."  </P> <P> Through November of this year, Ford's cars and trucks were selling at a pace  7.7% slower than last year.  </P> <P> GM said its combined car and truck sales for late November fell 22.5%. Through  the first 11 months of the year, sales of GM's North American-made cars and  light trucks were down 4.1%.  </P> <P> Chrysler, which has suffered the most in this year's sales downturn, said its  late-November car and truck sales were off 17.4%. Through November of this  year, the company's combined car and truck sales were down 13.6% from last  year.  </P> <P> Times researcher Amy Harmon in Detroit contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VEHICLE SALES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.11IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Nov.21-30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> year to year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GM*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 94,111  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -22.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 59,438  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -30.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chrysler*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41,545  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -17.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Honda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19,529  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +25.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Isuzu U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,694  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  **  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mazda U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,176  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +35.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,323  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -0.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nissan U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,582  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -43.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Subaru U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,443  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  **  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Toyota U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8,238  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -14.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 236,079  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -20.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Includes light truck sales.  </P> <P> **No comparison possible.  </P> <P> There were 8 selling days in the selling period this year and last year.  </P></p>

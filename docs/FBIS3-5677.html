The sales launch of the EPZ in Danang with  EPZ MASDA joint venture cooperation as developer, will be held  on the 22d of this month. EPZ MASDA chairman, Datuk Michael Chen  told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur that labor-intensive  companies, especially those in the garment and shoe  manufacturing businesses, should reconsider relocating to the  EPZ.    EPZ MASDA is a joint venture between Malaysian South-South  Corporation Limited and Quang Nam-Da Nang Export Processing Zone  Development Corporation. The EPZ is the brainchild of both the  prime ministers of Vietnam and Malaysia -- the result of Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir's visit to Hanoi in 1992.</p>

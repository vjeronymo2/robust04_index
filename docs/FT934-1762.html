			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Securicor beats Group 4 to escort job Securicor yesterday gained its first stake in the growing penal services market by winning the contract to provide court-escort services in the London area. The five-year contract to handle about 11,000 prisoner movements a month between prisons, police stations and courts is worth Pounds 96m. The first private court-escort service, taken over by Group 4 in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside region earlier this year, led to a series of escapes and other incidents in the first weeks of the new operation. As a result, the Prison Service has decided Securicor will take over the London service in five stages between next July and July 1995. Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service, said Securicor Custodial Services had won the contract 'against strong competition'. He said it was evident that privately run escort services reduced duplication, led to more efficient use of police and prison officers' time, and represented better value for money for the taxpayer. Transferring the services to the private sector enabled police and prison officers to concentrate their skills and energies on the work for which they were trained. Securicor will handle all prisoners except those in the highest security category. Group 4 was among the unsuccessful bidders for the London contract. The company remains a strong contender for the contract to manage the new Doncaster prison. Group 4 already runs Wolds remand prison on Humberside and winning the Doncaster contract would give the company a basis for building up a range of privately managed penal services in a single region.</p>

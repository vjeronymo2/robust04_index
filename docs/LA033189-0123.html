			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. J. DIAMOND: PROVING IRS CAUSED 'ERRORS' WON'T BE EASY  </P> <P> It was a well-played news story: Early this month, the Internal Revenue Service  admitted that its telephone assistance people were giving taxpayers wrong  answers to tax questions 30.8% of the time. But the agency held out the  assurance that if taxpayers were penalized for any resultant errors on their  returns, the penalties would be waived.  </P> <P> Seems a very decent, human approach. It even reiterates last year's admission  of errors and last year's promise to waive penalties.  </P> <P> But don't count on it. There are qualifications and amplifications: The errors  may not be errors, the penalties are unlikely, the number of waivers sought or  granted is unknown and the chance of actually getting a waiver is unsure. It's  like the old joke about the broken cup: I never saw your cup, I didn't take it,  I put it back, and anyway, it was already cracked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Test Calls Made  </P> <P> The first haggle is the number of errors, a matter of some importance when an  advisory service handles 38.8 million telephone calls and 7.4 million walk-in  inquiries a year. In recent years, as the IRS's 5,000 "assistors," many  part-time and seasonal workers, struggled with all the changes in the tax code  since the 1986 Tax Reform Act, error rates as polled in popular periodicals  went above 30%; a Money magazine survey last year drew 45 wrong answers to 100  inquiries, 41 this year.  </P> <P> The government's General Accounting Office has also, as requested by Congress,  been making test calls to tax assistors since 1978, asking them questions that  involve tax law -- typical taxpayer questions about IRA contributions, business  expenses, kiddie taxes. In the 1987 filing season, the GAO found a 21% error  rate; in 1988 a 36% error rate, and this year, a 35% error rate.  </P> <P> But this year, the testing was done in concert with the IRS (which will  eventually take it over), and the IRS, using the same 62 questions, found only  a 30.8% error rate. The reason: The IRS judged an answer correct if the final  advice was right. The GAO scored the whole process, including the "probing  questions" posed by assistors. "If they quickly gave the right answer, but  didn't ask the right questions," says Jennie Stathis, the GAO's director of tax  policy and administration, "it would be (counted) wrong. We try to put  ourselves in the position of the taxpayer."  </P> <P> A question about qualified dependents, for example, should elicit probing  questions about all five dependency requirements. One might assume the college  nephew supported by Nebraska residents is a U.S. citizen, but the assistor  should ask: If he's here from France on a student visa he's not a qualified  dependent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Managers Monitor Questions  </P> <P> The IRS response is that most such assumptions will fit the inquiry and  furthermore, the testing situation is skewed: "Testers don't give any  information unless it's probed for," says IRS spokesman Frank Keith in  Washington. "The taxpayer will keep asking, 'What about this, and what about  that?' "  </P> <P> The GAO's questions, moreover, all involve tax law, and such questions  generally constitute less than half the actual inquiries received. The majority  are either procedural (what forms to use, where to send a return) or  account-related (where is a refund, what does a notice really mean). Such  questions are monitored regularly by IRS regional managers, who listen in on  random assistance calls, taking notes and making judgments that might result in  discussions with the individual assistor, a general tip to all local assistors,  or required training sessions. They even judge question handling, i.e., the  probing questions as well as the final answers.  </P> <P> Given the emphasis and grading system, the GAO surveys, says Keith, are "not an  indictment of the taxpayer service." As for the penalty consideration, he adds,  one must ask "how much damage does a taxpayer suffer who gets the wrong  answer?"  </P> <P> The IRS doesn't know and can't figure out how many such errors lead to  penalties for the taxpayer, but it must be very few. "Under what fact scenario  could someone call, get a wrong answer and get a penalty?" asks Keith. Someone  might be encouraged to take an unpermissible deduction, but they'd get a  notice, says Keith, that "you can't deduct funeral expenses for your pet Shih  Tzu: pay up, plus interest." Penalties, says Rob Giannangeli, IRS spokesman for  the Los Angeles district, "are only assessed for failure to pay after you get a  specific bill."  </P> <P> There are penalties for making a "substantial understatement" of one's tax  liability, but it's not a common situation, or a common telephone inquiry,  since "substantial" means more than 10% of the correct liability, or $5,000,  whichever is greater. There are also penalties for failing to file any return  at all, but if the taxpayer is penalized for failing to file, says Keith, he  can explain that an assistor told him he wasn't required to file and request a  penalty "abatement."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Proof' Not Defined  </P> <P> Alas, no one knows how many requests for penalty waivers grow out of this  situation, or any other, for that matter. Such requests are made locally and at  any point in the process -- correspondence, audit, collection -- and may be  quietly granted at any point.  </P> <P> In fact, and IRS reassurances aside, it's no sure thing that such waivers would  be granted, given the number of people who would probably claim that "an  assistor made me do it." Indeed, the IRS has never defined how a taxpayer  proves that IRS assistance, verbal and undocumented, caused his error. One can  only, says Keith, note "the day called, the person's name, the question you  asked and any citation given. That information will be used by the person  who'll decide whether it's appropriate to abate the penalty."  </P> <P> One thing's for sure: The IRS's promise last year that it might also waive  interest on payments in such situations has not been repeated. "We don't regard  interest as punitive," says Keith. "It's a fee for the use of money."  </P> <P> No wonder the story gets such play, with its apologies for human failing and  assurances of good will balanced by hints that "Trust me" will turn to "Take  that." Trouble is, nobody knows what actually happens. At least the IRS  doesn't.  </P></p>

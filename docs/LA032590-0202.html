			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING: GENERAL CONTRACTORS USUALLY HIRE SPECIALISTS  </P> <P> In response to our January column, readers asked a number of interesting  questions, which we'll address this week.  </P> <P> QUESTION: If I hire a general contractor to build our room addition, will I  also need to hire an electrician and plumber?  </P> <P> ANSWER: A general contractor, under California license, can do the complete  job. However, they generally negotiate with licensed subcontractors for the  work you mentioned.  </P> <P> If you have a specific subcontractor that you would like to use, be sure to  discuss this with the general contractor before the job starts. Most generals  will accommodate you by using your subcontractor for the job or permit you to  contract directly with that particular sub.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that if you contract directly with your sub, the general  contractor will not want to direct nor be responsible for that subcontractor's  work, warranties, insurances or liabilities.  </P> <P> The general contractor is responsible for his own subcontractors' work and  therefore it is better to let the general contract with his own subs. He's  probably been doing work with them for some time and is aware of their  expertise and capabilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Written Contract Required by State  </P> <P> Q: Is a contract necessary for all remodeling jobs?  </P> <P> A: Contractors are required by California law to provide a written contract for  any work valued at $300 or more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contractors Provide Limited Warranties  </P> <P> Q: Should a contractor have a warranty for his work?  </P> <P> A: In the construction industry, most contractors provide limited warranties on  labor and material, with a pass-through warranty from the general contractor to  the homeowner for appliances, motors and manufactured items. However, this is  not required by law.  </P> <P> Many established remodelers have outside insurance companies provide a  five-year extended limited warranty such as provided by the Homeowners Warranty  Corp. (HOW). It is my opinion that all remodelers should provide at least a  minimum, written one-year limited warranty.  </P> <P> Be sure to remember, a limited warranty with the contractor is only as good as  the contractor's integrity, stability and financial circumstances. Limited  warranties from outside insurance companies eliminate these problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who Should Apply for Building Permits?  </P> <P> Q: When remodeling a home, who applies for the building permits?  </P> <P> A: Generally, the general contractor, or whoever is responsible for the  construction, applies for the permits. Many municipalities will not permit a  homeowner to take out some permits because of the technical aspects involving  safety, such as plumbing, gas and electrical jobs.  </P> <P> If the contractor takes care of the permits, the city has control over checking  for licensing, bonding and workman's compensation and liability insurance along  with recourses for corrections and/or non-code conditions.  </P> <P> If your contractor should ask you to pull the permits, either by advancing  money and/or signing the application, you would be well advised to take a long,  second look at the legality of his license and require certificates of  insurance for both workman's comp and liability to reassure yourself that all  is in order.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contractor Makes Calls for Inspectors  </P> <P> Q: Who calls for building inspections on the framing electrical, plumbing and  mechanical components of the job?  </P> <P> A: The contractor is responsible for scheduling all inspections and usually  meets all inspectors on the job site to answer questions and/or perform minor  corrections on the spot.  </P> <P> This eliminates the need for many reinspections and facilitates completion  time. It is not uncommon to ask the homeowner if he or she will be home for  some of the minor inspections.  </P> <P> Normally, for liability reasons, no inspector will enter your home without an  adult being present.  </P></p>

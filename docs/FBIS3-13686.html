Ayatollah Khomeyni was the first to oppose this day being  marked by the Zoroastrian sect, on the grounds that it is part  of idolatrous rituals that conflict with Islam. Although the  regime failed to prevent all citizens from marking the occasion  by igniting fires in public places and the yards of houses, it  maintained the ban without displaying great enthusiasm for its  implementation.    But this year Ayatollah Khamene'i, spiritual guide of the  Islamic Republic, issued orders to put security forces on alert  and deploy them in all major cities, especially Tehran, "to  eliminate from the streets any signs of the atheists'  celebrations."    According to the report, the clashes between security forces  and demonstrators, the majority of whom were young men, began  after midday the day before yesterday and continued until late  at night. Eleven people, among them one policeman, were killed  and 530 wounded, among them 180 security men. And 2,598 were  arrested, many of whom were released after interrogation.    Religious authorities imposed a media blackout on the  clashes, but sources close to security forces and the  Information Ministry described the clashes as "unprecedented and  organized."    Opposition sources in Iran have confirmed the occurrence of  the clashes. A report released by the Iranian National Party,  one of the oldest secular political organizations in the  country, said that "street battles broke out between citizens  and security forces in Tehran and the neighborhoods of Akbatan,  Ghisha, Aryashahr, and Shahrak Gharb..., and security forces  opened fire and used tear gas."

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure warns of losses Whitegate Leisure, USM-quoted bowling alley, discotheque and healthcare company, expects to report a 'moderate' loss for 1991 when it issues its figures in early March. In 1990 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.18m and at the interim there was a Pounds 54,000 profit. A number of board changes, including a new chairman and chief executive, were also announced. The shares closed down 3p at 9p, a new low. The company added that it intended writing down the French and healthcare divisions to their realisable values. Other plans include reducing the par value of the issued share capital and changing the year-end to August 31. Mr Michael Terpening will become managing director next month and Mr Alexander Cassels will take over from Mr Nicholas Oppenheim as chairman after the annual meeting. Mr James Naylor has resigned as chief executive. Mr RD Manser has joined the board and two non-executive directors, Mr T Cross Brown and Mr TLA Burgess have left the board.</p>

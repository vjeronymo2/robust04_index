The total Federal amount is $330,563 and is composed of $322,500 plus the Audit Fee amount of $8,063. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15%, $58,335 in non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $388,898. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. For those applicants who are not incumbent organizations or who are incumbents that have experienced closure due to a break in service, a 30-day start-up period will be added to their first budget period, making it a 13-month award. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour based on the gross receipts of the client's business. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

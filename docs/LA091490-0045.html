			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. AGREES TO REDUCE DUMP'S GAS EMISSIONS;  </P> <P> LOPEZ CANYON: MILLIONS WILL BE SPENT IN AN EFFORT TO BRING THE LANDFILL INTO  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AIR QUALITY LAWS BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles has agreed to spend millions of dollars on measures  demanded by regional air quality officials to reduce methane gas emissions from  the Lopez Canyon dump in the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it was announced  Thursday.  </P> <P> The city still faces civil fines for violating state air quality laws at the  landfill.  </P> <P> Elliott R. Sernel, an attorney for the South Coast Air Quality Management  District, said an agreement, hammered out over the past few days, is expected  to bring the landfill into compliance with state laws governing methane gas  emissions by the end of this year.  </P> <P> "Substantial conditions are being imposed on the city" that will solve both the  gas emissions and odor problems at the dump, Sernel told members of the AQMD  hearing board, which has been holding hearings on the dump's gas emissions.  </P> <P> On Sept. 7, the district's enforcement staff cited the city for violating air  pollution laws 28 times from April through July, exposing the city to fines of  up to $25,000 a day, a total of $700,000.  </P> <P> The exact amount of the fine is still being negotiated and will be included in  a separate civil agreement to be presented to the City Council on Tuesday,  Sernel said.  </P> <P> However, he said, the amount of the fine is not expected to be high, because  the agreement announced Thursday already commits the city to spend "several  million dollars" to install new gas collection wells and flares and to seal  cracks in the landfill.  </P> <P> Sernel and Assistant City Atty. Christopher M. Westhoff, representing the city  Bureau of Sanitation, asked the five-member hearing board to approve the  agreement today after hearing public comment on the document.  </P> <P> Both attorneys asked the board to discontinue hearings it is conducting into  noxious gas emissions and other problems at the landfill -- a proposal that met  with immediate opposition from hearing board members, elected officials and the  public.  </P> <P> "I'm skeptical that what we're going to see is going to be an acceptable  document," said board member Mark Abramowitz, adding that he is opposed to  ending the hearings.  </P> <P> "I don't want this document to stop these proceedings before the full story is  told," said Kagel Canyon resident Rob Zapple, who has led the fight by  neighborhood activists to close the dump. The AQMD enforcement staff has not  testified yet, he said.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who in April called for the hearing board  to close the landfill until it complied with state law, accused AQMD and city  attorneys of trying to rush an "insulting and outrageous" agreement through the  hearing board.  </P> <P> "What's the rush to go to the City Council on Tuesday?" he asked, accusing the  enforcement staff of "ignoring their own hearing board."  </P> <P> Both Katz and Zapple argued that the proposed agreement allows inadequate time  for public input.  </P> <P> "Why not wait a week?," Katz asked. "If the deal is in the public interest,  then it will stand up to public scrutiny."  </P> <P> "A lot of work has gone into this document," Westhoff said. "I think it does  address all the concerns brought out in these hearings."  </P> <P> Carol Coy, AQMD assistant director of enforcement, said the agreement calls for  "extensive and detailed surface monitoring" of the landfill and details what  steps the city must take to expand the gas collection system.  </P> <P> The district will maintain "a tight grip on enforcement" on a continuing basis,  she said.  </P> <P> At issue is the escape into the atmosphere of methane and other gases given off  by garbage rotting underground. By state and district law, the city is obliged  to control the emissions by channeling the gas into underground collection  pipes to the surface, where it is burned.  </P> <P> The city has already spent about $4 million on an emissions control system,  which the city has conceded is not working adequately.  </P> <P> Among other things, the agreement announced Thursday requires the city to  install a gas collection system in the initial disposal area of the landfill,  expand its existing flaring and gas filtration, install additional perimeter  probes on the landfill, conduct air monitoring in the community and maintain  gas monitoring equipment in good working condition.  </P> <P> It also sets dates by which the city must complete each condition of the  agreement and requires the city to install an additional gas collection system  if a proposed expansion of the dump is approved by the City Council.  </P></p>

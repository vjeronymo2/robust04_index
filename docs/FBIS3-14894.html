Pirozhenko, under the "Parties and Social  Movements" rubric; place and date not given: "Another Party"]    [Text] The Social Justice Party of Crimea (SJPC),  registered as No. 13 by the Ministry of Justice of Crimea on 7  February 1994, has been presented in the conference hall of the  Crimean Consumers Union.    [Korobov] The goal of our activity is to protect the  economic, political, and social interests of all citizens of  Crimea, regardless of nationality, religious beliefs, or social  affiliation. Here we are primarily concerned with the socially  unprotected segments of society and those engaged in the  production and processing of agricultural output, those who are  striving to saturate the consumer market of the republic with  essential commodities and foodstuffs.    [Pirozhenko] Vladimir Ilich, V.M. Negulyayev and G.N.  Prigornitskiy were selected as your deputies. In the Presidium  we have A.V. Oleynikov, N.M. Bramatkin, and other well-known  people who work in the system of the Crimean Consumers Union.  Does this not mean that the SJPC is an occupationally  affiliated party, that is, affiliated with workers in the  consumer cooperatives?    [Korobov] No, it does not. The party charter states quite  definitively that our party is established not according to an  occupational principle, but rather a territorial one. Any  individual can become a member who agrees with its program and  is prepared to support and implement it. Though it is true  indeed that consumer cooperative workers brought the party into  existence-- lower-echelon consumer cooperative workers.    [Pirozhenko] How large is the SJPC membership?    [Korobov] Right now we have over a thousand applications,  and they continue to come in. Primary party organizations have  been established in all the rayons. This demonstrates that our  new organization enjoys mass popular support and that its aims  and objectives conform to the interests of the workers. The  Social Justice Party of Crimea intends to become a party of the  parliamentary variety, joining the membership of the Supreme  Council. It will support the programs of other parties and join  with them in unified blocs if their social objectives are  similar.</p>

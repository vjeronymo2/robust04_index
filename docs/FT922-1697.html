			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Boring for England: Dominic Lawson knows why soccer fans turn to rioting . . . FOR THOSE comforted by the traditional and the familiar, events in Stockholm have been reassuring. Cold wars come and go, the world's climate may dissolve in a puff of ozone, but still we can be sure that the England soccer team will lose ignominiously and that English fans will riot. The riots are always followed by a marvellous outpouring of what-is-to-be-done-ism. The most amusing part is the attitude of those on the left, who normally advocate extreme leniency in custodial sentencing and the highest standards of police evidence of wrong-doing, but who, in the case of football hooliganism, propose salutary punishments and rough justice. The football hooligan is the most politically incorrect of individuals: he is, apparently, racist. Worse: he is in favour of macho-male dominance. It has become fashionable to deny any causal link between football games and violence. It is said that these are thuggish, clannish young men, who merely choose soccer games as the pretext for their anti-social activities. I find this puzzling, Why are these outbreaks of hooliganism never associated with Rugby League, or with the support of Essex County Cricket Club? I fear that football must be the cause, and the self-interested denials of this by the Football League should not be swallowed whole by the public and newspaper leader writers. The connection, however, is not an obvious one, and has eluded commentators until now. It is that association football is boring. And it is well known that boredom and crime are linked. Soccer is boring because it is impossible. Nobody, apart from the odd South American freak, can play it. It is just too difficult for the normally constructed human frame to control a ball with a foot. (I discovered this at an early age, and determined at school to play in no other position except goalkeeper). At amateur level this impossibility is evident even to the players. They shout, curse, foul, and occasionally cry as the ball ricochets, defying reason or control. But the same is true at professional and even international levels. There is none of the satisfying rhythm and discipline which characterise the ball-handling games such as cricket and rugby. Watching soccer on television is like watching a pinball game - interesting only if you have money at stake. This can be demonstrated most clearly by a video recording played at fast-forward. There is no pattern at all - except that one notices, with shock, that the ball is only in play for about half the game, so impossible is it to control. But the problem is that the soccer fans do not realise that they are supporters of an impossible game. They think it should make sense, that there should be glorious flowing movement from player to player, from end to end. The fans become increasingly frustrated and violent, as their idols are shown to have boots of clay, and as players described by the tabloid newspapers as geniuses and prodigies boot the ball into touch or simply fall over it. The fans then turn back to the tabloids to read - if they can - the explanation. There they are told that it is not players' fault; oh no, it is the manager's fault. Read yesterday's Sun back page: 'Sunsport Verdict: 'Turn it in, Taylor: GO NOW.'' Underneath this headline is a picture of Graham Taylor, the England football team manager, disguised as a turnip. Poor Taylor. He is not a turnip. He knows that football is impossible; so random that nothing can be predicted. But it is more than his job is worth to admit it. So the careful massaging of the vain hopes of the dejected football supporters will continue, leading to more disappointments and frustrations and further riots, as inarticulate youths give vent to their anger. I gather that Conor Cruise O'Brien, a great Irishman, last week proposed as a solution, that large areas are set aside in the major cities, in which the football fans can drink to their hearts' content. He advocated that these areas should be surrounded by riot police, who would be the only people to observe the football fans beating each other up. I think O'Brien is on to a good thing, but he misses the point. Without the unendurable frustration of having to watch football, the youths would become maudlin, but not aggressive. The riot police would pack away their gear. The only people to suffer would be newspaper leader writers. Dominic Lawson is editor of the The Spectator.</p>

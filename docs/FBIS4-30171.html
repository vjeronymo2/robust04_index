			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japanese Authorities Must Not Run Riot"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  authorities must ponder over the grave consequences to be  entailed by their moves against the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon). Otherwise, they will meet a severe  punishment. NODONG SINMUN serves this warning today.    The analyst says:    The Japanese minister of justice and general director of the  public security investigation agency revealed the intention of  the Japanese reactionaries to intensify the anti-Chongnyon  campaign when they cried on June 21 for a closer watch on  Chongnyon and investigation into its activities.    The Japanese authorities' anti-Chongnyon campaign which is  assuming ever more serious dimensions is part of their moves to  stifle the DPRK. It is a deliberate and premeditated political  suppression motivated by a sinister intention to threaten  Chongnyon, obstruct its patriotic activities and, further,  destroy it.    Chongnyon, a lawful organization of overseas Koreans of the  DPRK, has neither ignored and violated the Japanese law nor  interfered in the internal affairs of Japan. Nevertheless, the  Japanese authorities have committed a string of fascist outrages  unprecedented since the formation of Chongnyon. And they are  now crying for an open surveillance over Chongnyon and  investigation into its activities. This is clear proof that  their anti-Chongnyon moves have reached a very reckless stage.    What cannot be overlooked is that their indiscreet  anti-Chongnyon moves are timed to coincide with the scheme of  the imperialist reactionaries to stifle the DPRK under the  pretext of the "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK.    Our people and compatriots in Japan hold the sovereignty and  dignity of the country dearer than their lives and they will  never pardon those who encroach upon them. The Japanese  authorities must know that it is not favorable to them to join  the international reactionaries in their scheme to stifle the  DPRK and intensify the suppression of Chongnyon.</p>

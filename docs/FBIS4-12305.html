			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New U.S. Proposals, Do Not Accept Pressures"] </F>   [Text] In the past few days, it has become clear that the  United States is considering various proposals to realize the  goal of nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. These proposals  are being put forward to both Pakistan and India formally and  informally. Although the exact nature of the proposals has not  come up at the official level, it has been guessed from  newspaper reports that their foremost aim is to do away with  nuclear arms proliferation in South Asia. As Pakistan has made  it clear that the nuclear program in the subcontinent is linked  to the Kashmir issue, the United States has put forward some  proposals to resolve the Kashmir dispute. According to the  latest report, the United States has proposed to Pakistan that  the Kashmir dispute be put on hold for some time. Meanwhile, a  conference is to be held and attended by Pakistan, India, the  United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China to  discuss all the aspects of security in South Asia. The  conference will propose a strategy that guarantees and becomes a  source for stability for the South Asian subcontinent. The  United States will expect from any such conference some strategy  to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms in the region.    If Pakistan has refused to accept this proposal, there are  solid reasons behind it. First of all, it is not clear what the  intention of putting the Kashmir issue in cold storage is and  what the demands after the strategy is adopted would be. Will  it mean that Pakistan should stop raising its voice against  Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir? Likewise, will it mean  that Pakistan should not raise the Kashmir issue at  international fora? In other words, will it mean that Pakistan  should stop its moral, diplomatic, and political support to the  Kashmiris? It is obvious that this will be impossible and  unthinkable to Pakistan. The American proposal also does not  make it clear when the proposed conference will be held and the  outcome of the deliberations emerge, and whether that outcome  will be acceptable to Pakistan? Another strong objection to the  proposal is that its basic aim is not to resolve the Kashmir  issue, but to put forward a strategy that prevents the  proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles in South Asia. In  Pakistan's view, giving preference to this issue has the similar  connotation of dangling a carrot before the horse.    The Kashmir issue is the root cause for all the problems and  hardship in the South Asian subcontinent. As long as efforts  are not taken to resolve the issue in accordance with the UN  resolutions, no other problem can be resolved. If the Pakistan  Government adopts a stance that the above U.S. proposal is  impractical and unacceptable in the present context, it is fully  understandable. We hope that the Pakistan Government will not  bow to any kind of external pressure and will not take up as  worthy of consideration proposals such as putting the Kashmir  dispute on hold and initiating discussions on the Kashmir issue.  Despite all the political differences between the opposition  and the government, the entire nation and political circles are  unanimous and united on Kashmir and on Pakistan's nuclear  program. The government should never be cowed by any external  pressure and should remain as firm as a rock on its principled  stand. The entire nation is behind the government on this  question and it need not have any anxiety over it, but it should  make the country's policy clear to the external forces with more  vigor and clarity.</p>

Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman of Union Carbide, said the 1992 asset sales included the company's investment in Exel Limited, a casualty insurance company; and Carbide's interests in Kemet Electronics and in a Canadian financial trust. Mr Kennedy said that talks were still under way with prospective buyers of Carbide's Organo Silicon business, a division that makes fluids and chemicals used in fibreglass, reinforced plastics, textiles, coatings, automotive adhesives and other specialty markets. The Union Carbide chairman, in a year-end letter to employees, called 1992 one of the toughest in memory.</p>

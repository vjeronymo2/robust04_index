			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOME STATE HONORS CHRISTA MCAULIFFE WITH PLANETARIUM  </P> <P> The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium was dedicated Thursday as a memorial to the  teacher killed in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and to honor  her passion for motivating children to learn.  </P> <P> "This planetarium is more than a memorial to Christa McAuliffe . . . it is more  than a planetarium.  </P> <P> It is a promise to continue the work she believed in and a promise to fulfill  her dream," NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said.  </P> <P> About 1,500 people, including some of McAuliffe's former students and White  House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, attended the ceremony.  </P> <P> The $2.6-million planetarium is New Hampshire's official memorial to the  37-year-old Concord High School teacher, who died with six other crew members  when the space shuttle exploded in January, 1986.  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP and Statoil in deal to develop Caspian Sea field BRITISH PETROLEUM, the UK oil company, and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reached an exclusive agreement with Azerbaijan to negotiate to develop the Dostlug (Friendship) field in the Caspian Sea. The deal is BP's most significant agreement with a former Soviet republic - probably involving investment of at least Dollars 1.5bn - and only the second by Azerbaijan with a western company. BP-Statoil has exclusive rights to conduct a feasibility study of the 1bn-barrel Dostlug field (formerly known by its Russian name of Kaverochkin), 75 km (47 miles) south of Baku, the Azeri capital, as well as to explore the nearby Shak Deniz (formerly Shakhovo More) area, where experts believe significant amounts of oil may be found. The agreement was signed by Mr Isa Gambarov, chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP exploration. It was witnessed by Lady Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, who, as guest of the newly-elected Azeri president Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, had earlier swept into Baku at the head of a 30-car convoy. 'We have signed today a momentous deal,' Mr Browne said. 'It will bring prosperity to the people of Azerbaijan through investment, training, technology transfer and revenue. The alliance will conduct a two-year study of the field with local oil and gas producers Kaspmorneftegaz and Azerineft, while negotiating production-sharing agreements with the Azeri government. BP-Statoil paid Dollars 30m for exclusive rights to the field, and will make a further payment once final agreements have been ratified. Interests in the venture will be split 50:50 with Azerbaijan. The Dostug field is at present estimated at more than 1bn barrels, although experts believe eventual recoverable reserves may total more than 2bn barrels - ranking the field alongside the UK North Sea Forties field in size. Production could be more than 200,000 barrels a day, which would double present Azeri oil output. Mr Browne said he was 'very satisfied' with the results of an experimental Dollars 7.5m contract with the ShelfProyektstroi construction yard, 15 km (nine miles) south of Baku, to produce four piles which will used to secure platforms in the North Sea. He said BP hopes to construct as much as possible of the Dostlug infrastructure at the SPS yard. It will also employ native Azeris offshore and in local management, providing employment for about 700 people. Oil will be exported through an existing pipeline through Russia, there are also plans for a Dollars 750m pipeline through Georgia to a new oil terminal at Poti, on the Black Sea. The deal is a welcome boost for BP-Statoil, which was narrowly beaten last year by Amoco, the US oil company, in Azerbaijan's first international tender to develop the Caspian Sea Azeri field, although the alliance was awarded a 19 per cent interest in the field.</p>

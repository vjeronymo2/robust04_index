			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bilal al-Hasan: "The Nine Points Are Not the </F> Solution"]    [Text] If we examine the nine points conveyed by a  Palestinian delegation headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to  Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee, we would conclude  quite simply that even if Yasir 'Arafat fully accepted all nine  points, this would not resolve the PLO's crisis. The crisis  would continue and get worse.    The nine points call for the formation of committees,  leadership bodies, development councils, and planning and  consultation bodies. They contain no political substance, but  the problem is basically one of political substance.    It was the absence of an agreed political concept that  prompted the call for reform, the drafting of a memorandum  urging reform, and the dispatch of a delegation headed by  'Abd-al-Shafi to discuss the issue of reform.    For instance, the Taba negotiations are going through a  crisis at present. The negotiations are led on the Palestinian  side by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. If a committee was formed to  participate in the negotiations with him, would that make a  difference to the negotiation outcome and would it mean a  certain change for the better? Of course not, because the  presence of a committee with Sha'th would not make him more  eloquent in expressing the Palestinian position and would have  no effect on the nerves and morale of the Israeli negotiators.    It is a question of Palestinian "policy." Palestinian policy  is the point of contention. That is what should be discussed  with 'Arafat. After that and once agreement is reached on that,  it would be easy to form committees and we might discover that  there was no longer a need for such committees.    We have, over a period of some months, witnessed conflicting  Palestinian policies. There was the policy pursued for 11  rounds in the Washington bilateral negotiations and then there  was the policy which emerged in the Oslo secret talks and  torpedoed all foundations of the negotiations held in Washington  and the efforts to impose the idea of Palestinian sovereignty  there, and then there was the third policy pursued in the Taba  and Cairo negotiations raising the question of sovereignty again  through insistence on the issue of the crossings and their  control.    Now, with the unconditional -- as they say -- resumption of  the Taba negotiations we are seing a fourth aspect of  Palestinian policy. That could mean dropping the formal demands  on sovereignty and accepting just symbolic verbal or practical  hints.    These conflicting Palestinian policies denote a lack of  strategy, absence of vision, absence of constant principles, and  absence of red lines. They also reflect a Palestinian crisis.  It is a political crisis. A political dialogue is needed for  resolving that crisis but many people feel that it is now too  late for that because the decisionmakers had already made up  their minds and signed the Oslo agreement, and that it is now up  to them to pluck out their own thorns with their own hands.    The Palestinian crisis is no longer a crisis between  hardliners and moderates or between romantics and realists or  between accepters and rejecters and therefore it is not a matter  for committees or committee debates to solve. The crisis is now  between those who believe in a Palestinian pan-Arab position and  those advocating cooperation with Israel's genius or who dream  of Palestinian regional concept. It is now a battle between  continuation of the fedayeen factions hegemony over Palestinian  political action or new hegemony of the social forces over  political action. These matters are the crux of the crisis and  that is what should be discussed regardless of whether or not  the nine requested committees are formed.</p>

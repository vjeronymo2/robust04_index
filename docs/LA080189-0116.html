			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BRAWLER TAKES UP NOVELIST'S PEN  </P> <P> Charles Wheeler offered a good-natured apology but couldn't suppress a grin  when he heard a visitor had disabled a car trying to negotiate the steep,  rutted, rock-strewn cowpath up to his rustic mountain retreat.  </P> <P> He has gone to great lengths to put a rugged buffer between himself and the  world, and he clearly was pleased to learn it works. As satisfied as he is that  people are discovering his fiction, Wheeler hopes no one discovers him.  </P> <P> A disdain for celebrity would hardly surprise those who knew Wheeler before an  accident blinded him 14 years ago. Back then, he was a biker and a brawler; he  worked on building sites, not novels, and spent his leisure time in crowded  bars, not secluded retreats.  </P> <P> His first novel, "Snakewalk," has just been published by Harmony Books, a  division of Crown, and his agent is asking him to sign a deal to film his  semi-autobiography about coping with blindness. First novelists at this point  should be ecstatic. Wheeler would rather be left alone.  </P> <P> "Once you get out of all that man-made stress (of the city), you can focus on  what you are and why you're here," he explained after a day of work at his  retreat, which is at the moment a rough campsite with a trailer. "You have to  live in a place that's in tune with your own electrochemical reactions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing Affected About Him  </P> <P> If it sounds like loopy, affected authorspeak, forget it. There's nothing  discernibly loopy or affected about the tall, lean, 42-year-old author whose  presence -- not to mention his goatee and flinty expression -- hint at his  affection for motorcycles. "Moving here also took off a lot of the social  pressures on me," he added thoughtfully, referring to a long but vague list of  dust-ups with cops and others who ran afoul of his unyielding personal sense of  right and wrong.  </P> <P> He paused, pulled hard on a can of Miller High Life, then offered candidly,  "You won't find a lot of people who like me."  </P> <P> That is hard to believe after spending an evening with the author, his wife,  Jaimie, and their 17-month-old son, Kendal Gus, at their bucolic home site in  the Cascade Range near this quaint southern Oregon college town.  </P> <P> Then again, it is quite evident that Wheeler, like his protagonist Patrick Todd  in "Snakewalk," is not one to calmly suffer others' shortcomings. Especially  not people who subscribe to what he calls the "adipose guide" -- mindless  slaves to conformity, convention and greed.  </P> <P> What people will find, if Wheeler allows them to, is an engaging paradox: a  gentle family man and sensitive naturalist with an unrepented history of fast,  sometimes violent living and an insatiable appetite for adrenaline.  </P> <P> He is a man with a love of speed so intense that he recently bought a  long-coveted Porsche, even though his blindness keeps him from behind the  wheel.  </P> <P> "I still like fast things," he confessed. "I still like the risk factor in  life."  </P> <P> He is, also, a man with enough talent to give sighted people -- "eyeballs" he  calls them -- a vivid glimpse of life without sight.  </P> <P> Wheeler was blinded in 1975 when a friend's fishing boat capsized and  disintegrated in rough weather, seriously wounding the 28-year-old heavy  equipment operator and hell-raiser shortly before he was to leave for Alaska,  where he hoped to make enough money to go into business for himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fictional Version  </P> <P> "Snakewalk" is a fictional retelling of the accident and subsequent effort of  young, tough, lustful Patrick Todd to deal with sudden blindness -- and in turn  resolve his own identity and learn to try to balance intellect with impulse.  </P> <P> The story unfolds at the fictional California Institute for the Blind, in a San  Francisco Bay Area town not unlike Wheeler's blue-collar boyhood hometown, El  Cerrito, Calif. The snakewalk is a serpentine path where new "blinks," or  blind-school students, gather to drink and talk. As the most direct route from  the school to a busy street, Wheeler adds, the snakewalk also is the  metaphorical link between the worlds of those who cannot see and those who can.  </P> <P> Wheeler's protagonist adjusts slowly to the school, where he comes to learn to  read Braille, translate such routine tasks as banking into other senses and  develop the ability to navigate without eyes.  </P> <P> He also learns, from a hard-drinking part-Indian spiritual and intellectual  alter ego called Cole Saunders, to redirect his anger, intelligence and energy  to something other than fighting, fishing and female conquests.  </P> <P> At the same time, in the style of Ken Kesey, Wheeler's character shares his  personal courage, iconoclasm and unshakable zest for life with the more timid  students around him.  </P> <P> Wheeler said he began working on the novel "as a kind of therapy after the  accident," hoping to gain some personal insight into his disability while also  offering sighted people a different, more realistic perspective on blindness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revealed an Outlet  </P> <P> Therapy became avocation when Wheeler's early writing introduced him to his  latent talent. He realized fiction offered him a satisfying new outlet for the  passion and energy he previously spent on racing and carousing.  </P> <P> He said his confidence and ambition flowered when a Playboy magazine editor  attached an encouraging letter to a rejection slip for one of Wheeler's short  stories, the tale of an eccentric who collects unmentionable souvenirs in the  women's room of a Wyoming roadhouse.  </P> <P> At "blink school," as he calls the rehabilitation center, Wheeler said he  realized a blind man is better off working with his brain instead of his back,  and he enrolled as a philosophy student at Solano Community College in Suisun  City, Calif. Meanwhile, he expanded his written observations on blindness, the  heart of "Snakewalk," to novel length.  </P> <P> He continued working on the project after transferring to UC Davis, to which he  commuted twice a week by Greyhound bus from a riverfront home in tiny Anderson,  Calif., more than 100 miles away.  </P> <P> After starting at Davis, he changed his field of study to creative writing,  quitting philosophy and giving up his earlier goal of going to law school.  </P> <P> At Davis, Wheeler met two women who profoundly influenced his life.  </P> <P> One was a fellow student, Jaimie Bernhagen, an engaging Dana Point, Calif.,  native who became his fourth wife a year and a half ago.  </P> <P> The other was the instructor who taught his final graduate writing seminar,  writer Diane Johnson ("Terrorists and Novelists," "Persian Nights"), who  recognized in his master's project the kernel of what later became "Snakewalk."  </P> <P> Johnson introduced Wheeler and his manuscript to San Francisco literary agent  Bonnie Nadell. She forwarded the novel to Michael Pietsch, an editor at Harmony  Books in New York. Pietsch wrestled with Wheeler through numerous rewrites that  finally produced a tight, smooth narrative.  </P> <P> Wheeler lauded four people -- Bernhagen, Johnson, Nadell and Pietsch -- in an  introduction to his book, but he reserves particular praise for his wife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Praise  </P> <P> "Everybody's making a big deal out of me, but we are no better than who we are  with," he said. "I wouldn't be doing any of this if Jaimie wasn't here with  me."  </P> <P> As she gets up to tend their son, he leaned over and proudly confided: "We must  have lived together in another life. We are real comfortable together."  </P> <P> He said his wife helps him with his writing process, which involves working out  a story in his head and dictating early drafts into a tape recorder before  entering later drafts into a home computer equipped with a voice synthesizer.  </P> <P> Jaimie, who has literary interests of her own and hopes to return to school  soon to complete college, modestly shrugged off Wheeler's praise, as she later  dismissed the hardships of their crude encampment, a trailer with no utilities.  </P> <P> "Ever since we arrived there, we wanted to leave," she said, referring to their  former home, a ranch-style house overlooking the Sacramento River near  Anderson. "A pool to maintain, a lawn to mow, fences penning the dogs -- it  just was not our cup of tea. We are actually much happier in this 39-foot  fifth-wheel (camp trailer) than we were there."  </P> <P> "I miss some of the conveniences," Wheeler added, citing the present need to  bathe outdoors in icy spring water, "but if your sense of humor stays intact,  you can get through most anything."  </P> <P> One of his biggest problems so far is the impact he is having on the land. He  still broods over a rattlesnake accidentally crushed by the bulldozer the day  he arrived. And he laments a skunk killed by his dogs: Generally, he  appreciates his Oregon retreat and doesn't miss California even a little bit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'In a Dog Kennel'  </P> <P> "In California -- I won't say all of it, but just about all of it -- you are in  a dog kennel," he said. "You go for what you can get for yourself when you can  get it without worrying about the overall peace. If you can go for the throat  of the big boy next to you, then you grab him by the throat and rip out the  jugular. Automatically. Reflexively.  </P> <P> "That is what I write about. I write about a dissolving civilization -- the  decline of compassion of one human being for another."  </P> <P> Such startling observations are not unusual when talking to Wheeler.  </P> <P> "Usually," he opined at another point in the evening, "the cream of your  society is found in bars, soaking up alcohol and numbing themselves from their  own potential because that's easier than endeavoring to change things."  </P> <P> For the record, Wheeler, a former world-class drinker who still is familiar  with a beer 12-pack, avoids bars these days -- ever since irritating some  locals by toppling a local arm-wrestling champion.  </P> <P> As quickly as some topics can irritate him, others can just as swiftly calm  him. One is the pleasure of writing. Another is the enjoyment of hiking in the  woods with his four dogs.  </P> <P> "When my facial vision is working, I can walk anywhere with the dogs," he said,  referring to the use of nerve-packed facial tissue to sense obstacles in one's  path. "When it isn't working, I might as well be in a closet."  </P> <P> Not that that indicates any measure of surrender to a handicap. Not in someone  who responded to counselors who said it would take two years to master Braille  by learning it in two weeks.  </P> <P> "I'm like a salmon," he said. "Someone will dam a river, and salmon will wear  off their faces nosing around for some way to get past it."  </P> <P> Hardships are not new to Wheeler, the second-oldest of eight children of an El  Cerrito police officer. Wheeler said his father moved the family into a  converted chicken coop. The $3,500 price meant manageable monthly payments of  $15, but Wheeler said his dad still owed $1,700 on it when he died in 1961 in a  boating accident.  </P> <P> Books were scarce in his home. Wheeler read little before he lost his sight.  Since then, he has followed the advice of teachers and listened to many hours  of tape-recorded American masters, including Faulkner and Hemingway.  </P> <P> That Wheeler's father was a policeman will come as a surprise to people who  know the author. Not only has he had his share of often violent confrontations  with police officers -- most recently in Anderson, where a run-in cost him five  days in the county lock-up -- but the police also serve as antagonists in much  of his writing.  </P> <P> "There are good cops and bad cops, like anything else," Wheeler said with a  shrug, placing his father in the former category.  </P> <P> Indeed, Wheeler is eager to make sure that any film version of his book has  balance with all his characters, including the blind students.  </P> <P> "I spent a lot of time and a lot of pain on this," he said, "and I don't want  to see blind people slabbed out there, as being all one thing or another.  They're as individual as anyone else."  </P> <P> Despite the praise implicit in the remarkable process by which his work was  discovered and favorable pre-publication reviews, Wheeler believes he has only  begun the process of developing his talent.  </P> <P> "I am still in the minor leagues as a writer," he said, keeping an ear on his  son as he played near a bulldozer and backhoe resting on land destined for a  large log home supplied with water and power from a nearby spring. "I still  have so much to learn about my craft. I think of 'Bottoms' as my real debut as  a writer."  </P> <P> "Bottoms" is a second novel, still in progress, about the denizens of a Texas  junkyard. It is loosely based, he said, on the experiences of a family friend,  called Grandy in the book, who quit the aerospace business "to open up that  junkyard and make millions off the discards of America."  </P> <P> Wheeler smiles at the absurdity of that notion, and at the junkyard owner's  conviction that only compulsive womanizing will keep him alive forever. And he  relishes recalling how the real Grandy, whom Wheeler considers a second father  and after whom he named his younger son, valiantly resisted the big-money boys  who came to buy him out.  </P> <P> "He's a hard-headed old man," Wheeler said, "and about the only friend I have."  </P> <P> Relying so directly on his own life gives him no pause.  </P> <P> "Everything I write is going to be autobiographical," he said flatly.  </P> <P> For now, however, Wheeler is not writing at all. He has a publicity tour for  "Snakewalk" and prefers focusing his energy on improving his retreat, where the  only electricity comes from automobile batteries.  </P> <P> "I've got three other books -- four, possibly -- kicking around in my brain all  the time," he said. "When one gets ripe, I'll stop and write it. I will have  to."  </P></p>

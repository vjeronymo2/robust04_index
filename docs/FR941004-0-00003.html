			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;221&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments Received to the NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of a portion of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to exclude the Models DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 from the applicability until more information is gathered to substantiate that these airplanes are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. These commenters point out that cracks have been reported on Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 series airplanes only. One commenter states that the airframe manufacturer previously had requested that operators of Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes inspect their airplanes for cracking and, as a result, none was found on any models other than the Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series. Another commenter suggests that the spar cap and skin panel installed on Models DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 are thicker than those on Models DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15; therefore, the possibility of these items cracking on the Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 airplanes is very low.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with these commenters' request. Although fatigue cracking may not have been detected on in-service Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes, the airframe manufacturer has conducted load, fatigue, and damage-tolerance analyses, which indicate that fatigue-related cracking is likely to occur on all Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes as these airplanes accumulate flight cycles. The compliance thresholds specified in this AD, as well as the compliance times for the required initial and repetitive inspections, were developed in consideration of these analyses and with the participation of the airframe manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the rule be revised to give credit for visual inspections of the area that were performed previously, and to add a visual inspection as an option for accomplishment of the initial eddy current inspection. These commenters state that a damage tolerance assessment conducted by the airframe manufacturer has shown that an initial visual inspection will ensure that the structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer spar cap and skin is maintained. Additionally, by permitting a visual inspection to be performed, which takes less time and materials than an eddy current inspection, the economic impact of non-scheduled maintenance and removal of aircraft from service would be reduced for operators, as well as the corresponding inconvenience for the traveling public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs with these commenters' request. Subsequent to the issuance of the notice, the FAA reviewed and approved Revision 1 to McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletins 55&hyph;24 and 55&hyph;25, both dated August 3, 1994. These revised service bulletins contain revised instructions for accomplishing the eddy current inspection (to make it less complicated), and instructions for performing an optional visual inspection in lieu of the initial eddy current inspection to determine if cracks exist in the horizontal stabilizer forward cap and skin panel. The FAA has revised the final rule to permit operators to perform this optional visual inspection as the initial inspection only. All repetitive inspections must be performed using eddy current techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to eliminate the compliance time for the terminating modifications. These commenters consider that these modifications should be optional instead of mandatory. Other commenters indicate that fatigue-related cracks are cycle-dependent, not calendar time-dependent; therefore, it is inappropriate to impose a calendar time compliance time on a cycle-dependent phenomenon. The commenters also consider that the proposed compliance time of five years for installation of the terminating modifications could be unfair to operators of low-time airplanes, since, in some cases, an operator could be required to install the terminating modifications before the airplane has reached the threshold for the initial inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to allow the terminating action to be optional. The FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety will be better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem, rather than by repetitive inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on design improvements. The modifications required by this AD are in consonance with these considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does acknowledge, however, that the proposed compliance time for installation of the terminating modifications could present an unfair situation to operators of low-time airplanes. This was not the FAA's intent. Therefore, the FAA has revised paragraph (d) of the final rule to specify modification prior to the accumulation of a certain number of cycles (depending upon airplane model) or within 5 years, whichever occurs later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of the final rule to delete the previously proposed requirement to continue inspections after installation of a repair that has been approved by the Manager of the Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. The FAA has determined that deletion of this requirement is appropriate, since some repairs that have been approved have incorporated a terminating action, thereby eliminating the need for continuing repetitive inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accomplishment of the optional initial visual inspection will take approximately 1 workhour per airplane per inspection, at an average labor charge of $55 per workhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this optional inspection on U.S. operators who elect to accomplish it is estimated to be $55 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accomplishment of the eddy current inspections will take approximately 3 workhours per airplane per inspection, at an average labor charge of $55 per workhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $39,765, or $165 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accomplishment of the modification of the forward spar upper cap will take approximately 248 workhours per airplane. Likewise, the accomplishment of the modification of the forward upper skin panel will take approximately 248 workhours per airplane. The average labor rate is $55 per workhour. Required parts will cost approximately $10,600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification actions AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,129,080, or $37,880 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the required modifications require a large number of workhours to accomplish. However, the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph (d) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the modifications to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carries a two-minute video  report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's  destruction of its chemical weapons. Peslyak begins by recapping  Russia's international commitment to destroy its chemical  weapons and to discontinue their production. He reports on the  debate on this topic in the State Duma on 24 March. The main  problem was storage of the weapons until they could be  destroyed. The video shows the Duma being addressed by Major  General Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense  troops of the Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand  that we cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves.  Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most  dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have.  That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast."    Peslyak says that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a  billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The  video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov,  deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International  Affairs, identified by caption, who says: "The means of  eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be decided upon.  The sites where the destruction of the chemical weapons is to  take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see from the  hearing, the settling of these matters with local authorities  and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running into  considerable difficulties."    Peslyak points out that a factory in Chapayevsk equipped  with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it could be  used for destroying chemical weapons. Video shows the exterior  and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped in plastic  sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, he says;  it is difficult to know just how much toxic material there is to  be destroyed, saying there could be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000  tonnes."</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Nat Power and Transco to settle out of court National Power has reached a settlement with Transco Energy of Houston, the gas trading company, over a dispute arising from its Dollars 150m purchase last year of American National Power from that company. Litigation between the two companies has now been withdrawn. As part of the settlement, Transco has agreed to exercise its right of first refusal to buy back TrenFuels, a fuel services company and ANP subsidiary. National Power has received Dollars 12.5m for TrenFuels, which it says was not material to ANP's generation business. National Power's obligation to Transco to settle some balance sheet issues has been agreed at Dollars 8m. It has received the net sum of Dollars 4.5m from Transco, which it says will not affect its 1994/95 earnings.</p>

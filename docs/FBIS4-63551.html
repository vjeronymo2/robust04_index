			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich by Igor </F> Osinskiy; place and date not given: "Opposition's Demarche and  Premier's Position"]    [Text] He betrayed national interests, "surrendered" the  state's independence to another country, and should be punished  in accordance with Article 61 of the Criminal Code as a traitor  to the motherland. That was the judgment passed on Vyacheslav  Kebich in absentia by the participants in a recent press  conference given by leaders of the Belorussian [Belarusian]  People's Front. A letter has been sent to the parliament and  the general prosecutor demanding that judicial proceedings be  instituted against the head of government.    This hasty move, which is patently aimed at an excitable  audience, only causes a wry smile.    The opposition is jumpy....    It has been so convenient for many months now to accuse the  prime minister of deluding the people with the impracticable  idea of creating a unified ruble zone and gradually reverting to  a normal life worthy of man! Let us be frank. Kebich sometimes  left himself open. His frequent overly optimistic statements  that there was just one step to go to monetary union failed to  materialize with suspicious regularity, thus alienating  long-standing allies. In a desire to score as many propaganda  points as possible from this, Stanislav Shushkevich did not wait  for the official announcement of the election campaign but  rushed to tour cities and villages saying how bad the parliament  and government are. It is of course no secret to the retired  speaker that this does not square with universally recognized  norms. But the following has long since been well-known: Where  there's a will there's a way. Another month or two is all that  is needed!    But....    Readers saw that Premiers Chernomyrdin and Kebich ratified a  treaty in Moscow with their signatures, giving the two  countries' economies equal rights, removing customs barriers,  and fixing unified prices of energy sources. Without the  slightest chance of competing with Western output, Belorussian  goods are once again turning up on the immense Russian market  where there was always demand for them. Thus, enterprises that  had shut down are beginning to work again. And the timid "hare"  [the Belarusian currency] is giving way in people's wallets to  the full-blooded ruble.    One may argue about whether Vyacheslav Kebich was involved  in  the breakup of the USSR, which was formalized, to our shame, in  Viskuli, and how personally accountable he is for the agony of  the Belorussian economy. These questions will probably be given  exhaustive answers at some point. Today, there is no time for  moralizing. It is important to understand something else: What  direction should be taken now -- toward the East as the  government is insistently urging or toward the West, where the  opposition is painting alluring mirages?    [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, you are perhaps starting  the presidential race in the most disadvantageous position.  None of your rivals bears the burden of responsibility for the  current state of the economy. At least that is what they  themselves think. Even Stanislav Shushkevich is rushing to  disavow what he has done in parliament. But you cannot get away  from critical fire. Your rivals will pin "all manner of  charges" on you. So here is a roundabout question for you:  What is the reason for our collapse?    [Kebich] Gorbachev's perestroyka, beyond any shadow of a  doubt. Having begun this without a well-founded concept,  instead of replacing the rotten roof and ceilings and recasting  the internal layout of our all-union home, the leaders of the  CPSU set about shattering walls that had been built over  centuries.    Had Gorbachev agreed at Novo-Ogarevo to turn the country  into  a confederation, I have no doubt that even the Baltic countries  would have accepted this plan. However, the vain general  secretary was convinced that he knew the situation better than  anyone. The result was that, when the leaders of the three  republics met in the Belovezhskaya Forest, the edifice of the  USSR was already breaking up.    However, even at that critical moment it still could have  and  should have been saved. That was the aim of the document that  the prime ministers signed. It enshrined a common economic  area, a unified ruble zone, and transparency of borders. I am  not ashamed of my signature on this treaty.    But in practice it proved a totally meaningless appendix to  the document initialed by the heads of state. Political  ambition and a desire to escape from the "union center's  clutches" gained the upper hand. They gave rise to terrible  centrifugal forces and brought about political, economic,  social, and moral catastrophe.    [Osinskiy] Do you think that not everything was all that bad  with the USSR's economic system? Have I understood you right?    [Kebich] Absolutely. In an attempt to justify their  actions, "democrat" politicians are effectively committing  blatant forgery. Ask any of them: Where does salvation lie?  And you get the response: in the market. And everyone pictures  a huge Komarovskiy bazaar [allusion unknown] across the whole  country where total anarchy reigns. Gentlemen, no capitalist  countries have a market like that! It only exists in your  fevered imagination.    While I was chairman of the Republic's State Planning  Committee I made frequent visits to the United States. And you  know, the first person to whom I was introduced in each state  was the governor's first deputy for planning. State regulation  is an indispensable condition for a normal market.    [Osinskiy] During my work in the FRG I also encountered this  at every turn. Small German firms, for instance, curse the  government like nothing on earth for not being given quotas to  import cheap vodka and consumer goods from the CIS countries.  Agricultural regulation is even tougher. East German peasants  were forced to leave half their land fallow so as to prevent  overproduction of grain. Admittedly, the state's diktat is not  administrative but economic here.    [Kebich] That is the whole crux of the matter, the main  distinction from the preposterous capitalism that is being  cultivated in our country. Something similar happened in the  West during the "Great Depression." Leading capitalist  countries extricated themselves from economic crisis not despite  but with the help of reasonable planning and regulation. Take  for example the states of Southeast Asia which are a household  name today. Why did Japan, South Korea, and Singapore reach the  heights of economic prosperity so rapidly? Because everything  was laid down there, planned down to the finest detail.    For two years we too succeeded in preventing the wholesale  breakup of the economy thanks to the tremendous safety margin  built in during Soviet times. The republic had a very strong  and disciplined industry and highly developed agriculture.  Remember: In 1989 national income rose around 8 percent and we  did not drop below the figure of 6 percent even during the worst  years. Belorussia almost reached the U.S. level in terms of per  capita meat production and outstripped it by a factor of 2.5 in  terms of milk production. The government tried to restructure  the economic mechanism without putting it out of action as  happened in Russia and other USSR republics. Joe Public had the  impression (and the opposition did its utmost to foster it) that  reforms were being deliberately delayed. In fact, we prepared  them carefully, avoiding ill-conceived actions, and thanks to  this we have kept ourselves afloat for the time being.    [Osinskiy] The opposition claims that the main secret of the  relative stability of the time was the low price of energy  sources.    [Kebich] That is not true. They were higher then than in  Russia and the difference became even more tangible from month  to month, but we nonetheless held our ground and the Russian  economy collapsed. To be honest I am surprised at how we  succeeded in surviving! Since even Ukraine, with its wealth of  natural resources and favorable climate, ended up on its knees  right away.... No, it was this safety margin that saved us.  That has now disappeared. And people have become fully aware  of rampant savage market forces.    [Osinskiy] I think that the "democrats" would disagree  with you there. They think that the situation in Russia is  improving because Gaydar and his team jumped into the cold water  of the market without fear and doubt. Needless to say, they  swallowed a lot of water, but then they started swimming! We  are all standing on the bank testing the water.    [Kebich] They may have started swimming -- but to where?  Back to the bank that they left so easily. Chernomyrdin's  government is making increasingly vigorous use of plan levers  and is channeling state investment into those sectors on which  the future of the whole economy depends. If you want to know,  it is not Belorussia that needs to overtake Russia but Russia  that needs to restore what we have managed to preserve.    [Osinskiy] The opposition looks as though it is right about  some things: Have Kebich and his government deliberately held  up market reforms.    [Kebich] Yes. Just add the prefix "pseudo" to the word  "reforms" -- "pseudoreforms." I do not consider "reforms" that  are designed to destroy the economy and which advocate shock  therapy, and hence the mass impoverishment of the population, to  be genuine and I will never support them.    [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, a very complex election  marathon lies ahead. With what platform are you beginning it?    [Kebich] I will present my election program later. But I  can tell you now that it is based on the position of centrism as  a basis for popular accord. I think that the future president  should use ideas, plans based on their good sense regardless of  which party proposed them, and support ideas and plans that come  from "left" or "right." During the election campaign let us  seek a more acceptable economic model for our country without  slighting one another and without digging up the dirt. And may  victory go to the person whose arguments the voters consider the  most cogent.</p>

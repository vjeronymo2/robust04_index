			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Property pessimism deepens MOST commercial property lenders expect no improvement and even a decline in the market over the next year, according to a survey of 58 banks and other financial institutions. It showed that lenders have revised their forecasts as the expected recovery has failed to materialise. This month, only 48 per cent expected an improvement in the market over the next 12 months, down from 55 per cent in January and 70 per cent in July last year. The report by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Chartered Surveyor Weekly magazine suggests that the next six months may be critical for struggling property companies. Sixty-nine per cent of those polled expect the upward trend in receiverships to continue over the next six months. Average bad-debt provisions have risen from almost 3 per cent of the total property loan book in January to 7.5 per cent. Over the next six months, 69 per cent of lenders expect a further increase in bad-debt provisions. Confidence Barometer. Chesterton Financial, 54 Brook Street, London W1A 2BU. Free.</p>

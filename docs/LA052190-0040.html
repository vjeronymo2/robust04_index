			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: RAP LINEUP GOES ONE FOR THREE  </P> <P> The rap show on Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim started at the  pinnacle and wound up in the pits.  </P> <P> This long, delay-filled evening of steadily diminishing returns ended with  teen-age headliners Wrecks-N-Effect grinding to a wretchedly amateurish  embarrassment of a finish that was rewarded with scattered boos.  </P> <P> Another young New York rap crew, Redhead Kingpin &amp; the F.B.I., turned in an  energetic but lightweight middle set. But Def Jef, a more experienced rapper  based in Los Angeles, made it all worthwhile with a near-perfect opening set  that was fun, funky, and politically focused -- a textbook example of all  that's good in rap music (a homophobic comment from Jef also demonstrated  what's worst in rap).  </P> <P> For 35 deftly paced minutes, Def Jef (real name: Jeffrey Fortson), deejay Erick  Vaan and a trio of wonderful dancers called the Soul Brothers offered a  cornucopia of rhyme, rhythm and eye-popping motion. Throughout his segment, Def  Jef expertly interwove his key themes: rap as a call to party, rap as a  foundation for friendship, and rap as a vehicle for expressing black pride and  black protest. Carrying himself with unusual confidence and charm, Def Jef was  able to be both serious and entertaining. He and his crew made a  well-thought-out performance seem like casual, happy play.

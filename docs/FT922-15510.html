			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: Mythology of NHS Sir, Is it not possible finally to dispel the mythology of National Health Service deficit funding? From 1946, through Bevan as minister of health, the Labour government implemented the report on Social Insurance &amp; Allied Services by W H Beveridge, Cmnd 6404 1942. In paragraph 27, the post-war inflation rate was determined at plus 25 per cent on 1938 prices. The actual increase was made at 31 per cent (held at the cost of living above pre-war). The Beveridge increase was based on the 1914 Cost of Living Index, long outdated, and replaced in 1946. The subsequent Treasury review showed that, using the old 1914 index, 1946 prices were 54 per cent above pre-war. Ignoring the new (1946) index, the deficit has always been minus 23 per cent.

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Friday's schedules prove vividly the remarkably unchanging nature of much British television. Sometimes it is a matter of repeats. Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons (6.00 BBC2) was first screened in 1967 and The Man From UNCLE which follows is even older: it started in 1965. The late-night sci-fi movie on Channel 4, Them, (12.05) which has been shown umpteen times on television, is 40 years old. Some current series are almost as long in the tooth. The press review, What The Papers Say (7.45 BBC2) first turned up in 1956; Britain's most popular drama series, Coronation Street (7.30 ITV) began in 1960; and the science series Tomorrow's World is in its 30th year (7.30 BBC1). In BBC2's series about six Manchester students, The Living Soap Colin's 21st birthday coincides with rag week (7.15). In Olympic Grandstand there is women's figure skating, ice hockey and ski-jumping on BBC2 (8.00). In Love Hurts the relationship between sub Sloane Ranger Tessa and rich rough diamond Frank is getting more, not less, complicated (9.30 BBC1).</p>

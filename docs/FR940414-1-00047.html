			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An estimated 97 percent of the products reported to be repackaged and 90 percent of the total 1988 production (in pounds) are classified as herbicides. Nine products classified as fungicides were reported to be repackaged by refilling establishments; these amounted to less than two percent of the total production (in pounds). These fungicides are commonly used in grain storage areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agricultural pesticide products that are repackaged at refilling establishments contain various percentages of one or more of the 272 active ingredients that were part of the survey. An estimated 1,746 products that are repackaged contained between 40 percent and 50 percent active ingredients. An estimated 30 million pounds, (44 percent of the total pounds) including 504 products repackaged by these facilities contained between 80 percent and 90 percent active ingredient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of active ingredient(s) in a product may vary somewhat with the type of formulation of the product. The five active ingredients that were repackaged in the greatest quantity by the water-using refilling establishments are listed below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;EPTC is used as a herbicide to control perennial grassy weeds in a variety of crops such as beans, legumes, potatoes, and corn. An estimated 22 million pounds of EPTC were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alachlor is used as a preemergence herbicide to control certain grasses and weeds in crops such as corn, cotton, soybeans, and potatoes. An estimated six million pounds of alachlor were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Metolachlor is used as a preemergence and preplant herbicide to control weeds in a variety of crops such as corn, soybean, peanuts, potatoes, cotton and grain sorghum. An estimated four million pounds of metolachlor were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Atrazine is a herbicide used to control various weeds used mainly on corn and sorghum crops. An estimated 3.7 million pounds of atrazine were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Butylate is used as a preemergence herbicide for grassy weeds mainly on corn. An estimated 1.7 million pounds of butylate were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Pesticide Programs also classifies products by their type of formulation. The largest percentage of products reported to be repackaged by water using refilling establishments were emulsifiable concentrates, which composed an estimated 74 percent of the products repackaged and 80 percent of the total 1988 production in pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production lines at refilling establishments typically consist of a bulk storage tank, a minibulk into which the product is repackaged, and any interconnecting hoses, piping and pumps. The bulk storage tanks are usually clustered together, and the repackaging operations are controlled by the use of either a computer- or manually-regulated system of pumps and meters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some refilling establishments dedicate their bulk storage tanks, hoses, piping and pumps to one product to prevent any cross contamination of products that are applied to different crops. When a repackaging line was used to repackage more than one product, the establishment may have switched to a different product on that line during the season to meet farmers' demands. For example, several refilling establishments in the midwest that were contacted for the phone survey reported switching from repackaging corn pesticides to soybean pesticides during the middle of the season. These establishments may or may not have utilized a single line to repackage these different products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately half of the refilling establishments reported operating their lines on an as-needed basis and the remainder reported that they operated their lines during only one period. In both cases, the facility provides the product on an as-needed basis to meet the demands of a transitory market. The busiest period for repackaging is March through June. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Water Use and Wastewater Characteristics <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Wastewater Sources and Characteristics <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates that 1,806 facilities (PFPR facilities and refilling establishments combined) use water in their formulating, packaging or repackaging process. The median annual volume of water discharged by PFPR facilities is 3,003 gallons, except for manufacturing facilities that formulate and package with a median annual volume of formulating and packaging wastewater of 261,174 gallons. The average annual volume of water discharged, as reported by refilling establishments, is approximately 78 gallons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities reported no water use. EPA estimates there are 633 facilities nationwide that do not use water in their formulating, packaging or repackaging process. Of the estimated PFPR facilities that use water in their formulating, packaging or repackaging process 652 discharge wastewater to surface water or Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), 19 refilling establishments are indirect dischargers to POTWs. An estimated 457 facilities recycle or reuse on-site some or all of their wastewater. In some cases, facilities treat and reuse their process wastewater before reusing it. An estimated 142 facilities use off-site disposal of some or all of their wastewater. Reports of off-site disposal included incineration, deepwell injection and centralized waste treatment facilities. An estimated 93 facilities dispose of some or all of their wastewater to septic systems or by land application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

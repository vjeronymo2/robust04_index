			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Patriarchate?"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has visited the  United States. He was the first Greek prime minister to do so  in the past 20 years. Yeoryios Papandreou, his son, made the  preparations for his visit. He is the deputy foreign minister  responsible for the affairs of Greeks who live in foreign  countries and is also responsible for Greece's relations with  the Greek lobby in the United States, AHEPA [American-Hellenic  Educational and Progressive Association] affairs, and matters  related to the Patriarchate in Istanbul and the Turkish minority  in Western Thrace.    Prior to leaving for Washington to prepare for his father's  visit, Yeoryios Papandreou arrived in Istanbul and held talks  with the patriarch. He also attended a mass in the  Patriarchate. Yeoryios Papandreou held talks with the AHEPA  members and made several initiatives with the support of  Archbiship Iakovos, head of the Orthodox Churches in Washington.  Meanwhile, George Stephanopoulos, who is an adviser to the  White House, was asked to help him gain the support of the  Greek-American voters.    Meanwhile, a warning in Clinton's letter, which Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller leaked to the press prior to the local  elections in Turkey on 27 March, has drawn attention. It said:  "It will be in Turkey's interest to work with all its  neighbors, including Greece, to reduce tensions in the region to  a minimum. Your government may take certain symbolic steps to  reduce the latest tensions in relations between Turkey and  Greece. In view of that, I am convinced that an effort should  now be made regarding certain developments. One of the symbolic  steps that you may take could be related to the Greek Orthodox  Partriarchate in Istanbul. I hope that you will consider easing  certain difficult problems to help the Patriarchate become a  functioning institution."    That message reemphasized the views U.S. officials have for  many years conveyed to Ankara under the pressure of the Greek  lobby.    What Clinton has requested from Ciller is the recognition of  an "ecumenical status" for the Patriarchate. In fact, Clinton's  statement at the press conference he held in the White House  after he met Andreas Papandreou was interesting. President  Clinton asked for a change in the Patriarchate's status; he did  that under pressure from the Greek lobby.    The Patriarchate's status is not provided for in the  Lausanne  Treaty, it has been outlined verbally. The Patriarchate does  not have any political or administrative authority. According  to the Lausanne Treaty, the Patriarchate is nothing more than a  Turkish institution. Its task is to function as the spiritual  institution of the Orthodox community in Turkey. The  Patriarchate functions in accordance with Turkey's laws, as do  other Turkish institutions.    The Patriarchate's wish for an "ecumenical status" is based  on Orthodox tenets. It has dreamed of attaining a "state  status" in Istanbul, like the Catholic Church has in the Vatican.    There are several patriarchs in the divided system of the  Orthodox Churches. However, the patriarch in Istanbul is more  influential than his colleagues elsewhere in the Orthodox world.  There is a strong desire for the patriarch of Constantinople  [Istanbul] in the Orthodox world to gain a status similar to  that of the Pope in the Catholic World. This is based on two  reasons. The first is their wish that he be the most influential  patriarch in the Orthodox world; and the second is the wish to  have an equal ecumenical status with the Pope so they can have a  balance, in status and protocol, among the Christian Churches.  However, any move in that direction may create a religious  state within a state, which would conflict with the Lausanne  Treaty and the republican principles in Turkey.    From Turkey's viewpoint, the concept of an "ecumenical  status" is meaningless. As far as Turkey is concerned, the  Patriarchate is just an ordinary Turkish institution. Clinton's  request for an improvement of the Patriarchate's working  conditions is tantamount to interference in Turkey's internal  affairs.    However, is it not true that Prime Minister Ciller's request  for a letter of support from Clinton, which she would use as a  trump card in the elections, was tantamount to inviting him to  "interfere in Turkey's internal affairs?" Obviously, such a  request would encourage him to raise the question of the  Patriarchate's status. Naturally, Clinton has not missed this  opportunity to support Andreas Papandreou in Greece's domestic  politics and bow to voters of Greek origin in the United States.    An interesting point is Yeoryios Papandreou's arrival in  Istanbul from Washington. He gave first-hand information to the  Patriarchate on his contacts in Washington.    All that has a very important aspect for Turkey. The  Pan-Slavic trend was resurrected after the collapse of the  Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the Orthodox Church, which has had an  important political role throughout history, has moved to step  up its activities in the region. What can be more natural than  coordination between an Orthodox organization based in Istanbul  and the Greek Megali Idea [Great Ideology], which Greece has  never abandoned?</p>

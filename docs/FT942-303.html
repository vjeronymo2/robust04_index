			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (9): Four ways ahead - Strategic Management / PN Thornton on a self-effacing prizewinner What is Strategy and Does it Matter? by Richard Whittington Routledge, Pounds 39 164 pages There are 37 books in print with the title Strategic Management, according to Richard Whittington in the introduction to this rather self-effacingly titled little volume in the Routledge series in analytical management. So who needs a 38th? The answer, of course, is all those who either lack the time or the retentive capacity to cope with the other 37. Not that Whittington's book relieves its readers of the burden of informing themselves more widely, nor indeed does it claim to do so. What it does seek to do is to map out the landscape of contemporary approaches to strategy-making, and to provide a guided tour of that landscape. Readers should then be in a position to decide which approach is most appropriate to their own circumstances, and to know where to turn for more detailed guidance. In this aim it succeeds, at least in the opinion of the judging panel for the Management Consultancies Association Business Book of the Year. It carried off the first prize for the best business book of the year by a British author aged under 45. Whittington's framework consists of a 2x2 matrix (how else]) within which any approach to strategy can be slotted. The axes of the matrix represent the top-down (deliberate) or bottom-up (emergent) process used to arrive at a strategy on the one hand and the profit-maximising or more broadly based pluralistic objectives of the strategy on the other. Within this matrix, four basic approaches are identified. The classical approach, associated with renowned authorities such as Ansoff and Porter adopts a deliberate process of rational analysis designed to maximise long-term advantage. Evolutionists, on the other hand, eschew long-term planning as largely irrelevant in today's fast-changing world. All that one can do is to operate as efficiently as possible in today's conditions, and take tomorrow as it comes. Natural selection will determine who survives and who goes under. Processualists such as Mintzberg and Hamel agree that long-range planning is largely futile, and that organisations evolve through a process of trial and error. However, this incremental approach is not necessarily just a tactical one; it may be informed by an underlying 'strategic intent' which provides a broad sense of direction and channels opportunism. Finally, Whittington himself favours a systemic point of view, which recognises that the objectives of an organisation can vary dramatically, depending on the culture (national culture, in the main) within which it is embedded. He notes, for example, that Japanese companies target themselves on market share and new product introductions whereas US companies are focused heavily on return on investment and share price. Having defined his terms (and the book is worth reading for this alone, though some plain words would have helped) Whittington examines a number of important elements of modern management - leadership, decision-making, approaches to growth and organisational change. He does this through the 'lens' of each of his four basic schools of strategic thinking. The classical approach to decision-making, for example, will rely heavily on detailed analysis, whereas the processualists believe this creates a delusion that one is shaping the future. The systemic school takes a more cynical view. If analysis is expected to get the decision, do it; it not, don't. And not surprisingly Whittington concludes that strategy, or rather the approach to strategy does matter, for the whole economy as well as for individual enterprises. He argues that the 'market-rational' paradigm adopted by the Anglo-Saxon world is deficient, and that future success will require greater state leadership and some interlocking of national and business strategies. This sounds over-simplistic, and it is. But that does not detract from the overall merit of the book, which is well-structured, short and energetically written. It does, though, deal with some challenging material (the author is an academic with Warwick Business School) and it is not an easy read. However, it repays perseverance, and all those concerned with strategy development, whether as consultants, business development executives or general managers, should end up with an enriched understanding of what strategy means for them and which approach is likely to deliver the goods. This book won the first MCA Book Prize, sponsored by the Management Consultancies Association, announced in late March. Details of the 1994 prize - open to British writers of management books under the age of 45 - can be obtained from Andrea Livingstone, MCA Book Prize Administrator, 122 Fawnbrake Avenue, London SE24 0BZ.

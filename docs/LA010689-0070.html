			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DUCOMMUN CEO ELECTED CHAIRMAN  </P> <P> Ducommun President and Chief Executive Norman A. Barkeley has been elected  chairman of the troubled aerospace firm.  </P> <P> Barkeley succeeds Wallace W. Booth, 66, the firm's longtime chairman. Booth  joined Ducommun as chief executive in 1977, and became chairman a year later.  He remains on Ducommun's board.  </P> <P> Barkeley, 58, joined Ducommun last July as Booth's heir apparent, following two  presidents who left the firm in rapid succession. Before coming to Ducommun,  Barkeley had been chairman and chief executive of Lear Siegler, a Santa Monica  aerospace company acquired by an investment group two years ago.  </P> <P> Barkeley lends his "brand name reputation" in the aerospace industry to  Ducommun, said Julian Menear, an aerospace analyst with Pershing &amp; Co. in  New York. Even so, Barkeley's task won't be easy, Menear said.  </P> <P> "He's got to convince customers that Ducommun can improve its service and offer  competitive prices," Menear said. Barkeley wasn't available for comment  Thursday. The Carson-based company, which has cut jobs and dismantled its  electronics business to lower costs, expects to report a loss for 1988.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 16 (AFP) -- PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  will make his long-awaited visit to Gaza and Jericho within the  next week, but it will only be for a short stay, Palestinian and  diplomatic sources said Thursday.    'Arafat will visit the newly-autonomous areas for three days  but will spend every night in Amman according to the plans being  laid, the sources said. No precise date is yet known.    Contradictory rumours have been circulating for weeks about  when the PLO chief intends to make his triumphant entry into  Jericho. But preparations have been going on nonetheless to  hand over control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to the new  Palestinian Authority.    'Arafat is due to return for good to Jericho, but has said  he  did not want to make the trip until donor countries had  fulfilled pledges to help fund Palestinian self-rule.    Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been issuing various  dates for his return for months. On Sunday the PLO's former  negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 'Arafat would arrive within two  weeks. Sha'th himself entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after  spending most of his life in exile.    PLO officials said Sha'th would prepare for 'Arafat's  arrival  either later this month or in early July.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Oshchenko, VLADIVOSTOK: "Pot-Belly </F> Stoves Can Be Fueled Without Coal or Fuel Oil"]    [Text] "Pot-belly stoves must first be placed in the  hallways, and only then in the apartments." This comment uttered  Tuesday by Sergey Demin, deputy head of administration of  Maritime Kray, at the session of the kray Emergency Situations  Commission passed somehow unnoticed by those assembled.    There is every reason to believe, however, that the next  session of the commission may be held under candlelight, and it  will be dedicated to precisely which plants will have  requisitions placed for pot-belly stoves and what will be used  to fuel them.    Perhaps publicly for the first time in his life Yuriy  Basharov, general director of the Dalenergo joint-stock company,  screamed out in front of television cameras and bystanders--"We  have reached bottom... We are on the brink of disaster! If we  cut off the energy system today, we will not only freeze this  winter--we will be living under torchlight for the next two  years." Basharov's face turned red as he screamed from the  platform.    Due to the fact that kray enterprises and city  administrations owe Dalenergo over R110 billion for energy used,  the Dalenergo people themselves have become debtors and cannot  pay for fuel. The required amount is R30-40 billion.    As a result, fuel oil has stopped being offloaded at the  Maritime Kray thermal power station as of 23 December, and coal  in the amounts intended for the kray has stopped being loaded in  Eastern Siberia and Southern Yakutia as of 25 December. Reserves  of fuel oil on hand are capable of supplying only five to eight  days of operation of the heat producers.    "If we sweep the coal storehouses clean, the Maritime Kray  state regional electric power station will have a supply to last  until 1 February, while reserves at the Artem state regional  electric power station will last until 10 February," Basharov  continued.    According to a departmental order with respect to Dalenergo,  a timetable for shutting off thermal energy systems of  enterprises and residential buildings must be drawn up by 13  January. It would be appropriate under the present situation to  compare this timetable with a sentence, the execution of which  depends on the resourcefulness of financial specialists and  directors of enterprises in debt to Dalenergo.    Igor Lebedinets, chairman of the Emergency Situations  Commission and deputy head of administration of Maritime Kray,  stated unambiguously: "Unless we put R30-40 billion of net  assets into circulation right away, we will have to shut off  power from residences." In short, use your water and electricity  now while you have them.    The situation Vladivostok is in looks especially bleak. The  municipal enterprise for heating systems owes Dalenergo R15.7  billion, but residential building trusts have not settled their  accounts with it. These trusts, in turn, are not receiving money  from the city administration. Once again, unfortunately, the  leaders of the city and the kray have been unable to find a  common language even for such a topic as whether or not their  own apartments will go without heat. City mayor Viktor Cherepkov  did not attend the Emergency Situations Commission session at  all. City manager Vladimir Gilgenberg again tried to argue the  matter of putting tax withholdings into the city budget, but  Igor Lebedinets did not want to hear any explanations--either  from Gilgenberg himself or from the deputy mayors of Vladivostok  for finance and economics.    Sergey Demin, deputy head of the kray administration for  problems of the fuel and energy complex, is to fly to Moscow  today, where he will try to secure the receipt of grants  promised by the government in the amount of R62.8 billion. At  the same time, Demin himself stated: "For Moscow, our regions  are remote not by virtue of their designation or distance, but  by virtue of their treatment..."    Here we can only modify a common saying: Rescue of the  freezing is a matter for the freezing themselves...</p>

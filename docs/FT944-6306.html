			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Carsberg resignation follows delay in competition law reform Sir Bryan Carsberg decided to step down as director-general of fair trading three weeks ago, after it became clear the government would not include competition law reform in the Queen's Speech, it emerged yesterday. Observers said the government's failure to include in its legislative programme the reform of restrictive trade practices, first promised in 1987, may have proved the decisive factor in his decision to resign. Sir Bryan and senior competition officials at the Office of Fair Trading are known to have become increasingly frustrated by the government's lack of interest in competition policy since Mr Michael Heseltine took over as trade and industry secretary at the last election. On several occasions over the past two years, Mr Heseltine has rejected Sir Bryan's advice on referral of proposed mergers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In February, Mr Heseltine ordered Sir Bryan to stop investigation into bus services on the Isle of Arran. However, it was the government's failure to introduce long-awaited competition law reform which generated the most friction between the Department of Trade and Industry and the OFT. Speaking in Paris yesterday, where he was attending an international competition policy conference, Sir Bryan denied there was any rift with ministers and insisted his move to the International Accounting Standards Committee was a positive one. He was headhunted for the job as secretary-general of the international financial reporting organisation by Clive &amp; Stokes, the international search consultants. Talks took place over summer, but it is believed Sir Bryan initially rejected leaving the OFT, only agreeing to accept the IASC post less than three weeks ago. The DTI yesterday said that it would conduct a wide search for his successor and the appointment would be made by Mr Heseltine. Mr Heseltine, who has relaxed competition policy during his tenure at the DTI, can be expected to choose someone who shares his views on competitiveness and deregulation. The DTI said it would be looking for someone with regulatory experience, prompting speculation that the job may go to one of the present privatised utility regulators. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator and a former civil servant who has just completed a water review, are thought the most likely candidates.

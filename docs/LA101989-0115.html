			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The NCAA Council will recommend year-round drug testing for college athletes  and stiffer penalties for those who test positive, especially for such banned  substances as steroids.  </P> <P> The NCAA Council, which includes 22 representatives from the NCAA's Division I  schools and 11 each from Divisions II and III, ended three days of closed-door  meetings Wednesday. The meetings set the agenda of proposals it will sponsor at  the full NCAA convention at Dallas Jan. 7-10.  </P> <P> NCAA President Albert Witte, a law professor at the University of Arkansas,  said the council unanimously endorsed the concept of a year-round drug testing  program, although no details of the plan or how it would be implemented have  been formulated. The NCAA now tests only before its championship events and  football bowl games, but many schools conduct in-season testing for athletes.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Venezuela Threatens to Halt Debt Servicing: Venezuela has raised the stakes in  its debt restructuring talks, threatening to withhold interest payments on its  $21 billion of debt owed to foreign banks unless new loans are provided,  bankers who attended the negotiating sessions in New York said. The country has  already missed interest payment deadlines in January and has fallen into  arrears, they said. They described the threat as a tactic to pressure reluctant  bank lenders into extending new loans and agreeing to a restructuring of the  country's foreign debt.  </P></p>

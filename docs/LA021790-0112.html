Monitoring of 259 homes in  Jacksonville, Fla., and Springfield, Mass., for 32 substances used in farming  and consumer products found the indoor levels of some chemicals to be 50 to 90  times greater than the levels outdoors. The consumer products included bug  sprays, disinfectants and termite chemicals.  </P></p>

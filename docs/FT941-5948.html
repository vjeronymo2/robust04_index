			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Fear in Athens for health of the nation: Illness has become an obstacle to government Greece's socialist government has a problem usually associated with the old communist regimes of eastern Europe: the weak health of several key players, among them the prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has become an obstacle to effective decision-making. 'Administrative delays are always a hurdle to getting anything done in Greece. It's compounded now because the prime minister and the economy minister can't stay at their desks as long as they should,' says a senior government adviser. Privatisation is a case in point, now that the rising budget deficit has forced the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) into an embarrassing reversal of its previous opposition to unbundling the state. In addition to the plan for selling part of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, there is talk of disposing of a 15 per cent stake in the Public Power Corporation this year, through a convertible bond issue with a five- to seven-year maturity. Decisions are needed quickly if the flotation and the bond issue are to be completed on schedule this year, given that both require extensive preparation in terms of passing enabling legislation and removing other procedural obstacles. Offers from half a dozen international merchant banks to act as advisers or underwriters to the OTE flotation are being evaluated at the Economy Ministry. But officials there say the choice cannot be made without Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who has terminal cancer and has been away from his desk for several weeks. One banker said: 'There's a communication gap, no feedback. There was an enthusiastic meeting with the minister some time back, then simply nothing happened.' Planning the sale requires tough decisions at an early stage on sorting out OTE's large pension obligations and auditing its books according to international standards Mr Papandreou, 75, shows no sign of replacing Mr Gennimatas, one of his closest political associates. One reason is that the economy minister, Pasok's most popular member, is considered the best person to sell privatisation to the trade unions, who successfully opposed the previous conservative government's plans to transfer public utilities to the private sector. However, Mr Papandreou, who has a serious heart problem and is often not seen in public for several days, has not appointed a deputy prime minister either. He is expected to cling obstinately to power: the succession to his leadership is not on the agenda for discussion at next month's Pasok congress. Meanwhile, the Culture Ministry has been thrown into disarray by the illness of Ms Melina Mercouri, still in intensive care in a New York hospital after surgery for a recurrence of cancer. At the Bank of Greece, advisers keep a watchful eye on Mr Yannis Boutos, the governor, who has a heart condition that would curtail his activities under normal circumstances. Mr Boutos, a former economy minister appointed by Mr Papandreou on his return to power, says he is determined to expedite reform at the central bank. However, the survival of the socialist government in the next few months depends not on Mr Papandreou's health but on President Constantine Karamanlis, the 86-year-old head of state, whose hold on power is just as precarious. Mr Karamanlis also has heart problems, but after consultations in London last year decided against having by-pass surgery. If he has to step down before his presidential term expires next spring, parliament would probably be unable to muster the three-fifths majority needed to elect a successor, and a general election would be held.</p>

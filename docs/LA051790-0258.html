			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE ARTS LEADER AIMS TO CREATE A SCENE;  </P> <P> CULTURE: HENRY KORN IS WORKING TO REBUILD A PUBLIC ARTS PROGRAM IN THE MECCA OF  MASTER PLANNING. THE EFFORT IS PART OF A NATIONWIDE TREND TO IMPROVE THE  QUALITY OF LIFE.  </P> <P> So why would an arts administrator leave Santa Monica, with one of the most  active and diverse cultural scenes in Southern California, for the antiseptic  environs of Irvine?  </P> <P>  For the challenge, of course, answers Henry Korn, now in his second week as  Irvine's cultural affairs manager.  </P> <P> In the face of Irvine-esque "sameness of people's every day experience," the  arts can "invest a community with a sense of identity," Korn said. "If ever  there was a place that needed it," he adds, "it was sure going to be Irvine."  </P> <P> If he is daunted by the thought of trying to bring a spark of culture -- with  its implicit promises of spontaneity and individual expression -- to the mecca  of master planning, he doesn't let on. In fact, he seems to relish it.  </P> <P> "The part about (arts administration) that interests me the most is the  beginning of things because that's when the creative opportunities are the  greatest," Korn said. "That's when you're dreaming the dreams."  </P> <P> Korn's appointment is the most concrete step yet in Irvine's quest to establish  a local arts agency. After years of reports, studies and committee meetings, a  Cultural Affairs Commission was appointed earlier this year. Commission members  are now working with Korn to present a detailed funding plan to the City  Council, possibly by July.  </P> <P> The agency's mission is still being defined, but its primary tasks probably  will include giving grants to local arts groups, rebuilding a public arts  program, establishing a mechanism to raise private funds, lending a hand in  local arts education, and administering the existing Irvine Fine Arts Center.  </P> <P> Several Orange County cities already have arts agencies, and the county itself  is thinking about establishing one. These efforts are part of a larger trend,  according to Thomas Wolf, a consultant whose Massachusetts-based Wolf  Organization prepared a blueprint for Irvine's proposed agency.  </P> <P> "In the last two decades, the local arts agency movement has grown from  virtually nothing to a movement which is very large," Wolf said this week.  "Cities of even moderate size now generally are developing local arts  councils." Wolf said economic factors play as big a role in the movement as a  desire to improve the quality of life: Cities have noted that "cultural  amenities" are effective incentives for attracting businesses, as well as  high-income and well-educated residents.  </P> <P> Wolf sees the role of local agencies gaining in importance as state and federal  arts support hits a ceiling. "Since the beginning of the '80s, the real growth  explosions of new monies have been at the local level," he said. Federal and  state support have "really capped, because there's a huge federal deficit. The  states are facing big deficits."  </P> <P> The soft-spoken Korn, 44, continues to live in Los Angeles with his wife Donna  Stein, an independent exhibition organizer (she is bringing parts of the Berlin  Wall to Los Angeles), and their 3-year-old daughter, Sophie. An author, Korn is  currently working on a book of fiction and takes part in a weekly comedy  writing workshop with veteran TV writer Danny Simon, brother of playwright  Neil.  </P> <P> Korn was hailed in Santa Monica for his handling of the city's public arts  program, which installed 15 public sculptures during his four-year tenure, and  for the success of the Santa Monica Art Foundation, which raised $250,000 from  the business community in three years.  </P> <P> Among his other accomplishments: administration of an active performing arts  program, including free outdoor theater; a literature program that, among other  things, put poetry on the inside walls of city buses; a video art program that  broadcast artists' works on the city-run public access channel, and creation of  a city art collection.  </P> <P> "I think a number of these things are applicable to Irvine," Korn said.  </P> <P> While he enjoyed his work in Santa Monica, he says he felt he had fulfilled his  goals there and was ready to move on. "There are lots of 'maintainers' in the  world," he notes. "I'm not a maintainer."  </P> <P> One obstacle he acknowledges in Irvine is its youth and affluence. The cost of  housing is not exactly within the reach of most artists, and because there are  few older buildings, inexpensive studio space can be hard to find. According to  the Wolf Organization report, studio rentals in Irvine can run three times as  high as equivalent space in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Still, Korn says, "we hope to create a situation hospitable to an artists'  community," perhaps by providing employment for artists and arts professionals  through residencies and commissions, and through jobs at the Fine Arts Center  and through the public schools.  </P> <P> "We can perhaps even create working spaces for artists," he said. The Wolf  report suggests expanding the Fine Arts Center to accommodate private studios  or creating some sort of partnership with UC Irvine. Korn sees the university  as one of the city's attributes both as a source of cultural expertise and as a  partner in arts ventures. Already, the city and UCI have joined to build the  Irvine Theatre, due to open in October.  </P> <P> And, even as he jokes about Irvine's reputation as a middle-class fortress of  enforced architectural uniformity, Korn says he has found Irvine residents to  be open and enthusiastic about creating a cultural scene.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can come to any conclusions about people from the outsides  of their houses," he said. "The built environment has been defined by  developers and corporate institutions.  </P> <P> "Creativity is meaningless without receptivity. . . . My sense is that Irvine  has a very well-developed degree of receptivity."  </P></p>

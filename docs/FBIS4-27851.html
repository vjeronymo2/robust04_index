			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The cooperative farms  across the country have finished rice-transplanting in all paddy  fields except northern highland and cold areas and some rice  seedling beds.    The agricultural working people have made a breakthrough for  reaping another rich crop this year by finishing rice  transplanting in the time most opportune for the highest yield.    Weeding has already entered a full-scale stage in Paechon,  Chaeryong and Anak, South Hwanghae Province, and in Unjon,  Chongju and Yomju, North Pyongan Province, and many other areas  on the west coast.    Cooperative farms are pulling their full weight on manuring  and tending crops.</p>

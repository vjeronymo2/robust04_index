			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, this rulemaking has a limited scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is therefore not revisiting many of the policy and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues resolved in the rulemakings establishing the ABT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking is focused on the narrow issue of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what credit accounting procedure best implements the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals of the ABT program, with the existence of an ABT program as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a given. In that context, EPA believes that the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in this rule are appropriate. A FIFO credit accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision will better serve the intended goals of the ABT program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the current LIFO accounting provision. In addition, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not expect an adverse environmental impact from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, and over time believes the changes should benefit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, as was explained in the preamble to the notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking (58 FR 32498, June 10, 1993), FIFO is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred over LIFO, because LIFO may induce manufacturers to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any credits in the bank before generating new credits, for fear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of having the previously banked credits expire. Thus, LIFO may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the incentive for manufacturers to pull ahead new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. On the other hand, FIFO encourages manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> put into production new technology in order to generate new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits and gain experience on the overall effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology on emissions before it is required by standards. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience may lead to improved reliability when new technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is implemented on a wider scale. In addition, FIFO has the added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental benefit of having more credits discounted, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits are banked first rather than averaged first, as under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LIFO. (Averaged credits are not discounted, while banked or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traded credits are.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, while MECA, NRDC, and ALA claim that the increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of credits in the 1994&hyph;1996 model years resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the switch to FIFO credit accounting is an environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detriment, EPA emphasizes that the credits in question are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits that manufacturers have previously generated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore represent an emission reduction that has already taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place. Furthermore, under FIFO, credits are banked more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently than under LIFO, because LIFO requires averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first. Therefore, FIFO provides the additional environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of a 20% discount to more credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One final commenter, Michael Walsh, questioned EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rationale for ``relaxing'' the ABT requirements when a stated goal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program was to not undercut the purpose of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act to promote the achievement of the greatest degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reductions available now and in the future. In support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of his argument, Mr. Walsh states that the ABT program has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually been used by manufacturers to employ engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications to meet emission standards rather than employing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more significant pollution controls (presumably particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traps). Mr. Walsh further bolsters his argument with studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showing the health hazards associated with oxides of nitrogen and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate matter. Finally, Mr. Walsh comments that EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withheld data from the public which has denied the public a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has, through rulemaking, set the emission standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty engines at levels which reflect the greatest degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emissions reductions available now and in the future. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency will work hard to ensure that overall emissions will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed the levels set by those standards. Indeed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental safeguards built into the ABT program, safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which remain in effect today, are intended to ensure that overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will not exceed the standards. EPA does not believe,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that it is appropriate to dictate which emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies manufacturers must use to meet those standards. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal goal of the ABT program is to provide flexibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturers to choose the most economically efficient means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of meeting the emission standards. If manufacturers do employ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less expensive emission control options to meet the standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is their prerogative. The overall emission levels set by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards are not exceeded and, theoretically, resources have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been allocated more efficiently. Until data is provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall emissions levels are being exceeded, EPA will assume that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ABT program is achieving its goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for Mr. Walsh's claim that EPA is withholding data, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserts that it has placed in the docket all accurate data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it has relied to make this decision. The only data which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been withheld is confidential business information (CBI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which EPA is statutorily prohibited from releasing; even that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, if it was considered by EPA in making this decision,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been recharacterized to avoid revealing CBI and placed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

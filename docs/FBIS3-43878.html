			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fighting between the Liberian Peace Council [LPC]  and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  has intensified in Sino County in the southeast of Liberia, and  as Nii Artey Allison reports in this telex from Monrovia, the  weekend's fighting saw the Peace Council making substantial  advances against the NPFL. [read by announcer]    NPFL sources confirmed yesterday that the Liberian Peace  Council overran Paynestown last week, bringing to six the number  of main towns in Upper Sino County now under LPC control. A  resident of NPFL territory told me yesterday that NPFL officials  were trying to play down the losses. The NPFL named  (Gettyporg), Po River, (Pankfield), Lexington, and Buto as other  towns lost to the LPC in the last four weeks.    It was confirmed yesterday that Charles Taylor has replaced  top battlefront commanders responsible for the Sino and  Rivercess region to strengthen NPFL defenses in the area.  According to several NPFL commandos whom I spoke with, the LPC  had entered Sino County by amphibious landing craft to the port  of Greenville.    Meanwhile, the NPFL reopened its portion of the Gbarnga to  Kakata highway yesterday before a sizable crowd of residents  from Gbarnga. United Nations staff and diplomats also attended  the occasion at Kanela Mission School campus, 40 miles north of  Monrovia. The highway was closed when the NPFL attacked  Monrovia in October 1992. However, the reopening of the NPFL  section of the highway may make little difference since ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] imposed a  blockade on the highway some two weeks ago. Recently a 12-car  convoy of UN staff, ambassadors from the United States, Lebanon,  and Egypt, and journalists, including myself, were held up for  two hours by ULIMO forces brandishing assault rifles and rocket  propelled grenades. One ULIMO commander shouted: Turn back,  turn back. You stupid people are the ones causing the problem  here. The situation was later brought under control by the  colonel in charge of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] Kakata Command.</p>

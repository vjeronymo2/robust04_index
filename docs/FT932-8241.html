			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Siam Cement first-quarter profits almost halved SIAM CEMENT, Thailand's leading industrial group, reported a 49 per cent fall in consolidated net profits for the first quarter of 1993 to Bt694.54m (Dollars 27.51m). Sales of cement, approximately half the group's output, held up well but earnings were hit by fierce price competition, a sharp increase in capacity and higher depreciation and interest charges. Mr Francis Middlehurst, an analyst with Crosby Research said domestic demand for cement had increased but export markets proved more difficult than expected because of the high transport costs. First Asia Securities' analyst Colleen Duggan said the problems of the whole group - from building materials to car parts to pulp and paper - mirrored that of the economy. 'Siam Cement is practically everywhere dealing with producers expanding in the midst of oversupply. This is depressing a lot of industrial earnings and almost the entire construction sector,' she said. First Asia recently halved its group net profits forecast for Siam Cement this year to Bt2bn. Post Publishing, publisher of the Bangkok Post, and just under 15 per cent owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, reported first-quarter net profits of Bt44.831m, down from Bt55.157m. Earnings were cut by the one-off expense of moving into a new headquarters and the launch last summer of a Thai language paper, the Siam Post, which is not expected to generate profits until 1994.</p>

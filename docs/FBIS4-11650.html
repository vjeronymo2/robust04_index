			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao at the </F> concluding session of the G-15 Summit at Vigyan Bhavan in New  Delhi -- live]    [Text] Excellencies, heads of state, heads of government,  special envoys, ladies and gentlemen: We meet now in the  concluding session of the fourth summit of the G-15 in New  Delhi. We have had fruitful discussions on matters relating to  the future organization of the work and activities of the group  as well as on further evolving its perspectives on global issues  of common concern. When we began the summit, we were set to  impart a new dynamism to this group and enable it to more  meaningfully serve the interests of its constituents. We sought  to clearly establish a direct correlation between our interests  in the group and the benefits that we can derive from it. We  believe that we have been able to provide the wherewithal and  direction to the group in terms of institutional framework and  agenda that, given rigorous monitoring and follow up, could  achieve this objective.    We have decided to broaden the scope of intra-G-15 economic  cooperation through the establishment of a Committee on Trade,  Investment, and Technology, which will work toward evolution of  transregional arrangements. Key elements of these arrangements  would be liberalization, facilitation, promotion of trade to  demonstrably increase economic interaction within the group.  The success of our efforts would, in turn, simulate such  exchanges in the vital areas of trade, investment, and transfer  of technology with and among other developing countries. The  private sector will have a crucial role to play and will  therefore be closely associated with this venture. This  committee will also establish interactive links with related  projects such as the South Investment, Trade, and Technology  Data Exchange Center -- SITTDEC -- payments, arrangements,  infrastructure, sectoral, and techno-economic projects such as  solar energy and gene banks. This approach will not only bring  our complementarities to the fore, but will fully utilize them  to enlarge markets and accelerate growth and development in our  countries. Above all, this approach provides an altogether new  dimension to our firm commitment to further implement our  cooperative projects and establish more vigorous linkages  between them and our national institutions and policies. This  would then make South-South cooperation a truly vibrant  component of G-15.    The business forum which has been held in tandem with the  summit has provided new insights to expanding trade, investments  through joint ventures, technological exchanges, and tourism.  It drew up time-bound action plans for strengthening transport,  financial, and information infrastructure for intra G-15 trade.  The trade committee would help achieve these objectives through  its own work program. We recognize that the availability of  objective, balanced, extensive, and timely information about  political, cultural, economic, and social developments in G-15  countries is an essential prerequisite of effective cooperation.  We, therefore, agreed that G-15 should harness the information  and communication revolution to promote better understanding and  knowledge about the problems and experiences, capabilities, and  potential of our countries. This could best be achieved by  establishing telecommunications and media link-ups and  coordination of efforts in these areas. A group to evolve  appropriate strategies in this regard, including recommendations  on information infrastructure and communication systems --  existing and new -- that may need to be established will be set  up. We are asking the troika foreign ministers to facilitate  the setting up of such a group and develop its terms of  reference.    The summit reaffirmed support for the continuing operation  of  SITTDEC and agreed that member countries should meet their  financial obligations. To ensure viability, the summit  recommended that SITTDEC should be commercially oriented and  accept subscribers directly from all developing countries. In  this regard, it was felt that a board meeting should be convened  at the earliest. Our group has considerable technological  resources and expertise, which we are keen to put to the service  of industrialization, rural development, employment generation,  and building of social infrastructure in developing countries.  Cooperation in the setting up of small scale industries,  especially in Africa is of particular relevance and we agreed to  extend full support through appropriate projects.    We welcomed the offer by the government of Senegal to  coordinate a project on the transfer of technology and  development with a focus on food production, energy, and health.  We welcomed the proposal by the government of Egypt on  establishment of South-South Renewable Energy Promotion Center,  which is geared to exchange of information and the use of  existing capabilities in member countries in this field. We  also welcomed the proposal of the government of Egypt for  cooperation in the design, execution, and management of  petroleum, gas and petrochemical projects. We agreed to hone  our consultative mechanisms by providing for meetings of our  ministers of foreign affairs, economy, trade, agriculture,  environment, and science and technology on a regular basis in  the intersummit period. This would not only deepen our  understanding on these policy areas, but also lay the practical  foundation for cooperation among our countries. We are aware  that our decisions will have to be continuously followed up and  translated into action on the ground. We expect that the  summit's declared commitment will ensure that our national  administrations with the active support of our industry and  business would involve themselves in this task and produce  results. We would use ministerial and other consultative  mechanisms to coordinate our approaches on specific global  issues of common concern. The group's mandate of engaging in a  substantive dialogue on such issues with our partners in the  north will be actively pursued through interactions at  multilateral fora. The G-15 initiative on a constructive and  focussed dialogue with the G-7 will be carried forward.    The summit provided us an opportunity to evaluate the  international situation and exchange perceptions on issues of  critical importance to peace and development in our times. We  undertook a [words indistinct] of the economic, political,  environmental, and social changes that we, the developing  countries face in common and shared our experiences in meeting  these challenges. We affirmed the equal importance of attention  to peace and development in a restructured and democratized UN,  if we are to realize more equitable, prosperous, and secure  world order.    The world trading order that is emerging after seven long  years of negotiations in the Uruguay Round engaged our  attention. We expect that the round will fulfill its promise of  propelling our growth through new and expanded market access  areas of current and potential interest to us. Further, we look  to the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a guarantor of the  rights of the weaker trading partners and as a safety net  against arbitrary, unilateral, and discriminatory protectionist  action. In the coming months and years, we would have to work  together for this. At the same time, while we are fully  conscious of genuine social and environmental requirements and  the need to fulfill them in our specific context, we will have  to guard against new trade restricting tendencies in the  developed countries using the pretext of social and  environmental concerns with the real aim of nullifying the  comparative advantage of the economies of the south such as raw  materials, simple life styles, climate, wage structure, et  cetera. Keeping these factors in mind, it was agreed that our  ministers could meet at Marrakech on the occasion of the  concluding conference on the Uruguay Round with a view to  ensuring coordination amongst us.    Our discussions on the substantive and organizational  aspects  of the group have yielded positive results and it is my hope  that the group will influence policies, decisions, and events  that directly impinge on our individual and collective  well-being. We welcomed the offer made by the president of  Argentina to host our fifth summit meeting and look forward to  meeting in Buenos Aires in 1995. We also welcomed and accepted  the offer made by the president of Zimbabwe to host our sixth  summit in 1996. As this summit draws to a close, we look  forward to the future. We are confident that under the wise and  able stewardship of President Menem, the G-15 will prosper and  advance toward the realization of its potential. I would like to  assure him of our fullest cooperation in this noble endeavor,  which is the cherished goal of all our countries and peoples. I  now invite His Excellency Mr. Carlos Menem to make his  acceptance statement as the host of the fifth summit of G-15.  Thank you.</p>

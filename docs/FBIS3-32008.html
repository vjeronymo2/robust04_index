That was  the opinion in Congress yesterday, which is also shared by  Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the Senate, and by  Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  leader in the Senate. The blocs faithful to presidential  hopefuls Paulo Maluf from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party],  and to Jose Sarney and Orestes Quercia from the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party], were notoriously absent from the  voting session.    "They were all talking about that in the Senate plenum: the  presidential hopefuls estimate that if the stability plan is  successful, no one will be able to compete with Fernando  Henrique Cardoso," Pedro Simon told O GLOBO.    "There is no need to launch a formal candidacy. No event  this year can avoid being influenced by the election campaign.  And it has been this way from the start," Senator Mario Covas  said. Covas, who supports the candidacy of Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, asserted that if he had been beside Cardoso on the  rostrum when he denied being a candidate, "I would have kicked  him in the ankle."    Yesterday afternoon, when it was evident that the government  would not obtain a quorum for approving its measures without the  help of the PPR -- which declared it would obstruct the voting  session, and abandoned the hall -- Covas sought out Deputy  Armando Pinheiro (PPR-Sao Paulo), a Maluf supporter, to try to  obtain his support. The officialist congressmen believe that  the intransigent attitude of the PPR bloc simply reflects the  campaign strategy of presidential hopeful Paulo Maluf.    The thesis that former President Jose Sarney also helped  block the approval of the stabilization plan was based on the  nearly total absence of Maranhao deputies from the Chamber -- as  confirmed by the appearance of Deputy Sarney Jr. (PFL-MA)  [Liberal Front Party -- Maranhao] who crossed the chamber  smiling, without voting or abiding the role call.    "The launching of the Fernando Henrique's candidacy and the  lack of political coordination has led us to this result," said  Deputy Gonzaga Mota (PMDB-CE) [PMDB-Ceara], rapporteur for the  stability program in the lower house.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Double economic boost for South Africa SOUTH AFRICA yesterday received a double economic boost with the release of third-quarter GDP figures showing quarter-on-quarter growth of 8.2 per cent and the production price index for September falling to 5.5 per cent, the lowest level since January 1972. Economists said yesterday that the country's four-year recession had probably ended in the middle of the year with the third-quarter GDP figures following growth rates of 1.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively in the previous two quarters. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, South Africa's largest life office, joked: 'We're combining Asian growth rates with G-7 inflation]' The GDP figures were better than expected, though recent figures on retail sales, manufacturing production and car sales had hinted at an upturn. Most companies that have reported recently say they expect little meaningful growth before the second half of next year. As with the previous two quarters, most growth sprang from an improvement in agricultural production which grew at an annualised rate of 196 per cent. One feature was the 2 per cent annualised increase in non-farm GDP. Mr Mohr said it was the first time since 1988 that the economy had gone for three quarters without substantial negative growth on the non-farm side. Manufacturing growth was 5.5 per cent. The recovery remains fragile, with the Central Statistical Service (CSS) pointing out yesterday that the average level of the total seasonally adjusted real GDP for the first nine months of 1993 was 0.4 per cent below the equivalent figure a year ago, an indication of the low base from which these quarterly growth rates were achieved. Mr Mohr said the inflation figure confirmed inflation was probably lower than originally thought and economists were revising their forecasts downward. Consumer inflation was likely to average about 9.5 per cent in 1993 and would be lower in 1994.</p>

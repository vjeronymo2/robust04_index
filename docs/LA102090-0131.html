			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST DANCE WON'T BE SLOW FOR NOTRE DAME AND MIAMI  </P> <P> A moment of silence, please, for the rivalry that gave you fistfights and  highlights, taunts and touchdowns, cakewalks and classics.  </P> <P> At 12:30 p.m. today (Channel 2), sixth-ranked Notre Dame and second-ranked  Miami will conclude a relationship that blissfully began in 1955, but ends 23  games later amid veiled accusations of Irish cowardice and Hurricane thuggery.  </P> <P> Wave goodby to one of the few rivalries that still causes goose bumps. Storied,  tradition-dipped Notre Dame vs. the James Dean of college football, Miami. Or  as it's labeled on the hot-selling T-shirts here these days: Catholics vs. the  Convicts.  </P> <P> Notre Dame says it is ending the series because future Irish schedules, which  run through 2004, need more diversity. The Irish pride themselves on national  schedules, meaning there is a turnover in opponents. In this case, Miami gets  the boot after 23 games' worth of faithful service.  </P> <P> In its defense, Notre Dame correctly points out that other longtime opponents,  such as Michigan, will step aside in coming years for the likes of Florida  State. In essence, Notre Dame is saying the decision was nothing personal.  </P> <P> As you might expect, the Miami version of the story differs from the official  Notre Dame explanation. A lot.  </P> <P> The Hurricanes, whose schedule is set through 2000, offered to juggle or drop  opponents so the rivalry could continue uninterrupted. Notre Dame declined.  </P> <P> Miami tactfully mentioned the monetary benefits of such a series. After all,  the last two games between the Irish and the Hurricanes gave CBS its highest  college football rating each season. The 1987 game produced the second-highest  rating. Notre Dame shrugged.  </P> <P> And wouldn't a Hurricane-Irish matchup bring Notre Dame another huge payday for  those games played at the Orange Bowl? NBC owns Notre Dame's home TV rights  beginning next year, but that doesn't mean the Irish couldn't collect a hefty  paycheck for a nationally televised road game on another network.  </P> <P> "We have done everything possible to keep this game alive, both in the present  and future," said Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic director. "And we would have  entertained any proposal from Notre Dame."  </P> <P> Notre Dame wasn't in the proposing mood. Last August, Irish Athletic Director  Dick Rosenthal told reporters that "nothing should be read into the fact that  the series is ending. It was something planned many, many years ago. There  should be no suggestion that Miami doesn't want to play Notre Dame or Notre  Dame doesn't want to play Miami."  </P> <P> Rosenthal also said that if an opening presented itself, Miami would be one of  the first schools the Irish called. Well, there were openings, but Notre Dame  signed Florida State and, later, West Virginia to contracts.  </P> <P> "I don't think they even called us," said Larry Wahl, Miami's associate  athletic director.  </P> <P> Miami has its own reasons for the series' demise, beginning with the escalating  ill will that surrounds the game.  </P> <P> "They may feel it's gotten a little out of hand," Wahl said.  </P> <P> A little out of hand?  </P> <P> In 1988, the teams traded punches outside the tunnel leading to the Notre Dame  Stadium locker rooms.  </P> <P> Last year, the teams almost engaged in another pregame fight, but Miami and  Notre Dame coaches were able to separate the players before punches were  thrown.  </P> <P> "It became emotional maybe in the mid-'80s," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said earlier  this week in a teleconference. "I read where the players accused Miami of  spitting in their faces. I don't know what happened. That kind of talk fuels  emotions for the next year when they play."  </P> <P> Notre Dame leads the series, 14-7-1, but Miami has won five of the last six  games and six of the nine games played in the 1980s. Before that, Notre Dame  had won 10 consecutive games against the Hurricanes.  </P> <P> If ever a rivalry caused a nation to take notice, this is the one. For the  fourth time in as many years, Miami and Notre Dame start today's game ranked in  the top 10.  </P> <P> One other statistic of note: In the last three seasons, the winner of this game  has gone on to win the national championship.  </P> <P> "It's a good rivalry," said Melvin Bratton, a former Hurricane running back  (1983-87) who plays for the Denver Broncos. "I just think they're tired of  getting beat by us."  </P> <P> The rivalry was doing nicely until 1985, when the fourth-ranked Hurricanes  destroyed the unranked Irish, 58-7. Miami, which was then coached by Jimmy  Johnson, was accused of running up the score.  </P> <P> "That kind of teed off Notre Dame fans around the whole country," Bratton said.  </P> <P> For the record, Bratton said the Hurricanes couldn't help running up the score,  so bad were the Irish that year.  </P> <P> Holtz and Miami Coach Dennis Erickson vowed that there would be no more fights.  The last game between the Irish and the Hurricanes, they said, will also be the  cleanest. Or so they say.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to be fine," Holtz said.  </P> <P> "We're going there to play a game," Erickson said in his weekly news  conference. "(Fighting is) something of the past, and you won't see it."  </P> <P> One other thing you won't see: a rematch.  </P></p>

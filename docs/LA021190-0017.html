			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: CELEBRATING THE GASTRONOMIC LIFE  </P> <P> Jack Hennessy always comes up with an opener for the Confrerie des Chevaliers  du Tastevin white-tie dinner. This year, le grand senechal said, "Bless this  dinner in which we share a delectable cuisine beyond compare." He also  implored, "May the bubbles, the whites and burgundy reds enliven our hearts,  not lighten our heads."  </P> <P> Jerry Magnin, owner of Ralph Lauren in Beverly Hills, chaired the festivities  at the Beverly Wilshire, home of the late hotelier Hernando Courtright, a  Chevaliers founder. Before dinner, Magnin and William L. Martin II (l'officier  cellier of Chevaliers) inspected the wines to be served. Grand Connetable  Louis-Marc Chevignard flew in from France for the occasion to oversee with  Thomas W. Trainer (la commanderie d'Amerique) and John H. Hadley and Hubert F.  Laugharn Jr. (la sous commanderie le Los Angeles) the grand inductions of les  candidats Robert C. Boffa, Lee Danielson, Peter J. Doumani, Clifford A. Miller,  Peter W. Mullin and Nelson C. Rising. They swore "to lead a good gastronomic  life."  </P> <P> For the night, cares were shrugged off in favor of the grape vine. Having a  jolly time in La-La Land were many, including Hadley and his wife Barbara,  honored for 33 years of leadership in the group. Cheering him -- Roger and  Billie Converse, Z. Wayne and Cynthia Griffin (down from Sun Valley) and  Chevaliers Jon Masterson, John Maher, Henry Singleton, Donald Crowell, Stephen  Griffith, Desmond Hinds and Daniel Ridder.  </P> <P> MILE HIGH: Bill Shoemaker stood a mile high for the tributes Santa Anita Park  bestowed the night before "The Legend's Last Ride." Santa Anita chairman Robert  Strub called the evening "a once-in-a-lifetime occasion" and spent a pretty  penny to honor the Shoe.  </P> <P> What made it nice were all the tender kisses wife Cindy bestowed on her husband  and the quips from Amanda, their 9-year-old daughter, who was one of the stars  on the Ralph Edwards' "This Is Your Life" production put on at the affair for  Shoemaker. Amanda appeared on stage in racing colors and broke up the audience  when she commented, "When my mother and I go shopping for my dad, she always  tells them he's 4 feet, 11 inches, but he's well-built in the shoulders."  </P> <P> Friends of Robert and Betty Strub and some greats of racing -- trainer Charlie  Whittingham, jockey Johnny Longden, Dr. Robert Kerlan -- sparked the night  along with videos of the great scenes of racing. Applauding were Frank and  Margarita Kanne, and Felix and Barbara McGinnis, among others.  </P> <P> VITAL NEEDS: Many of the city's most prominent Catholic families turned out for  Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's award dinner at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.  </P> <P> Anne Kenney chaired the award committee and Pamela Mullin the dinner. Honored  were long-time philanthropists Sir Daniel Donohue, Mrs. G. Allan (Marian)  Hancock, William Hayden, Mrs. Thomas (Dorothy) Leavey and Cyril Nigg. Hancock  and Hayden were unable to attend.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the affair will go to DARE (the LAPD's Drug Abuse Resistance  Education) in Catholic Schools and for aid to archdiocesan homeless shelters --  the Long Beach Family Shelter, the Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women and  the St. Vincent de Paul Men's Center.  </P> <P> It was a night that called for the Los Angeles Police Department Honor Guard,  the Pledge of Allegiance by L.A.

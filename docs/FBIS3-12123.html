Beaubrun said: Bayonets lay down the law, which is what we are  experiencing today. He denounces the behavior of everyone  involved in the current crisis:    [Begin Deaubrun recording, in Creole] First of all, to  return  to a constitutional framework, we should first [last word in  English] resolve the Haitian crisis. Nothing can be accomplished  in a crisis situation. In a crisis situation, it is normal for  bayonets to lay down the law, while the Constitution goes  unheeded [bayonet se fe; konstitisyon se papye]. When we say  bayonets lay down the law, we see bayonets in the hands of  Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the international community when it  uses embargo, when it uses blockade, when it uses pressure, and  when it uses threats. All these things are bayonets. We also see  bayonets in the hands of the Haitian Army when it represses...  [pauses] I will not say repress because the word repress is not  appropriate, when the Haitian Army oppresses, when it randomly  destroys, arresting people arbitrarily, abnormally,  anarchically. Then bayonets lay down the law, while the  Constitution goes unheeded." [end recording]    Beaubrun invited the senators to show their patriotism by  disentangling the crisis. He revealed that the Chamber of  Deputies would soon be looking into the crisis in the Senate  because Senator Sansaricq sent a letter to the office of the  lower chamber mentioning sanctions that are being considered by  the unofficial office [of the Senate] against the senators who  are chronically absent.</p>

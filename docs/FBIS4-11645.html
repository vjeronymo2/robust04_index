			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "BABIL's </F> Admonitions"]    [Text] For the second time in less than two months, the  Iraqi daily BABIL, whose board chairman is 'Udayy Saddam Husayn,  has criticized Iraq's foreign policy, contending that  decisionmakers "have given the United Nations and the West  everything but got nothing in return."    Aware that the Iraqi press is state-controlled, foreign  observers are speculating that BABIL's admonitions may signal an  imminent shakeup in the Iraqi diplomatic community that may see  the country's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and Foreign  Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf lose their jobs.    BABIL's views and commentaries are not necessarily those of  the decisionmakers in Iraq. It must be pointed out, however,  that Iraq's foreign policy, and that of all nations, for that  matter, is a reflection of its internal politics, all the more  so in the absence of a pluralistic political system of  government or a state within a state.    Out of our concern for Iraq, we will venture to say that  BABIL's criticisms are not well founded. It does not make sense  to single out one party for criticism and lay the blame for the  failure to get the sanctions lifted at the doorstep of Iraq's  foreign policy makers. It is not so much the preformance of  this or that Iraqi diplomat that will get the job done. It has  more to do with Iraq's overall policies, administered by a  well-known leader.    To be fair, there is much to be said for the way the  diplomatic team led by Tariq 'Aziz conducted itself at the  height of the Kuwait crisis. Even hostile Western circles will  go along with that evaluation. At the United Nations,  'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari did a wonderful job that few, in his  place, could match. The same could be said for 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Hashimi, who steered a successful media effort from Paris  under unfavorable circumstances and an unequal balance of forces.    Even Henry Kissinger, renowned for his feats on the  diplomatic battlefront, could not have outperformed Tariq 'Aziz,  Nizar Hamdun, or al-Sahhaf. The diplomatic team of any nation  with circumstances similar to those of Iraq would probably do no  better.    In the kind of circumstances -- a bottleneck -- Iraq is  going  through, such brilliant diplomats should be retained, not fired.  Iraq has had more than its share of exhaustion and bloodletting  over the last three decades.    It is more than likely that BABIL's admonitions to the  directors of Iraq's foreign policy are not inspired by the  country's top leadership, but are the opinion of their authors.  If, indeed, they are inspired from above, then Iraq is in for a  big loss that it can ill afford in these particularly hard and  critical times.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / RTZ goes west for a foothold in US coal mines: Nerco acquisition offers UK group prospects for long-term growth Coal mining is unglamorous and to the uninitiated investor seems environmentally unfriendly. And it does not look like perfect timing to move into coal mining in the US just after Bill Clinton has been elected president - with a new energy tax and promises to clamp down more firmly on environment-damaging operations. Nevertheless, that is what RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, is doing. It is making a Dollars 1.16bn (Pounds 810m) entry into US coal mining with the proposed acquisition of Nerco, the floundering natural resources company. The stock market was perturbed by this diversification and marked RTZ's shares down. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, says: 'It looks like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But should anyone be buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably high-quality coal?' According to Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, the answer is a resounding: Yes. His company has been looking for opportunities for some time and towards the end of last year offered to buy Nerco's coal business after the US company's third-quarter results showed it was financially stressed. RTZ was rebuffed then but now is back with an agreed offer for all of Nerco. The US company will be split up: RTZ will sell Nerco's oil and gas operations and probably its gold and silver mines too but will keep the profitable coal business and merge it with its Kennecott subsidiary in the US. It hopes to build on that base with more coal acquisitions. 'This is the first step for establishing a new high-quality business for RTZ in the States,' says Mr Wilson. RTZ is not the only UK company to hunt for US coal. In 1989 Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, took over Consolidated Gold Fields which brought with it a 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining, which in turn owned about one third of Peabody, the second-largest US coal producer. Hanson was expected to sell that stake but instead spent Dollars 715m to take full control of Peabody and it became a core business destined for expansion. Coal is now Hanson's fastest-growing business and accounts for more than 30 per cent of the group's capital employed. So what makes US coal so attractive? According to Mr Wilson, it offers long-term, if modest, growth prospects. Before Mr Clinton's election the consensus was that electricity consumption in the US would grow by 1.7 per cent to 2 per cent a year and that would provide 2 per cent growth for coal used by the utilities. Mr Wilson suggests there will also be important changes within coal demand as the US clean air legislation bites deeper during the rest of this decade. Coal with a high sulphur content from Illinois and the Appalachian Mountains is expected to be displaced by low-sulphur coal from the Powder River Basin which straddles Montana and Wyoming. 'So low-sulphur coal demand could grow at better than 2 per cent a year for a long time to come,' says Mr Wilson. Nerco gives RTZ two open pit, steam coal mines in the Powder River Basin and a half share in a third. Nerco's share of production was 16.6m tonnes last year and its share of reserves is 580m tonnes. More than 60 per cent of production from these mines is secured by long-term contracts, 95 per cent of the contracts run into the next century. Mr Wilson says the mines 'are about the lowest-cost in the world', with coal typically costing only Dollars 4 a tonne to mine. This is because the deposits are thick and very little waste has to be removed before it can be extracted by cheap, open-pit methods. The snag is that Powder River coal has to be transported by high-cost railways up to 1,200 miles to reach customers. Also, Powder River coal might be 'clean' but it usually contains only a moderate amount of energy compared with Appalachian material. Nevertheless, the acquisition fits in with RTZ's philosophy of wanting a portfolio of wholly-owned, world-class, long-life, low-cost mining assets. Neither is President Clinton's proposed energy tax much of a setback. Mr Wilson says this came as no surprise to RTZ. According to the group's analysis, the proposed tax would be less damaging to the coal business than a carbon tax, will hit oil's competitiveness most of all but favours gas against coal. Via its 49 per cent-owned subsidiary, CRA, RTZ has interests in coal in Australia and Indonesia, 'so the business is familiar to us both technically and commercially'. Some time ago RTZ decided to add a wholly-owned coal operation to its core businesses which already include copper, aluminium, gold, titanium, borax and iron ore. It started in the US 'because it is the biggest market for coal'. Mr Wilson says there might be opportunities to add to its Powder River Basin reserves because Nerco owns only about 9 per cent of the reserves in the area and there is no dominant producer. RTZ might well benefit from this fragmentation, particularly as some of the reserves are owned by oil companies which seem to want to move out of the coal. Also, 'market forces are pushing for rationalisation because it is an over-supplied market'. Over-capacity is keeping coal prices in the spot market low but Mr Wilson suggests they are unlikely to go much lower. RTZ will also look for opportunities to buy into the internationally-traded coal business or add some value by putting some international coal trading companies together. Analysts suggest that the Nerco deal seems a good one for RTZ. Mr Geoff Campbell, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says that, while it is difficult to estimate, RTZ seems to be paying only Dollars 1 a tonne for Nerco's coal. He says: 'The sector is out of favour at present and not subject to the inflated values seen in some of the base metals sectors.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 13 KYODO -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korea to accept inspections  on a key atomic site that Pyongyang barred the agency from  checking last month, an agency spokesman said Wednesday [13  April].    The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog, however, has not  received any response from the country so far, the spokesman  said.    Besides additional inspections on the radiochemical  laboratory in the Yongbyong nuclear complex, north of the  capital, the IAEA has also demanded North Korea allow the agency  to change film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed  at nuclear facilities there, the spokesman said.    Last month, a six-member IAEA team conducted inspections on  North Korea's seven-declared nuclear sites to check that no  radioactive material had been diverted from the plants for  military purposes.    But Pyongyang refused the team access to the laboratory,  thus  prompting the agency to refer the issue to the UN Security  Council.    The council issued a nonbinding presidential statement March  31 urging North Korea to grant full inspections on its nuclear  facilities.    The communist country has denied it is developing a nuclear  arsenal and warned that a war could break out on the Korean  peninsula if it was pressed too hard on the matter.</p>

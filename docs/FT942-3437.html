			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Killings raise fears of Kurdish violence The killing of at least 12 people during a funeral procession in northern Iraq has raised fears of new violence between rival Kurdish groups, threatening a 10-day-old ceasefire, disrupting vital aid efforts, and raising doubts about the durability of the self-administered Kurdish region. Monday's incident in Suleimaniya near the Iranian border occurred as rival leaders - Mr Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Mr Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) - were meeting under Turkish auspices to review the tentative ceasefire to end a month of clashes leading to 300 deaths. The killings, at a funeral of a KDP militiaman, could hardly be worse-timed for the nascent Kurdish leadership, striving to preserve its power-sharing experiment. The violence comes as Turkey's parliament is due to debate the mandate for Operation Provide Comfort, the Turkish-based allied air operation set up to protect the Kurds. The clash coincides with renewed UN efforts to win donor-support for relief efforts in Iraq. The Kurdish zone is a legacy of the safe havens set up by the allies in 1991 to repatriate some 500,000 civilians who had fled to Turkey and Iran in the wake of Saddam Hussein's onslaught. Since May, the UN estimates 25,000 people have been displaced by the fighting between rival militia. The haven is now in effect partitioned, with the KDP dominating the northern area along the Turkish border; the PUK controls the southern area centred on Suleimaniya. Aid workers have warned the Kurdish leadership they may have to curtail the operation unless security improves. The Germans have suspended aid operations. Earlier, Mr Mohammed Zejjari, UN co-ordinator for Iraq, said he planned to call a meeting to win new aid pledges under the Dollars 280m (Pounds 186m) requested in this year's programme. Only a few million dollars have been provided.</p>

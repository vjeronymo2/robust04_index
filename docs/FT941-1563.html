			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trizec given warning by senior debt holders Senior debenture holders of Trizec, the biggest property company in the Edper-Hees group, have warned they will move quickly to take control if agreement on recapitalisation is not reached by March 31. Mr Derek Tay, spokesman for the debenture holders, said Trizec's proposal to negotiate a CDollars 600m (USDollars 429m) third-party equity infusion by March 31 'does not look promising as a solution, based on what they have shown us'. Senior debtholders are owed CDollars 1.2bn. If they quickly seized assets after March 31, junior debt holders and preferred and common shareholders would probably end up with nothing. Trizec, hit by the property market collapse in North America, and with insufficient cashflow to service debt, said its primary aim was to have a recapitalisation plan accepted so the company could survive intact. Abitibi-Price, the North American pulp and paper group, plans to raise CDollars 173.5m of new equity next month with a public issue of common stock at Dollars 17.35 a share. The proceeds will be used for capital projects, debt refinancing and working capital.</p>

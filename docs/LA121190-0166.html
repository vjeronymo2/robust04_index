			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE GAMES  </P> <P> Tom Watson is praising the Kansas City Country Club's decision to invite Henry  Bloch to become a member but won't say whether he intends to rejoin the club.  </P> <P> The golf pro resigned from the 94-year-old private club Nov. 28 when he learned  the club's membership committee rejected an application by Bloch, who is  Jewish. Watson's wife and two children are Jewish. He is not. The club's board  of directors announced last week that if Bloch re-submitted an application it  "will be acted upon favorably."  </P></p>

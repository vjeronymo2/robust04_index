			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGHER HORSE STALL RENTS APPROVED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks on Monday approved a  controversial boost in the rental rates for horse stalls at the debt-ridden Los  Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith Park.  </P> <P> The increases, which board members said are needed to help ease the center's  financial burdens, will be as high as $36 a month for some stalls and are  effective immediately.  </P> <P> Some horse boarders had opposed the increases, saying they were being "priced  out" of the center and were being unfairly singled out to help the facility  become profitable. However, just before the board's vote, many boarders said  they favor the increase as long as the center continues operating.  </P></p>

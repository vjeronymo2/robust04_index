			<p>CSO     [Text] The property sector will continue to be the first  choice of investors throughout 1994 because of the various land  and building development projects now being implemented and the  large number of projects scheduled for this year. Several  market analysts predict that spending in the land and building  sector in Malaysia will remain high and that construction will  continue to experience rapid double-digit growth over the next  three years.    One analyst said that construction of the Kuala Lumpur  International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang alone will cost 8 billion  ringgit. The giant project will spawn many construction  contracts worth more than any in the past.    The analyst listed IJM Corp. Bhd. [Limited], Pelecon  Engineering Bhd., Sungei Way Holdings Bhd., and United Engineers  Malaysia Bhd. as the three construction companies best prepared  to compete for the contracts. He said the selection of a  company will be based on the company's capabilities as shown by  previous accomplishments, financial and management performance,  and preparedness from the aspect of capital and skills.    Another analyst said that the property "counter" will  continue to have bright prospects for investment portfolios  because the industry will be affected by a positive synergism.    He said current factors consist of six principal projects  now  under way: a series of roads worth 1 billion ringgit in the  Kuala Lumpur area, roads and highways in the eastern part of the  Peninsula (500 million ringgit), Tenaga Nasional [National  Power] Bhd. electric power plant and transmission cable projects  (11 billion ringgit), a Telekom Malaysia Bhd. project (8 billion  ringgit), a water supply project (2 billion ringgit), a twin  runway project, and KTM [Malayan Railways] Bhd. electric trains  (1.2 billion ringgit).</p>

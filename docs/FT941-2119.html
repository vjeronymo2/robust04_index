			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas downgraded Aerospace and motor components group Lucas Industries surrendered 10 to 209p, in healthy volume of 6.5m, after several brokers downgraded full-year profit expectations following the release of interim figures. Brokers said earlier predictions had been over-ambitious and several analysts said the company was a little too optimistic about the short-term recovery prospects, though prospects for the long term remained good. Dealers also said the improvement in profits had been discounted. Brokers downgrading included BZW, which reduced its forecast by Pounds 13m to Pounds 72m, and Panmure Gordon, which trimmed its figure by Pounds 11m to Pounds 75m. Mr Harry Philips at the Panmure said: 'Trading conditions remain difficult, but I remain positive particularly about the year to July 1996.' However, NatWest Securities was more positive and it upgraded its current year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 80m.</p>

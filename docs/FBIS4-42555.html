			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  PCP Views </H5>   The Lisbon daily PUBLICO reported on 8 May that there are no  prospects for an alliance between the PCP and the Socialist  Party (PS) for the 1995 legislative elections. Luis Sa, member  of the Communist Party (PCP) political commission and leader of  the party's list for the European Parliament elections, stated  at a meeting in Funchal that PS views are generally too close to  those held by the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). Only  if the PS were to adopt new policies to differentiate itself  from the government would the PCP consider a rapprochement. Sa  added that joint lists had never been advocated for legislative  elections but only for the Lisbon mayoral race, where the  election of a leftist mayor depends on forming a a PS-PCP bloc.  Responding to a question on eventual PCP support for Lisbon  Mayor Jorge Sampaio in a presidential race, Sa said it is still  "too early" to discuss the issue, which could only be considered  after the PS reaches a decision on a particular candidate.  <H5>  PS Views </H5>   According to the 13 May issue of PUBLICO, PS officials also  continue to affirm their party's "strategic autonomy" and reject  an alliance with the PCP. The report speculates that the PS  officials' statement may be related to recent poll results  showing that an alliance with the PCP would boost the PS's  percentages by only "1 or 2" percentage points.</p>

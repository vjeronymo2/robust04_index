			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY: HIGHLY AMBITIOUS 'STRAIGHT ARROW' WITH AN INTELLECTUAL BENT  </P> <P> President Bush could not have found anyone more distinctly different from John  Tower than Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.) in his search for a new nominee as defense  secretary.  </P> <P> Not only is Cheney a man with a squeaky-clean reputation, but unlike Tower --  who spent his entire political career anticipating that he would someday run  the Pentagon -- the Wyoming congressman apparently never considered that  possibility until he received a telephone call Thursday from the White House.  </P> <P> A soft-spoken, intensely ambitious man with an intellectual bent, Cheney, 48,  who serves as assistant House minority leader, by all accounts has been on a  fast track in recent years toward becoming minority leader -- and perhaps even  Speaker, if the Republicans could reclaim control of the House within the next  decade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never in Service  </P> <P> Although he has served for five years on the House intelligence committee and  was a leading light on the 1987 Iran-Contra investigating committee, Cheney has  never been closely identified with Pentagon issues. Nor did he ever serve in  the armed services.  </P> <P> His only genuine involvement with military affairs -- other than his House  votes on defense bills -- was his presence at National Security Council  meetings during his tenure as White House chief of staff during 1975 and 1976  under President Gerald R. Ford.  </P> <P> Elected to the House in 1978 after Ford's defeat, Cheney also has a more  conservative reputation than Tower and is viewed as a leader of the staunch  right-wing faction in the House. In fact, his voting record has won him 100%  ratings with the American Conservative Union and 0% ratings from the liberal  Americans for Democratic Action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reason to Worry  </P> <P> As far as Cheney's personal life is concerned, Bush has no reason to worry that  the Senate will uncover any evidence of drinking or womanizing, as it did with  Tower. In fact, many of his House colleagues use the same term to describe him:  "straight arrow."  </P> <P> According to Bush, Cheney also has weathered intensive FBI investigations into  his background before two other government appointments in the last 20 years.  </P> <P> Cheney is a Methodist and a family man with two daughters. And when it comes to  the question of whether he supports equal opportunity for women, the Senate  needs only to look at his wife, Lynne, who heads the National Endowment for the  Humanities. According to an aide, it was his family responsibilities that kept  him out of the military in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, given his House record, Cheney has few ties to the defense  industry. In six elections to the House, he has gathered more than $700,000 in  contributions from political action committees, $104,000 of it from defense  concerns. The biggest defense contributor is a Chicago-based company, FMC, that  contributed $15,000.  </P> <P> While he is known as one of the major beneficiaries in Congress of speaking  fees and honorariums from special interest groups, which added $107,937 to his  income over the last five years, none of his fees in the last reporting year of  1987 was derived from defense groups.  </P> <P> Despite Cheney's lack of experience in defense issues, he is known as a quick  study and a thoughtful man. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from  the University of Wyoming, and has finished all of the requirements for his  doctorate except his thesis. In addition, he and his wife have co-authored one  book, "Kings of the Hill," a study of the office of House Speaker.  </P> <P> The one question that is most frequently raised by his detractors is whether  Cheney, a native of Lincoln, Neb., is a true Westerner, as he frequently  portrays himself. Although he always wears cowboy boots -- even with tuxedos --  most Washingtonians consider Cheney one of them. Some of his political  opponents in Wyoming have even branded him a carpetbagger.  </P> <P> After government internships in Wyoming and Wisconsin in the mid-1960s, Cheney  served in various federal posts in Washington from 1969 until 1973 under  President Richard M. Nixon, stayed in Washington to work for an investment  advisory firm in 1973 and 1974 and did not return to Wyoming until after Ford  left office in 1977.  </P> <P> Conservatives also view him as a recent convert to their point of view. He  began his career in Washington as an aide to then-Rep. Donald H. Rumsfeld  (R-Ill.), a moderate, and succeeded Rumsfeld as White House chief of staff when  his mentor became defense secretary.  </P> <P> But none of his acquaintances would dispute that Cheney is ambitious. Despite  three heart attacks and a quadruple heart bypass operation last year, he works  long hours at his job as assistant minority leader, to which he was elected  last December.  </P> <P> At a White House news conference announcing his nomination, Cheney told  reporters that he had expected to remain in the House for the bulk of his  political career and he expressed the view that Republicans will control the  chamber in the near future. The GOP has been in the minority in the House since  the 1950s.  </P> <P> Although becoming defense secretary will eliminate the possibility that Cheney  might someday be Speaker, it could mean that he has refocused his sights on a  different leadership position and one more easily accessible to a Republican:  the presidency.  </P> <P> "It makes a lot of sense," a House acquaintance said. "He doesn't come off as  ambitious because of his calm demeanor, but I think running for President is  where his ambitions have always been."  </P> <P> Staff writers Paul Houston and William J. Eaton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

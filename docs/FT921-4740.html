			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Cleaning up on the high seas - A businessman who has always been sensitive to the environment PAUL DE LA PENA's experience may be typical of the British small businessman. 'All my working life we've been in a boom or a recession,' he says. Chairman and owner of the company that bears his name, de la Pena's response has been atypical. Rather than dash for growth which becomes contraction a year or two later, his dlP Group has looked for areas that will give it 10 to 15 years' solid expansion in its field of industrial oils and allied services. The company employs 52, with a Pounds 3.8m turnover in 1991. Since 1960 de la Pena, who is 61, has had to refocus it into new areas three times. Its latest production venture is penaMarine: environmentally-friendly cleaning and maintenance fluids for international shipping; everything a modern merchant ship needs to keep its decks, bilges and tanks gleaming. A successful spin-off has been an identical product, consumer-packaged for the environmentally-conscious leisure boat-user, launched recently at the London Boat Show. With the world's oceans increasingly patrolled by groups such as Friends of the Earth, Rod Wood, dlP's managing director, says that chucking chemicals over the side of a ship is a vanishing practice. Companies such as BP and Shell will now only buy 'green' products for shipboard use. The key to de la Pena's products is the absence of any petrochemical element. The solvent is a substance called dilimonene, found abundantly in citrus waste from oranges, lemons and grapefruit which have been crushed for their juice. (It even smells naturally nice.) 'In my last year at university we had environmental chemistry,' says Wood. 'That was in 1971, and until about 18 months ago no one had done anything with knowledge which had been around for 20 years. The science was there, but it had to wait for opinion to come round and create a market.' Paul de la Pena, son of a Cheltenham engineering family, was an environmentalist before the phrase existed. 'The workshop environment was awful when I served my apprenticeship,' he says. 'Floors black and slippy, globules of oil on the beams. I could never understand why offices which didn't need cleaning were cleaned every night, but never the machine shops.' When the early 1960s slump hit sales of the machine tools he was importing from Italy, de la Pena decided that selling consumables such as cutting fluids was more sensible. When the norm in UK industry was still neat oil costing three shillings a gallon, de la Pena began importing a US emulsified product, easily cleaned, at 27 shillings. 'Buyers would invite me in just to see if this twit had two heads,' he recalls. 'I used to pour the oil on to my suit in front of the boss, just to show what it could do for cleanliness. In a small way we spearheaded the change, making the machine shop as clean and effective as the boardroom.' The oil sold well, but being a 'niche' player was tough going against the resources of, say, Castrol or Mobil. By the late 1960s de la Pena was thinking about the possibilities of recycling oil from machine sumps. The upshot was a rugged industrial vacuum cleaner, brand-named Freddie. Rod Wood says: 'Every blue-chip engineering company now uses a Freddie; it's become a mature market, although exports are growing well,' The company concedes that, from a strictly commercial perspective, the powerful, ugly Freddie is perhaps over-engineered. 'The philosophy of the company is to build a long-life product that can stand being rammed by a fork-lift truck and come out alive,' adds Wood. 'We only come this way once. Whatever we make has got to last,' says de la Pena. The Freddies cost slightly over Pounds 3,000 per unit. Last year the group sold about 100 in the UK, with a further 138 exported - primarily to France and Germany but with the US market growing quickly. Hard work could maintain volume, but the specialist oils business seemed to have little room for growth. In 1991 the de la Pena group identified the marine cleanser market, when two other companies bowed out, leaving the field clear for an intended worldwide duopoly between Unitor and Drew, the giant chemicals companies. 'We have the technology already; it's a question of distribution and specialising. The worldwide market is worth Pounds 40m a year, and we are looking for about Pounds 10m of that within a couple of years,' says Wood. He expects to see a 1992 turnover of about Pounds 700,000 for penaMarine - from zero six months ago. 'It takes time to gain credibility with the major owners, but we're being asked to tender for some big contracts. We're already a credible alternative to the two huge suppliers.' On the wall of the group's main factory in Pershore, Worcestershire, is a motto put there by Paul de la Pena 20 years ago: 'Today's guardian of Tomorrow's world.' 'I'm really excited by penaMarine,' he says. 'The real advantage of starting with nothing is that you've got nothing to lose.' de la Pena Group, Racecourse Road, Pershore, Worcester.

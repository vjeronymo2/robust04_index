			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Israeli markets tax to go ahead Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday said a controversial capital gains tax would go ahead on January 1 as planned. The statement put an end to a cabinet row over the proposed measure and settled more than a week of uncertainty. It would mean Israeli investors would have to pay tax of 10 or 20 per cent on stock market profits, depending on whether they wanted to deduct their losses. The option with deductions would be assessed at 20 per cent of net profits and would require investors to file year-end tax reports. The option without deductions would be assessed at 10 per cent and would be deducted at source. Mr Rabin made the announcement after meeting Mr Abraham Shochat, the finance minister, who has spent the last week fending off fierce criticism of the tax from other ministers. Opponents maintained the proposals had hit support for Mr Rabin's Labour party.</p>

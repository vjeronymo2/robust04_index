			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Worries hit life insurers Life assurance companies were given a drubbing by marketmakers anxious to head off any attempted large selling of the sector ahead of a Securities and Investments Board report on pensions selling, expected later this month. Stories circulating in the market suggested that compensation to policyholders could amount to Pounds 2bn, well ahead of previous estimates of Pounds 500m. Life assurance specialists pointed out that it would be the unit-linked companies which would be affected by the increased compensation news. These include Lloyd Abbey Life, whose shares dropped to 334p before settling a net 10 off at 338p, and Allied Dunbar, a subsidiary of Bats. Prudential were 12 lower at 307p. Legal &amp; General, whose shares were lifted recently by vague takeover stories, dipped 11 to 451p and London &amp; Manchester lost 5 to 336p.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAT ROBERTSON STEPS UP NEA BROADSIDES;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: AS THE HOUSE NEARS A COMPROMISE ON RENEWING THE ARTS AGENCY, THE  TELEVANGELIST INCREASES HIS ACCUSATIONS OF NEA INVOLVEMENT IN AN ADULTS-ONLY  PUPPET SHOW.  </P> <P> As House leaders moved Thursday toward a resolution of the protracted National  Endowment for the Arts controversy, TV minister Pat Robertson has tried this  week to reinvigorate the conservative assault on the embattled federal agency.  </P> <P> On Wednesday Robertson blanketed members of Congress with letters urging an end  to federal support of "obscenity, pornography and attacks on religion," and, on  Thursday, the Virginia minister took to his electronic pulpit to tell his TV  viewers that Congress is out of step with the public on the NEA issue.  </P> <P> Robertson, who sought the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination, has been one  of the NEA's most consistent attackers, both on his "700 Club" television  program and in newspaper advertisements.  </P> <P> His latest broadsides have centered on an Atlanta puppet show last month that,  he charged, featured simulated oral sex and may have been supported by the NEA.  The charges have come as the House of Representatives is preparing for a  crucial floor vote next week to renew NEA funding for another three years.  </P> <P> Prospects for a Senate vote soon, however, are far less certain.  </P> <P> Key House leaders Pat Williams (D-Mont.) and Tom Coleman (R-Wis.) on Thursday  unveiled an NEA compromise that contains no restrictions on the kinds of art  the NEA can support and over time transfers 35% of NEA money to state arts  councils -- up from 20% now -- but far less than the 60% that Coleman once  urged.  </P> <P> The Williams-Coleman compromise allows the NEA to take back money it gives in  grants for work later judged obscene by a court and bars endowment support of  work that qualifies as obscene under existing U.S. Supreme Court decisions. It  calls on the NEA to consider "general standards of decency and respect for the  diverse beliefs and values of the American public" in making grants.  </P> <P> But Robertson would like to see Congress abolish the agency altogether. Ralph  Reed, executive director of Robertson's Christian Coalition, said Robertson's  letters and Thursday TV appearance were a coordinated effort to try to wipe out  support for the arts endowment in the House and Senate. "The NEA is going to  find its support on Capitol Hill is really crumbling, especially against the  background of the budget crisis," Reed said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> "If Congress votes for this, they're out of touch with America," Robertson told  his viewers Thursday. "There shouldn't be one (tax) dollar spent on oral sex in  a puppet show."  </P> <P> NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer -- apparently concerned that Robertson's puppet  show crusade has begun to gain political momentum -- held an Atlanta press  conference Thursday where he demanded that Robertson "apologize to Congress and  the people of Atlanta" for distorting the NEA's role in the puppet show.  </P> <P> "I believe the time has come for fairness," Frohnmayer said. "I believe the  time has come for honesty and for truth."  </P> <P> Frohnmayer has publicly accused the evangelist of misrepresenting the NEA and  its grants, and once demanded -- and got -- equal time on the Robertson show to  rebut the charges.  </P> <P> The puppet show episode grew out of a Sept. 21 performance at the Arts Festival  of Atlanta by puppeteer Jon Ludwig, who is associated with Atlanta's Center for  Puppetry Arts. The center received more than $132,000 in NEA support last year.  The NEA also gives money to the Georgia Council for the Arts, which gave the  festival some state funds. But documents produced by the NEA and the festival  this week appeared to show that there was no direct link between NEA support  and the controversial show, titled "Zeitgeist."  </P> <P> The controversy arose after a local Methodist minister, the Rev. John Norton,  complained to festival officials that some children slipped past security  officers and attended the performance, which was labeled adults-only. Norton  distanced himself from Robertson's use of the dispute to reignite the larger  NEA controversy.  </P> <P> "I'm a strong fan of the arts and sorely regret that the arts in Atlanta got a  black eye," Norton told The Times. "Others have attempted to use this incident  as a forum. These same persons and groups have attempted to bring all of this  into a national issue that will soon be brought before Congress. It was never  my intent that this become a forum for (Robertson's) issue."  </P> <P> Frohnmayer accused Robertson of practicing "guilt by association" and contended  the NEA had faxed Robertson background materials on the extent of NEA  involvement in the puppet show before Thursday morning's broadcast, but that  Robertson ignored them.  </P> <P> Even Robertson appeared in his television broadcast to back away from the  direct charge that NEA money had been involved in the puppet show. "I wasn't  there. I didn't see (the show)," Robertson said. "Now, the minister (Norton) is  backing away from it (Robertson's allegations of an NEA link.)" In a video  report, a "700 Club" announcer also acknowledged denials that federal money was  directly involved. "That may be so," the soundtrack said.  </P> <P> Times Atlanta bureau researcher Edith Stanley assisted in the reporting of this  article.  </P></p>

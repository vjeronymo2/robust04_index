			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 14 Jan (EFE) --  Despite the Mexican Army's unilateral cease-fire in Chiapas and  the apparent peace that prevails in that southern Mexican state,  today the press reported sporadic clashes in Lacandona where  rebel groups are hiding.    After the Mexican Army's offensive during the first days of  the armed uprising that began on 1 January, members of the  Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) retreated to the  jungle areas near San Cristobal de las Casas, from where they  direct their attacks.    On Wednesday [12 January] Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de  Gortari ordered the Armed Forces to observe a cease-fire against  the "transgressors of the law" (as the government describes the  rebels) and since then official reports maintain there is  absolute peace in that area.    The Mexican press, however, reported on today's front page  that some isolated groups of soldiers have clashed with rebels  on Wednesday and Thursday without specifying which side fired  first.    The daily LA JORNADA reported that a group of soldiers  clashed with presumed guerrillas in the Lacandona jungle area, a  few kilometers from the Indian village of San Miguel.    "There is no truce, no cease-fire in the Chiapas jungles,"  the report said. "We were stopped by recurrent detonations that  sounded like a pistol discharging all of its ammunition. Those  detonations were followed by synchronized machinegun fire. We  heard heavy shooting from tanks. For 10 minutes, the shooting  made the jungle birds fly away, while we waited in Chuvi," LA  JORNADA journalists reported.    The report added that a dozen tanks entered the towns of San  Miguel, Patate Viejo, and Chivi on Thursday "attacking EZLN  rebels," and that helicopters and reconnaissance planes  participated in the attack.    Apparently the announcement of the unilateral cease-fire has  not reached the soldiers, who are still searching for rebels in  the jungles of Lacandona -- considered the "lungs of Mexico" --  and probably it has not reached the Zapatists dispersed in the  mountains either.    Regarding this, it is being said this is why the EZLN  General  Command has not responded to the government's invitation to hold  peace talks, which is creating a tense and long wait for  authorities.    Civilian sources from the town of Altamirano, which was  taken  by the rebels on 1 January, said the soldiers, who were deployed  there to prevent more rebels attacks, maintain it in a "virtual  state of siege. They do not allow us to go out to work in the  fields or visit relatives in other villages; they supervise the  distribution of food and supplies and oversee the activities of  all residents of Altamirano as if we were suspects," one of the  residents said.    The National Defense Secretariat reported the situation in  the mountainous and jungle region in Los Altos de Chiapas  "remains completely calm." It added that during the patrols  ordered by the Army to guarantee peace in the region and the  security of the local residents "no armed group was discovered"  in the last 24 hours.    Most radio, television, and newspaper media, relying on  official reports, maintain that peace reigns in the area and  that the dialogue between the government and the rebels will be  held soon.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> 11 YEARS OF SHOVING HARVARD UPHILL  </P> <P> The University, an Owner's Manual by Henry Rosovsky (W.W. Norton: $19.95; 299  pages.)  </P> <P> At the end of the '70s, when Harvard University launched a drive to  substantially increase its already massive endowment, all the stops were pulled  out. There was a twisting of alumni arms on a scale never seen before. Among  the really high-torque operatives was Henry Rosovsky, dean of the faculty of  arts and sciences and the university's chief academic administrator.  </P> <P> An early arm was that of John L. Loeb, a prominent New York financier and  philanthropist. For the occasion, President Derek Bok came along; Loeb treated  them to hamburgers at the Four Seasons. It was gastronomic Harvardry --  provident chic, that is, like using a worn Vuitton bag to carry your cheese  sandwich. In his memoir, "The University," Rosovsky recalls:  </P> <P> "As the conversation gently evolved towards specific dollar amounts, our host  inquired: 'Are you asking me for $5 million?' I replied: 'Not quite, sir. My  hope is that you will agree to give $10 million, so that others would be  inspired to give $5 million.'  </P> <P> "Henry," Loeb said, darkening, "that comes close to chutzpah." Abruptly, he  asked whether Rosovsky knew how to spell the word. (One thing you get in  exchange for multimillion benefactions is the right to grill a Harvard dean on  his spelling.)  </P> <P> But if knowledge is power, then it was time for No. 1 to strut his stuff.  "Suddenly, the president of Harvard University snatched the napkin from my  hands," Rosovsky continues, "and printed CHUTZPAH in large block letters on the  paper and gave it to Mr. Loeb."  </P> <P> A few days later, Loeb sent word he was good for about $9 million. "We had  established that the value of chutzpah is approximately $4 million," the writer  concludes.  </P> <P> It is witty, urbane, a touch cool, a touch smug, a touch fierce, and it ends  with an academic flourish in Prof. Rosovsky's own field: economics. And  underneath there is a winning glee in the entire operation and, above all, in  telling of it.  </P> <P> These are the marks of Rosovsky's engaging account of 11 years spent shoving  Harvard uphill. It's hard to do when your shov-ee hasn't the least doubt that  it already is on top. In general, Rosovsky thinks so too, but he gives us an  account of the diplomacy, finagling, and intellectual judo -- you use your  partner's lunge to keep him pointed the right way -- to patch the holes and  minimize the slides.  </P> <P> Rosovsky has dean-like things to say about the advantages for undergraduates of  university-colleges such as Harvard, with big research and graduate programs,  as against the small liberal arts college (more stimulation). We hear about  Harvard's core curriculum -- a means of broadening a student's program by  replacing general education courses with a series of highly focused specific  ones. Some of it sounds like a speech or a position paper; some of it is.  </P> <P> When Rosovsky, like his core curriculum, gets away from generalities and down  to particulars, the book shines. He gives us a composite of a well-packed  dean's day. Among its events is the discovery that his plan to save money by  reducing the painting of classrooms would mean laying off painters; and, under  union rules about seniority, those laid-off would be black. Painting will  proceed as scheduled.  </P> <P> Everything is linked to everything else. His financial assistant insists  tuition must be raised; this will mean anguish and higher outlays for  scholarships. We get one of the Rosovskyisms that stud the book: "I know that  few decisions have to be made immediately and that it is best not to make them  in a macho frame of mind."  </P> <P> An economics professor comes in to complain that his pay raise is only 1%.  Rosovsky takes pleasure in proving to him that the correct figure is 6%. A  delegation of Jewish students brings 3,000 signatures to protest the holding of  commencement during a religious holiday. Rosovsky is unimpressed: "In our  community, thousands of signatures can be obtained in a few hours for nearly  anything." More to the point, he has obtained in advance rabbinical advice to  back him up; it helps, he adds, that he is Jewish.  </P> <P> He has to speak harshly to a professor who refuses to meet with his classes,  complaining that his students are "inauthentic." Later, painfully, it turns out  that the man has lost his mind and has to be retired on pay.  </P> <P> Harvard has no special dispensation in the competition for talent. It has to  sweat. The chairman of the chemistry department sends over a note from a Nobel  prize winner in Britain who had been asked to comment on a list of names for a  vacancy. "With the reputation you have got for treatment of the branch of  chemistry that has most rapidly developed over the past 30 years . . . any of  the distinguished gentlemen on your short list would be as mad as the  proverbial March hares to leave their cushy nests, particularly those who have  been spurned by Harvard in the past."  </P> <P> It is a reflection of the most important battle Rosovsky fought during his  tenure: getting fresh blood. There are Harvard departments that resist  virtually any possible candidate. The philosophy department, he writes, is so  highly rated it suffers "the classic pathology: the inability to find anyone  worthy of joining its ranks. It is in imminent danger of becoming a club of old  gentlemen, more exclusive with every retirement and death. In my imagination, I  picture the department with only one member: a patriarch holding a gigantic bag  of black balls."  </P> <P> Accordingly, Rosovsky sets aside an hour and a bottle of the best sherry to woo  a brilliant young philosopher from a Midwestern university who has managed to  crawl out of the black ball sack. There is a high salary, a job for the wife, a  housing allowance and a small slush fund.  </P> <P> Rosovsky has provocative things to say about tenure, about the pleasures and  pains of being a professor, the hard path for the young Ph.D., the peculiar  strains, balances and imbalances of power in a university, the envy and  rivalries that develop. "Universities and colleges are schools for adults," he  writes, "and the requirements of schooling and adulthood can be difficult to  reconcile."  </P> <P> It is appropriate that the book concludes with an exchange of letters with John  Kenneth Galbraith. (The latter responds to Rosovsky's all-points instruction  warning against romances between faculty and graduate and undergraduate  students. He had committed such a fault decades ago, Galbraith confesses, and  was still happily married to her; what did the dean advise? Discretion, the  dean replies.)  </P> <P> Rosovsky, who held his job longer than anyone since World War II -- he lets us  know this -- before deciding to return to teaching, much resembles Galbraith in  his style, graceful and with a deadly understatement.  </P> <P> Friday: Elaine Kendall reviews "Fling and Other Stories" by John Hersey.  </P></p>

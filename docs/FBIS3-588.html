			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The newly founded Freedom Front of General Constand  Viljoen and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] of Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi are apparently not going to take part in the April  election. Freedom Front representatives were present at the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] in Johannesburg this  afternoon, but did not submit the party's list of election  candidates when they saw that the IFP was not there.    Earlier there was confusion over whether General Viljoen had  submitted a candidates' list because he went into the IEC  offices. A Conservative Party MP [Member of Parliament], Dr.  Pieter Mulder, told the SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] that the Freedom Front did not hand a candidates'  list to the IEC today.    Twenty-three of the 28 parties which registered for the  election handed in candidates' lists this afternoon, with many  of them arriving minutes before the deadline. The result was  that the 4.30 deadline was extended to give the latecomers time  to hand in their lists.    The ANC [African National Congress] and the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] were among the parties which arrived  late.</p>

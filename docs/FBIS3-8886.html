We regret that we  were unable to complete, with your support, the work that we  strove to accomplish. We are confident that you will not forget  this. Together with you, we are determined to realize our plans  and aims. We are still keen on your support and favor. We will  do everything in our power to achieve the aims outlined by Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar in his address to the National Council  of the Slovak Republic on 11 March 1994. In the interest of a  democratic Slovak Republic, give your support to the  referendum!" This is stated in a Slovak Government statement  that was made available to the TA SR yesterday evening.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Property: Ugly maze encircles elegant avenues - Flats in Paris tend to be elusive and expensive. Andrew Jack explains why vendors are so reluctant to sell For those with fistfuls of francs to fritter away, there is always some intriguing property or other coming up on the Paris market. For most, France's capital remains one of the more frustrating places to seek accommodation to rent or buy. Take the magnificent hotel particulier called the Hotel de Cavoye, on rue des Saints Peres in the fashionable seventh arrondissement, not far from the house of the late Serge Gainsbourg and the headquarters of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the most prestigious training college for the country's elite. For potential buyers of the more ambitious kind, the property will probably come up for sale this month, thanks to the indisposition of its current owner, Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician. The sale depends on Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned bank to which he owes more than FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m) winning the latest in a series of court battles to seize Tapie's assets in its search for payment. The only snag is the price: FFr100m-FFr160m, according to one estimate. The incident highlights two of the more curious and frustrating things about the Paris property market: accommodation appears and disappears in the most peculiar ways, and the properties on offer are often phenomenally expensive. 'It's very easy to find yourself holding instructions for properties which have prices with too many noughts on the end,' says Richard Crosthwaite, a partner with Knight Frank Rutley, the chartered surveyors. As in the UK, both the residential and commercial markets sharply declined during the economic recession. This was borne out by the heavy losses reported by French banks and insurance companies. Nevertheless, agents are now beginning to spot signs of recovery in the Parisian market. Crosthwaite says: 'Prices rose quickly in the 1980s and have now fallen back dramatically. The market took a bigger hit than in London. Now it's coming out of the doldrums slowly. But it's difficult to call.' 'Prices are now reaching more realistic levels,' says Donelle Higbee, the representative for Sotheby's International Realty in Paris. 'Things have become more stable.' Three or four years ago, she says, the asking price for property ranged from FFr80,000 to FFr100,000 a square metre - the obsessive use of dimensions as a selling point being one of the characteristics of the local market. Now, she says, FFr30,000-FFr40,000 is more likely. The exceptions come in the most popular areas. These have additional cachet and a correspondingly substantial premium. They include Avenue Gabriel, Avenue Montaigne and Quai d'Orsay. 'All my customers are essentially looking for the same thing: 17th and 18th century buildings with high ceilings and a view - absolutely a view,' says Higbee. 'It is extremely difficult to locate these and when I find them there are always lots of people who are interested.' Generally, Parisians seem reluctant to sell - hence the custom of putting their property on the market at unrealistically high levels. Unless divorce or death duties demand a more rapid sale, this habit seems to have held the market in check. Among the reasons for this inertia are the disincentives to sell: fees and duties are often more than 10 per cent. From the buyer's perspective, there are also tortuous legal hurdles, including a cumbersome process to prove title. But Higbee says she is now beginning to see some change. 'Owners are becoming more realistic,' she says. One reason may be economic circumstances. 'They can see that nothing is going to happen to prices for two or four years,' she says. 'Banks are more reluctant to lend money. So if they have financial needs they are having to sell.' A number of aspects make the Parisian market starkly different to London and other cities. Most fundamental is the low level of supply. Paris is a relatively small city, but also one in which - as in many other countries in continental Europe - the culture of home ownership is far less dominant than in the UK. Most people rent instead. Another issue is the very different infrastructure for selling property, which can make the hunt extremely frustrating. There is a tight network of agencies, most of which have nothing like the network of some other countries nor the tradition of sharing listings and splitting the fees. 'It's every agency for itself,' says Higbee. 'They are very particular who they share information with.' 'There is a gap in the market for the sophisticated level of international marketing,' says Crosthwaite. 'There are no magazines with listings, and just a handful of agents and architects with the knowledge of what's for sale. It's all done on the cocktail and dinner-party circuit and is a question of who you know.' For those with more money to spare, Paris does offer a variety of relocation agencies and specialists willing to do much of the legwork and hunt for available property. The same applies to the rented sector. For those with more modest means, the search is rather different. There are property agents with shopfronts advertising their wares, although generally with far less extensive networks than the chains found in some other countries. The French often seek property through the columns of Le Figaro, the daily paper, which has an especially comprehensive property section on Tuesdays, and De Particulier a particulier, a weekly listings magazine. Similar listings, regularly updated, are available on Minitel, the computer information network easily available to any French telephone subscriber. Very often, a housing agent will occupy in a flat for a series of fixed hours in order to play host to dozens of prospective buyers. Those who are interested need to act fast to get over the bureaucratic hurdles before the others who are viewing at the same time. Finding the property is only a small part of the battle. The first shock is the presentation of the flats. 'Unfurnished' means just that. Very often little is left in place except the electric sockets - if you are lucky. The second is the scale of charges. On top of the standard monthly rental, a monthly fee is normally charged for the communal areas and sometimes pays for a concierge. In addition, factors such as the provision of electric or centrally-controlled heating can make a substantial difference to the final costs. Finally, there is the paperwork. Landlords often demand two months' rent in advance, possibly some financial guarantee, and a detailed series of references. They may have other demands, such as asking your employer to provide verification of your salary. On the other hand, the French legal system does offer good protection for tenants once they move in. There is one consolation. To protect people from the bitter winters, by law no one can be evicted between October and March.</p>

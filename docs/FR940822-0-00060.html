			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating rules; filing and recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 217.7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> contains the filing and recordkeeping requirements with regard to operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) provides that Class I railroads, Class II railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and railroads providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area must continue to file their operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator. The deadline for filing these documents is November 21, 1994. Most railroads are in compliance with FRA's existing provisions concerning such filings. For such railroads, it is not FRA's intent that another copy of already filed material be given to the agency. If a railroad currently has its documents on file with the agency, FRA will deem that railroad to be in compliance with this section, if the documents are in effect on November 21, 1994. (In other words, if previously filed documents are still in effect on November 21, 1994, then a railroad has complied with the new provision, having filed before December 21, 1994.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) provides that railroads subject to the filing requirements must also submit to FRA a copy of any amendment to these documents issued after November 21, 1994, within 30 days after it is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (c), Class III railroads and all other railroads subject to this part but not subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must retain one copy of their current operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions at their respective system headquarters. These documents must be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program of operational tests and inspections; recordkeeping; annual summary on operational tests and inspections; electronic recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed amendments to &sect;217.9 called for railroads to retain one copy of their operational test and inspection programs at all division headquarters and at the system headquarters. The final rule adopts this proposal with some significant modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a) is adopted unchanged, with one exception: A railroad must now conduct its operational tests and inspections in accordance with a program that it retains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) also departs from the proposed text. After November 21, 1994, a railroad must retain one copy of its current program of operational tests and inspections. The program must be updated with any subsequent amendments. These programs must be retained at the system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division where the tests prescribed in the program are conducted ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the records availability may be division specific). In other words, if certain tests are not conducted in a certain division, that division headquarters need not retain a copy of the program prescribing those particular tests. The operational testing program must be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours and must be retained for three calendar years following the end of the year to which it relates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria requirements stated in existing &sect;217.9(b) (1)&hyph;(4) and (6) remain unchanged, and a conforming change is made to paragraph (b)(5): deletion of the reference to a program ``filed with'' FRA. Under final rule paragraph (b)(5), a railroad must begin conducting operational tests and inspections within 30 days after November 21, 1994 or the date of commencing operations, whichever is later. This requirement will not affect railroads that are currently in operation, given that the existing regulations already require railroads to begin their programs within 30 days after they file their operational testing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Redesignated &sect;217.9(c) (formerly &sect;217.9(d)) requires a railroad to keep a record of the date, time, place, and result of each operational test and inspection that was performed in accordance with its program. Each record must identify the officer administering the operational test and inspection and each employee tested. These requirements clarify the information requirements provided under existing &sect;217.9(d) by identifying specific data points each record must provide. These revisions will promote the examination of relevant information from captured data sources, enabling FRA to determine the effectiveness of a railroad's operational testing program. The operational test and inspection records must be retained for one calendar year after the end of the year to which they relate at the system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division where the tests are conducted ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the records availability may be division specific). Additionally, railroads must make their operational test and inspection records available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA has decided to organize all provisions in Part 217 pertaining to operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.9; therefore, &sect;217.13 introductory text and paragraphs (a) through (c) are removed and redesignated as &sect;217.9(d). New paragraph (d) requires railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours per year to compile an ``annual summary'' recounting the number, type, and result of each operational test and inspection conducted, stated according to operating divisions where applicable, which are the same requirements as provided under existing &sect;217.13(b). The summaries should be indexed in a well organized format to facilitate efficient and manageable review. FRA has also concluded that annual compilations of the total number of train miles and of the rate at which the railroad conducts operational tests and inspections provide limited useful information; therefore, these existing requirements are removed from the final rule. These compilations, redesignated ``annual summaries on operational tests and inspections,'' must be made available at each division headquarters and at the system headquarters by March 1 of each calendar year. Such annual summaries are required to be retained at these locations for three calendar years after the end of the year to which they relate and made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New &sect;217.9(e) authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection records, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections by electronic recordkeeping, subject to conditions stated in that provision. This provision provides an alternative for railroads retaining certain information as required in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

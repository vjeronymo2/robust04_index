			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Waving the olive branch - Present talks represent the first real hope of peace in years. But deepening recession and threat of spending cuts add to the sense of urgency POLITICAL initiatives lie like burnt-out wrecks along the trail that has marked Northern Ireland's recent history. Twenty-three years of intractable sectarian conflict has left behind such a backlog of mistrust and fear that new ideas for bridging the gulf between the nationalist and unionist traditions in Northern Ireland have often been rejected out of hand before they have even had a hearing. But in April, for the first time since the 'troubles' began, the province's four main constitutional parties started facing each other at the negotiating table, with representatives from the British and Irish governments, to discuss substantive proposals for the future administrative structure for Northern Ireland. The complex three-strand negotiating process initiated then has created the first real hope in years that the elusive political settlement may finally be in the offing. The walk-out by the Democratic Unionist leaders at Stormont two weeks ago, however, has put a question mark over their likely presence in Dublin this week, where the talks are scheduled to resume today. The Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, insists that the Irish government must first commit itself to reforming the Republic's constitution, dropping its legal territorial claim to Northern Ireland, before any progress can be made in other aspects of the negotiations. The Irish government, for its part, is proffering the carrot of constitutional reform to the Unionists, which would dilute the Republic's territorial claim to one of a mere 'aspiration' for Irish unity, but in return also wants guarantees that will protect the interests of the minority community in Northern Ireland. The nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) led by Mr John Hume, will be particularly anxious that any compromise on the Irish constitution must be compensated by a radical new government structure for the province, which will give Dublin some monitoring role in order to guard against any irredentism on the part of the Unionist majority. To date, the unionists have given few clues as to how they see the concerns of the nationalist community and the Irish government being addressed, or indeed that they are prepared to surrender any of their bargaining counters. That presumably will be tested soon. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, said that he has no wish to endanger the talks by putting undue pressure on the participants. 'I expect it to be a longer rather than a shorter process. It would be better to see a result rather than an abrupt halt. It will have a better chance of success if we allow people to sound off,' he said. However, there is concern in Dublin that the talks should not drag on indefinitely. Four cabinet ministers are in the Irish delegation, and are devoting most of their time to the talks - an indication of the importance Dublin attaches to the process. If no progress is made in the coming weeks, however, there could be a change of attitude, especially if simmering domestic crises should come to the boil. For its part, the UK government is showing signs of financial, if not political, fatigue with the Ulster question. In a speech earlier this month Mr Michael Mates, minister of state for finance and security in the province, said Northern Ireland would no longer be cushioned from the impact of spending cuts elsewhere in the country. 'There are firm constraints on public expenditure nationally and these are likely to be reflected in difficult decisions for all parts of the public sector. . . we in Northern Ireland cannot be excused our share of this misery'. It is an ominous warning. Some 40 per cent of employment in Northern Ireland comes from the public sector. It has been an important factor in Northern Ireland weathering the recession better than other parts of the country. Unemployment, already the highest regional rate in the UK, is rising, however, and independently forecast to exceed 16 per cent by 1994, even before any cuts. Economic experts are calling for radical new approaches to the economy. The government, however, appears to be going in the opposite direction. It is also going against the political grain in the province by pressing ahead with its plans for privatisation of public utilities against both nationalist and unionist opposition. The determination of the government to reduce Northern Ireland's strain on the Exchequer will undoubtedly encourage a growing number of politicians from both political persuasions to seek economic comfort in Brussels. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in its last Congress also noted that an EC dimension might form the basis of a political solution. Its leaders have also been making increasingly conciliatory statements towards the unionists in recent months. The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams in the West Belfast constituency at the last general elections is indicative that Sinn Fein's star is on the wane, and is pushing the organisation towards a more moderate and conciliatory stance. From the other end of the spectrum, Sir Patrick Mayhew is emphatic when he says: 'The British government does not have a selfish motive for staying here. It does not have a special interest of its own to serve . . . The more people understand that is the way we look at it, the harder it will be for the IRA to win support.' He still rules out talks with Sinn Fein, however. 'When there is palpable evidence on the ground that they have renounced and denounced violence for political purposes, then we will have a new situation,' he said. The fact that the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the cover organisation for the Loyalist paramilitaries of the UFF, was proscribed last month, and Sinn Fein was not, is nonetheless being interpreted as a signal to Sinn Fein that the door has not been closed to their eventual inclusion in the talks. The substantive concessions from all sides which will be necessary for progress have thus still to be made, but the fact that negotiations have begun at all suggests that a rethink of old dogmas may be under way. According to Mr Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight magazine in Belfast, who through his publication has done much to draw attention to the merits of an EC dimension in any settlement, 'it will be a question of redefining nationalism and unionism in a European context'. Whether that imaginative road will be chosen, remains to be seen. It will be a difficult and politically risky process for all involved, but the price of past failure by Northern Ireland's politicians is already there to be seen - the bomb-damaged buildings of Belfast and a grisly death toll of 3,000 since 1969.</p>

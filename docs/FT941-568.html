			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei resumes upward course in technical trading Share prices closed higher on technical trading but volume was thin; investors were cautious on the first trading day for delivery in the new business year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average gained 105.31 at 19,941.79 after a low of 19,725.55 and high of 20,062.91. Selling subsided as most companies and financial institutions had finished their stock selling to spruce up their financial books ahead of March 31, the fiscal year-end. A fall in futures contracts, following the decline on the Chicago futures market on Friday, pulled stocks down briefly during the morning. Shares rose on investment trust fund demand, and foreign investors were also seen buying stocks in small lots. Volume was 250m shares, against 353m. Uncertainty over movements in overseas financial markets also kept many investors inactive, while investor sentiment was also depressed as 1,038 shares went ex-dividend. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.49 to 1,612.84 and the Nikkei 300 put on 0.68 at 295.86. Advances led declines by 521 to 495, with 129 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.37 firmer at 1,330.34. Reports of increased investment in cable television boosted multimedia linked stocks. Itochu, the trading house which, according to reports, is investing Y40bn in its cable television business, climbed Y31 to Y673, while Toshiba gained Y16 at Y799. Other telecom linked shares were stronger. NEC, a leading maker of communications equipment, was the most heavily traded issue, adding Y50 at Y1,150, and Fujitsu rose Y30 to Y1,060. Mining and non-ferrous metal companies were higher on a rise in commodity prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y11 to Y931 and Showa Aluminum Y40 to Y510. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.27 to 22,129.51 in volume of 20.9m shares. Roundup The region was affected by a series of individual factors. HONG KONG swung to modest losses at the close as sharp early gains on a rebound in Jardine Matheson were wiped out. The Hang Seng index shed 37.18 to 9,197.03, off a day's high of 9,362.80. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 4.7bn from Friday's HKDollars 5.9bn.

Investors remained nervous ahead of the release of Bank Negara's annual report tomorrow. Turnover shrank to 141m shares from Friday's 194m. AUSTRALIA dropped to a new low for 1994, dragged down by weakness in the bond market and futures exchange. The All Ordinaries index fell 42.7 to 2,108.9. Turnover came to ADollars 795.6m. Industrials were among the main fallers, the All Industrials index weakening 68.5 to 3,192.2. BHP tumbled 26 cents to ADollars 17.08 after Foster's Brewing sold its stake in Beswick Pty, BHP's biggest shareholder.

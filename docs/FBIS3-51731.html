			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Itamar Garcez] </F>   [Text] Brasilia--The Judiciary Branch is the chief target  of legislators working on the constitutional revision. About 25  percent of the more than 17,000 proposals for amendments that  have been submitted deal exclusively with the courts and the  magistrates. Article 93, for example, which governs the  magistracy, was the favorite of deputies and senators, who  suggested about 640 modifications in it. This statistic, a  preliminary finding by Prodasen [Federal Senate Data Processing  Center], confirms expectations that the National Congress wants  outside control over the Judiciary.    The desire to set limits on the actions of judges is nothing  new. Ever since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, legislators  have had the Judiciary Branch in their sights. To repeat that  year's success, when they survived unscathed despite many  pressures, the judges will have to work a good deal harder.  Legislators of all stripes have already catalogued their  suggestions. Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino (PT) [Workers Party],  like his colleague Jose Dirceu (PT, Sao Paulo), proposed a  Council of Justice to exercise administrative, financial, and  disciplinary control over the judiciary.    Rondonia Senator Odacir Soares, (PFL) [Liberal Front Party],  wants to end the lifetime appointment of ministers, so he  proposes a 12-year term of office. His colleague in the Chamber,  Para Deputy Luis Carlos Hauly (PP) [Progressive Party], goes  further: he wants to give the Legislative Branch the power to  remove ministers from superior courts by a vote of "no  confidence" to be approved by an absolute majority of  deputies--the same quorum required to approve any proposal in  the constitutional revision--293 votes.    This predilection to suggest changes in the Judiciary has  not, however, prevented deputies and senators from setting to  work on all areas. In the most recent survey done by Prodasen,  Article 138, which contains the rules governing a state of  siege, was the only one not on the list of proposed changes. At  the other extreme, Article 5, on the rights and duties of  citizens, ranked second as a target of the legislators. More  than 610 proposals seek to modify that long constitutional  provision, which has 77 subsections.    For example, it is in Article 5 that Rio de Janeiro Deputy  Amaral Netto (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] will try, once  again, to insert a point on which he has been adamant: the  plebiscite on the death penalty. The members of this Constituent  Assembly will not have much luck, however, since Article 5 is  one of the clausulas petreas, provisions that  according to Article 60, paragraph 4, cannot be amended.    The major topics will probably be: the tax structure, the  petroleum and telecommunications monopolies, social security,  the civil service, the public administration, congressional  representation formulas, the federative pact, and agrarian  reform.  <H5>  [Boxed chart page 8] </H5>   Prodasen has just completed a preliminary survey of proposed  changes in the Constitution. Using these figures, it will be  possible to identify the legislators' principal interests. The  survey categorized 17,269 proposals for revision. Here is a look  at what the legislators have in mind.  <H5>  Proposals by Title of the Constitution </H5>    -  Title I, The Fundamental Principles - 68 proposals    -  Title  II, Fundamental Rights and Guarantees - 1,779 proposals    -  Title  III, The Organization of the State - 2,683 proposals    -  Title IV,  Structure of the Branches of Government - 5,843 proposals    -  Title  V, Defense of the State and Democratic Institutions - 751  proposals    -  Title VI, Taxation and Finance - 1,790 proposals    -  Title  VII, The Economic and Financial Order - 1,300 proposals    -  Title  VIII, The Social Order - 1,771 proposals    -  General Provisions -  470 proposals    -  Transitory Provisions - 819 proposals       Note: Sometimes a single proposal modifies more than one  article. Therefore, the total number of suggested changes is  greater than the number of proposals submitted.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS in the derivative markets reported a dull session with investors said to have been in a cautious mood ahead of today's US presidential election and tomorrow's Maastricht debate in the UK, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,679 and immediately came under selling pressure which drove it down to 2,666, the day's low point, within the first hour of trading. Thereafter, December moved steadily forward and by mid-day was trading at 2,682. During the afternoon, a squeeze on the back of a firm Wall Street sent the contract sharply forward to recover some of the earlier losses. For most of the session December traded at a 5 to 10-point premium. It finished at 2,714, around 30 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash, which has come back this account to around 17 points. Turnover was 7,198 contracts. In traded options, volume remained poor, reaching only 22,749 lots, but was an improvement on Friday's meagre 19,164 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 5,448 contracts and some 3,284 lots were dealt in the Euro FT-SE option. British Steel led the league table among the stock options with 2,977 contracts. That total included a seller of 1,000 April 60 calls at 2p. This was followed by BP, in which 1,260 lots were transacted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, acting head of the </F> parliamentary group of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Anna  Dano; place and date not given]    [Text] [Dano] Why is the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] not satisfied with the coordination right that is  equivalent to a veto right and the four ministerial positions  offered by the Socialists?    [Kuncze] Who said this is not enough? We have mutually  learned our positions and this phase in the negotiations has  come to an end. It is true that our desires were far apart, but  we are negotiating in order to bring them closer.    [Dano] However, it is well known -- and perhaps you will not  deny it either -- that there are serious debates over the  distribution of ministries and the appointment of ministers and  state secretaries. Would you tell us what this difference of  interests is about?    [Kuncze] This is as if the press were controlling politics.  At the same time, all that is happening is that we have reached  a point in the negotiations where we must decide how to divide  up the government positions among us. This has been given a lot  of publicity, which is misleading because this publicity gives  the impression that this issue has elicited the biggest debates  or that this issue is the most important. The creation of  guarantees or the coordination in 10 committees are more  important issues. It would be really unfortunate to give the  voters the impression that the most important issue here is who  gets what position.    [Dano] In your opinion, what other critical points can be  found in the agreement?    [Kuncze] For example, if we fail to agree in the committees  and the members of the main committee also fail to find a  solution to the problems. Differences emerging between the  committee on local government and the constitutional law  committee could be such problems. There are differences of  views regarding the role of the counties, but we also have  differences of views on what should be done regarding the  constitutional law in the coming parliamentary cycle and in what  order.    [Dano] It often seemed during the negotiations that the  SZDSZ would not even have adequate experts for many ministries.  Perhaps this is why you are sticking so much to certain  positions, and this hinders progress in the negotiations. All  this is surprising -- all the more so because, for the past  year, the SZDSZ has been saying that it was preparing to topple  the government; in other words, it was preparing for governing.    [Kuncze] This is not true. The SZDSZ has adequate experts.    [Dano] What is your opinion about the bill-package of  Sarkozy's independent group of experts -- namely their proposals  to modify the statute and the Constitution?    (Kuncze] We have been following their activity closely, and  we knew the details previously; generally, we agreed at the time  and, of course, we argued about some details. It is another  matter that a comparison of programs is taking place at the  coalition negotiations, and the proposals meant for the  parliament will emerge based on this. However, if we compare  this with the activity of Sarkozy's group, we can find  differences.    [Dano] These proposals almost eliminate the candidates'  independence and would turn parliament into a voting machine.    [Kuncze] On the contrary. They free parliament from  unessential issues. This could open up more opportunities for  debate, and the essence of parliament is to hold debates there.  Our parliamentary group supports the statute modifications  mentioned by our negotiating delegation at the six-party  negotiations. But it is not longer worth mentioning Sarkozy's  proposals because we would like the professional issues to be  decided upon already in the committees. People should vote on  the modifying proposals there and, after a strict control, these  proposals should be submitted to the plenary session. There,  people can vote in packages on proposals that most certainly  enjoy the support of parliament. This would also reduce the  time spent on voting.    Our parliamentary group also supports the proposals that  give  greater opportunity for the opposition to supervise the  government, proposals that facilitate the establishment of  investigation committees and set up rules regarding the ordering  of days of political debate. We also support the idea that  one-third of the deputies in important committees should be  opposition members, because one-third of votes are needed for a  proposal to make it to the plenary session. The fact that the  opposition parties will receive more committee positions than  their government weight will also facilitate the activity of the  opposition.    [Dano] How can you guarantee a parliamentary group  discipline according to the expected new statute?    [Kuncze] This is a matter of the statute of the  parliamentary group. We discussed this matter last weekend.  Everyone accepted that, as a government party deputy group, our  parliamentary group will have to function according to new  rules. There are only ideas about this now, and there is not  yet a set rule regarding the absences. This rule will endeavor  to make sure that there are as many people present as possible  at the plenary sessions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Stay of Compliance With Line Section Replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its request to stay application of the line section replacement provision of the final rule, INGAA explained that ``almost all decisions, to include funding, for pipeline replacement and rehabilitation are made at least a year preceding the summer work season *&blank;*&blank;*'' INGAA states that the one year lag time includes time required for ``design work, obtaining bids for work, selecting contractors, ordering material, obtaining approval from FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), performing environmental analyses and obtaining Federal and State environmental and archaeological permits when necessary, and obtaining landowner approval for right-of-way work on their property.'' As a result, INGAA believes that it is ``far too late to comply with a May 12, 1994, effective date to make `line sections' piggable''. AGA echoes this sentiment by stating that if the May 12, 1994, effective date of the final rule remains in place, ``pipeline replacement projects currently in progress for 1994 would have to be canceled, since the administrative permits and plans for such projects were in place during the winter of 1993&hyph;94.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concerns expressed by INGAA and AGA led RSPA to advise INGAA, AGA, and the American Petroleum Institute on May 12, 1994, that it was suspending enforcement, until further notice, of the final rule insofar as it requires making the entire line section accommodate smart pigs if the line pipe, valve, fitting or other component is replaced. The suspension did not effect the requirements that pipeline operators design and construct new onshore and offshore pipelines or the actual line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component being replaced to accommodate smart pigs. Furthermore, operators were encouraged to voluntarily modify any obstructions in the line section to accommodate smart pigs whenever any replacement is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice addresses INGAA's and AGA's request for a stay in a more formal manner. First, this notice proposes to extend the compliance date for replacements made in gas transmission pipelines to allow operators to continue replacing any line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component (with a replacement that accommodates smart pigs) without requiring that any other obstructions in the line section be designed and constructed to accommodate smart pigs. As discussed below, RSPA is proposing to partially grant reconsideration of the final rule as it applies to replacements in gas transmission pipelines. At the same time, we are proposing to extend compliance dates to allow for completion of rulemaking on the reconsideration. Second, the suspension of enforcement with respect to gas transmission pipelines will remain in effect until February 2, 1995, or until RSPA finalizes action with respect to compliance dates, whichever is earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitions for reconsideration and requests for administrative stay received addressed only gas transmission pipelines. However, because of the possibility that the issues raised could be equally applicable to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines, the suspension of enforcement applied equally to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA has considered whether the reconsideration granted in this notice with respect to aspects of the final rule as they apply to gas transmission lines should be expanded to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. RSPA has decided not to expand the reconsideration to include hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. First, there has been no request to do so. Second, hazardous liquid pipelines pose environmental risks generally unrelated to the population surrounding the pipelines. The relief proposed below with respect to gas transmission lines arise from the nature of those pipelines and their location with respect to population. Finally, based on data collected by RSPA (below) in 1989, approximately 41.7% of (136,359 miles) of natural gas transmission lines were not able to accommodate a smart pig for reasons other than lack of launchers or receivers, while only 10.5% (16,275 miles) of hazardous liquid pipelines were similarly not piggable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

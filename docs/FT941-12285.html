			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Funding for PNG gold mine Efforts to raise the debt funding for the large Lihir gold mine project in Papua New Guinea are expected to get under way in the next couple of weeks, writes Nikki Tait. Niugini Mining, one of the joint venture partners in the mine, alongside Britain's RTZ and the Papua New Guinea government, said an information memorandum would be circulated early in February to international banks. The banking memorandum follows preparation of a detailed financial plan for Lihir Gold, the corporate entity which will eventually own the project. The development cost of the mine, put at USDollars 610m, is expected to be covered by the raising of both equity and debt funds, and JB Were, the Australian stockbroking firm, has been appointed as lead broker for the planned initial public offering of share in Lihir Gold. Lihir has the potential to become the largest gold mine outside South Africa.</p>

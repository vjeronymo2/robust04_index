			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: NURSERY CRIMES  </P> <P> What could be creepier than a grown-up Freddy Krueger? How about Freddy as a  tyke. In New Line Cinema's just-out "Nightmare on Elm Street, Part 5: The Dream  Child," the little devil invades the nightmares of a young pregnant woman who's  being pursued by Freddy.  </P> <P> Baby Freddy's creator, special effects artist David Miller, told us that the  tot has radio-controlled facial features -- to enhance its screams and cries --  and also operates as both a hand and a rod puppet. That allows for head, arm  and leg movement.  </P> <P> "It's, um, kind of gross I guess," laughed Miller, 29, who created the makeup  appliances and the Freddy "look" for the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" in  1984.  </P> <P> Miller went on to work on projects including "Terminator," "Cocoon," Michael  Jackson's "Thriller" and "a whole slew of horror films."  </P> <P> "Nightmare 5" marks his return to what is easily his most infamous creation.  Now at work on the syndicated "Nightmare on Elm Street" TV series, Miller  chalks up Freddy's popularity to the fact that he frequently cracks one-liners  after committing vile crimes.  </P> <P> "Here's a monster who can make you jump -- and then make you laugh."

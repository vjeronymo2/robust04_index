			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Dalai Lama calls for dialogue: Tibetan leader voices fears of 'cultural genocide' THE DALAI Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, said yesterday he wanted to discuss with China a 'one country, two systems' approach along the lines of Beijing's policy for Hong Kong and Taiwan. At a press conference in London, the Nobel peace prize winner said Tibet was not part of China, which has governed it since invading in 1951. 'Ultimately, the Tibetan people have the right to decide (their future),' he said. However, Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, had said anything could be discussed except complete independence, the Dalai Lama added, apparently referring to a meeting in 1979 between Mr Deng and the Dalai Lama's brother, acting as his emissary. Without accepting this starting point, discussions would be pointless, he indicated. The Dalai Lama's suggestion of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty has been made before. But his urgent desire for dialogue on such an approach clearly reflects his growing concern about transfers of Chinese people into Tibet and the devastation of Tibetan culture. Population movements into Tibet, he said, involved violations of human rights, environmental problems, and 'cultural genocide'. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told the Dalai Lama yesterday he would raise the issue of population transfers with China. He would also urge China to start a dialogue with Tibetans including the Dalai Lama'without any preconditions'. This toughening of Britain's position on Tibet came recently after China sought to impose conditions on talks, officials said. Britain believes Tibet should be autonomous but recognises the 'special position' of China - an approach in line with that of most other countries which do not believe complete independence from China is realistic. A group of European ambassadors to Beijing is due to visit Tibet later this month to seek first-hand evidence. Travellers report the wholesale demolition of Tibetan buildings and their replacement with stalls for mostly Chinese vendors. Mr Robbie Barnett, director of a London-based Tibet information network, said one recent visitor had reported an 'architectural holocaust'. There are no reliable estimates of movements of Chinese into Tibet, although China specialists note that movements of people from rural to urban areas in search of commercial opportunities are common throughout China. China meanwhile kept up its campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama. Its London embassy issued a document accusing him of acting 'in total disregard of historical facts' and insisting that life for Tibetans was much better than under the previous 'feudal serfdom'.</p>

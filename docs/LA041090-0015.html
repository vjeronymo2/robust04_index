			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: A RUSH TO JUDGMENT . . . ON FLAG-BURNING ISSUE  </P> <P> Those who say that President Bush does not have an agenda are misreading the  newspapers. The other day the President requested that the Supreme Court rule  on the constitutionality of flag-burning laws as quickly as possible. Mr. Bush  wants an accelerated timetable in getting a court opinion for what he deems the  most important issue of our time -- far more urgent than court rulings on  capital punishment, abortion, the environment and the social issues that  confront the nation today.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court agreed to Mr. Bush's request so flag desecration has been put  on the justices' front burner, and arguments will be heard in May.  </P> <P> Many Americans are wondering why the hurry. How come the President is so  desperate to get a decision, and why did the Supreme Court agree to drop  everything to give him one?  </P> <P> A mole in the White House provided me with the answer.  </P> <P> "The President has just received word that there is going to be a rash of  flag-burnings this summer, and he wants the court to reverse its earlier  opinion that flag-burning laws are unconstitutional."  </P> <P> "How many flags does Mr. Bush expect to be burned this summer?" I asked him.  </P> <P> "Four -- maybe five. It could be an epidemic. Bush is so worried about Old  Glory going up in smoke that he sleeps with a fire extinguisher in his bed."  </P> <P> "Being President is no fun," I said. "I am surprised that the Supreme Court was  willing to go along with the speed-up of the case."  </P> <P> "Congress directed it to. The law says that the court must expedite any  flag-burning appeal as soon as it possibly can."  </P> <P> "Is that because the national security of the country is at stake?"  </P> <P> "That, plus the fact that every Republican congressman's election depends on  it. No politician can face his constituency while the country's flag is in  flames."  </P> <P> "Is this the first time a President has requested that the Supreme Court  leapfrog all its cases and rule on something as important as flag desecration?"  </P> <P> "Yes, but the President can't make that request too often because the court  doesn't like to be pushed around. At the same time, when the patriotic health  of the nation is in danger, then even the Supreme Court cannot sit idly by  while people flick their Bics."  </P> <P> "What if the court still declares that the anti-flag-burning law is  unconstitutional? What will President Bush do then?"  </P> <P> "He will demand that Congress pass an urgent constitutional amendment in three  weeks."  </P> <P> "I thought it took years to pass a constitutional amendment."  </P> <P> "It does if you don't have an election coming up. You need to understand one  thing. This country has many problems that it cannot solve. Preventing the  burning of the flag is one of the few issues that Bush can deal with. He wants  to go down in history as the President who saved the Stars and Stripes. He  really deserves credit for getting the Supreme Court on it so fast."  </P> <P> "Will the court rule on it before the summer recess?"  </P> <P> "If they don't, it will be the end of Yankee Doodle Dandy as we know it."  </P></p>

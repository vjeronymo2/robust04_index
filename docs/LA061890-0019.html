			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: CURSES! SOME THINGS LAST FOREVER AND EVER AND . . .  </P> <P> Fallon Evans, a professor of English literature, writes that he has had a  vision of the hereafter. It is not a vision of his death, which he expects to  be very ordinary.  </P> <P> Fallon believes he is destined to have an ordinary life and death. He explains  that he spent World War II as a soldier stationed in Kansas, and the most  extraordinary thing that happened to him in that time was having three changes  in uniform of the day before breakfast one morning. That's the sort of exercise  the officers think up to keep the troops on their toes when there isn't any  combat.  </P> <P> Fallon's vision is of himself lying in his casket, after all the rituals have  taken place.  </P> <P> "The undertaker has approached to lower the lid and screw in the last screws  and my wife has come to take her last look.  </P> <P> "And just as the lid closes, she will see, way down in one corner of the  casket, one of those white plastic, non-biodegradable kernels that mail order  houses use to cushion the purchase within the cardboard box. You know, the  little walnut shaped things that flow out of the box and under tables and  chairs . . . that show up in the kitchen weeks after, that always appear after  the trash truck has left . . . those dratty little things that you can never  get rid of?  </P> <P> "And my wife will sigh and think, 'They beat him in death just as they did in  life.' "  </P> <P> I have no such vision, since I don't intend to be buried. With my  claustrophobia it would kill me. I'm going up in smoke.  </P> <P> But I do expect, until my dying day, to be pestered, teased, pursued,  beleaguered and frustrated by those little plastic pellets he describes.  </P> <P> They are undoubtedly the most fiendish invention of the packaging industry,  which is by all odds the most fiendish of all industries.  </P> <P> I have seen a lot of them. My wife enjoys mail-order shopping, so our living  room is never quite free of them. As Evans says, they flow out of the box and  under tables and chairs, where they resist recapture, only to turn up months  later.  </P> <P> He calls them kernels, which indeed they are. Some may look like walnuts, but  the ones I see are more often round or shaped like peanuts. They have almost no  weight. They are used to fill in the empty spaces in packages. When the package  is opened they "flow" out, as Evans says. They are light on the air and they  have an affinity for clothing. They cling to one's pant legs, and if you brush  them off they float away and land somewhere else, like elusive flies.  </P> <P> You can not pick them up by the handful. They flow out of your hand and hide  under the sofa. They seem to have minds of their own. There is nothing to do  but curse them.  </P> <P> As Evans notes, they are non-biodegradable, another bad mark against them.  Unlike Evans, when he is laid in his casket, they will last forever. When I see  one on the rug, defiant, mocking me, I am not heartened by the knowledge that  it will outlast me. It will never disintegrate.  </P> <P> I don't even know what these little monsters are called, or who manufacturers  them. I only know that they are a curse on mankind, and one of the many  pernicious products of our high technology.  </P> <P> I believe I have already written of the impossibility of opening packaged goods  -- even a loaf of bread. Fingernails and teeth are helpless against the plastic  seals. They say, "Tear here," but nothing less than a knife or a pair of pliers  can undo their indestructible embrace.  </P> <P> I am rather given to dry cereals, which my doctor says were meant for herd  animals to eat. I am discouraged, though, by the impossibility of getting at  the cereal through that plastic inner sack without risking the loss of a finger  by using a butcher knife. Even my wife, who is much better at these things than  I am, gives up. Sheer strength will not pull those sealed flaps apart. The  people who think these things up should be boiled in non-biodegradable oil.  </P> <P> I occasionally receive review books from publishers. I despair every time I  pick up one of those brown cardboard "jiffy" packages with the tongue you are  suppose to pull to peel the package like a banana. Either I cannot find the end  of the tongue or when I peel it, it doesn't open the package. Usually I end up  using a large pair of shears or a large knife.  </P> <P> As for medicines, the ingenious locking devices they think up to make the  bottles inaccessible to children are nothing less than satanic. Even a plastic  bottle of aspirin is harder to crack than a safe. And the irony of this  elaborate precaution is that children don't seem to have any trouble opening  them.  </P> <P> As for those little plastic peanuts, Evans is right: the only way to get rid of  them permanently is to lock them in a casket and bury them.  </P></p>

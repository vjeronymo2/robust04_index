			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Geevor looks for new lease of life from reverse takeover GEEVOR, the UK mining company with an 85-year history, is likely to be swallowed up in a Pounds 10m reverse takeover which will give it new assets, management and ownership. Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, chairman, said yesterday that a private UK company, which he refused to identify, would be putting its North American assets into Geevor in exchange for shares which would give the vendors a substantial majority of the enlarged capital. The assets include an underground coal mine in Pennsylvania which had been operating for 10 years, underground and surface coal reserves and resources, two operating coal reprocessing plants and coal refuse tips, and various gold and silver mining interests. These would be expected to generate an operating cash flow for Geevor and offer potential for further expansion. Mr Wellesley-Wood pointed out that the operations were similar to those previously held by Geevor, so present shareholders would have an interest in a similar company. Geevor shares were suspended at 4 3/4 p yesterday, pending the outcome of negotiations involving Smith New Court for Geevor and Charterhouse for the vendors. He suggested talks would take at least another two weeks. The proposed deal would be subject to shareholders' approval. Interest on the Pounds 1.25m 10 per cent secured convertible loan notes 1996, due on December 31 but deferred at that time, would be paid in full on completion of the proposed deal. The loan notes were issued after Geevor was nearly killed off when the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce withdrew banking facilities last year in controversial circumstances. Some shareholders took up the loan notes partly so that Geevor could pursue the bank in the courts. Mr Wellesley-Wood said that, should the reverse takeover be approved, Geevor's name would be changed - probably to Phoenix Mining.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Technology: Putting a face to a phone Seeing the people you telephone has moved a step closer this week as two companies prepare to launch videophones for consumer use. BT and Amstrad plan to introduce products, manufactured by GEC-Marconi, in time for Christmas. The likely price tag will be Pounds 399. Until now, most videophone research has been aimed at the business market with advances in videoconferencing spearheading developments. But the new GEC-Marconi videophone can use either traditional analogue systems or the new digital exchanges, the latter making up around 55 per cent of the UK phone network. The difficulty with the analogue system has been in compressing the amount of information required into the line to produce a clear moving picture and adequate sound quality. But developments in data compression and integrated software have enabled the breakthrough to be made to standards the manufacturer hopes will become the norm for the industry. The unit contains a three-inch square flip-up screen, which receives colour pictures from a finger-sized camera situated above. It plugs into a normal telephone socket and calls cost the normal rate. The screen and camera can be placed down if not required. The videophone has a 'picture refreshment rate' - the transmission rate of frames per second - of around 10 compared with a television rate of 25. This means that there is a slight time lag on sudden movements - and a tendency to make the image slightly larger than normal. Otherwise the picture is surprisingly clear. GEC-Marconi says it is developing separate types of unit for Amstrad and BT, although the product will use similar components. These developments mark the latest stage in an increasingly competitive business with manufacturers racing to open up the market. Earlier this year AT&amp;T announced it was testing an analogue videophone in the US which would retail at around Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 850).</p>

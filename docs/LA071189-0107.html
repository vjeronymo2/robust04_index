			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUSING ART;  </P> <P> IN THE FACE OF HOUSE VOTE, MUSEUMS ARE PUZZLED BY UPROAR OVER EROTIC WORKS  </P> <P> In a display case in a room off the Inner Peristyle Garden at the J. Paul Getty  Museum in Malibu, there is a small statue of a satyr, an ancient Greek  half-man, half-beast figure that, when closely scrutinized, is obviously  aroused.  </P> <P> Nearby, a vase from about 510 B.C. -- attributed to Euthymides, a contemporary  of the famed Greek vase maker Euphronios -- is vividly illustrated with a scene  depicting a couple engaged in what is clearly steamy foreplay.  </P> <P> And in the next room, another vase, discreetly titled "Drunken Singing Reveler  and His Young Attendant," shows a pretty-faced teen-age boy holding a pitcher  into which his older male companion is urinating.  </P> <P> Across town, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a tall, phallic structure  by Robert Graham includes numerous explicit scenes of sexual intercourse. Two  or three rooms away, a couple makes love in the back seat of a 1938 Dodge.  </P> <P> In still another room, Jean-Simon Berthelemy's 1778 painting, "Death of a  Gladiator," shows its subject complete with pubic hair. Philip Conisbee, the  museum's curator of European painting and sculpture, points out that the work  probably was completed by Berthelemy while he was in Rome, studying under a  French government grant.  </P> <P> Except for the '38 Dodge scene -- by Edward Kienholz, which caused a scandal  over its content after it was completed in 1964 -- none of these anatomically  explicit or sexually suggestive artworks has precipitated a single complaint by  the millions of people who have viewed them in the last five years or so, the  two museums say.  </P> <P> Even with the Kienholz, said Pamela Jenkinson, public information officer at  the county museum, "we haven't heard squat since we opened the building."  </P> <P> Among curators at the Getty and at LACMA, this is a source of puzzlement. Why,  when a single room at the Getty contains a dozen pieces of sexually explicit  art, has similar subject matter in contemporary art caused such a fuss? Witness  the ruckus surrounding the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose  homoerotic and sadomasochistic work -- except for its medium -- focuses on many  of the same things the ancient Greeks did.  </P> <P> Ironically, the single most controversial image in a disputed show of  Mapplethorpe's work is a self-portrait in which he appears nude, with a  bullwhip protruding from his buttocks in a fashion reminiscent of the bestial  detail of Greek satyrs.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, then, it is Mapplethorpe -- whose work received partial  federal financial support -- who has become such a large part of the arts  funding crisis unfolding in Washington this week.  </P> <P> The dispute, fomented by conservative congressmen, may reach a preliminary  climax Wednesday with a budget vote in the House of Representatives that could  strip millions of dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> After all, said Marion True, curator of antiquities at the Getty,  homosexuality, explicit nudity and a variety of sex acts have been legitimately  a part of artistic expression since at least Greek times. Tina Oldknow,  associate curator of ancient and Islamic art at LACMA, agreed, noting that,  while the Getty may have the explicit statue of the satyr on display, LACMA has  in its collection a Greek vase that goes even further: It shows two satyrs --  masturbating.  </P> <P> Little is known about the personal life styles of Greek artists, said True and  Oldknow. At that time, said True, artists lacked the social stature they enjoy  today.  </P> <P> Chances are good, however, that Greek artists -- working in a society in which  homosexuality, for instance, was accepted behavior -- were people not unlike  Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> The battle against government support for controversial art has been led by  Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Dick Armey  (R-Tex.). With assistance from fundamentalist religious groups, the  conservative congressmen have challenged the National Endowment for the Arts to  devise ways to control subject matter to prevent funding of art that Armey has  described as "blatantly offensive to the vast majority of the American people."  </P> <P> The conservatives contend that the national endowment has no business financing  art whose subject matter may be perceived as sacrilegious or pornographic.  D'Amato and Armey have said they are not trying to limit artistic freedom of  expression -- only to ensure that public money doesn't pay for anything the  most conservative members of art's audience don't like.  </P> <P> "If we take the representations of life that they (Greek artists) have left for  us," said True, "one has to assume they were familiar with all kinds of things.  Group sex was nothing new to the Greeks.  </P> <P> "There are certainly representations of people being spanked with slippers and  sandals. There are people with whips in their hands. I'm not suggesting they  are equivalent (to Mapplethorpe's photographic images), but I don't think there  is much that goes on in the contemporary world that would shock a Greek."  </P> <P> "In Greek art, nudity shouldn't just be seen as nudity. It denotes something,"  said Oldknow. "It means as much about something as a person wearing clothes. It  tells us a lot of things about the figure being represented. Ideal youths and  their nudity is thought by some people to denote their spiritual excellence and  their power in their physical perfection.  </P> <P> "The ideal qualities of a male in the 6th Century B.C. would be that he would  be athletically developed, physically powerful, courageous and honorable. So  you would have the male figure nude. You don't have nude female figures because  the ideal qualities were that they would wear fashionable clothes and be very  demure."  </P> <P> Two centuries later, said Oldknow, the direction of Greek art shifted enough so  that the female nude is frequently seen. In that era, state support of art was  virtually unknown, said True and Oldknow. Many vases, in particular, featuring  the most explicit subject matter, were private commissions. "You would have  dinner parties where men would gather together and drink and discuss things,"  said Oldknow. "Women who would accompany the men would be prostitutes, not  their wives. It was also acceptable for a man to be married and have a male  lover. It really wasn't an issue."  </P> <P> The acceptability of such subject matter has gone through permutations over  time. In the Victorian age, it became commonplace for a wide variety of nude  sculptures, for instance, to be draped or for their genitals to be covered with  fig leaves. Michelangelo's famed fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in  Rome, completed in 1512, has from time to time aroused controversy because it  depicts garland-bearing nude youths.  </P> <P> In the 1920s and '30s in the United States, said True, the racy subject matter  of Greek vases became such an issue that some museums painted over the genitals  of figures depicted on them.  </P> <P> While the function of nudity and explicit sexual conduct in art has changed  through history, True contended that the contemporary controversy is  characteristic of cyclical clashes between fundamentalist religious beliefs and  artistic freedom that have recurred over many centuries.  </P> <P> "I think it's predictable," she said. "I think the problem is that, whenever  you have a very conservative period politically and socially -- which we have  right now -- and great interest in fundamental religious ideals, people tend to  impose them on other people.  </P> <P> "(They seem to say), 'Not only do I not want this, but I don't want money going  to support anybody else doing this.' It is one of the problems with art today."  </P> <P> To True, such a climate demands courage from museum directors and others in the  arts community, whose function in such cycles may well be to try to hold out  against the running of the political tide.  </P> <P> "I think that any museum that is receiving (government) funding should refuse  to be intimidated by the threat that the funding is going to be taken away if  government officials who are supporting the national endowment say they don't  approve of the art," she said.  </P> <P> If this week they don't approve of Mapplethorpe and photographer Andres  Serrano, whose image of a crucifix immersed in urine also played a major role  in the current controversy, she added, "next week they won't approve of  Euphronios and Exekias and the Greeks.  </P> <P> "We have explicit representations of couples copulating. Are we supposed to  take them off exhibit because someone doesn't approve of them being on display?  Thank you, I won't do it. When an institution is intimidated by that kind of  thing, there's no way of defining the limits of it. It is not going to stop at  modern art."  </P> <P> At least indirectly, True was criticizing Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art,  which last month canceled a Mapplethorpe show due to open at the beginning of  this month. In announcing the cancellation, the Corcoran said it was attempting  to defuse the political controversy, but the decision itself caused such  disagreement that the gallery succeeded in potentiating it. Subsequently, the  Washington Project for the Arts, another private agency that receives national  endowment support, announced that it would host the Mapplethorpe exhibit.  </P> <P> To LACMA's Conisbee, the current crisis -- which observers of the national  endowment say is the first in the agency's nearly 25 years of existence  provoked by the visual arts -- has been intensified by the fact that  photography is a medium unknown in any previous period of history.  </P> <P> "We tend to associate photography with life," Conisbee said. "A photographer  has as much control (over subject matter) as any sculptor or painter, but  nevertheless, (photography) has a kind of immediacy or presence. It seems to us  not to deal so much with the idea as painting and sculpture.  </P> <P> "I think that, if you can imagine some of the Mapplethorpes done as paintings,  it would take some of the immediacy away. You know that, in the photograph,  you're seeing exactly what Mapplethorpe saw in his eyes.  </P> <P> "I find Mapplethorpe in a way not easy to look at. It takes you into a kind of  sexual underworld. They are disturbing images."  </P> <P> But having said that, Conisbee strides through a gallery at LACMA, stopping at  Rodin's "Iris, Messenger of the Gods," executed in 1890 and 1891. It is a  headless -- but otherwise anatomically explicit -- depiction of a woman,  standing, legs spread, with one knee thrust into the air.  </P> <P> "Rodin was deliberately playing the slightly sensational romantic artist's  role," Conisbee said. "He knew perfectly well he was going to shock people. A  lot of his work has a very autoerotic strain. There were drawings by him that  were completely explicit. He also acted out the role with his models. He was  famous for it."  </P> <P> To George Goldner, curator of drawings and acting curator of paintings at the  Getty, the history of art in terms of subject matter is a meandering stream of  sorts. "Each period defines what is sexually explicit a little bit  differently," he said. "There are periods when (sexual content) is rare, if  existing at all . . . periods when religious sentiment was preeminent. In the  15th Century, there were very few or no sexually explicit themes.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say that there has necessarily always been sexually explicit  subject matter, but I think for hundreds of years, there has been. We tend  probably today, in the 20th Century, to have more of that than was true in the  16th Century. There are complicated reasons for that that have to do with the  social role of an artist.  </P> <P> "In the 16th Century, painting was an essential medium of communication. Today,  artists are a bit more functionally out of the center of society, so there's a  tendency for the people who practice it to be a bit more unconventionally, but  I think one can easily exaggerate that.  </P> <P> "Going back to the 16th Century, there were artists who were unconventional.  There were homosexual artists in the Renaissance. There is no way of telling  whether the proportion is greater or less now than it was then.  </P> <P> "Mapplethorpe is more provocative than most artists have been. But we've all  been numbed by provocation, so you have to go pretty far to provoke."  </P></p>

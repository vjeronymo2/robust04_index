			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: Stiff upper lip from Italy, not Britain - London ITALY and Britain, both in currency trouble, reacted quite differently this week. One government went for the flashy, but perhaps ultimately empty, gesture. The other gritted its teeth, showed what it was made of, bit the bullet, and all those other public-school cliches. The country whose actions this week displayed operatic flourishes, is, of course, Britain; the one that displayed a dogged determination traditionally associated with John Bull is Italy. In the short term, there was no doubt which gesture impressed the markets more. Britain's decision to raise Ecu 10bn in loans to defend the pound pushed share prices up and market interest rates down. Italy's decision to defend the lira in a different, more painful way - by raising official interest rates for the third time this summer - led to hectic selling in the Italian market in after-hours share trading, with the market as a whole down 2 1/2 per cent. The announcement of the British borrowing came at 3pm on Thursday. That morning, the stock market had been moving upwards, anyway, as traders who had left themselves short of stock scrambled to cover themselves against a small burst of optimism about the British government's chances of avoiding an interest-rate rise. Then came the treasury statement. The pound jumped sharply, showing daylight above the ERM floor for the first time in weeks. Shares rose, too, with the FT-SE 100 index ending Thursday at 2381.9, up 38 points in 90 minutes. The speed of the markets' reaction owed a lot to the way the treasury and the Bank of England caught them by surprise. In their dog-eared files on defending the pound, civil servants will have come across a pile of memoranda dating back to Stafford Cripps which emphasise the first rule of currency defence: kick speculators where it hurts, in their wallets. That means catching them off-balance and driving sterling up sharply - a big enough move, carried out quickly enough to inflict real pain on anyone whose positions reflected an expectation of a weaker pound. In that, the authorities were eminently successful. They have probably re-established themselves as a credible threat - and that alone is sufficient to give sterling an element of protection in the two weeks before the French referendum. Italy faced a more difficult challenge. As one European observer of the currency markets put it: 'The polls show that there is a 50 per cent probability of a No vote in the French referendum. Since Italy will certainly have to devalue if the French vote No, that means there is a 50 per cent probability of a lira devaluation in three weeks' time. 'If you calculate the interest rates required to compensate for that risk, the numbers get pretty hairy. There has never, that I can remember, been such a high probability of a devaluation at a defined date.' Italy's difficulties, reflected in Friday's interest-rate rise, hang over the London markets, too. Higher Italian interest rates were one of the factors that led to a partial reversal of Thursday's rise in Friday's share trading. Unexpectedly awful US employment figures, raising the strong possibility of a further easing of US interest rates, also helped to weaken the pound and the stock market. Sterling closed the day unchanged at DM 2.80, down two pfennigs from its high and the same distance from the ERM floor. The FT-SE index closed at 2362.2, down 19.7 on the day and up 49.6 on the week. Lower US interest rates will increase the temptation to move out of dollars and into D-Marks, pushing up the German currency within the ERM and making life still more difficult for the currencies at the bottom of the system. By Friday, the immediate fears of a rise in UK interest rates had eased  - three-month money, at 10 5/16 , is only a quarter-point or so higher than base rates - but the treasury's Thursday coup had left at least some observers unimpressed. If sterling again were to come under ERM pressure, say the economists at SG Warburg, with most of the plausible shots in the Bank of England's armoury now fired, it would be 'increasingly difficult to see any alternative but higher UK rates.' A similar pessimism can be detected in a striking volte-face at Goldman Sachs: at the beginning of August, its European strategists put the UK top of their list of equity markets to buy in Europe; by September, with share prices 4 per cent cheaper, the UK had dropped to seventh place in a list of nine. Meanwhile, back in the real world, a flood of companies have been reporting their interim results. Overall, the numbers reflect a further worsening from an already depressed period of earnings last year. But manufacturing companies - doing better than their depressed cousins in the service and financial sectors - are starting to show an improvement in profits, and dividends are also holding up. This week, for example, Reckitt &amp; Colman announced a 5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Similarly, Burmah Castrol's profits gained 17 per cent, Cookson 100 per cent, T&amp;N 71 per cent, Bowater 19 per cent and Laird 43 per cent. One trend in the results has been the impact of the weak dollar on companies with big US operations or competition from companies in dollar-linked economies, such those in the Far East. However, companies which have been dollar borrowers are chalking up double gains: not only are US interest rates now at bargain-basement levels, but every dollar of debt service now costs a fifth less in sterling terms than it did in the summer of 1991. Hanson and Bowater - companies famous for their knack of borrowing in dollars and depositing cash in sterling - must be watching the currency markets' antics with an indulgent smile.</p>

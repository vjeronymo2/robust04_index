			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Chinese leader seeks close links with Kazakhs The Chinese prime minister, Mr Li Peng, arriving in Kazakhstan for an official visit as part of a five-nation tour, said yesterday that Beijing attached 'great significance' to relations with the former Soviet republic, Reuter reports from Alma Ata. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the vast nation which has a nuclear capability and borders north-western China, met Mr Li by the steps of an Air China passenger jet. Both leaders smiled, shook hands and reviewed a guard of honour. A statement issued by Mr Li spoke of renewing historic links which were strong during the time of the Silk Road, a trading route from China to Europe which began to flourish more than 2,000 years ago. 'China attaches great significance to developing relations with Kazakhstan,' he said in the written statement given to reporters at Alma-Ata's international airport. The nations share a border of 1,700km (more than 1,000 miles) and bilateral trade has soared since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. China is Kazakhstan's second biggest trading partner after Russia. In 1992 bilateral trade totalled Dollars 433m (Pounds 297m) but declined to Dollars 205m in 1993, according to official Kazakh figures. However, despite buoyant commercial ties, friction exists. Officially-sanctioned Kazakh groups protest at Chinese nuclear testing in Lop Nur, only a few hundred kilometres east of the Kazakh border. Militant ethnic Uigurs, who are seeking independence for China's north-western territory of Xinjiang, are active in Kazakhstan. This situation has drawn private protest from Beijing to Alma-Ata, foreign diplomats said. Li is nearing the end of China's first top-level tour of this newly independent region. He has been to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. After Kazakhstan, he will end his 12-day tour in Mongolia.</p>

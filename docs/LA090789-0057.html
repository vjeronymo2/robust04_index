			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> State agriculture officials have completed ground spraying of the pesticide  malathion in northern Santa Clara County and announced plans for an aerial  spray to battle an infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. Gov. George  Deukmejian told agriculture officials that he will declare a state of emergency  in Santa Clara County, agriculture department officials said. The emergency  declaration allows authorities to spray malathion without issuing an  environmental impact report that could take months to prepare, Curry said. The  state will also release 30 million sterile Medflies a week until biologists  decide that the infestation has been curtailed.  </P></p>

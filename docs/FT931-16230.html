			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Tokyo home prices in biggest fall since 1979 RESIDENTIAL property prices in Tokyo fell 14.5 per cent last year, the largest fall since an annual industry survey of prices began in 1979, and a sign of the pressure on financial institutions heavily exposed to the property market, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The MRD Nationwide Real Estate Information Centre said the sharp fall in Tokyo prices followed a decline last year of 13.5 per cent, while houses on the fringe of the metropolitan area saw a drop of 30 per cent in price. Prices in Osaka, the second largest city, fell 9.8 per cent, and officials at the centre said further declines are expected this year in both Tokyo and Osaka, as soundings of customer intentions suggested that many are not yet ready to enter the market.</p>

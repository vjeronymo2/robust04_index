			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> USX CORP. PROBLEMS CORRECTED, CHAIRMAN SAYS  </P> <P> USX Corp. Chairman David Roderick said today that the company has corrected  problems in the steel division that had caused steel profits to fall below the  company's expectations last year.  </P> <P> USX had predicted that its steel profits in 1988 would be about $60 per ton  shipped. But the US Steel unit, the nation's largest steelmaker, achieved a  profit of only about $40 a ton shipped. Roderick said the $60 level will be hit  this year.  </P> <P> Declines in tubular steel sales in the second half, higher than expected costs  and a fire at the large Gary, Ind., steelworks all hurt steel profit levels,  Roderick said in a briefing on the earnings report released Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We didn't quite do as well in running our mills in the second half as we did  in the first half," Roderick said. The start-up of a Fairfield, Ala., steel  plant cost more than expected, he said.  </P> <P> USX took a pretax charge of $101 million against fourth-quarter steel earnings  to cover the start-up of Fairfield, an adjustment to the costs of its major  1986 restructuring, retiree labor costs and other items.  </P> <P> Despite the charge the company reported a profit of $158 million on sales of  $4.4 billion in the quarter, contrasted with a loss of $14 million on sales of  $4.3 billion a year ago. In 1988 as a whole, USX net income more than tripled  to $756 million.  </P> <P> Charles Corry, who will succeed Roderick as chairman and chief executive on  June 1, said USX's earnings outlook for 1989 was better than 1988 but declined  further comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Divest Steel  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters, Corry said USX does not plan to divest its steel  operations, as some had speculated that it might do when it began a  restructuring two years ago to avoid a takeover by investor Carl Icahn.  </P> <P> Corry said he could not speculate about Icahn's intentions regarding USX. "He  can answer that better than I can," Corry said. "We can't say what his  intentions are."  </P> <P> Icahn, who holds 11.4% of USX, has not added to his holdings since acquiring  the stake in late 1986, Corry noted.  </P> <P> Corry said that he is not as close to Icahn as Roderick but that the three men  meet occasionally to discuss USX.  </P> <P> "Steel is definitely going to continue to be a part of USX," he said. But the  performance of the USS steel unit since its 1986 restructuring has not been  tested in an industry downturn, he added.  </P> <P> Roderick said the company will ship 1 million more tons in 1989 than the 12.2  million in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / First-day covers scheme welcomed The Office of Fair Trading has welcomed a Royal Mail plan to introduce a scheme to assist independent producers of first-day covers, Michael Skapinker writes. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the plan followed talks between the OFT and the Royal Mail after independent producers complained about how much they had to pay for stamps. Mr Anthony Buckingham, managing director of Benham, an independent first-day cover producer in Folkestone, Kent, said he had complained to the OFT that Royal Mail was charging almost the face value of the stamps. Mr Buckingham said the Philatelic Bureau, Royal Mail's in-house operation, had to pay only the production cost of stamps for its covers. Sir Bryan said the Royal Mail would introduce a scheme to enable independent producers to claim a rebate on stamps affixed and cancelled on their first-day covers. He added: 'I understand the Royal Mail will be consulting the independent producers about the handling of their first-day cover business with a view to introducing a rebate scheme early in the new year.'</p>

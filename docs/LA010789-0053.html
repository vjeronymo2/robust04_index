			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIMNEY SWEEPS;  </P> <P> A TOUCH OF LUCK FROM A SOOTY SLEEVE  </P> <P> The head of the chimney sweepers' union doesn't want to talk about the spurious  issue of good luck -- since superstition and time-worn tradition are not  officially regarded as recruitment incentives in the new world of socialist  reform and modernization.  </P> <P> The shortage of chimney sweeps in Prague is getting to be serious, and the  union chief tries hard to put a high-tech modern gloss on his discussion of the  problems of converting coal heaters to gas. But after all, this is not rocket  science.  </P> <P> "Just don't ask them about the superstition," he says hopelessly at last. "They  don't like it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whiff of Coal Smoke  </P> <P> There is a frost of early winter on the pitched rooftops of Prague as Pepa  Vitak and Vaclav Gebhart set out on their rounds. The sky matches the slate of  the roofs, and their breath hangs in motionless plumes. A whiff of coal smoke  gives its acid bite to the air.  </P> <P> They wear black flannel shirts, black pants, black shoes, white caps on their  heads. On belts around their waists are tin boxes filled with official forms.  Vitak carries the satchel with the coiled leather rope, the steel brush on the  end of the baseball-sized iron weight -- the trademark uniform and tools of the  chimney sweep.  </P> <P> And they are not 50 yards up the street before it begins. A little old lady,  her morning's shopping list clutched in a dimpled fist, looks up, spies them.  Her hand goes quickly to the button on her coat, her lips move silently.  </P> <P> She is making her wish.  </P> <P> Her smile, as she passes, is sly and grateful, as though she's been let in on a  secret.  </P> <P> Gebhart pretends not to notice. Vitak actually doesn't.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Human Good-Luck Charms  </P> <P> Gebhart has been a chimney sweep for 18 years, Vitak for 12. It seems a part of  the code of the chimney sweep, especially after so many years, is not to take  obvious notice of the fact that people regard them as human good-luck charms.  </P> <P> The notion that chimney sweeps are the agents of good fortune is an old  European tradition. The superstition holds that it is good luck to touch them,  wiping a fingertip across their sooty sleeves, or, when seeing them from a  distance, to touch a button and make a wish.  </P> <P> The effect of this, especially for a companion dressed up -- at the insistence  of Gebhart and Vitak -- in black flannel chimney sweep gear, is like spending a  day as a kind of enchanted person. People smile, murmur bashful greetings,  slyly finger their coat buttons, sneak a touch on a crowded sidewalk.  </P> <P> However quaint chimney sweeps may seem in America, in Czechoslovakia and most  of the rest of Eastern Europe, where houses and apartment buildings are often  heated by individual coal stoves, chimney sweeps are in high demand. In fact,  they are in such high demand that in some places, such as Poland, they are as  imperious in manner as star surgeons and, some would say, just as hard to find.  </P> <P> For example, there were 300 chimney sweeps working in Prague's state-run  chimney sweep enterprise 15 years ago. Now there are 190. There are 16 working  out of the office in Prague's Second District, where Gebhart and Vitak are  assigned. Gebhart says they need 25. Recruiting has gotten difficult, despite  the pay, which, at 4,500 crowns per month ($450), is above the national average  of 3,800 crowns.  </P> <P> "It's not the kind of work people want to do any more," Gebhart says. "They  want to wear white shirts and work in offices. They don't want to do work like  this, where you get dirty."  </P> <P> The backlog of work orders takes at least a week to fulfill, often longer, and  the demand continues to rise as more of Prague's residents seek permission to  convert from coal to gas heaters in their apartments. Such a conversion  requires an inspection from the chimney sweeps. Likewise, any apartment  remodeling that affects the heating system requires chimney sweep approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decidedly Cool Welcome  </P> <P> The first call of the day for Gebhart and Vitak is such a case, and the only  visit where their welcome is decidedly cool. On the fourth floor of a large  apartment building, a man had remodeled his apartment and, in the process,  blocked off three chimneys from other apartments and tapped into three others,  although, by chimney sweep rules, he was entitled to only one. Opening his  door, the apartment owner scowls as though a pair of large wharf rats had  materialized on the landing.  </P> <P> Just behind the chimney sweeps comes a delegation of three women from the local  housing authority. This is, it turns out, an old dispute.  </P> <P> The complaint comes from a poor single man of impaired intelligence living  downstairs, a man whom the rest of the building's occupants do their best to  look after. Now, his small room fills with smoke when he tries to use his coal  heater. For days, he has had no heat at all. His cramped room is frigid.  </P> <P> The situation is resolved, somehow, by the committee of women, who tell the man  downstairs that he will be moved to a new apartment and inform the man upstairs  that he is to be fined and directed to return the chimneys to their original  state.  </P> <P> It is the day's only sign of conflict. Over a mid-morning break of bean soup  and coffee in a neighborhood eatery, Gebhart says he and Vitak could have told  the man how to get around his problem, but, as on two previous visits, he tried  to deceive them, so they backed away and let the ladies of the committee have a  go at him. "He shouldn't have acted like a criminal," Gebhart says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frou-Frou and Filigree  </P> <P> They hurry on though the district, past once-lovely turn-of-the-century  apartment buildings, up stairways where panels of etched glass in moderne  designs look out over weedy gardens and where the iron scrollwork around  windows and stair railings whisper of a vanished age before communism, when  architects and builders could afford such frou-frou and filigree in privately  owned buildings.  </P> <P> "This is what our fathers left to us," says Gebhart, pausing before one of the  lovely etched windows. Then, on the next landing, where the window has been  replaced by a plain sheet of opaque glass, he adds, "and this is what we are  passing on to our children."  </P> <P> Vitak climbs through lofts filthy with pigeon droppings and onto tile roofs,  lowering his iron ball and brush down chimney pipes, and sits gazing over the  rooftops of Prague while he waits for Gebhart's answer on the two-way radio --  the one modern device in a chimney sweep's kit, one that saves much huffing up  and down stairs. The air is hazy with coal smoke, and the golden globes on the  Gothic spires of the city's churches wink in the wan sunlight. Prague is a  lovely city from any vantage point, but, from a chimney sweep's perch, it seems  especially magical.  </P> <P> "It's even better in the summer," Vitak says. "Then you have the girls, out  sunbathing on the rooftops. On days like that, you don't want to go back to the  office. You can stay up here all day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sprightly Woman of 92  </P> <P> Their last stop is the apartment of a sprightly woman of 92, her hair died a  brassy blonde, her enthusiasm for life undiminished by either her age or the  fact that she now lives her life entirely in one room, the kitchen of her  apartment, to save on coal. Her bedside table is crowded with medicines and  nostrums.  </P> <P> All she really wants from Vitak and Gebhart is to clean the ashes from her coal  stove, and to do it quickly enough so that she makes it to the weekly meeting  of her ladies' circle.  </P> <P> Vitak does the work, and Gebhart talks, looking over adored pictures of  grandchildren. "And this is my granddaughter, just graduated from medical  school."  </P> <P> In a few minutes, they are trooping down the stairs, meeting another elderly  lady on the way up. She stops on the landing and stares for a moment.  </P> <P> "Look at this," she says in a cooing, high-pitched voice. "Three little chimney  sweeps. What luck I am going to have today." She reaches out with a finger, as  though to strike a single note on a piano.  </P> <P> "Bing, bing, bing," she says, her voice like a bell, touching them as they  pass.  </P> <P> Powers, The Times' Warsaw bureau chief, was recently on assignment in Prague.  </P></p>

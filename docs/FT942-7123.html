			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (14): Biggest consumer market - Sao Paulo state accounts for more than 40 per cent of Brazil's industrial production / Three states tackle economic and social problems with a variety of approaches The state of Sao Paulo is Brazil's economic giant and the biggest consumer market in South America. With less than a quarter of Brazil's population it accounts for more than 40 per cent of industrial production and 37 per cent of gross domestic product. Paulistas, as its inhabitants are called, put that success down to one main factor: hard work. The more arrogant look down on what they regard as the decadent and workshy Rio de Janeiro as well as the under-developed and poverty-stricken north-east of Brazil. Sao Paulo's wealth was built on the 19th century coffee boom and the influx of immigrants from Europe, Japan and the Middle East. That was followed by a wave of immigration by job-hungry Brazilians from the north-east, who have helped swell the state's population to 35m. The city, at 17m, is the biggest in South America. In the 1950s, the economy's axis moved from agriculture to industry, with the arrival of car production, chemicals and other manufacturing to take advantage of the state's large population and enterprising workforce. The economy is today highly diversified, ranging from the manufacture of satellites to food processing. Sao Paulo's growing economic supremacy mirrored the decline in importance of Rio de Janeiro, which was partly caused by Rio's loss of the capital to Brasilia in 1960. 'Sao Paulo is the centre of gravity for Brazilian capitalism,' says Mr Pedro Paulo Branco, head of Seade, the state's research institute. But Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, the state governor, complains that part of Sao Paulo's wealth subsidises the federal government. 'We contribute 52 per cent of federal taxes while only getting 2 per cent back,' he says. Analysts put Sao Paulo's continued industrial success down to a good road and energy infrastructure, impressive universities and research groups and a strong business culture, founded on the dynamism of its immigrants. But there are problems. Sao Paulo's share of Brazil's GDP has fallen from 41 per cent in 1980 to 37 per cent in 1992, according to Seade, and there have been doubts about whether the state can continue its role as the engine driving the national economy. Part of the reduction in Sao Paulo's importance has been caused by neighbouring states such as Minas Gerais offering tax and land incentives to attract companies tired of Sao Paulo's over-saturated infrastructure and higher costs. However, Mr Branco says these companies are often in the agro-industrial or intermediate goods sectors and that capital-intensive and high-tech companies are still choosing Sao Paulo. Some business people say militant unions, particularly in the car industry, have contributed to companies moving out. Mr Jose Lopez Feijoo, president of the CUT union confederation in Sao Paulo, says the number of companies leaving the state because of strong unions is 'very small' and that for most companies the benefits of being close to Sao Paulo's huge consumer market are overwhelming. This point is echoed by Mr Robert Rennard, chief operating officer of Autolatina, the holding company for the combined operations of Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil. Mr Rennard adds that he expects higher labour costs in Sao Paulo to be offset by a reduction in regional wage differences in the car industry and that relations with the unions 'are maturing.' Large sectors of Sao Paulo's economy are not unionised, however, and unemployment stands at 15 per cent; about 1.2m workers. Some analysts believe that the state's social problems, particularly unemployment, will not be relieved significantly by economic growth because of a move towards more specialisation in industry. Outside the industrial sector, the city of Sao Paulo has consolidated its hegemony over Rio de Janeiro in financial services. The Sao Paulo stock exchange accounts for about 85 per cent of Brazilian share trading. The city's futures and commodities exchange had trading volume of more than Dollars 500bn in 1993. Since the 1970s, when Sao Paulo's stock market expanded after carefully targeting the growing new capital issues, there has been a trek of financial executives from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. Mr Ronaldo Nogueira, a director of the Brazil Fund investment trust who lives in Rio de Janeiro, says: 'Not being in Sao Paulo requires a certain effort and I find myself travelling there at least once a week on average.' The future for Sao Paulo clearly depends on the national perspective. If the Brazilian economy can be stabilised then Sao Paulo could become an even more important hub, analysts believe. They see the state as the anchor of a large industrial and trading region, helped by by the Mercosul trading bloc. The axis linking Sao Paulo with Buenos Aires, South America's two biggest markets, is regarded as a key part of this development. 'Other Brazilian states and countries like Paraguay and Bolivia will act as satellites, linking their growth to that of Sao Paulo,' Mr Branco says.</p>

At  the "People's Republic of China Soil Erosion Law Implementation  Regulations" press conference held in Beijing on 8 September  1993, Ministry of Water Resources minister Zhou Wenzhi [0719  2429 2535] stated with fervor that severe soil erosion is posing  a threat to our natural environment and national economy.    Zhou Wenzhi said that China is losing an estimated five  billion tons-plus of soil each year, equivalent to 17.5 million  mu of land cultivated to a depth of one foot. The total amount  of associated losses of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium  nutrients far exceed total chemical fertilizer applications in  China each year. According to incomplete statistics, during the  past 40 years we have lost 40 million mu of cultivated land due  to soil erosion, resulting in economic losses of about 10  billion yuan a year.    Zhou Wenzhi pointed out that improvement along with  destruction is an important cause of degradation of the soil  erosion situation. He said that since Liberation, it has  received a high degree of concern from the party and government,  and through the arduous efforts of vast numbers of cadres and  the masses, China has controlled an area of soil erosion  covering more than 500,000 square kilometers and major changes  have truly occurred in some places. However, at the same time  man-made destruction of vegetation has caused soil erosion over  an area covering about 20,000 kilometers each year, which is  equivalent to the area where soil erosion has been controlled in  China over the same period, basically offsetting achievements in  control. As the pace of development and construction has  accelerated and our population has grown, the rate of  destruction to soil resources by people has grown at a huge rate  and the soil erosion situation has worsened. To achieve a  fundamental reversal of this situation, we must rely on the rule  of law.    Evidently, the newly-promulgated "People's Republic of China  Soil Erosion Law Implementation Regulations" are important laws  and regulations matched up with the "Soil Conservation Law" and  they provide concrete provisions for the core regulations in the  "Soil Conservation Law" and strengthen their operability.</p>

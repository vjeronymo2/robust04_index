			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has told  Interfax that he will sign not only the NATO Partnership for  Peace program but also a protocol to another program,  Russia-NATO, worked out by Russian officials in Brussels on June  22.    Kozyrev will leave for Brussels on June 21. Kozyrev said his  main purpose in Brussels was to sign the protocol to the  Russia-NATO program.    Kozyrev may leave Brussels for Corfu instead of Moscow in  order to join Russian President Boris Yeltsin who will  participate in the EU summit and sign an agreement on  partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU.    A high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign Ministry's  All- European Cooperation Department told Interfax that the  Russia-NATO program transmitted to the NATO headquarters a month  ago was a "sound document reflecting our vision of relations  with NATO, Russia's place in Europe and in the world."</p>

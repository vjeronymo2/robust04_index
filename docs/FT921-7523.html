			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Observer: In the club Most people would agree with Labour's tribute to Britain's nurses whose dedication means they 'routinely do more hours than they are paid (for), staying on without overtime or working through lunch'. But when the new policy document 'Your Good Health' goes on to lavish praise on the consultants, Observer begins to feel a bit queasy. After all, many GPs attribute delays in treatment under the NHS to consultants who find lengthy waiting lists a useful marketing aid for their lucrative private practices. And consultants' working practices (not to mention their devotion to improving their golf handicap) are often responsible for under-use of hospital beds. Didn't Barbara Castle fall out with the consultants over their hours of work when she was Labour's health secretary in the mid-1970s? Not unreasonably, she wanted those who were paid by the NHS to work for the NHS rather than for themselves. Perhaps Robin Cook hopes to avoid such confrontations by this sort of sucking up - but Observer doubts whether it will cut much ice with the long-suffering NHS-user.</p>

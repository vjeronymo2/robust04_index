			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STIFF SENTENCES, FINES URGED IN S&amp;L FAILURE  </P> <P> The nation's top bank regulator has joined the U.S. attorney's office in Los  Angeles in recommending long prison sentences and payment of millions of  dollars in restitution and fines for two Orange County men convicted of causing  the collapse of a Santa Ana savings and loan.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office has recommended that John L. Molinaro and Donald P.  Mangano Sr. -- former owners of Ramona S&amp;L -- receive 55 years in prison  between them and pay a total $15 million in fines and restitution.  </P> <P> Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman appealed in a  letter to U.S. District Court Judge David V. Kenyon to give both men a stiff  sentence.  </P> <P> "I am particularly concerned that the sentences imposed upon Mr. Molinaro and  Mr. Mangano reflect the seriousness of their crimes and serve to deter others  from committing similar acts," wrote Seidman, who oversees failed thrifts as a  member of the Resolution Trust Corp.  </P> <P> In a sentencing memo submitted earlier this week, federal prosecutors said  Ramona's collapse "typifies the unbridled greed and insider corruption that has  so catastrophically harmed the savings and loan industry."  </P> <P> Molinaro and Mangano were both convicted in October on more than 30 counts of  bank fraud and conspiracy and are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Kenyon on  Feb. 5.  </P> <P> Ramona was taken over by regulators in 1986 and subsequently required a  $65.5-million bailout.  </P> <P> The Office of Thrift Supervision also sent a letter to Kenyon calling the  Ramona case "one of the most egregious examples of insider abuse that have  plagued the thrift industry during the past few years."  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein has asked Kenyon to fine Mangano  $1.5 million, order him to pay $6.8 million in restitution to the FDIC and give  him a 30-year prison term.  </P> <P> "From the moment he and Molinaro took over Ramona, Mangano's sole interest was  to steal as much of Ramona's money and property as he could," Zipperstein said  in a memo.  </P> <P> Michael E. White -- Mangano's attorney -- said he was shocked by the  prosecution's request.  </P> <P> "I think the recommendations are outrageous; they're excessive," said White.  "They are using Mangano as a scapegoat for the woes of the entire S&amp;L  industry."  </P> <P> Prosecutors have recommended that Molinaro receive 25 years in prison and pay  $7.8 million in fines and restitution. His attorney was unavailable for  comment.  </P> <P> Mangano, 53, of Huntington Beach, and Molinaro, 48, of San Jose, were found  guilty of carrying out a complicated real estate scheme using Ramona's funds  that was designed to enrich them personally. Prosecutors alleged in the  sentencing memo that Mangano stole $11 million from the thrift and Molinaro  more than $10 million.  </P> <P> "In effect they pulled off an enormous heist of their own bank," Zipperstein  said. "This case has once again demonstrated that a person with a briefcase can  harm society much more than can a person with a gun."  </P> <P> The Ramona case was the first criminal trial of owners of a failed savings and  loan in Southern California.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Handling of economy 'appalling' THE government's 'appalling mismanagement' of the UK economy will prolong the recession throughout this year according to economists at Liverpool University, Edward Balls writes. The latest forecast from Liverpool Macroeconomics Research expects output to fall by 0.4 per cent this year, with only a weak recovery in the final quarter. Unemployment is projected to reach 2.9m by the end of the year, and depressed demand for imports is expected to push the current account back into surplus. Professor Patrick Minford, director of the group, said the recession was being prolonged because UK economic policy was 'paralysed by the exchange rate mechanism'. The ERM was keeping interest rates high, in spite of falling inflation and low monetary growth. The group expects retail-price inflation to fall to an annual 2.9 per cent in 1992. Prof Minford is a member of the group of 'Liverpool Six' monetarist economists who have repeatedly called on the government to cut interest rates and leave the ERM. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and one of the six, endorsed the forecast, describing the outlook as 'decidedly bleak'. Forecast Vol 13, No 1 March 1992. University of Liverpool, PO Box 147, Liverpool L69 3BX.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Fixed-rate mortgages are just too popular - Lenders want to switch emphasis Fixed-rate mortgages have proved so popular with new borrowers that lenders have been trying gradually to shift attention back to their more profitable variable rates. Two years ago, 27 per cent of new mortgages had the interest rate fixed; this rose to 60 per cent between June and September 1993 (the most recent figure from the Council of Mortgage Lenders). 'We want a balance between fixed rate and variable rate business,' says Halifax, the largest lender which, with half its new loans on fixed rates, is below the market average. 'Too high a proportion of fixed rates leaves us with less flexibility if interest rates turn against us. We do not want to leave ourselves open to adverse market conditions.' Halifax offers first-year discounts of up to 3.5 percentage points on its variable rate of 7.64 per cent. Last September, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester introduced a one-year discount of 2 percentage points on its variable rate, which has been increased to 3 percentage points. This brings down the variable rate to 4.64 per cent to borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit. Abbey National has also brought in discounts of up to 2.25 points until July 31 1995 on its present variable rate. Northern Rock will post borrowers a cheque for Pounds 1,000 two weeks after they complete a mortgage with the society - but only if the loan is on a variable rate. Northern also gives discounts of up to 4.24 percentage points on the variable rate until April 1 1995. From Monday, Britannia building society will - for one week only - give a discount of 5 percentage points on its variable rate to those with a 25 per cent deposit. This brings down the rate to 2.75 per cent until January 1 1995. Britannia provided funds for essentially the same package marketed last week by mortgage broker John Charcol and Scottish Life. But there is a disadvantage in going directly to Britannia in that you would have to take out the society's buildings and contents insurance. Lenders are keen to focus attention on variable rates because, with base rates at 5.25 per cent and the standard variable mortgage rate at about 7.64 per cent, margins are much wider than on the fixed rates. 'The variable rate is more profitable for us because we launch fixed rates on tight margins to attract new business,' says C&amp;G. For borrowers, there is a danger that this shift of emphasis might mean that the choice of good fixed rates will begin to ebb. Nationwide, for example, has just launched some new fixed rates which are higher than those they replaced. The two and three-year fixes, available to all home-buyers, are 6.2 and 6.65 per cent and replace those of 5.99 and 6.45 per cent. This does not necessarily mean fixed rates have hit the bottom - many economic strategists expect base rates to fall further in the UK. But choosing a fixed rate now could be a good move. If, however, your own lender does not offer competitive fixed rates, the cost of re-mortgaging - moving from one lender to another - could be prohibitive. Alan Patten, senior property partner at London-based solicitor Harbottle and Lewis, says: 'A lender will treat a re-mortgage as a completely new transaction so it will want a new local search. 'There will be a land registry fee to pay and the solicitor's conveyancing costs for checking titles and preparing and registering the new mortgage. But at least there will be no stamp duty.' John Charcol estimates that typical costs on a Pounds 100,000 mortgage are Pounds 260 for the land registry fee, Pounds 100 for the local search and Pounds 225 for the conveyancing fee. Other costs include a mortgage valuation fee (about Pounds 225) although some some, such as Halifax, C&amp;G and Nationwide, will waive or refund this. There will be early redemption penalties if you are already on a fixed rate, a fee for the new fixed-rate mortgage, and a new mortgage indemnity premium. The latter is calculated on a percentage of the amount borrowed above 75 per cent of the value. Woolwich says a 90 per cent mortgage on a property worth Pounds 112,000 would incur an indemnity premium of Pounds 1,200. Lenders are usually happy to work through the figures to see if it is worth making a switch, and some make it easier financially than others to transfer. Midland bank, for instance, is offering to pay legal and valuation costs for home-owners switching before the end of the month to one of two of its fixed rates - a five-year fix of 7.25 per cent or a two-year fix of 5.95 per cent. There is no fee for the fixed rates but it will not pay indemnity premiums. John Charcol will pay the re-mortgage costs for those transferring to a five-year fixed rate of 6.99 per cent; it charges Pounds 250 instead of the typical costs on a Pounds 100,000 mortgage of more than Pounds 1,000. The offer is limited to those with a deposit of at least 25 per cent. Maximum loan size is Pounds 250,000 and the mortgage is with Bank of Ireland, which has a competitive variable rate of 7.6 per cent. There are no compulsory insurance-related products and the mortgage is available on all repayment types as well as being portable. Ian Darby, of John Charcol, estimates that people on high fixed rates would make substantial savings by switching. If someone took out one of the most popular fixed rates in 1992 - 10.65 per cent for five years - the cost of re-mortgaging with the John Charcol package would be Pounds 2,912 (comprising Pounds 2,662 for six months' gross redemption penalty and the Pounds 250 re-mortgaging fee). The customer would save Pounds 10,156 in lower interest payments over the three years left of the fixed-rate mortgage, leading to a net saving of Pounds 7,244. It would take just over 10 months to recover the cost of the mortgage. One caution, though: anyone considering a re-mortgage should check that they will not lose any tax relief.</p>

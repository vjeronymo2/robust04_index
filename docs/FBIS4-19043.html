			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  reiterated that in the future Germany has to be involved without  reservation in UN operations to secure world peace. Despite  setbacks, the United Nations was becoming "the central guardian  of peace for the human race," Kinkel said at the annual  conference of the German Society for Defense Technology in Bonn  today. Germany should not stand to one side in this, and has to  "come down from the spectators gallery." The foreign minister  added that the greater responsibility that Germany will be  taking on also makes necessary a "corresponding voice" as a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>

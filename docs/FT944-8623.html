			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Focus remains on outlook for US interest rates The Federal Reserve's move on Tuesday to raise short-term US interest rates remained at the top of the agenda yesterday. NatWest Markets commented that the move was a step in the right direction, representing 'a serious attempt to rein in an economy that is continuing to exhibit strength well above its longer term trend rate of 2 1/2 per cent'. However, it continued: 'While the Fed has assuaged immediate market fears that it is underestimating the inflation risks that the continued strength of the economy poses, it may have to do more to gain the bond market's respect.' James Capel suggested that the rate rise 'is likely to be the start of a more aggressive tightening phase by the Fed, rather than a signal that short rates are close to their peak'. A further increase of 25 basis points could come before Christmas, Capel added, if economic data continued to show signs of strength. FRANKFURT, back from a day's holiday, lost ground in the official session and saw the decline accelerate in the session after hours. The Dax ended with a decline of 8.06 at 2,102.69, seeing this widen to 2,091.94 in the Ibis session. Research from Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, forecast that there would be no year-end rally in German equities; and given that industrials had been trading on 18 times prospective earnings, a downgrading of optimistic 1995 forecasts might be expected because of underlying domestic economic weakness, rising commodity prices and a strong D-Mark. Mannesmann put on DM5.00 at DM406.50 after reporting a 9 per cent rise in nine-month sales, helped by strength in the telecoms sector. In contrast, Volkswagen retreated DM5 to DM455 after reporting that losses in the first nine months had fallen. Nomura noted that the strength of the company's recovery would start to show through in 1995 and 1996, while also benefiting next year from the launch of three new models. PARIS took to Renault as the car maker made its debut, closing the day at FFr184.90, against the offer price of FFr165. But aside from this the market overall was weaker, the CAC-40 index off 22.67 or 1.2 per cent at 1,927.53. Turnover rose to FFr4.5bn, while volume in Renault was above 9m shares. Although Peugeot lost FFr7 at FFr812, traders did not necessarily attribute this to switching into the newly listed car maker - Renault being seen as adding further robustness to the sector. Michelin declined FFr1.90 to FFr215.60 in line with the trend, and Valeo FFr1 to FFr280. MILAN continued to be buffeted by politics as the government ran into further problems in winning parliamentary approval for its budget plans. The Comit index fell 2.13 to 638.28. However, Mr Sushil Wadhwani at Goldman Sachs retained a bullish view of Italy on a one year basis, while accepting that the market still faced bumpy patches in the months ahead. 'Obviously there is a lot of nervousness, but there is also a realisation that the economic mountain has to be climbed,' he said. Mr Wadhwani noted that the market was historically cheap and viewed further weakness during periods of volatility as buying opportunities. He forecast a rise in the Comit index to the 750 to 770 level over the coming year. Ferfin gave up an early lead to finish L10 lower at L1,337 and Montedison slipped L25 to L1,212 as the group denied speculation of a merger as part of the restructuring programme. ZURICH failed to find direction, with the mood dampened by weaker bonds and the easier dollar. The SMI index settled 8.5 lower at 2,600.9. Swiss Re, however, picked up SFr5 to SFr775 as recent profit-taking by speculative buyers subsided. CS Holding bearers fell SFr18 to SFr532, below support at SFr545, amid rumours that the bank wanted to increase its stake in Swiss Re and planned a capital increase to finance the move. Brown Boveri picked up SFr5 to SFr1,114 ahead of today's nine-month figures. Analysts forecast a 22.5 per cent increase in nine-month group earnings and a further surge over the next two years as European economies picked up. UBS bearers eased SFr6 to SFr1,200 and the bearers were SFr9 lower ahead of next Tuesday's crunch shareholders' meeting. Holderbank dipped SFr11 to SFr1,057 on profit-taking after the recent strong gains. Merrill Lynch, which recommended the stock, saw the price at SFr1,200 over the next 12 months. The investment bank believed that peak earnings were not in sight for the group in 1996 for two main reasons: Holderbank was extending its geographical network in emerging countries every year; and Europe was awakening now and it still represented nearly 50 per cent of sales. DUBLIN continued to shrug off political developments and the ISEQ overall general index marked time after Wednesday's strong gains, adding 0.34 at 1,841.05. Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin noted that in recent years the markets had taken the view that what ever combination of parties formed a new government the economic policies to be pursued would remain unchanged. During the current hiatus, international investors, who had become increasingly important to Dublin's performance, had taken the same view.

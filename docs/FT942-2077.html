			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel fall slims margin over rights price Falling global stock markets created further difficulties for Eurotunnel's underwriters yesterday, as the registered shares fell a further 5p to 283p. This left a 7 per cent premium to the 265p rights price, with just two trading days before the Pounds 858m offer closes. Underwriters said this was 'enough to encourage an adequate take-up', and the nil paid shares, which stopped trading yesterday, stayed at 10p. Traders spoke of further short selling by hedge funds, and said that since it had become all but impossible to borrow Eurotunnel shares, short sellers would have to buy back in the stock market, pushing the share price higher. Mr Jean-Michel Plou, first vice president at Banque Indosuez, which led the French underwriting, said: 'I am more pessimistic than I was a week ago, but there are still grounds for optimism.' French investors, who account for the bulk of the bearer units - 75 per cent of Eurotunnel's issued shares - are not recompensed through a placing of the rump of the issue and their take-up is usually much higher. The institution with the most to lose is Swiss Bank Corp. SBC has Pounds 100m of the French portion of the underwriting, which carries the greatest risk, since institutional investors do not tend to sub-underwrite their exposure. The French underwriting syndicate was led by Banque Indosuez, and includes Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas and Credit Lyonnais, while the British syndicate was led by Morgan Grenfell and SG Warburg, and includes Robert Fleming and Salomon Brothers.</p>

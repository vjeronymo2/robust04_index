			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Arms control after Start MANY PEOPLE'S first reaction, on reading that the US and Russian foreign ministers yesterday reached agreement on 'a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty', may well be to think that an item from a few years back has somehow got itself reprinted. The age of such news reports seemed to have ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union a year ago. Yet only two weeks ago in Stockholm Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the same Russian foreign minister who initialled yesterday's agreement, sent shivers down spines with an unorthodox but rather effective hoax speech, giving the world a foretaste of what it should expect from his successor if anti-western forces in Russia were to regain the upper hand. That is certainly not to be ruled out, and the new agreement (which will not be fully implemented until the year 2003, or at best 2000) reminds us that Russia remains by far the west's most formidable potential adversary; so much so that the US can envisage cuts amounting to 50 per cent of its strategic budget, or nearly 10 per cent of its total defence budget, on the basis of reciprocity with Russia alone. Implementation cannot be taken for granted. Even if Mr Kozyrev's fears are not realised, and power in Moscow remains in the hands of people committed to reform at home and co-operation with the west abroad, the task of decommissioning so many strategic weapons will tax Russia's financial, technical and administrative resources to the limit; indeed, it is already asking for US assistance, which for this purpose Congress will probably be happy to provide. Last of its kind In any case, it can safely be assumed that this agreement will be the last of its kind. It marks the limit of what can be achieved by a bilateral US-Russian arms control process. From here on, nuclear arms control will be multi-lateral, as conventional and chemical weapons control already is. Already it would be true to say that the officially recognised nuclear powers are much more worried by the danger of proliferation than they are by the size and nature of each other's arsenals. This danger takes two forms. The classic one, which inspired the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the danger that hitherto non-nuclear states will acquire nuclear weapons. This danger has been significantly increased by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rapid run-down of its defence industries. While there is as yet no evidence that ready-made nuclear weapons are being sold to third-world countries, there can be little doubt that nuclear materials and above all skilled technicians are finding their way there. Intense eagerness The more novel danger is that new nuclear powers may be coming into existence by political fission as the former Soviet Union breaks up. During the past year much American effort and ingenuity has gone into heading off this danger by trying to ensure that ex-Soviet republics other than Russia renounce any nuclear pretensions. This effort was facilitated by the fact that most if not all Soviet nuclear weapons, wherever located, were under the control of Russian personnel; and also by the intense eagerness of all the ex-Soviet republics for western recognition and support. As far as short-range weapons are concerned, the effort has seemingly succeeded: by last May the US and Nato were able to certify that all such weapons had been 'repatriated' to Russian soil. But uncertainties persist about strategic weapons in Ukraine, and to a lesser extent in Kazakhstan and Belarus. Though all three of these states have promised to sign the NPT, none has yet done so; and Ukraine has yet to ratify the protocol associating it with the 1991 US-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start). None of these states can properly be called a nuclear power, in the sense of having operational command and control of the weapons on its territory, but Ukraine at least has the capacity to become such a power. So far, it is unclear whether Ukraine's leaders are merely holding out for more western aid or whether they wish to retain the option of building a nuclear deterrent to safeguard their national independence. Either way, the west's interest must be to persuade them that Ukraine's security can be better ensured by other means.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD TAKES WSC SOUTHERN DIVISION TITLE BY BEATING VALLEY, 36-10  </P> <P> Fried. Baked. Boiled. Bakersfield College isn't choosy.  </P> <P> The Renegades will take their potatoes any way they can get them.  </P> <P> Saturday at Valley College, the Renegades took their potatoes in a bowl -- as  in Potato Bowl.  </P> <P> Bakersfield, playing near error-free football, defeated Valley, 36-10, to win  the Western State Conference Southern Division championship. The Renegades  (8-0-2, 7-0-2 in the conference, 5-0 in the division), unbeaten in two years,  have accepted an invitation to play in the Potato Bowl in Bakersfield, probably  against Taft.  </P> <P> And Valley? The Monarchs (5-5, 5-4, 4-1), Southern Division runners-up, will  accept an invitation to the Western State Conference Bowl, most likely meeting  WSC Northern Division runner-up Southwest.  </P> <P> Against Bakersfield, Valley had all the ingredients of a loser -- four  turnovers, a blocked punt and 112 penalty yards.  </P> <P> Valley Coach Chuck Ferrero was so frustrated by the turn of events that he was  flagged in the fourth period for unsportsmanlike conduct when he persisted in  berating an official.  </P> <P> "The blocked punt and the interception return for a touchdown -- you can't do  that . . . against a good football team," Ferrero said.  </P> <P> The interception return Ferrero spoke of was a 61-yard, third-period jaunt by  Ty Bowden with an errant Trendell Williams pass. Coming as it did after Valley  had cut Bakersfield's lead to 22-10 on Louis Melancon's eight-yard touchdown  run with a blocked punt, Bowden's touchdown effectively ended any thoughts of a  Monarch victory.  </P> <P> Williams, who dislocated his left shoulder last week against Santa Monica,  relieved starter Mark Mengoni in the third period and completed seven of 14  passes for 104 yards.

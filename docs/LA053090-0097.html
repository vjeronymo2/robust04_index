			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIME MINISTER OKD IN TAIWAN AMID PROTESTS  </P> <P> The legislature confirmed a top general as Taiwan's new prime minister during a  raucous session Tuesday, and hundreds of opponents fought in the streets with  police, burned buses and tossed firebombs at government buildings.  </P> <P> At least 40 people, including 10 officers, were reported injured.  </P> <P> Police detained 10 people in the rioting, which paralyzed downtown traffic for  more than 12 hours.  </P> <P> Two police officers were hospitalized with serious burns from firebombs, police  said.  </P> <P> At the height of the clashes, about 600 demonstrators, many wearing headbands  with the slogan, "Oppose Military Intervention in Politics," fought roving  battles with about 5,000 riot police near the Legislative Yuan building. Police  used water cannons to try to subdue them, witnesses said.  </P> <P> What touched off the unrest was the approval of Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun  as the next prime minister. Legislators approved him by a vote of 186 to 27.  </P> <P> The vote was delayed seven hours as 21 members of the opposition Democratic  Progressive Party stormed the podium, threw the Speaker's chair from the dais,  kicked their seats in disgust and grabbed microphones from lawmakers of the  ruling Nationalist Party.  </P> <P> The opposition lawmakers, all wearing vests with Chinese characters reading,  "Oppose a Soldier Leading the Cabinet," occupied voting booths for an hour to  prevent Nationalist lawmakers from casting ballots. Several replacement voting  booths were torn down.  </P> <P> At one point, legislature Speaker Liang Su-jung called in 100 police officers  to restore order.  </P> <P> Hau, 70, the nation's only four-star general, was selected by President Lee  Teng-hui earlier this month to head the Cabinet.  </P></p>

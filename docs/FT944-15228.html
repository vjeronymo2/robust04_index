			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stakis hotels improve in last quarter Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, yesterday reported an encouraging performance in its hotel operations and some improvement in its casinos in the last quarter of its financial year. The company was issuing its first quarterly trading statement and will not produce its results for the year to October 2 until January 10 1995. In the hotels division there was a 1 percentage point rise in occupancy in the quarter to 77.9 per cent, whereas in the year there was a 1.2 points rise to 69.7 per cent. Stakis pushed up its average room rate by Pounds 1.57 in the quarter to Pounds 41.61 and by Pounds 1.89 in the year to Pounds 41.63. The average number of rooms available increased from 3,758 in the third quarter of 1993 to 4,201 in the third quarter of 1994, which reflects the acquisition of four hotels. However, Stakis said none of the newly purchased hotels had made a big impact on the result for the year. Two of them, the Arundel Hotel in West Sussex and the Bath Hotel, Avon, were only acquired in the summer. The Norwich Hotel, Norfolk, acquired in April, made a broadly neutral contribution and the Coburg Hotel in London, acquired in March, suffered from low margin tour business which had been accepted before the hotel changed hands. In casinos, attendances rose by 7 per cent over last year as a whole, but were up only 0.6 per cent in the quarter. Average spend per head on casino chips rose by 8.1 per cent to Pounds 134 in the quarter and by 6.8 per cent cumulatively to Pounds 126. Cash drop - the total amount spent on chips - was up 8.8 per cent in the quarter and 13.8 per cent in the year, mainly reflecting the addition of three new casinos in the Midlands. However, the gaming margin (the percentage of bets which the casino retains) fell by 0.8 percentage points to 17.3 per cent in the quarter, though it was 0.2 percentage points higher in the year as a whole.</p>

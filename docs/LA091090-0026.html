			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A SENTIMENTAL 'JOSHUA'S HEART' HAS A TWIST  </P> <P> "Joshua's Heart," airing at 9 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, is unabashed  romantic bathos with a slight twist.  </P> <P> This Melissa Gilbert vehicle about a woman who finds it more painful to be  separated from her boyfriend's 10-year-old son than from her boyfriend, takes  off midway to become the story of a little boy looking for his piece of the  Norman Rockwell dream.  </P> <P> Gilbert is Claudia, a commercial artist and struggling children's author. She  meets busy architect Tom (Tim Matheson), who moves her into his classy beach  home as live-in lover and surrogate mom to Joshua (Matthew Lawrence, an  outstanding child actor).  </P> <P> The romance breaks up, but Joshua, lonely and needy, who adored Claudia, calls  the local child welfare services and offers himself for adoption, to be with  Claudia.  </P> <P> Enter Joshua's mom, a dancer who ran away when he was 5, but who now wants a  second chance with her son. Enter too, a psychiatric social worker (Lorinne  Vozoff) to investigate whether Josh is being abused or neglected.  </P> <P> From here on, it's Lawrence's film, not Gilbert's, as the plot focuses on  Josh's quest for emotional security.  </P> <P> The dialogue can be wince-making -- "You're so lovely, bright, shining and lit  up from the inside" -- and the ending is shamelessly sentimental, but the cast  often rises above the soap suds, and Susan Cuscuna's script has several telling  moments.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran's Economic and Moral Support"] </F>   [Text] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Iranian  spiritual leader Ayotallah Khamina met the other day and agreed  that the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN  resolution. In addition, they agreed that the Afghanistan,  Palestine, and Bosnian issues should also be resolved according  to the wishes of the people there.    The history of Pakistan and Iran's friendship is very old.  In  addition to Iran and Pakistan's social and religious  relationship, they are good neighbors. Iran helped Pakistan in  every difficult time. The people of Pakistan have not only  praised their Iranian brothers, but have increased mutual  relations with them. Especially after the Islamic revolution,  led by religious leader Ayatollah Rohella Khomeini, Iran  supported Pakistan on every critical occasion. Iran later had to  fight a cold war after its revolution. The imperialist agents  tried to throw obstructions in the path of Iran's revolution,  and hurt Iran both politically and economically. Still, the  Iranian government never hesitated to provide moral and material  support to their Muslim brothers in Pakistan. Mr. Hoshemi  Rafsanjani, the president of Iran, and spiritual leader  Ayotallah Khamina have great love and respect for Pakistani  Muslims, and have expressed it on several occasions.    Madam Benazir Bhutto said on arrival in Iran that it was her  second home, and that she did not consider herself a foreigner  there. That is why Madam Bhutto, in both her administrations,  made visits to Iran her first priority.    During Madam Bhutto's recent visit to Iran, several  agreements were signed between the Pakistani and Iranian  governments. They also agreed to accelerate action on the  agreements signed in the past. Iran has strongly condemned the  Indian government over Kashmir, and has emphasized resolving  this issue by providing self-government to the Muslims there.  Iran expressed great concern over the atrocities being committed  Muslims in India and other countries. The reaction that Iran's  government expressed at the destruction of the Babri Masjid in  India last year serves as a lesson to other Muslims. During the  meeting between Benazir Bhutto and Ayatollah Khamina, the  prayers delivered by the spiritual leader made the Pakistani  people respect him and pray that the roots of the relationship  between Pakistan and Iran become immortal in history.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Pakistani troops free child hostages Pakistan's elite commandos last night rescued five schoolboys and their teacher and killed three Afghan gunmen who had been keeping them hostage at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad. The rescue ended the 39-hour drama which began with the kidnapping of 67 children and seven teachers in a school bus, in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar on Sunday. During yesterday's five-second operation, at least seven commandos threw stun grenades and then shot the hijackers at close range. Earlier military and civilian officials persuaded the gunmen to release 62 children and six teachers. However, one of the gunmen threatened to kill their captives by noon today unless they were paid a ransom of Dollars 5m and were provided with military helicopters to fly to Afghanistan with the hostages.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): White Horse shows a lot of bottle - Efforts to promote Scotch whisky United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company, sold more bottles of its White Horse Scotch whisky in Japan in the final quarter of 1991 than in the preceding nine months. It was the first evidence that a Pounds 2m, three-year investment in repackaging the product was paying dividends. For more than 100 years, White Horse has been one of the industry's leading brands. Sir Peter Mackie, the Scottish distiller who launched it in 1890, gave it a distinctive taste by using three particular malts in the blend - Lagavulin from Islay, and Craigellachie and Glen Elgin from Speyside. At a time when most distillers branded their products with their family names, he also distinguished his whisky from competitors by naming it after an Edinburgh tavern. The White Horse brand rapidly gained popularity and sales as a result. Today, Mackie's original blend is one of the top 10 Scotch whisky brands, with total sales of 2m cases a year in about 100 countries. The brand, part of UD's portfolio since the takeover of DCL in 1986, occupies different positions in several markets. In the UK, for instance, it is a 'value-for-money' brand, priced between UD's market leader, Bell's, and the cheaper Vat 69. In Japan, White Horse leads the premium blended sector, selling at Y3,800 (Pounds 13) a bottle compared with Johnnie Walker Red, Cutty Sark and J&amp;B, at about Y2,500. But UD's global marketing, with local adaptations, has been based on the brand's long-established appeal to consumers. Advertising campaigns have focused on the distinctive taste of the whisky and the images of freedom and independence conveyed by wild white horses. Three years ago, however, signs of a weak link in the marketing mix emerged from consumer research in all the White Horse markets from Japan to South Africa and South America. David McNair, UD's brands director, says: 'The consistent message coming back to us was that the packaging no longer did full justice to the brand'. The bottle - a standard design in clear glass - and the labelling had been largely unchanged for 30 years. They were seen as outdated, no longer reflecting the brand values conveyed by the advertising. New designs were developed and consumer reaction to them was researched in the UK and other European countries, Japan, South America, and South Africa. One design - a squat, slightly bell-shaped bottle - won approval for its distinctive and contemporary appearance in every market but one. Japanese whisky drinkers overwhelmingly plumped for an alternative: a tall bottle with a short, angular neck. The importance of the Japanese market persuaded UD to introduce the preferred design last September. The rise in sales that has followed may exaggerate the effect of the change, but there is no doubt the initial impact on the market has been considerable. In the UK and other world markets, the brand will be progressively re-launched this year in the short, squat bottle, with a crisper, cleaner look to the labelling. UD's bottling lines in Glasgow have been modified and every aspect of the design has been rigorously tested from its appearance on a supermarket shelf to its ability to withstand the roughest handling. The grooming of the White Horse has been a long, painstaking, and expensive business but UD believes it will have greater appeal to consumers worldwide as a result.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Strasky, minister of transportation and </F> deputy chairman of the Civic Democratic Party: "The Czech  Republic: A State of Regions, Communities, and Citizens"]    [Text] The search for the role, shape, and organization of  the state's participation in its administration is older than  civic society itself. It ensues neither originally nor today  from the citizen's interest, which is why this argument should  not be overestimated or misused. It originates--and this origin  can be felt to this day--from the conflict between the interest  of the center (the king, the president, the assembly, the  parliament, the government, or a conqueror or occupier) to  enforce central power uniformly, effectively, and with the  requisite dose of integrity, irrespective of how the wielders of  the central power took hold of that role (whether by conquest or  by means of democratic elections) and the interests of citizens  with ambitions who are convinced that they have less  administration (power) than they should.    Experience confirms that, on the one hand:    --Mistakes, errors, or weaknesses of the center influence  the  stability of the whole and have often been an important or even  the decisive cause of its demise (because they always get into  contact, often clash, and occasionally get into conflict with  neighboring wholes).    --No reform of the whole's arrangement is permanently  satisfactory because it is not and, by its very nature, cannot  be perfect.    --The only thing that is constant and permanent is the  incessant reform of administration and the endless search for a  perfect model, even if this search always moves within bounds  that are very inaccurately labeled as centralization and  decentralization.    On the other hand, experience shows that, no matter how  praiseworthy the intentions to transform the administration  organizationally may be, they always produce a provisional  arrangement and not "the final word," from which follows, on the  one hand, that there is no need for any overhasty action and, on  the other (or on the same?), that it is necessary to responsibly  and conscientiously consider what is really unbearable and what  is functional about the administration, for whose reform one is  calling.    The risk in giving such advice is that you can be  immediately  asked, as minister and as deputy chairman of the party that at  the moment has the greatest share of power in this state, in  whose interest you are cautioning restraint. The only thing I  can say in response--because I will not furnish a single piece  of evidence to back this up--is that it is my right as a citizen  of this country, one, moreover, with a lifelong career as a  civil servant. I admit thereby, seemingly at variance with my  introductory words, that, in a civic society, the organization  of the country's administration does affect the citizen: He  wants to be represented and "served" by good, accessible,  intelligible, and competent bodies that are not too costly to  run. The target of a civic society (which we carry in our heads  and against which we gauge the attained reality) is the idea of  a sovereign citizen who decides, precisely in the interest of  his individual sovereignty, to tolerate, by means of indirect  (representative but controllable) democracy, only as much power  above himself as will allow him to be a sovereign citizen and  individual in this world.    The formation of lands (regions) is laid down in our  Constitution and the current dispute concerns only their size  and role. The fact that any internal state arrangement is  unsatisfactory--for which there are authentic as well as  demagogic arguments--permanently exerts an influence. We have  no shortage of ambitious people (which is so good that, as is  often the case, it becomes bad at times). We all speak from  positions in which we find ourselves and in the name of the  chances that present themselves. What unites us is the  experience and conviction that the state administration can and  must be better than it is now. And because there does not exist  a single solution to this task, politics gets a hearing.  Personally, I do not believe that it is in the citizen's  interest to have above himself more, rather than fewer, tiers of  power, that it is in the citizen's interest to have a weak  state, and that, under Czech conditions, having a large region  is a suitable way of bringing the state and the citizen closer  to each other and the best way of bringing the country's  administration closer to the citizen.  <H5>  State and Communities </H5>   The territory of the Czech Republic is administered by the  state and by the communities. The state is represented by the  head of state, parliament, government, the heads of central  bodies of state administration who are not headed by a minister,  the heads of bodies of state administration who do not operate  nationwide (such as the director of the Labor Office, the  Agriculture Ministry's Regional Department, or the Road  Administration and Maintenance Authority), and the chairmen of  district offices as the "uniform" body of state administration  in a given territory. Communities are administered through  their elected representatives, besides which they perform, with  their staff, some duties of state administration in their  territory (the so-called authorized communities perform these  duties on the designated territory of several communities).    There are many reasons for the citizen to administer and to  be administered by only the community and the state. The  "dividing line" is visible and historically stable here,  although I hasten to add that even here it is not beyond  dispute. It is not only changing but also oscillating [prolina  se], most probably in mutual interest.   <H5>    Size of the Communities </H5>   For the division of administration between the state and the  community to be balanced, competent, and, hence, satisfactory to  the citizen, the community should be of a certain size that will  guarantee its qualification potential [kvalifikacni potencial]  and, last but not least, also the necessary financial resources.  This prerequisite is not met in our conditions. This inevitably  complicates and restricts a uniform and broad delineation of  communities' powers (the sole authentic bringing closer of the  administration to the citizen). It is extremely difficult  uniformly to devolve the widest possible powers to communities  with a population of more than 100,000 (of which we have seven  in the Czech Republic) and, simultaneously, to communities with  a population of under 200 (of which we have 1,621 in the Czech  Republic, which is 26 percent of all communities). Of the 6,196  communities in the Czech Republic, 4,946--that is, a full 80  percent--have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants (do not let these  communities be angry with me, but, personally, I would regard  this number as the absolute minimum). Without discounting the  "Moravian issue" and the traditionalists' argument of a return  to the land arrangement [zemske usporadani], I personally  believe that the project of regions--that is, the idea of  inserting a regional tier between the state and the  community--is to a large degree a result of the large number of  small communities in the Czech Republic. The large number of  small communities makes administration solely from the level of  the state and the community more controversial and the need for  a regional tier more urgent and justifiable. At the same time,  it is evident that changing this situation cannot be an  ephemeral administrative ambition but a matter of long-term  development.  <H5>  Why Region </H5>   There are at least two reasons for the citizen to administer  and to be administered by not only the tier state and the tier  community, but also the tier region. The outcome of the  discussion on regional arrangements depends on which viewpoint  we prefer and which is stronger and more urgent.    The first argument is based on the assertion that the state  (the government, the parliament) is too remote from the  citizens, who live in diverse (mutually unrelated) conditions,  for it to be able to fulfill so many of its powers "from  Prague." It is being said, in support of this argument, that  even today the state is addressing this problem by establishing  outlying regional workplaces of individual central bodies of  state administration, whose task is to perceive and respect  local conditions and local differences more distinctly than the  center can. A subject of polemics is whether there should be  more such "feelers" at the "regional" level (that is, whether  there should be about 10 of them) or at the "district" level  (that is, whether there should be several dozen of them). My  reply in this respect is unequivocal: Because the main burden  of state administration is carried by the district office and  the other special (not uniform) local bodies of state  administration (regardless of whether their number exceeds, or  falls short of, the number of districts) are only a divergently  justified supplement, the district represents even today the  prevailing local dimension of state administration. Therefore,  we should base our considerations on the assessment of the  functionality of this tier (and its size).    The second argument is that the community is too remote from  the state. The idea of a citizen deciding by his (electoral,  civic) vote who will administer Zadni Lhotka with its 60  residents and the Czech Republic with 10 million inhabitants  (and nothing in between) is a strong motive for the  establishment of regions. The citizen's interest undeniably  reaches beyond the borders of (particularly small) communities.  If a citizen is to entrust the administration of everything  "beyond the community" to the state, he is raising the, in my  opinion justified, question of whether the "power above him" is  not too far away and too insensitive to his civic situation, to  which belong "everyday issues" such as transportation to the  nearest city, the retail network, health-care establishments,  higher-level schools, and so forth. The community (in its Czech  shape) is mostly too small to ensure his needs and demands,  while the state is too big and too remote to ensure them with a  feeling for local conditions.    The attentive reader will surely have noticed that,  actually,  we are not dealing with two problems but with two views of the  same problem, according to the example of the "half-full" or  "half-empty" glass: A view "from the center," which is "only"  being decentralized and parceled out with the establishment of  regions and the view of the citizen (community), who (which)  feels the need to influence matters "beyond the community" more  directly than through the medium of the government or  parliament. A solution to this "clash" has lain thus far, above  all, in the district office (a small government with limited  powers, whose application is restricted to a certain territory)  and the district council (an assembly of representatives of  communities of a given territory), which is, in my opinion, the  most controversial element in the present system of  administration of the Czech Republic, an element that is the  furthest from the ideal of functional perfection.   <H5>    What Is a Region? </H5>   It is time to try to express wherein the planned regional  arrangement differs (of course, according to the ambitions of  individual proponents) from today's district-based  administration of the country. This is difficult because,  according to the final shape chosen, it can differ from it  either in quantitative terms only (that is, the decisionmaking  horizon of the region in the sphere of administration would be  expanded) or in qualitative terms as well (that is,  decisionmaking would differ from region to region). We might  call the first option, rather imprecisely, decentralization  (decisionmaking according to, and within the framework of,  uniform rules, while paying heed to local conditions), while the  other comes close to the term parceling (decisionmaking  according to different rules). The prevalent idea is that the  regional body (unlike today's district office) would not decide  at the state's behest (that is, according to uniform, centrally  controlled and sanctioned rules), doing so only with greater  sensitivity [than the district office] (that is, with greater  ability to differentiate between specific situations), but that,  within the framework of jurisdiction that will be vested in  regions by law, it will decide with irrevocable and specific  powers. This idea arises from the thesis that the region will  also have its own property--that is, that, apart from state,  community, and private ownership, there will also be regional  ownership.    This can best be illustrated by an example coming, as in  most  cases, from transportation. Should the law on regions transfer  into regional ownership--for example, today's state third-class  roads and local railroad tracks--regional bodies will decide  which of these roads and railroads will be abolished, which will  be built anew, which will be repaired today and which later. I  have deliberately chosen a (seemingly) politically neutral  example, one that is realistic and even probable (incidentally,  in the sphere of road repairs we almost find ourselves in this  situation already). Nevertheless, from the national point of  view (from the point of view of the citizen of the Czech  Republic), even this example is not free of risks. The decision  to abolish (or even only temporarily close) roads because the  region does not have the money to repair them right now will, to  a greater or lesser extent, also influence the transportation  possibilities of the inhabitants of other regions. Let me point  out that I do not cite this example as an argument against  regions but exclusively for the sake of illustration.    A region--let us attempt a nontraditional definition--is a  partial territory of the state, with its own administration in  designated areas, above which are the laws of the Czech Republic  (of course, these laws must not be in conflict with the regions'  powers; on the other hand, the regions' legislative initiative  is foreseen--that is, the possibility for them to submit draft  laws to parliament). In conformity with the regions' powers  must be, self-evidently, also their responsibility and financial  provisions. Let me cite an example regarding responsibility:  If responsibility for transportation services on their  territory is vested in regions (that is, responsibility for  citizens being able to use public transport to get to work,  school, the doctor, and so forth), something the new law  transfers to district offices (in their capacity as state  bodies, however, and not as bodies of regional administration),  no one should any longer address any complaint to the president  or the minister of transportation that some bus route has been  abolished because, in a consistent regional arrangement, neither  of them can do anything for the citizen in this matter. The  complaint will have to be addressed to the appropriate regional  "minister of transportation" and regional deputy.    However, for the region to be able to bear final powers and  responsibility (independent of the state and the community), it  must avail itself of a firm and stable flow of financial  resources. There is, however, one snag in this, the preservation  or elimination of which must be thought through very  consistently: If a uniform nationwide system of taxation,  coupled with the necessary flow of resources into the budgets of  communities, regions, and the state, is to be preserved, this  can only be accomplished by means of "apportionment" (percentage  share) of taxes according to fixed rules and a uniform  nationwide tax policy. Otherwise (for example, in the event of  regionally divergent taxes being levied in the interest of  ensuring the region's autonomy), the "solidarity principle"  (responsibility of the rich for the poor) would be abandoned  within the framework of the state and replaced by citizens of  the region [sentence as published]. A citizen of the Ostrava or  Most area (should they become regions) would have to pay more in  taxes than a citizen of the Pardubice region, for example, so  that his "regional government and parliament" can live up to  their responsibility for the region, even if those "needs of the  region" came about as a consequence of activities (such as coal  mining) benefiting the state as a whole. Those who consider the  claim exaggerated that the regionalization of the Czech Republic  beyond a certain very fragile limit amounts to the parceling of  the Czech Republic with all its consequences are not playing  fair with the citizens of the Czech Republic.    To claim that the regionalization of the state is not  possible and that there exist no reasons in its favor would be  equally insincere. Quite the contrary, there do not exist any  absolute reasons for, or obstacles to, any solution whatsoever;  what exists, however, are absolute consequences arising from  every solution. After decades of centralist obfuscation, the  idea of "introducing transparency" is only understandable,  justified, and popular. Its immediate and definitive  realization is naive, however, and, what is more, dangerous. We  can let ourselves be inspired today by the regionalization of  Austria, U.S. federalism, or the territorial division of Great  Britain. In all of these cases, we encounter long strings of  historical events that led to the situation that exists today.  These examples confirm that everything is possible when it is  necessary for historical reasons. They do not confirm, however,  that all "models" are equally beneficial. The exact opposite is  the case. These models are the consequences of historical  development, which have retained up to the present a certain  strength that needs to be respected.    From this viewpoint, only "Moravia" has any certain  legitimacy in our conditions. Because of the subtlety of this  issue, however, I do not want to assess it in this place. I can  only say that Rajhrad [in Moravia] is as dear to me as Svata  Hora [in Bohemia] and Wallachia [Moravian region] as dear as  Sumava [Bohemian region]. The legitimacy of the Hradec  Kralove-Pardubice, Zatce-Louny, or (to stick to my Sumava)  Prachatice-Vimperk rivalries is not, historical reminiscences  notwithstanding, of such a nature as to warrant the formation of  regions. The legitimacy of the South Bohemian or the West  Bohemian Land is nonexistent, in my opinion, and almost  grotesque. While Carinthia or Bavaria are historical phenomena  that, for reasons that I am unable to assess, are reflected in  the regional arrangement of Austria or Germany, the lands of the  Czech crown are a phenomenon that will not be negligible even in  the third millennium. When contemplating the possible  uniformity of a united Europe, we do not express our  apprehensions as West Bohemians or as Central Europeans--and, as  far as I am concerned, I am not expressing these apprehensions  as a West Bohemian by birth, a Praguer by residence, or a South  Bohemian by sentiment--but as citizens of the lands of the Czech  crown. with our legacy, historical burdens, and inspirations,  with which we want to enrich Europe while preserving ourselves  as a single and differentiated whole, as a Europe of Greeks,  French, Scots, and Norwegians, but not, for God's sake, a Europe  of East Bohemians and South Moravians.  <H5>  What To Do With the Regions Today </H5>   We live in the year 1994. We are winding up the  transformation of our economy and want it to hold its own in  contemporary Europe. Our citizens are exposed to changes that,  in some social groups, are at the edge of tolerability. We want  to turn slaves of communism into proud and honest entrepreneurs,  duped workers into self-confident authorities in their  respective fields, kolkhoz farmers with no responsibility into  efficient providers of food for the nation, and servile (and  unpopular) bureaucrats into kind administrators of this country.    I am convinced that, in the effort to tackle the issue of  the  country's regional arrangement too rashly and radically, we are  taking upon ourselves a disproportionately heavy burden.  Insufficient preparation, ambition-filled impatience, and  short-term political calculations are driving us into  conventional solutions following up on the "traditions of  regional national committees." Because we will probably not find  the courage (apparently by right) to abolish districts, a costly  three-tier system will come into being. This system had been  challenged (in my opinion rightly) even under totalitarianism  (under conditions of the much larger Czechoslovak Socialist  Republic, where three tiers were more appropriate than in  today's Czech Republic). Even without regions, owing to the  influence of the new roles of the state in a democracy and in  the period of transformation, the state administration employs  more people now than it did before November [1989].    In spite of this, I am convinced that both conditions and  reasons exist to take the first step toward regionalization, a  step that, on the one hand, would lead to decentralization (the  bringing of the state administration closer to citizens) and, on  the other, to the "de-etatization" of some decisions, with the  aim of greater respect for local conditions and differences,  without at the same time exceeding the tolerable extent of  risks, to which I have attempted to draw attention, and without  causing an excessive growth of costs.    The solution lies in today's district arrangement. Next year  should be used to amend this system. At some places it appears  to be appropriate to merge districts and in other places to  partition them. The extent of corrective action should not  cause a "great shock."    1. In the first step, the territory of the district will  become a region.    2. A law will define the regions' powers, which should be  broader than those of today's districts.    3. The subsequent year will be devoted to the practical and  organizational preparation, to adjustments to the system of  taxation, the budget system, and so forth.    4. The elections of 1996 will establish regional  self-administrative bodies with, let us say, seven to 20  regional deputies.    The adoption of this proposal is based on two prerequisites:    a) The large number of regions, which is evidently in  contrast with the idea laid down in the Constitution.    b) The perception of the region as an entity centering on  the  regionally warranted allocation of mostly centrally acquired  (that is, acquired according to uniform rules) financial  resources.    I regard the first point as a serious problem--the large  number of regions will not do away with the problems of  management. A solution would lie in a reduction of the number  of regions to approximately a third. This, however, cannot be a  realistic task for a year or two, if we do not want to put off  regionalization completely. It can, however, lead to another  step, which, in my opinion, will depend on whether it will be  accompanied by the concentration of communities. Such a  concentration would simultaneously make it possible to expand  community administration. Objections to the second point can be  expected only from those who suffer from the illusion that the  region can be not only an independent administrative entity but  also an independent economic entity, which spends on its  territory resources that it itself has generated. Small regions  expose the naivete of such an expectation more than big ones.  There is no room here for a more comprehensive argumentation  against this idea. The disruption of the "solidarity  principle," on which the state is based (as is, in the  "downward" direction the community, and in the "upward"  direction Europe), is not only selfish from the human point of  view but also dangerous from the point of view of the state's  integrity. It follows from the perception of the first  regionalization step that the region would allocate resources  rather than own and dispose of regional property.  <H5>  In Conclusion </H5>   The train of regional euphoria has been set in motion, and  it  is difficult to jump onto it while it is moving. It already has  its political dimensions, with risks of labeling, and is driven  by a certain distribution of political forces. It could really  happen that we will be parceled out and will engage in disputes  about connecting the East Bohemian and North Moravian highways,  in the same way as we are currently engaging in a dispute about  a bypass around Plzen. I would only like to protest  emphatically against the view that the formation of large  regions will bring the administration of the country much closer  to the citizen. Plzen bureaucrats and West Bohemian deputies  are as far away for the inhabitants of Kvilda or Bozi Dar as are  Prague bureaucrats and Czech parliamentary deputies. I concede,  however, that the perspective from Plzen, Pardubice, or Olomouc  may be different. By pointing out that the reform of the  territorial and administrative arrangement is not a "task to be  resolved before the next elections," but an eternal task, I  wanted to call for circumspection and for the phasing [fazovani]  of all amassed ambitions.</p>

The  demonstration took place while opponents to President Gnassingbe  Eyadema yesterday claimed an overall victory in the elections  and affirmed that they had won the absolute majority of seats in  the National Assembly.    The Interior Ministry later denounced irregularities in five  of the 81 constituencies concerned -- including Lome -- by  implicitly suggesting the cancellation of the vote in those  constituencies where the opposition won all the seats, according  to unofficial sources.    The demonstrators were not wearing any distinctive signs to  show their political affiliation. After crossing Adewui  district, in the north of the administrative and commercial  center of the city, they commandeered five vehicles and began  roaming the streets chanting: "We Demand Justice. There Is Too  Much Fraud. Cancel The Elections Right Now. If They Are Not  Canceled, We Will Break Everything."    About 20 policemen and gendarmes arrived on the scene  shortly  after 1100, an hour after the demonstration started. They  negotiated with the young people, seized the vehicle keys, and  rounded them up without any brutality near the market.    At 1130, a man, who seemed to be leading the demonstration,  tried in vain to calm down his comrades who continued to chant  their slogans. He was dressed in a blue overall and the blade  of a hatchet was sticking out of his pocket.    Questioned by AFP, a police commissioner present at the  scene  said the young people should not be arrested because "it could  to a degeneration in the situation. We should try to reason  with them," he said.    By midday, the young people were still demonstrating and the  Adewui district inhabitants slowly came out of their homes to  join in the demonstration. In neighboring districts, streets  were empty and shops were closed. Two jeeps with a dozen French  and Burkinabe observers on board kept their distance from the  demonstration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- The General Labour Confederation's (CGT)  Central Confederate Committee yesterday [29 December] gave the  green light for its Directive Council to call a nationwide  strike and rally in Plaza de Mayo before January 31 "if the  government does not provide an answer to workers' demands."    In a session rife with criticism of President Carlos Menem  and his government the committee approved the plan submitted by  the UGTT [expansion unknown] and UTA [Motor Transport Workers  Union] transport workers unions to walk off the job if the  government ignores the labour movement's major demands. These  include loosening up on the austerity measures that have caused  unrest in the country's poorer provinces and dropping the plan  to reduce employer contributions to union-run health care and  other services.    Notably absent from yesterday's session were such staunch  government supporters as the head of the ANSSAL [National Health  Insurance Administration] social security administration, Jose  Luis Lingeri, Obras Sanitarias Waterworks union, Ramon Valle,  and UPCN [National Civil Service Personnel Union] civil servants  union, Andres Rodriguez, who is currently in the United States.    Also absent were UOM [Metalworkers Union] metalworkers  leader  Lorenzo Miguel and restaurant workers chief Luis Barrionuevo.    In a critical statement the CGT warned that the government  could not expect its belt-tightening measures -- which would  result in the dismissal of thousands of provincial employees  among other effects -- to be successful "if a strong network of  social protection is not simultaneously erected."    As regards the government's plan to roll back employer  contributions by up to 80 percent in order to cut the so-called  "Argentine cost" of doing business, the CGT said: "(It)  conspires against social justice and contradicts the more  developed policies in that area."    The government's plans to make labour legislation fared no  better as the confederation said they would "increase  unemployment, underemployment and marginalization."    The CGT attributed the government's policies to "a  dehumanizing, anti-Christian concept of the economy stemming  from the savage capitalism that degrades humanity and seeks to  convert it into one more raw material for economic production."    Numerous labour leaders made statements similar to those  expressed by health industry leader Carlos West Ocampo.    "We don't give a darn about twisting the President's arm,"  said West Ocampo. "This government has condemned thousands of  workers to hunger and misery and the Justicialist Party is at  his service."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chernyshev, economic observer: "The </F> Gold Reserve of `Finist' Bank"]    [Text]    In the Moscow bank rating, Finist Bank is in the group of  extremely successful leaders, holding a stable position among  them. Today this is a strategically advantageous position in the  marathon distance of the Russian movement toward the market. It  is possible to spring ahead, but then you run the risk of  overtaxing your forces. And they are needed to confidently reach  the goals that have been set. But the impressive rates of  development of Finist Bank and its rapid and confident mastery  of new kinds of services and modern banking technologies reveal  in it the fighting spirit of one of the most powerful and  promising financial institutions in the country. While in 1992  its currency reserve increased 2.8-fold, credit  investments--2.5-fold, and profit--fivefold, during the past  year these indicators stood out even more sharply--4.5-fold,  fourfold, and 4.4-fold, respectively. Of course the growth of  volumes and the scale of banking operations were taken into  account here.    The person I spoke with, Mikhail Gladilin, a member of the  board of Finist Bank, nonetheless evaluates the results of the  path that has been followed critically and in a balanced  fashion. His taciturn reflections are distinguished by their  simplicity, logic, and completely convincing arguments. I did  not observe a desire to promote himself, to present himself in a  more advantageous light. "We are a team that adheres to the  ideology of mutual prosperity," he emphasized repeatedly in the  conversation. "That is, we can all get rich together, but not at  one another's expense. Through mutual efforts we are striving to  increase our combined revenues. This approach corresponds more  to the Russian national character than the principle of Western  individualism does."    Finist Bank, as one of the largest and most competitive  general commercial banks of Russia, which performs to high  international standards, was created in 1989 and soon obtained a  license from the Central Bank of Russia. It is a matter of  special pride that it has no cases of failure to fulfill its  payment obligations. Under difficult economic conditions of  rupture of economic ties, nonpayments, decline of production,  inflation, and other kinds of disorder the bank has managed to  protect the interests of its clients and stockholders. All of  its stocks, incidentally, have gone through the procedure of  licensing, that is, verification for quality and reliability,  they have a permanent market quotation, and they are highly  liquid securities. All this attracts extremely solid and  respectable companions.    It would take too much time to travel to all the places  where  the bank does business--its 19 branches are located in large  industrial centers of Russia and CIS countries and serve more  than 6,000 dynamically developing enterprises and organizations.  Finist Bank has correspondent relations with first-class banks  of the United States, Germany, England, France, Singapore, and  other countries.    "Our bank's gold reserve includes dozens of devoted, honest,  and highly professional specialists," Mikhail Gladilin says with  conviction. "This year we will be placing most of our hopes in  them. The bank has created a computer center and a significant  analytical service that has diverse independent sources of  information. We are investing a great deal of effort and money  in the growth of our intellectual potential and technical  retooling, while receiving a high return from this. In  particular, Finist Bank plans to change over to a system of  electronic payments, `without leaving the office,' within a  realistic time frame and also to introduce a system of accounts  using plastic credit cards.    "Today our banking organism is in a stage of stable and  confident growth," continues Mikhail Gladilin. "While our  previous achievements were gained relatively simply, our current  prognosis and analysis convince us of the need to turn toward  strategic target planning, to tested expedient and economical  actions, and to a radical improvement of the quality of work and  of personnel and bank subdivisions with existing and new service  markets. The search for solutions is proceeding in a market  spirit--healthy, vital, and creative. Strategic target planning,  for example, strives to `look' several years ahead, is built on  a comprehensive analysis of global changes in economic  conditions, and is calculated for specific spheres of activity  and talented Russian entrepreneurs, as well as the capabilities  of the partners and clients of our bank.    "Here is one example of `quick reaction' to what would seem  to be insignificant changes in the economic situation. There was  revealed a tendency for Russia to begin to raise higher and  higher the customs barriers that protect domestic commodity  producers from the flow of goods and finished products that has  surged onto our immense market. So in a year or two it will be  more advantageous not to import foreign goods but to produce our  own products in Russia itself on the basis of existing  enterprises. But the latter have a significant `but.' In order  to produce competitive products, practically all Russian  productions are in need of modernization, reconstruction, new  mechanisms for financial and administrative activity, and  retraining of personnel. Otherwise, we will never see high-class  furniture, motor vehicles, audiovisual equipment, computers, or  many other things with the long-awaited mark `made in Russia.'    "In order to carry out these tasks the bank has founded the  International Investment Fund (MFI) which will soon open in  Moscow. It will work on establishing direct ties between Russian  and Western partners, developing technical-economic plans and  investment programs, and preparing all the necessary  documentation. In this connection I was happy to learn of the  two-volume `Guide to German Enterprises' which gives `portraits'  of 400 of the most successful German firms that want to work  with their Russian partners.    "The publication was prepared and published with the  participation of Finist Bank in the Russian and German languages  by the Russian firm Poliform in conjunction with its Berlin  partner Katalist Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH. Because of the new  information technologies it will be necessary to `work through'  other countries as well. So it is enough for our businessmen to  fall within the field of vision of the aforementioned MFI,  without running through the Moscow offices and dealing with the  bureaucracy, to engage in the creation of joint productions and  the output of high-quality products on the basis of their own  plants and factories.    "Today Finist Bank is aiming at investing its money in the  domestic economy. Under the conditions of the unfavorable  Russian investment complex this step, frankly, seemed  questionable to me. After all, hundreds of today's banks are  using their capital for transactions of the `buying and selling'  type. By reducing its share of such operations the bank will  inevitably lose some of its profit. It will probably be  necessary to have supernatural sensitivity and an especially  large reserve of strength in order to invest our money in  productions from which the return will come in a year or two. In  industry, agriculture, road construction, and communications.    "These are my assumptions here. While other businessmen are  ranting and raving over super high profit, Finist Bank without a  lot of fuss and with knowledge of their business holds key  positions in the branches of the economy whose renewal will  determine the image of the revived Russia. That is when the  bank's strategic vision will probably appear, the emblem of  which today is the fantastic `Finist--the bright falcon,' a  strong, keen-sighted, high-flying bird."</p>

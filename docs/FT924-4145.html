			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (7): Building up the team spirit - Esops EMPLOYEE share ownership plans (Esops) may be on the periphery of many people's minds during a buy-out but those who have opted for them believe they offer great benefits - especially during highly competitive times when it is important for the workforce to pull together. 'For employee human relations, it's exceptional,' says Mrs Jacqui Martin, financial director of People's Provincial Buses. 'The union representatives wear two hats when they're negotiating because they're shareholders as well. They don't demand anything silly or go on strike because they'd be striking against themselves.' Based in Fareham, Hampshire, People's Provincial Buses established its Esop in 1987, when the management and most employees conducted a buy-out from the National Bus Company for Pounds 730,000. Each contributor put in Pounds 750 to support the bid. At the time of the buy-out, 20 per cent of the shares were in the workforce's hands and the remainder in the Esop. Now, after distributions of free shares and offers to buy shares, the workforce holds 60 per cent of the shares with the rest in the Esop. Esops were established as a means by which employees could acquire a large shareholding in their company - whether public or private - without necessarily laying out personal capital. A company sets up an employee benefit trust (EBT) to acquire some of its shares. The trust buys shares from an existing shareholder using proceeds from a loan guaranteed by the company and serviced by the company's cash flow. Repayments are tax efficient since payments from the company to the EBT are treated as payments to employees, while the trust uses the funds to repay the principal of the loan as well as meet interest charges. Shares are then distributed to employees, usually through an Inland Revenue-approved profit sharing trust (PST). Although shares can be sold to employees, most are gifted by the company. As long as the shares are held for five years, employees pay no income tax on the sale of gifted shares. The EBT can repurchase shares from employees, creating an internal market for the benefit of the workforce. During an MBO, an Esop is the simplest way of including employees in the buy-out, purchasing shares on their behalf and distributing them once the buy-out has been completed. Not only is the Esop a means of raising a proportion of cash for the MBO. It is also a means of gaining the participation and commitment of the workforce. In a competitive bid, the support of employees for the current management, may be a critical factor for the management and for the fund providers. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the recession and market for buy-outs, the number of MBO-related Esops is down this year. 'The greatest momentum was in the late 1980s,' says Mr Robin Slagburn, senior corporate finance manager at Unity Trust Bank, which has funded several Esops. 'They aren't the kind of thing companies think of doing when they're just trying to survive.' In spite of this, money is still available, even if it is only in the hands of employees. At least two of this year's Esop-related buy-outs have been over-subscribed by their workers. When the Port of Tilbury completed its buy-out from the Port of London Authority in March for Pounds 33.5m, employees could buy 17 per cent of the shares. The offer was over-subscribed by 21 per cent as 55 per cent of the workforce came forward to buy. 'The average purchase was for Pounds 2,400 of shares,' says chief executive, Mr John McNab. 'It's a heck of a lot of money and people are already asking if they can buy more,' Why companies should attract so much financial support from their employees in such straitened times is open to debate. However, it may be a sign that those who are employed are keen to back and be part of their company. Numerous attempts have been made to broaden the appeal of Esops. The statutory Esop, introduced under the 1989 Finance Act, can operate like the popular case law Esop but receives additional tax advantages. For example, shareholders selling at least 10 per cent of their shares to an Esop may be able to claim capital gains tax rollover relief. In 1991, the Esop Centre launched a model Esop in an attempt to make it easier and less expensive for companies to establish a statutory Esop. The model steers companies and their advisers through recent legislative changes and includes a model trust deed. Unfortunately, the qualifying requirements for a statutory Esop have proved so onerous that even the model Esop has failed to woo companies. The Esop Centre is now lobbying government to make radical changes to the statutory Esop, to make it more attractive. Its 10-point plan includes proposals to: Make the trustee a subsidiary company (so that no individual - such as an employee - has personal liability as a trustee); Allow part-time and new employees to benefit; and Make statutory Esop trusts tax neutral. Malcolm Hurlston, director of the Esop Centre, established to encourage Esops, is hopeful that these points may be accepted in the next Budget. 'It will be the main way of making Esops popular.' In the meantime, some of the trade unions are beginning see the attractions of Esops. The MBOs of Coolkeeragh Power and People's Provincial Buses had the backing of their respective unions. However, some trade unions remain sceptical. 'Many have a problem of coming out in support of Esops at national level, as it smacks of capitalism,' says Mr Blagburn. 'They're also wary of Esops being seen as pension substitutions, as they have in the US.' Mr David Tankel, director at the management and buy-out consultancy, New Bridge Street Consultants, believes that management attitudes to Esops and wider share ownership are changing. 'Managers are beginning to see the benefits of employees having a sense of ownership of the company and being committed to it.' Mr McNab at the Port of Tilbury, has seen his employees attitudes to the company changing. 'People feel they're working for themselves, they can have an impact on the company and see a return on their investment by being co-operative,' he says. It is still early days for Esops. They will, of course, only be successful if the company is successful. That, in the long-term, may be the best - or worst - advertisement they can have.</p>

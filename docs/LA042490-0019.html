			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES' ROLE IN TERRORISM BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Kenneth Freed's article "Killing Fields of Guatemala Persist Despite U.S.  Effort" (April 14) was gratifying for one reason: the fact that it appeared at  all. Some 100,000 Guatemalans dead and 40,000 disappeared in 26 years is indeed  staggering.  </P> <P> Yet the story continues to go largely unreported in the U.S. press.  </P> <P> Surprising? It shouldn't be. The CIA helped overthrow Arbenz's democratically  elected government in 1954 for advocating land reform and human rights (a fact  omitted from Freed's otherwise good piece). Since then U.S. tax dollars have  paid for death-squad thugs to "disappear," torture and murder anyone they deem  "dissident."  </P> <P> The ambivalence of the U.S. Embassy official quoted on whether human-rights  progress is "still a requirement of U.S. aid" to Guatemala belies our foreign  policy's double standard: We champion popular movements that overturn "hostile"  communist tyrants, but criticize rebellion against "friendly," right-wing  butchers and murderers.  </P> <P> SANDY LEJEUNE  </P> <P> Boyle Heights  </P></p>

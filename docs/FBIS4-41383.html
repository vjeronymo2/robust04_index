			<p>BFN     [Text] Uzbek President Islam Karimov left for Turkey today  on an official state visit. Before his departure, answering a  journalist's question, our country's leader said:    [Begin Karimov recording] After achieving our independence  and sovereignty, small but noticeable changes are taking place  in our policy and life and also in international and interstate  ties and in politics. From this point of view we are  establishing contacts with many countries including the small,  the powerful, and the large, but we will be looking at how these  countries see us, how close they are to us, how close their  people are to us.    From this point of view Turkey is very close to us. [words  indistinct] The people of Turkey, the Turkic peoples are very  close to us. Their language and their heart but primarily their  religion and their destiny are very close to us. [words  indistinct]    Our relations with the Turkish leaders, public, and  entrepreneurs are not bad and are currently developing well.  For example, there are more than 100 joint enterprises and  organizations [in Uzbekistan]. We must, however, be frank that  there are forces who want to damage these ties, these close and  friendly relations and it would be wrong to ignore these. For  this reason such forces must be controlled and we must look at  our relations with this close and strategically [word  indistinct] state on the basis of a long sighted policy.    Raising economic and political ties with this state to a new  level is the reason for our current visit. From this point of  view I believe that Turkey looks at us with the same wish and  hope and I think that this visit will raise our relations with  Turkey to a new level -- primarily it will be in the interest of  Uzbekistan and the people of Uzbekistan.

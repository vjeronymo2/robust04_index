			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 21 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- A party with an  unusual name -- "Lefsha" [left-hander] -- has been registered at  Russia's Justice Ministry. Dmitriy Semenov, the president of  the new political association, told ITAR-TASS that: The party  intends to defend the interests of qualified wage labor workers.  It consists of qualified industrial and agricultural workers,  scientific-technical and cultural intelligentsia, students, and  professional military.    We are for forming a middle class in Russia, which, as is  known, consists not only of medium and small owners but what is  more important, of qualified and highly-paid workers, the  party's president said.    In keeping with its program, the party will seek to gain  power constitutionally, in order to carry out a realistic reform  in the interests of wage labor workers. The aim of the party is  a legislative reform of social and labor relations.    The party has started preparations for its nationwide  congress, which is to take place at the end of  September-beginning of October 1994.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Clinton tour shows US loss of direction There was a time when an American president could help his standing at home by striding majestically across the world stage, basking in the adulation of huge crowds from Berlin to Beijing. But for President Bill Clinton, a weeklong trip across Europe has done little to enhance his stature at home, while distracting him from pressing domestic issues such as the devastating floods in Georgia or the critical phase of his healthcare reform plans. There is even a sneaking suspicion that his travels have not done him much good abroad, either. Leaders of the other Group of Seven leading industrial nations rebuffed Mr Clinton's principal initiative at their Naples summit, a last-minute proposal for new trade liberalisation talks. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia publicly upbraided him for blocking Russian exports and flatly contradicted him on the issue of getting Russian troops out of Estonia. And the crowds that greeted him in Riga, Warsaw and Berlin were at best politely enthusiastic, not the cheering multitudes that greeted his predecessors in the days when the Iron Curtain still stood. Even as he travelled through Europe, Mr Clinton's time was taken up with two outlaw nations thousands of miles away, Haiti and North Korea. Mr Jim Hoagland, the Washington Post's foreign affairs commentator, calls it 'the disappearance of the American premium in international politics:' a sense that foreign leaders - from the US's G7 partners to the Haitian military junta - see little to lose in defying the US president and little to gain in making him look good. Much of this is unconnected to Mr Clinton's own standing. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact have greatly diminished the significance of the US's protection to its allies, while the harsh realities of the transition to a market economy have made the American grass seem much less green to the citizens of the former communist countries. But part is also linked to doubts over where exactly Mr Clinton and his administration stand; over whether, if pushed far enough, there is a point at which they will turn and fight. European diplomats have been wondering, ever since the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle last year, which way the American Janus is facing: towards Asia or Europe. After Mr Clinton's third trip across the Atlantic this year, the answer is towards Europe; and within Europe, towards Germany. In Bonn, Mr Clinton spoke of 'a common partnership that is unique now because so many of our challenges are just to Germany's east.' The 'special relationship' with the UK he consigned to the status of a nostalgic curio: 'Even though we fought two wars with them early in the last century it is unique in ways that nothing can ever replace because we grew out of them.' Clinton administration officials have developed a formula for describing the significance they attach to each national or regional relationship: 'No country/region is more important to us than ..' This ever-changing focus has caused some of the US's closest allies to wonder if the Administration has any priorities at all for deciding what is truly important to it. The answer is not reassuring. 'We want it all,' said a senior State Department official.</p>

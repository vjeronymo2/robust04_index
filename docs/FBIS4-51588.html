			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued  the following statement denouncing the Japanese authorities'  hostile maneuvers [choktaesi chaektong] against the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], a  dignified overseas citizens' organization of our Republic, which  are reaching a grave extent these days.    A Statement of a Spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry:    The Japanese authorities' hostile maneuvers against  Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens' organization of our  Republic, are reaching a grave extent these days.    Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of  mobile  police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled and  threatened the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon all  day and kicked up a violent row, forcibly searching office rooms  of the headquarters, residences of its responsible  functionaries, and its affiliated organizations.    Prior to this, the Japanese rightist gangsters, under the  behind- the-scenes manipulation of the authorities, crowded to  the central headquarters of Chongnyon and its affiliated  organizations and made a reckless disturbance, chanting,  "Koreans go home," and "Disband the Korean Cbongnyon." Thus  debasing the dignity of the Korean residents in Japan, they even  committed a crime of murdering a Chongnyon businessman.    This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty of  Chongnyon and violently trampling upon the democratic national  right of the Korean residents in Japan and a challenge to our  Republic which cannot be overlooked.    Facts show that the Japanese reactionary authorities' direct  suppression of Chongnyon has begun and that their hostile policy  against our Republic has reached a reckless stage.    In Japan, which claims itself to be a law-governed state,  the  police pounced upon and kicked up a row in broad daylight  against the legitimate Chongnyon organizations which they should  protect. Crowding in groups, the gangsters are openly committing  murder and violence, encroaching upon human rights against the  Korean residents in Japan. This is really surprising.    There have been numerous instances of Japanese authorities'  hostile acts and suppression against Chongnyon and the Korean  residents in Japan. But the incidents such as noted above have  occurred for the first time since the formation of Chongnyon and  are arousing an unbearable indignation of all the Korean people  and the Japan-resident Koreans. We resolutely denounce the  Japanese reactionary authorities' crime as part of the  anti-DPRK, anti- Chongnyon maneuvers.    We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the  Japanese authorities are conducting a suppression of Chongnyon  and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating the  situation over the fictitious nuclear issue of the DPRK at the  instigation of the United States.    Chongnyon is a peace-loving organization whose activities  are  officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and Japanese  law and which enjoys the full support of many countries and  organizations in the world. There is neither reason nor ground  for Chongnyon to be an object of a crackdown by the Japanese  authorities.    Moreover, Korean compatriots in Japan are innocent Korean  people who were forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard  toil under the brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their  descendants. Therefore, special protection must be granted to  them by the Japanese authorities.    However, far from apologizing for and liquidating the past  crimes committed against the Korean people, the Japanese  authorities are engaging in the suppression of Koreans in Japan  and their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act.    We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment  upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and resolutely  counter it [kue tanhohi taeunghae nagalkosida].    The Japanese authorities should ponder over the grave  consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts, immediately  stop their crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean compatriots in  Japan and apologize for it.    We express the hope that all the progressive personages and  broad sections of people in Japan and the world will continue to  express support and solidarity for the righteous activities of  Chongnyon for its democratic national rights and national  reunification.    29 April, 1994, Pyongyang.</p>

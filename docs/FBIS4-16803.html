			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarus industrialists and entrepreneurs will  support Vyacheslav Kebich, current head of republican  government, in the forthcoming presidential elections.  BELINFORM reports that this decision was adopted by the Belarus  Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs at an  extraordinary meeting. At the meeting, the confederation  approved the government's activity aimed at creating a single  economic space with Russia -- the treaty on merging Russia's and  Belarus' monetary systems -- and proposed to submit it to a  session of the republican Supreme Soviet for examination.</p>

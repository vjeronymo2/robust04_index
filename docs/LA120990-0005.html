			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I would like to thank TBS for their "Good News" program (Sundays at 7:05 a.m.).  It is like a breath of fresh air to see some positive information on the news  and to find out about people who are doing good things with their lives and  sharing with others. It's a very upbeat program.  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Monterey Park  </P></p>

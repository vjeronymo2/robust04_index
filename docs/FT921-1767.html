			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / People: NatWest looks for 'material impact' National Westminster Bank may not be able to do much right at the moment but at least it intends to buy right. Britain's second biggest clearing bank has hired Stuart Humby from PowerGen to be its first director of group purchasing. Humby, 50, and a past president of the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, will be responsible for managing NatWest's Pounds 2bn annual spending on goods and services. He is one of a new breed of professional managers which regards the purchasing function as an 'important competitive weapon'. 'The difference between looking after purchasing in a ham-fisted way and doing it to the ultimate professional standard could be as much as 25 per cent of the cost,' says Humby, who has degrees in mechanical engineering and business studies. This appointment is believed to be the first time a clearing bank has hired someone of Humby's seniority and Bert Morris, a deputy chief executive of NatWest, expects that the initiative will have a 'material impact' on the group's performance. Traditionally, the big clearing banks have been slower than has industry in getting a grip on their costs and although NatWest's record in this area is not as bad as some, Humby believes that it has not taken the purchasing function as seriously as have companies like British Airways, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. Although he will be building his new operation at NatWest 'almost from scratch' he does not envisage having more than half a dozen people in the central operation. 'One of the gravest mistakes in purchasing is to set up a large central organisation,' says Humby. He started work as an engineering apprentice at Cummins, and after spells at Krupp and ICI Fibres, he joined British Coal where he was deputy director general of supply and contracts and oversaw an annual budget of Pounds 1.6bn. In terms of annual spending his new job at NatWest will be roughly four times as big as his previous post at PowerGen and it will also be less orientated towards engineering and more towards buying of services.</p>

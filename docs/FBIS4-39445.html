			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Stanislav Bychkov and Oleg </F> Velichko]    [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, 7 Jun -- Russia has entered the  Southeast Asian arms market with the signing here today of a  contract to supply Malaysia with 18 MiG-29 fighters. [passage  omitted]    It is very important for Malaysia that, by starting  wide-scale business cooperation with us, Russia is willing to  hand over advanced technology to the Malaysians, [Deputy  Malaysian Prime Minister] Anwar bin Ibragim stressed in an  interview for an ITAR- TASS correspondent. For this reason, he  said, Kuala Lumpur regards this present deal as a first major  step in bilateral ties in the development of the industrial  infrastructure, power engineering, and other spheres. With full  justification one can call today's event historic, both for  Malaysia and for Russia, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Abdul  Razak told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "We are the first  country in the region to begin defense cooperation with Russia,  cooperation which is destined to open up broad new opportunities  for business relations between us," the defense minister said.    In a speech at the signing ceremony, Oleg Soskovets [first  deputy prime minister of Russia] pointed out that the contract  is evidence of the start of a new stage in the development of  bilateral relations. "The main thing now, from Russia's point  of view, is to transform the extensive existing potential into a  stable range of practical ties between the two countries," he  stressed.</p>

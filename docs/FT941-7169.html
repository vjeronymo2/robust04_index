			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco trader denies destroying documents relating to Dollars 206m loss The man at the centre of the futures scandal at Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper company, has denied accusations that he destroyed documents relating to the loss of Dollars 206m on metals futures operations. 'Not a single document was destroyed that had any bearing on the investigation,' Mr Juan Pablo Davila told journalists after eight hours of testimony before the parliamentary commission looking into the case. Mr Davila, former chief futures trader at Codelco, has been accused by the company's acting president, Mr Jorge Rodriguez, of destroying correspondence from brokers. 'If we had had these documents, we could have cleared up this case much more quickly,' Mr Rodriguez said. Mr Davila's statement came after President Patricio Aylwin had on Wednesday received an interim report into the futures losses prepared by the comptroller general. Details of the report are not known, but a spokesman for the comptroller said losses were found to be 'somewhat higher' than the Dollars 206m cited by Codelco executives. They could rise or fall depending on the handling of contracts that were still open, he said. The report is also believed to point to a lack of controls over futures operations and to assign part responsibility for such failings to executives outside the futures department. Mr Rodriguez said that failure to implement controls - either deliberately or through negligence - was 'very serious'. Meanwhile, Codelco executives moved to limit the damage over the delay in signing a joint venture agreement for the El Abra project, which had been expected to raise an initial Dollars 555m. New tests on the deposit requested by the Cyprus Amax/Lac Minerals consortium, which last year agreed to take a 51 per cent stake in El Abra, would be ready by the end of April, Codelco said.</p>

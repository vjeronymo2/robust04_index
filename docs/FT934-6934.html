			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Clinton acts to halt US airline strike President Bill Clinton yesterday persuaded both sides in the American Airlines dispute to accept binding federal arbitration. In a surprise announcement, he said the airline's flight attendants had agreed to end their five-day strike that had threatened to disrupt travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period. American said it expected to resume a full schedule of flights today although it warned passengers to expect continued delays. Under the deal brokered by White House staff, a federal mediator acceptable to both the management of American Airlines, the second largest US carrier after United, and the flight attendants union will make binding decisions to resolve the contract dispute over pay, working conditions and fringe benefits. Only 24 hours earlier the airline rejected a suggestion by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 21,000 workers at American, to request emergency federal mediation to resolve the stand-off. Mr Clinton, who has wide powers to intervene in transport matters, said at a White House press conference: 'This company and its employees are a very important part of American economy, a very important part of the airline sector that has been troubled for the last couple of years and that is a very important part of our high-tech future.' Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American, said: 'The president's proposal of binding arbitration is much less troublesome than the threat of a presidential emergency board.' However, he repeated his misgivings about the arbitration process, saying that 'those who would create a final solution to the dispute have no long-term stake in the future of the company'. Mr Crandall said American's decision to accept arbitration also reflected the president's personal intervention. 'It is clearly unusual for the president to intervene in a matter of this type. In view of his national responsibilities, we think his requests are entitled to great deference.' As part of the deal brokered by the president, American and the union agreed that all employees would return to work under pre-strike conditions. A series of work-rule changes instituted after the union's contract expired at the end of last month would remain in effect.</p>

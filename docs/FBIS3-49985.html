Francis Briquemont, accused Thursday [20 January] Bosnian Croats  of blocking the efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Sarajevo  by road.    Foreign news agencies reported Gen. Briquemont as saying in  Sarajevo on Thursday that Bosnian Croats failed to keep their  promise given on January 12 by their Commander, Ante Roso. They  promised to enable UNPROFOR to repair the important Bjela  bridge, near Jablanica, southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been ravaged by the  civil war between local Moslems, Serbs and Croats for the past  21 months. Gen. Briquemont said if the bridge was repaired this  would facilitate the passage of humanitarian convoys from the  Croat-controlled territories in western Bosnia through central  Bosnia on their way to Sarajevo. The general said it was quite  obvious that the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO) had no wish to help  open the Mostar-Jablanica route.    Gen. Briquemont steps down as the U.N. forces commander for  Bosnia-Herzegovina next week, after criticizing the U.N. policy  in this former Yugoslav republic.</p>

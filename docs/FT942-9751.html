			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: April turnover falls 12% Bourse activity in April failed to respond to a tentative recovery in most European market indices, and turnover fell by 12 per cent on the month after a 5.7 per cent rise in March. This was partly due to the Easter holidays, says Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, but it also reflected caution on the part of international investors. Turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International, the London screen-based dealing system which attracts a lot of international business, declined to 15.8 per cent as a proportion of its counterpart in Continental domestic equity markets, after 16.2 per cent in March and 16.1 per cent in February. There had to be an exception, and in April it was Italy, which saw turnover up 31.8 per cent on the month, and by 49 per cent over the average of the previous quarter. Mr Cornish notes that Italian share prices rose by another 10.6 per cent last month, in growing anticipation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's success in forming a government. 'In contrast to Milan,' notes Mr Cornish, 'Seaq International turnover in Italian shares fell by 4.3 per cent on the month, with the proportion of London to domestically traded Italian shares falling to 12.8 per cent, from 17.4 per cent in March. This bears out our view that the Italian market is now propelled mainly by domestic buying.' Zurich was the underperformer in share price terms in April, with a domestic index fall of 1.5 per cent. Turnover in Swiss shares dropped by 25.3 per cent. But this was topped by France. In Paris, share prices rose by an adequate 2.5 per cent as turnover fell by 33.6 per cent. By April, too, the Paris market was becoming apprehensive about the weight of new issues that it was intended to field.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse               Jan        Feb       Mar       Apr       US                     1994       1994      1994      1994   Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           107.56      95.76     83.75     69.93       2.06 France            251.96     244.62    218.68    145.17      25.69 Germany           219.29     176.59    214.73    188.00     113.94 Italy             53,924     79,109    80,380   105,964      66.75 Netherlands        35.00      32.00     33.10     25.20      13.61 Spain           1,521.82   1,400.80  1,491.24  1,160.49       8.61 Switzerland        39.70      33.90     32.02     23.93      17.06 UK                 65.31      59.80     61.14     48.57      73.78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

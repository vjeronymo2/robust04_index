			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bank of Tokyo to set up Taiwan branch AFTER months of negotiations with Beijing, the Bank of Tokyo, the Japanese foreign exchange bank, yesterday finally announced its representative office in Taipei would be upgraded to branch status. This follows a painstaking approval process by the Chinese government, which is sensitive about dealings with Taiwan. Last month, the Bank of Tokyo denied an announcement by the Taiwanese government that the bank had won approval to open a branch in Taipei. The Bank of Tokyo has been wary of irritating the Chinese government, which punished the bank in 1990 when it announced plans to open a Taipei representative office by delaying a planned financial joint venture in Shanghai and suggesting other opportunities in the mainland market would be denied. After governmental talks, Beijing forgave the bank but, ever since, Japanese financial institutions have been discreet in dealings with Taiwanese authorities. Bank of Tokyo's Taipei branch plans to start banking and foreign exchange operations on March 27, becoming the first Japanese bank to open a branch since Japan severed ties with Taiwan in 1972. It will be the second Japanese bank to have a branch in Taiwan after Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which opened its Taipei operations in 1959. Bank of Tokyo, is to donate Dollars 250,000 of its loan portfolio to the Filipino government in a 'debt-for-child development' swap to assist a child education project in the Philippines. The debt donation will be channelled through Unicef Japan, and is the first ever of its kind. Japanese banks have started to write-off loans to developing countries through debt swap arrangements. Last year, BoT and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank arranged 'debt-for-nature' swaps, donating its loans to assist environmental conservation projects. Until recently, Japanese banks were reluctant to participate in such programmes.</p>

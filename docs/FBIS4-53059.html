			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 May, a Foreign Ministry source disclosed that  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] has made firm its plan to  actively conduct "preventive diplomacy" to prevent in advance  the outbreak of international conflicts or the expansion of such  conflicts. The plan is in line with UN policy which stipulates  that "preventive diplomacy" would be the international  organization's new role in dealing with post-Cold War regional  conflicts.    Specifically, MOFA plans to promote a policy through which  it  hopes to prevent expansion of ethnic conflicts in the Balkan  region by helping to bring about political stability in  countries in the region. In order to do this, MOFA plans to  actively provide aid to such countries as Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], which has declared  independence from the former Yugoslavia, and its neighbor,  Albania, both of which lie near the areas of conflict in that  region. Moreover, as MOFA places heavy emphasis on the roles of  nongovernmental organizations (NGO), which have set up regional  networks, it now plans to set up a "civilian support office"  within the ministry. The office will have general supervision  over NGO's which are engaged in activities overseas.    As for "preventive diplomacy," the idea was taken up in a  report which UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made to the  United Nations in 1992, entitled "Agenda for Peace." The idea  has since been clearly incorporated in UN activities. At last  year's General Assembly session, the United Nations adopted a  resolution which approved conducting peacekeeping operations  (PKO) for preventive purposes. It has become increasingly  acknowledged that "it is becoming a global trend to recognize  the importance of preventive diplomacy through which conflicts  can be prevented beforehand by detecting indications of such  conflicts well in advance, or through which on-going conflicts  can be kept from spreading or developing into full-scale war"  (as stated by a MOFA source).    Moreover, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, upon his  inauguration, said he plans to consider "preventive diplomacy"  as part of "active diplomacy" which Japan will now pursue.    According to MOFA, approximately 100 million yen was  extended  as subsidies to NGO's in fiscal year 1989. Since then, the  government's subsidies have increased very sharply. For  example, 440 million yen was allocated in fiscal year 1993, and  540 million yen has been allocated in the fiscal year 1994 draft  budget.    In addition, NGO's, for their part, have begun to be  actively  involved in preventive diplomacy. For example, an NGO called  the "International Dispute Prevention Research Organization" is  scheduled to be established on 19 May with the assistance of the  UN University. This organization will focus its activities on  preventive diplomacy.</p>

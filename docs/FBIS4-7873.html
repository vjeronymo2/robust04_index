			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Czech parliament has approved an  (inflation adjusted) 27-billion-koruna [Kc] defense budget for  1994 that reduces previous overall expenditures and reorders  defense priorities. Despite the general cutbacks, reports Pavel  Jegl in the Prague daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY, this year's budget  contains new line items for the creation of a rapid deployment  force (Kc800 million), the restructuring of logistic systems  (Kc500 million), and the modernization of the communications  network (Kc300 million). Jegl writes that the Defense Ministry,  emphasizing the reduced expenditures in the new budget, has  labeled it a "survival budget."    Miroslav Kalousek, the deputy defense minister, has been  charged with developing a new system of planning, programming,  and budgeting that is compatible with the systems of NATO member  countries, notes Jegl. The new system is intended to facilitate  the detection of wasteful expenditures and thus reduce costs.  It should also make it easier to examine the expense structure,  analyze revenue and expenditures, and make rapid budgetary  adjustments. Kalousek told Jegl that the Czech military is in  the process of redefining the nature of the threats facing the  Czech Republic and is designing a force structure to meet such  threats. He estimates that this redefinition of the defense  system should be completed by the middle of this year.</p>

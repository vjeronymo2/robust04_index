			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Feoktistov] </F>   [Text] Ankara, 9 Feb -- Turkey advocates an "immediate,  complete and unconditional" withdrawal of Armenian forces from  the areas of Azerbaijan they have seized. This was stated  yesterday by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel during a dinner  in honor of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is paying  an official visit to Ankara. The Turkish leader noted that  sooner or later, the Armenians would be forced to leave occupied  Azerbaijani territory.    Turkey and Azerbaijan, Demirel said, have decided to  strengthen bilateral cooperation not just at the interstate  level, but also in international organizations like the United  Nations, the CSCE, the Organization of the Islamic Conference,  and regional economic groupings. The Turkish Republic will  continue to assist Azerbaijan and support its "integration" with  the international community.    The talks in Ankara, the Turkish president stressed, have  been held in a candid atmosphere. "There are no problems in our  bilateral relations," he said.    In his turn, Aliyev said that he was "determined" to  preserve  Azerbaijan's independence and to liberate territory under  Armenian occupation. The young Azerbaijani Republic needs  Turkish help. "We are two states," he said, "but one nation."    The same day, the Azerbaijani president held talks with the  Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Aliyev is reported to have  said that he might agree to the presence, under CSCE auspices,  of Russian and foreign forces in the republic. He gave it to be  understood that the question of building a pipeline to carry  Azerbaijani oil across Turkish territory to the Mediterranean  "will be decided in the near future."    A number of bilateral agreements on development of economic  cooperation are expected to be signed today.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Samsung complex receives more aid Public-sector assistance for the electronics complex that Samsung, the Korean industrial group, is to develop at Wynyard, Cleveland has increased, according to figures released yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Infrastructure spending on the site by the government-sponsored agency English Partnerships is expected to exceed Pounds 12m. Support from Cleveland local authorities, Teesside Training and Enterprise Council and Teesside Development Corporation is estimated to be worth Pounds 16.7m over six years. When the project - the biggest Korean investment in western Europe - was announced in October English Partnerships' input was put at Pounds 9m and the package from the Cleveland authorities at just less than Pounds 12m. The figures come from the Northern Development Company, the regeneration body for north-east England and Cumbria.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Sport: Fastest boats cost the most - America's Cup AMERICA'S racing yachtsmen have a saying: 'Nothing goes to windward like dollars'. Even to a Limey landlubber the implication is obvious. Fast boats cost money, and the fastest boats cost the most. Dennis Conner is currently having that cynical axiom branded into him by billionaire America's Cup rival Bill Koch. The trials to select a Cup defender entered round two last Saturday and Conner is being out-spent and out-sailed. Two weeks ago Koch, skipper and paymaster of the America3 team, took delivery of his third yacht. Christened simply America she is proving unstoppably fast - even in a relatively untuned 'out-of-the-box' state. In her first encounter with Conner's steed Star &amp; Stripes the new yacht's winning margin was a huge 6m 23 secs. 'We're ecstatic because this is probably the slowest she'll ever sail,' said Koch, an engaging white-haired energy tycoon who trained as a scientist at MIT. 'She sailed for only eight hours before the race and we are still learning the little tricks of what she likes.' In the second race between the two boats, America won by 6 min. Conner won the start by a five second margin, indicating that Koch's crew were so confident of superior speed over the 20-mile course that a tiny advantage on the line was barely worth the battle. After the first beat America was 2m 38s in front and never missed a beat thereafter. Conner, beaten only once in four America's Cups going back to 1980, has made major modifications to Stars &amp; Stripes in the two weeks since the first round robin ended. She now has a forward canard fin, possibly steerable, as part of a two-element keel and has had her rudder moved forward. It sounds like a dog's dinner grafted on a hull designed over 18 months ago, making it virtually prehistoric in terms of the new International America's Cup Class. First time out it proved virtually impossible to control, as Conner admitted with uncharacteristic candour. 'Either the boat doesn't steer the way I would like it to or I haven't learnt to operate it yet,' said the portly, introspective sailor. While Koch has a virtually bottomless private war-chest, Conner has had to go out and raise corporate sponsorship for every dollar he spends on his yacht. His target budget for the whole campaign was a mean and lean Dollars 15m, but insiders say that Stars &amp; Stripes will not even reach that figure. It means that a new boat is out of the question, while Koch has a fourth yacht under construction and due in San Diego during April. The format for the defender selection process means that the top-scoring two yachts, out of three currently racing, go into a best-of-seven final in two months time. Unfortunately for Dennis Conner two of the competing boats are part of the America3 effort. 'You're never out of this until you lose four races in April,' says Conner confidently. However, if his position becomes genuinely desperate he could pull out beforehand, saving on everything from crew wages to hours on the huge supercomputers used in the design process. Ironically for a man whose 200-strong team has put together the best IACC boats to date, Koch is unstintingly critical of the new class. In public or private he seldom deviates from his attack on their design and cost. 'The boats are fragile and very expensive - one boat costs Dollars 5m. If the wind gets above 17 knots something is bound to break and someone could get physically badly hurt,' says Koch. 'I think these boats are bad for the America's Cup because they are following the same route to oblivion that the J-boats did.' This 130-ft class was last seen in the 1930s and never reappeared after the war because of their high cost. On the other hand, as his former skipper Gary Jobson pointed out, 'Bill Koch's the one setting the pace when it comes to spending money.'</p>

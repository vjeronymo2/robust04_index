			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Romania faces general strike Alfa Cartel, Romania's second largest trade union bloc, said yesterday it was postponing a general strike scheduled for tomorrow until February 28 in order to join forces with CNSLR-Fratia, the country's other main union confederation, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. In addition to mounting industrial stoppages and pickets, the strikers plan to block roads and fuel deliveries, interrupt telecommunications every 10 minutes and cut bread production by two-thirds, CNSLR-Fratia said. The two unions, which together represent 4.8m workers, are demanding the government accelerate economic reform, improve the social security system and take measures to solve the 'financial blockage'. In recent weeks, many workers have not been paid because of a liquidity crisis at highly-indebted state concerns. Inter-enterprise debt has risen to an all-time high of Dollars 2.8bn, according to the finance ministry.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SATELLITE RESCUE MISSION PLANNED  </P> <P> The owner of a $150-million communications satellite stranded in a useless  orbit, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, agreed  Wednesday to pay NASA about $90 million to mount a bold spacewalk rescue  mission during the 1992 maiden flight of the shuttle Endeavour. NASA has  tentatively scheduled the flight for February, 1992.  </P> <P> Endeavour is also scheduled to carry a science satellite into orbit.  </P> <P> The Intelsat 6 spacecraft, the most powerful commercially built television,  telephone and data relay satellite ever built, was stranded in a useless orbit  March 14 when it failed to separate properly from the second stage of its Titan  3 launch rocket because of a faulty Titan ejection system.  </P> <P> The only way to get the satellite away from the spent second stage was to  separate it from an on-board rocket that was to have boosted the relay station  toward its planned orbit 22,300 miles above the Equator.  </P> <P> The rescue plan calls for Endeavour to carry a new "perigee kick motor" into  orbit. After the shuttle completes a rendezvous, two space-walking astronauts  will attach the satellite to the motor.  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Observer: Gone sailing One might think that Tony Ryan, the hard-working chairman of GPA, would have ordered all his top executives to return to base to discuss how to salvage the company's credibility after it had to cancel its global stock market debut last week. But if he has, then Colm Barrington, chief executive of GPA Capital, has a more pressing engagement. He was reported yesterday to be 'watching the sun rise over Galway Bay' at the helm of Whirlpool, the lead boat in the Round Ireland Yacht Race which set off from Wicklow last Saturday. But the 46-year-old Barrington, who holds more GPA shares than any director save Ryan, was said by the race organisers 'to be keeping very quiet on the VHF radio'  - out of earshot not only of the following boats but presumably Ryan as well.</p>

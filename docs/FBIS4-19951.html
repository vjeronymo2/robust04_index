			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hugh Pope report: "Turks `Winning,' But Warned Over Kurd </F> Rights"]    [Text] Istanbul -- Turkey may at last be winning its  Kurdish conflict on the military front, diplomats say, as a  result of massive operations in south-east Turkey and northern  Iraq, tying down more than 300,000 Turkish troops and militiamen.    But diplomats and some influential Turks are warning that  military success alone cannot end nine years of crippling  insurgency. The key, they say, is a substantial recognition of  Kurdish rights. The increasingly nationalist Turkish  establishment has so far proved unable to take that step.    "Getting in is much easier than getting out," warned one  Western diplomat. "We've seen all this in Algeria and Vietnam  but the Turks think such parallels just do not apply to them,"  said another.    A Turkish spokesman said yesterday that 103 Turkish Kurdish  guerrillas and six Turkish soldiers had been killed since  several thousand Turkish troops crossed into a remote mountain  area of northern Iraq on 12 April. Operations were continuing  there on a front nine miles deep and 15 miles wide, as well as  in two war zones inside south-eastern Turkey, he added.    "We are determined to remove all threats from the region.  We'll continue for as long as it takes," said Colonel Dogu  Silahcioglu, a spokesman for the Turkish army. Turkish  newspapers have raised the possibility of a 10-mile deep  security zone all along the border inside northern Iraq, from  which guerrillas of the Workers Party of Kurdistan have been  infiltrating Turkey.    One Western intelligence expert said the Turkish troop  build-up has forced thousands of an estimated 10,000 guerrillas  to flee to anti-Turkish countries such as Armenia and Greece, or  to remote areas of Iran and northern Iraq. "The guerrillas have  got their backs to the wall," he said.    Turkish experts believe new appeals for peace and talks by  the Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, reflect this  weakness. Mr Ocalan told the newspaper OZGUR GURNDEM he was only  fighting for more Kurdish rights, not for an independent state  for the 12 million ethnic Kurds of Turkey or the 20 million  Kurds of the Middle East.    The Turkish General Staff apparently believes that Turgut  Ozal, the late Turkish leader, made a serious mistake in  sponsoring a March 1993 cease-fire, which saved the guerrillas  from a planned offensive. Many officers believe that the local  population must simply be made to fear the army more than they  fear Mr Ocalan's guerrillas from the Workers Party of Kurdistan  (PKK).    The President, Suleyman Demirel, has made ambiguous hints of  constitutional compromise. The Social Democrats, the junior  partner in the coalition government, are trying to link  long-promised Kurdish liberalisation to economic reforms. But  the position of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is weak, and she  seems unable to think differently from the military.    Not everybody is hard line. Some influential Turks think it  is time to move on from the blanket denial of the Kurdish  identity, started by the country's founder, Kemal Ataturk, after  the first modern Kurdish revolt in 1925.    "The whole military initiative has passed into military  hands," said Gungor Mengi, the chief commentator of the  newspaper SABAH. "To make this victory permanent we must accept  the Kurdish identity. This is the only way to isolate terror  from the people." Amnesty International is concerned about the  fate of Kurdish activists. It cited a case on 9 April of two  men in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbaki, ordered to be  released from police custody by a court. Instead they were found  shot dead in a field four days later.    Western powers have soft-pedalled their criticism because of  Turkey's parlous finances and a perceived role as a Western ally  in a tough neighbourhood, threatened by Russian ambitions and  Islami fundamentalists. That may not last for ever. "I find  many of my Turkish friends extraordinarily complacent about  human rights abuses," Michael Lake, the representative of the  European Commission, said.</p>

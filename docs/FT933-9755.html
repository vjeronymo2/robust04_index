			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Dealers look back to a bright future - London the FT Government Securities index regained the level it last saw in April 1955. Admitedly the index is an elderly yardstick, calculated since 1926, and one which has been overtaken by newer measures. But to remember the last occasion when the old index stood at 100 you have to be a pretty mature bond dealer. (And, in passing, what is the difference between a bond and a bond dealer? The bond eventually matures. The old jokes are the best . . . ) Back in April 1955, when Sir Anthony Eden was prime minister and John Major was just trying on his first pair of long trousers, the yield on industrial equities was 6.2 per cent and that on consols was 4.2 per cent. The stock market had not yet discovered that equities merited a lower yield than gilts, and it was not until the late 1950s that the 'reverse yield gap' appeared. Inflation in April 1955 was running at around 2 per cent, bank rate was 3.8 per cent and UK gross domestic product grew by 3 1/2 per cent that year. (I am indebted for the 1955 numbers to Mark Brown, who is not an elderly bond dealer but UK strategist at UBS, the brokers.) Now base rates are 6 per cent, the yield on the Footsie index is 3.9 per cent and consols are yielding nearly twice that. Does the gilt index's return to its 1955 level mean that the UK economy has awoken from the nightmare of double-digit inflation? That entrancing prospect is partly behind the strength of the gilt market of late. Well, inflation is low at present, but it is expected to rise - although not to dizzy heights. Economic growth is reviving, and while that leads to increased productivity, unit wage costs should not rise. However, that does not mean equity yields should rise above gilt yields once more. It might, however, mean that index-linked gilts are cheap, offering real yields of over 3 per cent and security if inflation does run out of control again. The other momentous event this week was the virtual collapse of the ERM, agreed early on Monday. The excitement over the ERM is because the rest of Europe has untied its economies from the inflation-controlling restrictions of German monetary policy, supposedly allowing a quicker return to growth. Is it likely, without German rectitude, that inflation can be held at bay? The equity market is the way to enjoy economic growth and get a hedge against inflation. Since sterling left the ERM last September the Footsie index has risen by a quarter. Strangely, given the fuss made last weekend, nothing very much happened this week in European interest or exchange rates, and the continental economies are still in recession. Germany shaved its money market rates, but French interest rates were not cut and the franc did not collapse. Sterling barely rose against the D-mark. What did change was expectations. From the UK point of view the most important one was that interest rates will come down sooner than had been thought. Not fast, and not far, but many now expect base rate to be 5 per cent by the year-end. That lifted the equity market, which has had a terrific run in the last fortnight, starting in anticipation of the ERM collapse, and breaking out from the trading range in which the Footsie has been stuck since Easter. This week it reached a new closing all time high, at 2969.8, up nearly 150 points over the last two weeks. Any bears left have been nastily squeezed in the run. And those who thought August was a good time to be on holiday have missed out on the action. The other hope is that European economies will recover faster, and since more than 60 per cent of UK exports go to continental European countries that is good news for the equity market. On the other hand, if sterling rises against the European currencies, the negative translation effect, as well as the relative loss of competitiveness, could outweigh the gains. All this is raising hopes that the forthcoming round of interim results from companies will lead to upward revisions of earnings forecasts for the rest of this year and next. That could underpin a further run in the equity market. It even allows Nomura Research Institute, which is forecasting a year-end target for the Footsie of 3500 - higher than most commentators, who are looking for 3100 to 3300 - to argue that on its estimate of the p/e for 1994 of 13, the UK market is still cheap. Corporate news this week has been, in the main, positive. The banks, of which more below, showed an improving trend in provisions, as one would hope as the economy recovers. Oil companies, BP and Shell, both reported better profits from their oil activities, although chemicals let them down. Better news came from the industrial heartland. TI Group, Glynwed and T Cowie all raised interim profits and GKN managed to maintain pre-tax profits in its half year, at Pounds 60m, despite a Pounds 6m rise in restructuring costs and poor demand in continental Europe. The UK car market has produced much better demand, and August car sales have started well. That helps Cowie, the motor trader and leasing group, which increased profits 28 per cent in its first half. TI, with the benefit of its Dowty acquisition, raised profits 25 per cent. Glynwed profits were 19 per cent higher. But Gareth Davies, Glynwed's chairman, spoke for many when he said the profit growth came from cost reductions and increased market share, rather than any rise in economic activity. That is still to come.</p>

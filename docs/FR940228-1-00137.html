Such evidence must relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualification by those students for an Expected Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the Department of Health and Human Services; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ending not more than six months prior to the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of these students who received a degree, certificate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other recognized educational credential from the institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred from the institution to a higher level educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program at another institution for which the prior program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic progress toward completion of their educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The calculation does not include students who did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete their programs because they left the institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve in the armed forces; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more with respect to its former students who received a degree,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those students who, based on evidence submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a higher level educational program at another institution for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the prior educational program provided substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student, or the period of time between the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's loan application, if any, whichever is less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified data to the Secretary's designated Department official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's appeal is not considered complete until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated Department official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's designated Department official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of written material submitted by the institution.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "OPEC Fails To Lower Crude Production"] </F>   [Text] Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OPEC) Saturday failed to agree on new  production ceilings and decided to extend the current 24.5  million barrels a day level.    Prior to the meeting, some OPEC nations including Iran and  Kuwait had indicated their willingness to cut production to  boost prices. Several non-OPEC producers excluding Britain,  Norway, and Mexico also favored lower crude export levels which  would bring higher prices and prolong the life of underground  crude reserves.    Britain and Norway claim that keeping the current level and  even increasing it has been planned a long time ago based on  "long-term investment programs."    Self interest is obviously the main consideration for  agreeing to any changes in production volume by the individual  members of OPEC. However, it does not necessarily follow that a  formula cannot be found that will benefit all members as well as  the non-OPEC crude exporters.    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of petroleum,  saying it needs to keep its production at the current level to  pay for its foreign debts, disrupted any semblance of consensus  by disagreeing to any production cuts. On the surface the Saudi  stance seems reasonable. But this is the same country that a  few weeks ago bought $6 billion worth of U.S.-made planes from  manufacturers who were on the verge of bankruptcy. it is hard  to understand the Kingdom's policy which costs its nation huge  sums in order to save American businesses but at the same time  endangers and actually damages the economies of its own  neighbors by reducing their oil revenues.    Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, proposed a 1.4  million barrels a day collective reduction in OPEC's crude  output amounting to an overall 6 percent drop in production  volume. At the same time Oman, representing 8 non-OPEC  producers, offered to cut non-OPEC production by 250,000 barrels  a day. Aqazadeh quoted the OPEC Secretariat as saying that the  above proposed cuts would have resulted in a $4 a barrel  increase in crude prices. This will more than offset Saudi  Arabia's lower oil revenues if production ceilings are dropped.    Considering the fact that all OPEC nations, particularly  Saudi Arabia which has the largest production volume, will  economically benefit from higher prices the Kingdom's opposition  to lowering production volumes seems contrary to its own  interests.    By keeping crude prices low the Saudi rulers are in effect  giving higher priority to the interests of the United States,  which wants cheap crude, than to their own economic well being  and political independence, and in the process they are creating  financial inconveniences for their neighbors.</p>

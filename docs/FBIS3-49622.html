The Slovak delegation included Economics Minister  Jan Ducky, Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia Vladimir  Masar, and a number of businessmen.    During his three-day stay in Israel, Moravcik met with his  Israeli counterpart, the Israeli premier, president and the  speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.    The Slovak balanced diplomatic activity is aimed at  "creating  throughout the region equal opportunities and room for  cooperation," Moravcik said, adding, "one of the prerequisites  for this is the implementation of the peace agreement between  Israel and the Palestinians."    In order to further bilateral cooperation, agreements on the  prevention of double taxation and protection of investments have  to be signed, he said.    His visit to Israel focused on the extension of political  dialogue, bilateral trade, and areas of prospective cooperation.  These are envisaged as agriculture, banking, travel industry,  and Israeli investment in Slovakia. "The first stage of  building bilateral ties logically culminated in this visit,"  Moravcik said.</p>

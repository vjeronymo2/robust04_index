			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mariya Kara, from Dnepropetrovsk and Lvov: "A </F> Split in `Russian' Ukraine"]    [Text] At the opening of the second conference of  Grynyov and Kuchma's Inter-Regional Reform Bloc (MBR), which  took place in the unspeakable stagnation-period splendor of the  old Dnepropetrovsk Political Education Building--quietly  transformed into a Business Center--two picket lines shivered in  their wet snow boots. On one stood three old Bolsheviks and two  old Bolshevik women, in ripped shoes and threadbare clothing.  Their demands: "Down with the Bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and  Balashov! Long Live the USSR!" Only two out of the five  inscriptions were in Ukrainian. Across the street stood three  UNA-UNSO leaders and one person from Rukh. They were equally old  and wore similarly shabby clothes. They were in full agreement  with part one of the others' slogans, which concerned the  bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and Balashov, who were here  additionally described as `kikes'. As to point two, concerning  the USSR, their point of view was diametrically opposed. The  sides could not find a compromise and, in the absence of the  `bourgeoisie' and `kikes', tediously cursed one another. Before  the picket lines was the band of National Guard, cheerfully  playing four pieces which included "Higher and Higher," "The  Slavic Woman's Farewell" and "Red Cranberry Tree". The  "Cranberry Tree" song was played when Grynyov made his  appearance, and when Kuchma showed up he was greeted with  "Aviator's March." O, Ukraine, the red beet country!    The MBR Grand Ball brought together more than 1,000 people.  But the girls manning the tables where delegates from western  Ukraine were registered seem unemployed; nor were there many  people around tables assigned to central Ukraine. But those for  the Left Bank, the South and the Crimea were swarming with  people. The proceedings began with the throne speech by Leonid  Kuchma. It was convoluted and long. The speaker announced that  the process of building a state on national romanticism has been  a failure and condemned the "manic reform movement." Then he  developed a profound idea that some forces of darkness stuck a  wedge between fraternal peoples and "knocked them out of the  market". Having declared that the USPP-MBR block is as strong as  ever, he offered a three-point program, consisting of  stabilization, fundamental restructuring and a geopolitical  course toward a union with Russia. Then he discussed regions and  a federal structure. At the end, the speaker reassured the  audience that "the election is not being left to its own  devices." Immediately following was Balashov, the leader of the  city's MBR, the head of the Political Initiative Center and the  king of Dnepropetrovsk's pedestrian underpasses, which are  filled with his stores. Getting to the heart of the matter off  the bat, he declared that the first thing would be to get rid of  Kravchuk and to elect a responsible president, and it was  obvious who that would be. At that, both Grynyov and Kuchma  smiled. After that came the best part. Mr. Balashov spelled out  the path of reform. It was a very smart path, since it easily  and quickly threw together everything: free circulation of all  existing currencies combined with strict controls over the  export of resources, a federal system combined with centrally  allocated investment funds. At that point my neighbor, a member  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine and a professional  economist, turned very pale and inquired of no one in  particular: "Lord, what is this nonsense?"    Then there was the usual: one speaker after another chewed  over the few general ideas. Primarily, these were a federal  structure, the introduction of Russian as a second state  language and, of course, an "economic and political union" with  Russia. They mentioned that union so often that our picket lines  at the Supreme Council could easily have competed with them. The  intensity of their wish for a union seemed to match Galicia's  bitter hatred of it. Another theme was the need to kick out  Kravchuk and to get in "our" president, with every third speaker  complaining that the party in power would sabotage the elections  and then introduce presidential rule. Blessing the podium with  his presence was a special guest, a people's deputy to the  Russian Duma, the head of the Budget and Planning Commission,  who touchingly addressed the meeting as Brothers and immediately  stated that "it is not the people who have decided to draw  borders." Judging by the reaction in the audience, the portion  of the people who gathered there in fact did not like borders.    Among other things, speakers proposed to transform the MBR  into a party. Volodymyr Filenko, the PDVU leader, showed himself  in the best light by announcing that he was ready to build such  a party along with everybody else. Well, he is an experienced  fellow: having built two parties already, the PDVU and the New  Ukraine, he has not tired of it yet.    But the strangest thing was that this glorious bloc of  reformers said almost nothing about the economy. There were some  vague statements about the market for land and even more vague  ones about privatization, but nothing concrete. In Galicia, it  is our habit to criticize our dear National Democrats for their  insufficiently developed economic programs. But life can be  understood only by comparison. I suddenly realized that next to  the MBR conference, Pynzenchyk, Chernyak, Shandryuk and Zlupko  together with Pylypchuk, and even our oblast assemblage of Rukh,  URP and New Wave adherents, are a veritable economic academy.  The only person who disturbed the calm and quickly became  distasteful to the high and mighty Grynyov-Kuchma gathering was  Serbin, the construction minister, who began to introduce overly  concrete proposals on the economy, infusing a dissonant note  into the proceedings. He left the podium amidst sarcastic  silence.    At the end of two sittings the situation was sufficiently  clarified. Mr.Grynyov moved that candidates for deputies sign  forms declaring that they represented the MBR, which was a type  of pledge which carried all of the bloc's principles on the  obverse. There were some arguments about them: apparently,  disagreement centered on the formulation "demanding a  federal-regional structure for Ukraine." But everyone wanted  bilingualism, and immediately. As to the Union, everything went  smoothly in this area. The same was true about the economy;  apparently, no one even bothered to read that part.    Adventures started only during the press conference.  Responding to questions, Kuchma ardently defended federalism and  the regions, but then suddenly declared that he did not like the  regional economic experiment in the Donetsk-Dniestr region.  After that, following half an hour of holding forth by Grynyov  about the market for land and private land ownership, it turned  out that Kuchma believes that the most promising economic  structure in agriculture is the kolkhoz. Things got even more  jolly when Grynyov and Kuchma were asked who of the two of them  would be president. To this, Volodymyr Borysovych replied that  they might find a third and split it three ways. In the  presidium, there was a third man, Balashov, the king of  pedestrian underpasses, and this suggestion caused much hilarity  in the audience; it only grew when Balashov, the number one  specialist in buying and selling issues, began to hold forth  about the importance of the producer. A healthy journalistic  laughter greeted Leonid Kuchma's reaction to the question about  the connection between the MBR an the Civic Congress. To his  credit, Leonid Danylovych found no appropriate lie but blushed  and muttered: "Yes." It is always a pleasure to see a real  person, especially if it is your fellow-Ukrainian, suffering  from a desperate case of the "little brother" syndrome.    Emboldened, we too asked Grynyov whether he understands that  the MBR's platform starts an open conflict in Ukraine. I hope  that Volodymyr Borysovych will forgive me, but his response was  like a hedgehog in the fog: in general, he fears confrontation,  but sticks a conflict on the outside.    It is not difficult to sum up the second MBR conference. A  force representing western and southern Ukraine, and partially  the Center and the Trans-Carpathian region, has been formally  organized and will take the field before 1 December. It  functions much more elegantly than the crude Bloc-239, and in  general it is much better packaged. These are no odious Commies  but very polite gentlemen. They all have education, money and  image. They are the old economic bosses and other nomenklatura,  of course, but in the past four years the old first, second and  even third party secretaries and their entourage have become  completely acceptable pros, now labeled as pragmatic reformers,  bankers and entrepreneurs. The dream candidates for the  Russified East.    Perhaps the reader already feels horrified and is getting  ready for a military confrontation on the banks of the Zbruch.  But let us not rush, since I have saved the best for last. The  most interesting thing about the MBR gathering was not who was  there but who was not. Thus, there was not a single person from  Markulov's Liberal Party, which has considerable influence in  Donetsk. There was no one from the Liberal Democratic Party of  Ukraine, which is very popular around Kharkov. There was  Retelnish, but as an observer; they summed up the event  laconically as a "gathering of the political dead." There were  no regional PDVU organizations from Odessa, Lugansk, western  Ukraine and many central oblasts. More than a dozen of regional  civic organizations from the South and East were missing,  ranging from the Kharkov Professional Union to the Odessa Forum,  which are very influential in their own oblasts. The  Constitutional Democrats and many others were absent, as well.  Dnepropetrovsk's major powers that be, their highnesses the  directors, were not present. I purposefully go through the  entire Russian-speaking political spectrum of the East and  South, without mentioning an Ukrainian-speaking parties,  centrists or rightists; let us be realistic, they are rather  weak there. Finally, ABSENT was the uncrowned king of  Russian-speaking free-market reformers of Ukraine and the god of  the liberal camp, Volodymyr Lanovoy.    Their absence is very telling. It indicates a process that  has been going on quietly for three years. The Russified East  has split in two. Some, although continuing to insist on their  Russian language and even ethnicity, no longer want to joint the  one indivisible Mother-Russia. The problem is that the dear land  stinks: it has Zhirinovskiy, chaos and confusion. It also likes  to pick others' pockets, which nobody likes. So they worry about  facing a home-grown Karabakh and want no federations or unions.  At the most, they want a supply of concrete inputs for their  factories. A stamp in the passport and Ukraine citizenship are  gradually becoming a reality for them. It is interesting that  the Russian-speaking intellectual elites have joined this camp.    Meanwhile, our dear nomenklatura, true to form, is marching  toward its coveted Russian shore, which is natural: folks of  their own kind are there, perhaps turned from red to white, pink  and even crimson, but their own kind none the less.</p>

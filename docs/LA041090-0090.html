			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLD RUSH THEME PARK PLANNED  </P> <P> A South African developer is hoping to find gold in them thar San Joaquin  County acres by developing a Disneyland-style theme park based on the Gold Rush  era.  </P> <P> Architect Norman Jarrett, who immigrated to Northern California from  Johannesburg in 1986, said Monday that he is in preliminary stages of  negotiating to buy more than 4,500 acres of San Joaquin County farmland.  </P> <P> If the necessary zoning changes and approvals can be secured, the land would be  used for a $2-billion development encompassing the Gold Rush City theme park,  as well as houses and apartments, time-share condominiums, hotels, a regional  mall, a business park, a wild animal park and golf courses.  </P> <P> Gold Rush City, which the developers say could attract as many as 3 million  visitors a year, would feature a re-creation of 1850s San Francisco, with  horse-drawn vehicles, steam trains and boats. But it would also offer roller  coasters and other rides.  </P> <P> Approval for the project is by no means a sure thing. Jarrett and his financial  backers will face strong opposition from land preservationists. Fast-growing  San Joaquin County and other Central Valley areas already are seeing the  encroachment of new "bedroom communities" housing workers who cannot afford to  buy homes in San Francisco, the East Bay or Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> "It's right smack in the middle of some of the world's best farmland," Will  Shafroth, Western regional director of the American Farmland Trust, said of the  proposed development. "This puts the ball in the county's court" to determine  whether such development will be allowed.  </P> <P> Kitty Walker, senior planner for San Joaquin County, said the county generally  is "in a pro-growth mode." Because of the seasonal nature of agriculture, the  county's unemployment rate tends to be high and the county favors development  as a way to provide jobs. The developers say this project would provide 20,000  jobs and $15 million in annual tax revenue for the county.  </P> <P> "Preservation of agricultural land is still a high priority," Walker said, "but  it's in conflict with our growth accommodation."  </P> <P> However, she added that the Gold Rush City developers might be faced with  "overwhelming" environmental concerns.  </P> <P> The farmland picked for development -- just east of Tracy on the San Joaquin  River near where Interstates 205 and 5 meet -- is on a flood plain on reclaimed  delta land protected by levees.  </P> <P> Jarrett and his backers are in the process of negotiating options to buy the  land from several owners. The contracts would hinge on the developers'  receiving the necessary zoning changes and approvals.  </P> <P> Much of the backing for the project would be from Miami-based Tate &amp; Lyle  Enterprises, which would be half owner. It is a subsidiary of Booker Tate Ltd.,  a British company with extensive sugar-processing facilities and landholdings  worldwide.  </P> <P> Gary Pike, a San Francisco publicist for the project, cautioned that the  negotiations are in very preliminary stages. Even if plans proceeded apace, the  theme park would not receive guests until 1994 and other segments of the  project would take as long as 15 years.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be an easy road," Pike said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles architect George Rester, who worked for 20 years as Walt Disney  Co.'s chief architect, has been hired to assist in the planning.  </P> <P> GOLD RUSH  </P> <P> The proposed site in San Joaquin County of a theme park based on California's  Gold Rush era.  </P></p>

These requirements are in addition to the Minimum Transportation Requirements of subpart C of this part which are applicable to all of the materials listed in table 148.10 of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;148.205  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Ammonium nitrate fertilizers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) This section applies to the stowage and transportation in bulk of the following fertilizers composed of uniform, nonsegregating mixtures containing ammonium nitrate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Ammonium nitrate with added matter which is organic and chemically inert towards ammonium nitrate; containing not less than 90% of ammonium nitrate and not more than 0.2% of combustible material (including organic material calculated as carbon); or containing less than 90% but more than 70% of ammonium nitrate and not more than 0.4% combustible material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Ammonium nitrate with calcium carbonate and/or dolomite, containing more than 80% but less than 90% of ammonium nitrate and not more than 0.4% of total combustible material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Ammonium nitrate with ammonium sulfate containing more than 45% but not more than 70% of ammonium nitrate and containing not more than 0.4% of combustible material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Nitrogen phosphate or nitrogen/potash type fertilizers or complete nitrogen/phosphate/potash type fertilizers containing more than 70% but less than 90% of ammonium nitrate and not more than 0.4% of combustible material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) No ammonium nitrate fertilizer to which this section applies may be transported in bulk unless it demonstrates resistance to detonation when tested as prescribed in appendix D.5 of the BC Code or an equivalent test satisfactory to the Administration of the country of origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Prior to loading fertilizer to which this section applies_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The shipper must provide the master of the vessel with a written certification that the ammonium nitrate fertilizer has met the test requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The cargo hold must be inspected for cleanliness and must be free from readily combustible materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Each cargo hatch must be weathertight as defined in &sect;42.13&hyph;10 of this chapter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The temperature of the fertilizer must be less than 55 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (131 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Each fuel tank situated under a cargo hold where the fertilizer is to be stowed must be pressure tested to ensure that there is no leakage of manholes or piping systems leading through the cargo hold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Bunkering or transferring of fuel may not be performed during cargo loading and unloading operations involving fertilizer to which this section applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) When a fertilizer to which this section applies is transported on a cargo vessel_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) No other material may be stowed in the same hold with the fertilizer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In addition to the segregation requirements in &sect;148.140, the fertilizer must be separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from readily combustible materials, chlorates, chlorides, chlorites, hypochlorites, nitrites, permanganates, and fibrous materials; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The bulkhead between a cargo hold containing the fertilizer and the engine room must be insulated to ``A&hyph;60'' class division or an equivalent arrangement to the satisfaction of the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the Port or the Administration of the country of shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;148.220  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Ammonium nitrate-phosphate fertilizer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a) This section applies to the stowage and transportation of uniform, nonsegregating mixtures of nitrogen/phosphate or nitrogen/potash type fertilizers, or complete fertilizers of nitrogen/phosphate/potash type containing not more than 70% of ammonium nitrate and containing not more than 0.4% total added combustible material or containing not more than 45% ammonium nitrate with unrestricted combustible material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) This part does not apply to a fertilizer mixture described in paragraph (a) of this section if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When tested in the trough test prescribed in Appendix D.4 of the BC code, it is found to be free from the risk of self-sustaining decomposition; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It does not contain an excess of nitrate calculated as potassium nitrate above the nitrate calculated as ammonium nitrate greater than 10% by weight of the mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) No fertilizer to which this section applies may be transported in bulk if, when tested in the trough test prescribed in Appendix D.4 of the BC code, it has a self-sustaining decomposition rate that is greater than 0.25 m/h, or is liable to self-heating sufficient to initiate decomposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Fertilizers to which this section applies must be stowed away from all sources of heat; and out of direct contact with a metal engine compartment boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

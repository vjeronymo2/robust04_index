			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Left-wing rebels win five Liverpool seats LEFT-WING labour rebels standing against official Labour candidates took five out of six seats in the Liverpool council elections. The six were either retiring Labour councillors already suspended from the party or local nominees opposed to Liverpool's moderate Labour leadership. The moderates were standing against the background of a series of strikes aimed at stopping 1,000 redundancies among council workers. They nevertheless improved their grip on the council with a gain from the Liberal Democrats, the defeat of one of the rebels and the replacement of another in a ward that remained loyal. The rebels, their nominators and supporters now face expulsion from the Labour Party. A report will be ready next week for submission to the May meeting of Labour's national executive committee. Up to 100 people are expected to be named. Labour may also challenge the results in the election court, which can disqualify winners if misconduct can be proved. Officials said early today they had clear evidence of rebels misrepresenting themselves as official candidates and confusing voters.</p>

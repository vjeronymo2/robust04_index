			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy If the Treasury's panel of forecasters is really wise, the department was certainly clever to think of bringing it together. Between Patrick Minford, who thinks the PSBR is entirely cyclical, and Wynne Godley, who thinks it largely structural, there is plenty of room to divide and rule. If there is a semblance of consensus in yesterday's report, it is that inflationary pressures remain subdued enough to allow further interest rate cuts. That would certainly come in useful when, as four of the panel point out, further fiscal tightening is also necessary. Such sentiments may only increase the pressure for lower rates before November's budget. Yesterday's money supply figures show some pick-up in the MO measure for June but the expansion of consumer credit slackened in May and recent data is consistent with a slowdown in second-quarter growth. Sterling is strong. The government has to face the Christchurch by-election and the Tory party conference before it even begins to think seriously about the Budget. Mr Clarke will just have to hope that there is some scope left by then for lower interest rates to ease the fiscal pain.</p>

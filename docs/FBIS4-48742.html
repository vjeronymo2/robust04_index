			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 25 May (AFP) -- A group of personalities  from the Union of Independent Democrats [UDI] has formed a  "radical wing" faithful to the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition [USOR], Frederic Kibassa Maliba, president of the  opposition group, announced yesterday evening. The UDI is one  of the member parties of the Union for the Republic and  Democracy [URD], which broke away from the USOR leadership,  accusing it of being driven by Tshisekedi's party, the Union for  Democracy and Social Progress [UPDS].    The URD considers that the USOR, to which it still belongs,  will be henceforth divided into two camps, a moderate one, which  it represents, and a radical one, driven by the UDPS and its  followers. Kibassa Maliba also announced that the USOR and its  allies supported the call for a ghost city demonstration on 27  May. This event is aimed at the "defense of the Transitional  Constitution," according to Lambert Mende, information minister  for the Tshisekedi government.    An initial call to turn Kinshasa into a ghost city was made  yesterday morning by the Innovating Forces of the Sacred Union,  one of the hardline groups in the USOR "to confirm their  confidence in the prime minister-elect". Until this morning,  the URD had not made its position known concerning the call for  a ghost city operation, or concerning the defection from the UDI.</p>

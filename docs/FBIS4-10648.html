			<p>BFN     [Text] Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem has received  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on the first day of his  48-hour official visit to Buenos Aires, which both parties  described as very positive.    Robaina, who met with the Argentine president for almost an  hour at the Olivos presidential residence, said that the meeting  was useful, positive, and friendly.    Argentine Acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who  also  participated in the meeting, told the press that the Cuban  foreign minister's visit is very important, successful, and  significant.    In remarks to reporters in Buenos Aires, Robaina, who on  Wednesday also met with the Senate president and with the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, said that many more things unite  the countries than separate them.    According to what was learned, Menem has proposed the  forthcoming visit to Havana of a delegation of Argentine  businessmen to sound out current conditions for trade and  investments in Cuba.    Robaina, who was declared illustrious visitor by the  Argentine congress, added that he also met with members of the  Argentine stock market, with members of the community of Cuban  residents in Argentina, and with leaders of the leftist  coalition, Grand Front.    Robaina's visit will conclude within the next few hours with  a popular act in Buenos Aires organized by several groups of  friendship and solidarity that demand the end of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba. Robaina will leave for Paraguay on 15  April.</p>

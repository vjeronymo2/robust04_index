			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Depressing not to have manufacturer among rights issues Sir, I find it somewhat depressing that the rights issue season should have 'kicked off' without any representation from the manufacturing sector. With the government's heavy funding programme, equity capital is likely to be in short supply and, accordingly, the City's traditional 'first come, first served' method of allocating capital needs to be supplemented with a more pro-active approach. Institutions, and company corporate advisers, should be encouraging the manufacturers and exporters to re-finance to take advantage of the opportunities created by sterling's decline rather than the retailers and importers of whom we already have a surfeit.

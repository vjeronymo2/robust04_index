			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Fears over share security deter investors in Russia Fears that factory officials may tamper with share registers are emerging as an impediment to foreign investment in Russia. The head of a leading western fund manager said the custody of shares by factory bosses 'is the single largest deterrent to western investment'. She added that big investment banks were keen to expand in Russia but not without 'proper settlement and custody of shares'. Russia was the worst of the world's emerging markets in terms of offering investors security for their share purchases. The sole document that establishes ownership over shares in Russia is the register of shareholders in a particular privatised enterprise. Legally, share registers of companies with more than 1,000 shareholders must be held by independent registrars, but many of Russia's largest companies directly control their own registers. 'It is a totally insecure system,' said one western investment banker in Moscow. 'It goes without saying that there's a conflict of interest when the factory controls the shareholders' register. Foreign investors are concerned that the system is being abused by factory directors who might be tempted to rid themselves of unwanted new owners by deleting them from the share register. Mr David Reuben, president of Transworld, the London-based company which dominates the Russian metals' trade, alleges share tampering took place last week at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, one of the world's largest aluminium producers. 'The 20 per cent stake in the company (which could be worth as much as Dollars 300m) owned by our proxies was simply erased from the register,' Mr Reuben claims. 'The Russian law is a complete disaster. Shareholders are completely at the mercy of the factory managers.' According to Mr Vladimir Lysyn and Mr Sergei Sukholinski-Mestechkin, Mr Reuben's Moscow business associates, the alleged share tampering became clear last Tuesday, when they travelled to Krasnoyarsk for a shareholders' meeting. Mr Lysyn says that when he and his colleague arrived at the factory gates they were turned away by armed guards and told their names no longer appeared on the register. Mr Sergei Petrushin, director of the securities department at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, confirmed that the shares held by Transworld's proxies had been struck from the share register, which is directly controlled by the factory. But he contended that the shares had been improperly purchased in the first place. 'We made a mistake in May by including them in the share register and now we have corrected it,' he said. Russian bankers say this insecure share registry system has spun off a mini-industry in the sale of shares by brokers who do not actually own them. The unfortunate buyers learn they have been deceived only when they try to add their names to the official register and discover that either the broker or the vendor does not exist.</p>

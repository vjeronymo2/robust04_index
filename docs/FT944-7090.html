			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids D-day approaches for shareholders in Attwoods, the waste services company fighting a Pounds 391m hostile cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US, writes Peggy Hollinger. When the more than 70 per cent of Attwoods shareholders who are based in the US come back from their Thanksgiving holiday, they will have just five days to decide which side to back. Acceptances are due in by 1pm on Friday. It appeared last week that some had already made up their minds. 'Cash today as opposed to promises tomorrow is a lot more attractive,' said one institutional investor. BFI is expected on Monday to reveal the level of acceptances it has received so far. Attwoods is fighting the bid by promising investors greater value from breaking itself up. It has lined up a number of potential purchasers for its UK business, and possible buyers or merger partners for the US operation. Waste Management International, the UK arm of WMX - another US company - is the only one so far to have made its interest known. But buyers are believed to be reluctant to lay their cards on the table until they are confident BFI will go away. That appears unlikely at this stage. BFI's original offer of 109p has been increased to 116.75, plus a 3.25p dividend. With the shares at 116p, the market appears to think the game is all but over. Meanwhile, the other serious bid to pre-occupy the market this week has been the ongoing battle between British Aerospace and GEC for control of VSEL, which makes submarines. VSEL changed its company articles to allow GEC to take over the company at an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday night. Approval for BAe's bid was given at a similar meeting on November 9. The two companies are now free to acquire VSEL provided they receive clearance from the Office of Fair Trading, due to report by December 7. But VSEL's company rules mean that neither can buy more than 15 per cent of VSEL's shares until its bid is declared unconditional. Since GEC already owns 14.9 per cent of VSEL, it is effectively barred from further purchases until it has acceptances for more than 50 per cent of the shares. BAe has a small shareholding and could increase its stake. There was some speculation that GEC might be tempted to break this rule, but most analysts thought it unlikely. GEC has assured the Ministry of Defence that it will keep the Yarrow yard on the Clyde open for at least seven years. This addresses fears that if both Yarrow and Barrow were owned by GEC, one would be closed. BAe issued a document slating GEC's export record and abilities as a prime contractor. The company was arguing this week that its variable-size 'trombone' rights issue to fund the VSEL bid put it back on an even footing with GEC. VSEL's shares closed 25p up at 1520p as the impact of BAe's increased offer sank in. BAe rose 9p to 452p, and GEC closed down 3 1/2 p at 274p.</p>

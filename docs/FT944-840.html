			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Power to the people - very Machiavellian Sir, Whatever Machiavelli's faults or merits, as either human being or management consultant ('Pioneers and Prophets', December 19), to say that 'empowerment was not in his vocabulary' is true only in the sense that this grisly word had not come into currency in the 15th century. This is what he said about political turmoil in Rome's republican era: 'If tumults led to the creation of the tribunes, tumults deserve the highest praise, since, besides giving the populace a share in the administration, they served as the guardian of Roman liberties' (Discourses, 1.4). In Discourse 58 (roundly titled 'The Masses are more Knowing and more Constant than is a Prince') he explicitly concludes that 'government by the populace is better than government by princes'. Machiavelli speaks plainly about how to impose or maintain tyranny because he wishes to avoid the consequences of taking would-be tyrants on the smooth face they present to the public. So no talk of 'empowerment' - but then none about 'downsizing', either. Julian Wells, lecturer in economics, International Business and Languages, South Bank University, London SE1 0AA</p>

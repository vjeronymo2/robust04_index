			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report on the 45th anniversary of Shanghai's </F> liberation" by reporter Zhang Zhiyuan (1728 5268 6678): "Having  Sent 16 Satellites Into Space and Gone Through Four Stages From  Scratch, Shanghai's Space Industry has Achieved World-Renowned  Results"]    [Text] Starting from scratch, Shanghai's space industry  has developed a complete research and development system for  carrier rockets and artificial satellites. After carrying its  first launch assignment with a large carrier rocket, Shanghai  sent 16 artificial satellites into space on 13 occasions, either  independently or through joint efforts, with a 100-percent  success rate. This has stunned the world's space industry.    The first and second stages of the "Long March-3" rocket,  which won a special state award, were developed by Shanghai's  space industry base with the New China Machinery Plant -- the  main assembly plant -- as the core. For several years after  that, scientists, engineers, and technicians from the space  industry base's 300-plus research departments, institutions of  higher learning, and production enterprises dedicated themselves  to the independent development of the large "Long March-4"  carrier rocket of advanced world standards, as well as the new,  two-stage liquid- propellant "Long March-2d" rocket.    Since the initial stage of large carrier rocket research and  development, Shanghai's space industry base has leapfrogged  through four stages. During the first stage, which began on 26  July 1975, Shanghai designed and developed the "Windstorm-1"  rocket with the support and assistance of other concerns at  home, and then used it to send the "Sky-1" satellite into space.  During the second stage, which began on 20 September 1981,  Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly completed our  country's first assignment of launching three satellites into  orbit on a single rocket. During the third stage, which began  on 8 April 1984, Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly  sent our country's first geostationary experimental  communications satellite into orbit on the "Long March-3"  rocket. During the fourth stage, Shanghai splendidly  accomplished the assignment of launching "Asiasat-1," the first  foreign satellite launched by our country for commercial  purposes. The satellite, which was manufactured by the  U.S.-based Hughes Aircraft Company, was an "extraterrestrial  visitor." Sent into space by a U.S. spacecraft in 1984, it  could not enter the predetermined orbit due to engine trouble.  Nine months later, it was retrieved by the mechanical arm of a  U.S. spacecraft. The satellite immediately began communications  and broadcasting services after it was successfully sent into  orbit by the "Long March-3" rocket.    Toward the end of the sixties, Zhou Enlai, then-premier of  the State Council, advanced the idea of developing space  technology in the old industrial base of Shanghai, citing its  strengths such as a sound industrial base, extensive academic  disciplines, cooperation-friendly conditions, and a plethora of  scientific research institutions. By now, Shanghai has trained  and groomed a specialized technical corps capable of designing  entire space vehicles and various subsystems, developed a  complete research and development system for carrier rockets and  artificial satellites, and established a space industry  cooperation network comprising more than 300 institutions of  higher learning, research departments, and factories. Moreover,  Shanghai has installed testing apparatus and equipment of fairly  large scale, such as rocket engine and cold-flow test beds.    Shanghai's space industry is converting its technological  strengths into tremendous social and economic benefits. It has  used its technology to build space-related systems, such as  satellite television ground receiving systems and large radio  and television acoustics systems, some of which have made their  way onto the international market. Moreover, it has produced  more than 1 million iceboxes for use in space.</p>

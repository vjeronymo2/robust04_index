			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [IRNA report from Dushanbe] </F>   [Text] The Tajikistan radio and television station has  displayed an increasing interest in pure Iranian music and  programs in the past few weeks. Radio Dushanbe is carrying more  than an hour of traditional Iranian music daily.    Tajikistan's television has also carried Iranian programs  such as the "Shakh-e Tuba" [the branch of a tree in Paradise],  the serial "A'ineh" [mirror], and some Iranian feature films and  has included Iranian traditional music in its musical  repertoires.    The Iranian programs have been warmly received by the  Farsi-speaking Tajik television aficionados and audiences, which  has resulted in more time being allocated to these programs.    The presentation of these Iranian programs by the Tajikistan  radio and television stations has drawn the attention of the  citizens of this country toward their mother tongue and is  gradually familiarizing them with certain expressions in Farsi  that were not in vogue in Tajikistan earlier.    In the past year, more than 3,400 minutes of programs  produced by the Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran have been  disseminated by Tajikistan television.</p>

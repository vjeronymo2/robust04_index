			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BROWN'S ATTORNEYS ARE QUITTING CASE  </P> <P> Millionaire David A. Brown's attempts to have county prosecutors for his murder  trial be replaced by ones from the attorney general's office came to an abrupt  halt Friday when Brown's own attorneys quit his case.  </P> <P> Attorney Joel W. Baruch said in Superior Court in Santa Ana that he and his  partner, Jack M. Earley, must declare a conflict of interest, but he did not  say what the conflict is.  </P> <P> It is Baruch who has vehemently argued that county prosecutors are biased  against Brown because of his involvement in a plot from the jail to have two  members of the county staff killed. Now it will be up to Brown's new attorneys  to decide whether to pursue the request for new prosecutors.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey, who appeared surprised by the sudden  turn of events, said after a closed-door hearing that he was satisfied that  there was nothing more he could do to determine either the reasons for the  conflict Baruch and Earley had declared or to act on it in any other way.  </P> <P> Brown, 36, of Anaheim is accused of masterminding a plot involving the fatal  shooting of his first wife four years ago and letting his daughter, then 14,  take sole responsibility for the crime. The daughter had served three years of  a murder sentence when she recanted last year, leading to Brown's arrest last  August. Last January, Brown was accused of trying while he was in jail to hire  someone to kill his second wife -- a key witness against him -- and also the  prosecutor and chief investigator in the murder case involving his first wife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Involvement Admitted  </P> <P> Brown has admitted his involvement in the jail plot but said other inmates had  set him up.  </P> <P> Reports had been circulating about differences between Brown and Baruch, but  Baruch said after a court hearing that the reasons he and Earley were leaving  the case were unavoidable but unrelated to their relationship with their  client.  </P> <P> "If he'd had any problems with us, he would have fired us," Baruch said. "But  that's not what happened."  </P> <P> Baruch told the court that the conflict had come up since the last court  hearing, which was the Friday before. By law, lawyers in most conflict  situations are not permitted to reveal their reasons.  </P> <P> Most defendants in murder cases cannot afford their own attorneys and must,  therefore, be represented by court-appointed counsel. Brown, who in recent  years had been very successful in a computer-related business, hired Baruch and  Earley on his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speculation on Replacement  </P> <P> Baruch said Brown will make his decision about hiring a new attorney soon.  </P> <P> Although Baruch said he did not know who the new attorney would be, Baruch was  seen conferring with C. Thomas McDonald, who will soon complete his duties as  co-counsel for convicted serial killer Randy Steven Kraft.  </P> <P> "Tom would certainly be a good choice for him," was Baruch's limited response  to speculation about whether McDonald might represent Brown.  </P></p>

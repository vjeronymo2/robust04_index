			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Where responsibility lies over the future of London orchestras Sir, Given the general misconceptions that have arisen over the role of Sir Leonard Hoffman in relation to the funding of the London orchestras, it is important to set the record straight and point out that Antony Thorncroft is quite incorrect when he asserts ('Out of Tune with its clients', December 11) that 'it was a ludicrous dereliction of duty to ask an outsider, Sir Leonard Hoffmann, to decide which of the three orchestras should receive Arts Council money'. The committee of orchestral experts, chaired by Sir Leonard (in a lay capacity) was appointed to offer independent analysis to advise the council's music panel. The panel in turn recommends to the full council what it considers to be the best course of action to take. It is the council itself that is responsible for making the decision. Moreover, Sir Leonard was not chosen because of his (unquestioned) legal eminence, but for his outstanding abilities in chairing an independent committee. Your correspondent goes on to suggest that 'according to the council's plan, the LPO was to get the vote, confirming its position as house orchestra at the South Bank'. Not so. There was no such plan, no such vote-rigging, as implied - and no pre-set hidden agenda. The Arts Council has throughout remained open-minded on the issue. It has taken its decision on the basis of the advice by the Hoffmann committee - and in the light of a full analysis of the implications of the reduced grant it has received for next year. This is not, let it be said, 'another example of the Arts Council's unresolved battle as to whether its role is to fight for the arts, or to give government better value for its subsidy'. We at the Arts Council believe that, contrary to the distorting views of some of our critics, we can - and do - perform both functions; the first priority is an integral part of the accomplishment of the second. They are not mutually exclusive aims. Complex issues are involved here, matters that have to be handled in a proper procedural and responsible manner. The council is thus now in the process of making some difficult decisions and drawing up a range of - in some instances - unpalatable priorities. Such deliberations simply cannot be conveyed, or indeed dismissed, in the simplistic language of the headline makers. Anthony Everitt, secretary-general, The Arts Council of Great Britain, 14 Great Peter Street, London SW1P 3NQ</p>

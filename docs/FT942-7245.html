			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: In a bind with bonds It is difficult to believe that barely a week has passed since the promise of a hiatus in US monetary tightening was supposed to bring calm to financial markets. Yesterday's 68 point fall in London equities came in the slipstream of some bad news from the bond markets, notably Germany's decision to withdraw a debt auction for lack of demand. But there were local factors at work as well. Though the UK's own gilts auction was well covered at 1.93 times, there were doubts as to how much of the paper found its way into firm hands. There is growing indigestion in the new issue market for equities, coupled with the prospect of a not particularly appetising rights issue from Eurotunnel this morning. With the FT-SE 100 index hovering not far above 3,000, equities arguably offer value. The economic recovery has apparently survived last month's tax rises, while both earnings and dividends have proved surprisingly buoyant in 1994. Yet the argument is not compelling. The market is still on a historic p/e not far short of 20. The earnings momentum may falter next year when both interest rates and taxes will be rising again. As for dividends, Whitehall chatter about possible action to stop companies over-paying is a destabilising force. The most worrisome aspect is that the more the authorities come under funding pressure in a weak gilt market, the more they may be tempted to alter the fiscal regime in a way that favours bonds over equities.</p>

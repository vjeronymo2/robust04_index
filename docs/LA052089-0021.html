			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: 'BIG BIRD': LESS SHOW, MORE BIZ  </P> <P> "Big Bird's Sesame Street Story" looks like a little bit of Las Vegas.  </P> <P> A ramp, bordered by glittering lights, juts into the floor of the arenas where  the touring extravaganza is staged (at the Sports Arena through Sunday, then on  to Long Beach and Anaheim Convention Centers). The proscenium of the stage  proper is ablaze with light. Before the acts begin, colored lights swoop around  the hall, heralding the arrival of the Sesame Street denizens.  </P> <P> It's exciting, as Las Vegas is, but it's awfully grandiose for these unassuming  characters. And the story line is even more narcissistic: a look at how "Sesame  Street" got to be a TV show.  </P> <P> It isn't a factual story; no one mentions Muppets creator Jim Henson. But its  explanation of how everyone had to be convinced that kids would want to learn  something from TV, as well as be entertained, is ridiculously self-promotional.  Have writers Jon Stone and Joseph A. Bailey run out of story ideas that would  more directly relate to the real concerns of preschoolers?  </P> <P> Many of the kids pay no attention to the story. But they do respond with shouts  and stares to the sight of life-sized Muppets (notably excepting Kermit the  Frog, who is nowhere to be seen) dancing, skating, singing, even bathing.  </P> <P> Furthermore, there are so many souvenirs to buy and play with. The most  distracting of these are annoying $4 flashlights. A couple of children near me  waved these at each other throughout the second act, oblivious to the show.  </P> <P>  At the Sports Arena today at noon and 3:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5 p.m. At  Long Beach Convention Center Wednesday through May 28. At Anaheim Convention  Center May 31-June 4. Tickets: $8-$10.50; (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.  </P></p>

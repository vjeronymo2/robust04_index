			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor Norwegians, in control of their own destiny Sir, Pity the poor Norwegians. They will not be allowed to contribute to the cost of inflated EU bureaucracy: they will not have the privilege of paying CAP prices for their food. They will not enjoy the economic blight produced by an artificially fixed exchange rate - or a single currency, which is the same, but permanent. Worse still: they will have to make all their own decisions about how their lives should be run. Really, my heart bleeds for them. Allan Beattie, 2 Kremesch Oicht, L-7473 Schoenfels, Luxembourg</p>

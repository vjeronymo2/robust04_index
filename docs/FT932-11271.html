			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: NHS trust managers constrained from above Sir, Unfortunately the National Health Service's former personnel director, Eric Caines, is all too correct when he says the opportunities for NHS trusts to break free from centralised pay and personnel policies are at risk ('No way to run a health service', April 27). It is unfair, however, to lay so much blame on trust managers, most of whom have been tightly constrained, not only by the political aspects he describes, but also by revenue limitations and the huge agenda for organisational and managerial change they have been implementing. Many human resource managers have quietly progressed with incremental change while acquiring the new skills needed for local pay bargaining and establishing new relationships with staff unions. Most have introduced new personnel policies and trust employment contracts, restricted in use by the protection of staff on national conditions under the transfer arrangements. Initial dreams of attracting staff off the Whitley council system and simplifying pay structures proved, with few exceptions, not to be viable due to the sheer cost on the paybill, especially in the larger multifunctional units, and, latterly, the 1.5 per cent pay limit. Recession deferred the demographic black hole, while emphasis on local needs logically means differing priorities on limited resources. As Caines points out, progress has generally been far short of expectations  -empty promises and changeable political agenda provide sandy foundations. Simply telling trusts to get rid of Whitley shows an abdication rather than delegation of issues. Failure to announce the phasing out of national negotiating machinery and the continued central impositions have conflicted with promises of devolved management. Most trusts want the opportunity to devise local arrangements but lack certainty of agenda and backing by top management and politicians. Accountability to the public is vital, but responsibility appears to have been devolved more readily than the authority to manage.

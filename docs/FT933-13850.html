			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Do some homework before you make a bid - There are bargains, but a cheap property is not necessarily a good buy. Many will have been repossessed - and empty houses can deteriorate / Buying your house 3, At auction YEARS AGO, my grandmother went to a Cardiff auction intending to buy a rocking horse. To my mother's disappointment, she returned with no horse, but a house instead. Can buying a house at auction still be approached so lightly? Perhaps not quite, but auctioneers are doing their best to catch the recent wave of public enthusiasm for property auctions by making the whole process as user-friendly as possible. The option of buying at auction was almost forgotten during the estate agents' boom of the 1980s, leaving the field clear for property developers and speculators. Since the housing market collapsed, however, the established auction houses have encouraged private buyers back. A recent newcomer to the UK is the American auction company Kennedy-Wilson, which aims entirely at private buyers. It takes on whole developments of new flats or houses, often where the builder has gone bust or the properties have failed to sell, and carries out an intense marketing campaign leading up to an auction. Much of the current interest in auctions is due to large numbers of repossessed houses being sold for apparently ridiculously low prices: Pounds 10,000 for a house sounds like a bargain to most people. But the prices that make the headlines are by their nature unusual. 'Historically, properties sold at auction are always sold at a bit of a discount,' says Robin Cripp, director of auctions at Barnard Marcus. This is because the speed of the sale can save the seller money. Whether or not you get a real bargain can depend on how well-attended the sale is, and how much interest there is in a particular property. Also, remember that a cheap house is not necessarily a good buy. Many properties sold at auction are empty, because they have been repossessed or are being sold by the executors of an estate. Empty property deteriorates fast, and disillusioned home-owners facing repossession often vent their frustration by ripping out the fittings and smashing up the house. Repairing the damage, whether caused by neglect or intent, can add considerably to the price. This is why most auctioneers recommend that you inspect the property thoroughly, and, if in any doubt at all about its condition, arrange a survey before the auction. It means that you pay in advance for a report on a property for which you could be outbid, but the price of a survey is small compared with the cost of dealing with, say, massive subsidence. 'Do your homework,' is one piece of advice given by everyone involved in the auction business. Unless you or your solicitor check legal documents and local authority searches before the auction, you could buy a house only to find that it has a sitting tenant, is subject to a listed building preservation order, or has only a few years of a lease to run. The auctioneers usually have copies of legal documents and search reports available for inspection, and onerous conditions should be pointed out in the sale catalogue, but it is safer to make your own checks as well. If you are particularly keen on a property, it can be worth making an offer before the sale, to avoid being outbid. If your offer is above the reserve, and the auctioneers are not expecting the sale to be very well attended, it may be accepted. Some auctioneers, however, discourage buying before the sale, on the grounds that it removes the seller's chance of a better price. But, since this can happen, check whether your chosen house is still for sale before you go along to the auction. A large proportion of property auctions are held in London, even if the houses for sale are scattered around the country. Watch out for advertisements in the national press or your local paper. If you cannot attend the sale in person, you can usually arrange to bid by proxy or over the telephone. Stickley &amp; Kent is one company that is trying to demystify the subject for first-time property auction attenders. First, it set up a premium rate advice line; now it has launched a video. For Pounds 9.95, the professionally produced video guides potential buyers through every step of buying a house at auction, from ringing up for a catalogue to dealing with the paperwork after a successful bid. Other auction houses offer the same advice free. Most are happy to arrange a chat about procedure and what preparation is needed. Kennedy-Wilson runs 'how to' seminars in the run-up to its sales around the country, where interested buyers can voice commonly-held worries, such as whether scratching an itchy nose can be mistaken for a bid. In fact, at Kennedy-Wilson's auctions, bidders must register in advance and are given numbered cards with which to signal a bid. At other auction houses, waving the catalogue is recommended as an unambiguous way to attract the auctioneer's attention. Once the hammer comes down on your bid, that is it. There is no threat of a gazumper emerging to snatch a prized Georgian townhouse from your grasp; but then again, there is no room for second thoughts over the charmingly dilapidated cottage with no running water. You must have a cheque, banker's draft or cash for the deposit, usually 10 per cent, ready to hand over at the auction. If for any reason you pull out, you lose the deposit and could face legal action for further costs. The balance of the purchase price is usually due 28 days after the auction. This is faster than many mortgage lenders are used to moving. So, unless you are a cash buyer, you need to start arranging finance well before the day of the auction. Building societies can withhold part of the mortgage until the property is in a good state of repair, so, if you are buying a repossessed wreck, take this into account in your calculations, or you could find yourself with a shortfall when the 28 days are up. Finally, two obvious but crucial points. First, know your price limit and stick to it. It is less easy to get carried away when you are dealing with thousands rather than tens of pounds, but it can be tempting to go just that little bit further when a house you have fallen in love with is at stake. And second, check, double-check and memorise the lot number of the property you have your eye on. People have been known to buy the wrong house by mistake.</p>

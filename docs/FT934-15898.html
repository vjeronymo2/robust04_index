			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Postel bid to rescue Greycoat rejected THE Pounds 120m plan to rescue Greycoat, one of Britain's most audacious and acclaimed property developers of the 1980s, was yesterday roundly rejected by bond and shareholders. The failure of the bid from Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, leaves Greycoat on the brink of liquidation and in default on its debts. The decision is also a setback for Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, who had taken a particularly high profile in an attempt to enlarge the pension fund's position in the recovering UK property market. Greycoat will now have to seek a further waiver to allow it to further defer interest payments already deferred while investors considered the Postel proposals. In heated meetings, two classes of investors rejected the rescue bid: preference shareholders and holders of zero coupon bonds, which offer capital gains instead of interest payments. The dissenting investors claimed that Postel had undervalued Greycoat's properties, which include the prestigious Embankment Place, above London's Charing Cross Station, and Britannic House, where BP is the tenant. They also claimed Greycoat had consistently refused to give investors the information they needed to evaluate the Postel deal and that it had failed to take into account the rise in the property market since the bid was first formulated. Greycoat's board had warned that rejection of Postel's offer would most likely lead to liquidation as the company would be unable to meet payments on some of its bonds. But as the board retreated to lick its wounds, property market analysts said other bidders could come forward. The attraction for a bidder is a portfolio of properties considered among London's most attractive. But like Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two other property companies that have recently failed, Greycoat fell foul of the longest recession in the property market for decades. Greycoat had also arranged financing of exceptional complexity involving four classes of share and bondholders. As yesterday's votes showed, these holders often had competing interests. Preference shareholders argued that Postel's complex four-part offer was placing them at a disadvantage to ordinary shareholders - who accepted the deal and would normally expect to rank behind them in a restructuring. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, had repeatedly warned the meetings that Postel's deal was 'all-or-nothing' and that shareholders could not modify individual portions. 'It is a rescue package to prevent the company from having to cease trading and all that entails,' he said. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Upbeat and dreamy - An unashamedly escapist 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' Six years ago the Georgian Film Actors' Studio of Tbilisi was the toast of the Edinburgh Festival with its mischievous Don Juan. The company's irreverent version of Moliere's play was laced with witty stage business and absurd characters, the most inspired being an onstage prompt who ran the show from a hole in the stage, chivvying along her wayward co-performers. The same light touch and impish mood characterises the company's A Midsummer Night's Dream (showing in The Pit as part of the Everybody's Shakespeare Festival), though this time the comedy is gentler and more benign. Mikhail Tumanishvili, the company's charismatic director, developed this production during 1992, when Georgia was gripped by civil war. Rather than reflect the distress around him, he chose to cheer his audiences up, and his production is unashamedly escapist and genial, turning its back on some of the darker notes in the play. The production's airy, dreamy mood is helped by the set, a simple cream space backed by a brightly coloured curtain that looks like a Jackson Pollock off-cut and a row of gauze screens also streaked with paint. This suggests a spirit of creativity, while at the same time being reminiscent of a nursery, and it makes for one single arena which, differently lit, is at once Athenian court, dark wood and fairy bower. This emphasises physically that the dream world and real world are closely intertwined - a notion Tumanishvili reinforces by having Titania and Oberon played by the same couple as Theseus and Hyppolita. Puck simply substitutes Theseus's golden wreath with a crown of fruits and flowers, and we are in the fairy world. This economy keeps the production moving along gracefully. But while the production emphasises how the worlds of the play co-exist, it also, paradoxically, extracts plenty of comedy from the fact that they are oblivious to one another. Theseus and Hyppolita glide around in beatific beauty, impervious to the muddle around them; the fairies scurry about constantly, hiding behind the screens to titter at the mortals, and the mechanicals keep creeping through scenes, cowed and whispering, intent on their duty. This is most effective, however, with the lovers, who are wonderfully, idiotically wrapped up in their own little world. They are wittily coupled: Lysander (Giorgi Pipinashvili) has a slightly rakish air that complements Nineli Chankvetadze's sweet, girlish Hermia (who takes a favourite cushion and a giant alarm clock with her to elope), while Gia Abesalashvili's precious, petulant Demetrius is a nice match for Rusudan Bolkvadze's sad, old-fashioned Helena. This foursome are delightfully young, foolish and full of comedy - at one point Helena, in her pursuit of Demetrius, rings him up on a silver phone, trying to cry without smudging her mascara as he rebuffs her again. The production is full of nice comic touches, repeated here and there to pull the production together and lend it a feeling of harmony. The fairies, having got their queen off to sleep, drop the fairy-like behaviour and whip out a pack of cards; later, after a splendid rendition of Pyramus and Thisby, the workmen sink on to their stage for a well-earned snout. The staging lacks somewhat in sexual charge and is not as dark or mysterious as some. But it is a charming, humane production, that brings the Everybody's Shakespeare Festival to an upbeat close. Finishes today at The Pit.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Pensions should be insured Sir, You report that the Maxwell companies and pension funds have filed a claim for Pounds 50m under insurance policies intended to protect them against fraud (UK Company News, March 19). The losses are said to be Pounds 900m. To reassure the trustees that the assets of their pension funds are in safe hands some fund managers have recently written to their clients to tell them that their investments are covered by fidelity and professional indemnity insurance. On enquiry I have found that the level of cover provided is often totally inadequate to give any comfort to trustees that their assets are properly safeguarded from the ravages of a rogue predator. In one case investigated by my firm the fund managers had a worldwide policy giving cover for Pounds 50m. The assets under management totalled Pounds 27bn. The trustees of pension funds should make it their duty to obtain a copy of the professional indemnity and fidelity policies held by the fund managers who act for them and evaluate their worth. Trustees need to assess whether such policies, taking into account the level of cover and the exclusion clauses, provide them with the pro-tection to which they are entitled. Is there any reason why the Securities and Investments Board should not require that all fund managers should have insurance cover to at least the total level of funds they have under management? If the internal control procedures in fund management institutions are sound the cost of insurance will not be excessive. If the internal control procedures are not adequate to safeguard pensioners' assets the sooner such institutions are closed down the better. Trustees must rid themselves of the notion that they have to live with unsound custodial practices in order to make life administratively convenient for fund managers. The primary concern of trustees must be to ensure that pensioners are never again deprived of their hard-earned income at the most vulnerable time in their lives.

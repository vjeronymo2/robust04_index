			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mohseen Jeenah] </F>   [Text] Natal is to be targeted by the Azanian People's  Liberation Army [Apla] this year, an Apla unit commander  threatened in an exclusive interview. The commander, who asked  to be labelled by his combat name of "Sizwe", said small attacks  had already been carried out in the province and that more would  follow, urging people to leave "Occupied Azania."    "In line with Apla's declaration that 1993 was the year of  the great storm, Apla units in Natal will pounce on the enemy.  The year will end with a thunder in Natal. This holiday will  be a bloody one. All the tourists in occupied Azania must leave  if they want to live."    Sizwe also threatened that the ANC's [African National  Congress] armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation,  MK], could soon become a target of Apla. "If MK joins the  peacekeeping force, then they will become legitimate targets."</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORDSTROM 'GUILTY' OF REWARDING INITIATIVE, BUT OTHERS ALSO REQUIRE WORK 'OFF  THE CLOCK'  </P> <P> Working "off-the-clock" is not unique to Nordstrom. I was often required to  complete a task but told to punch out first while working at May Co.  </P> <P> I was even encouraged to come in on my day off to finish assignments or  projects gratis. That was nearly 12 years ago. I see little has changed in the  industry.  </P> <P> STEVEN POPE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

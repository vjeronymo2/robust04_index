			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Books: The brain-cell connection - AC Grayling joins the consciousness debate SHADOWS OF THE MIND by Roger Penrose Oxford University Press Pounds 19.99, 457 pages One of the greatest mysteries facing science and philosophy is the phenomenon of consciousness. How do three-dimensional technicolour pictures arise inside our skulls? How do we explain the perception of scents and sounds? How does the excitation of neurons result in belief, memory, reason? Three centuries ago Rene Descartes declared that the problem was best solved by being ignored, and there are some philosophers today who agree with him. They argue that the supreme difficulty of the problem is a result of the fact that the human mind just is not built to understand its own basis - rather like the impossibility of an eyeball seeing itself. Fortunately the pessimists are in the minority, and an exciting worldwide programme of debate and research continues. Roger Penrose, who is a professor of mathematics at Oxford, is one of the leading contributors to that debate. In his previous and much applauded book The Emperor's New Mind he attacked currently fashionable attempts to explain consciousness by thinking of the brain as a computer, and argued instead that something quite new is needed in science to give us the materials for an explanation. In this book he tells us what that new something might be. To attack the 'computational model' of mind is a significant matter, because upon it turn two important related hopes. One is that we will one day build computers powerful enough to be genuinely intelligent, and the other is that the way to understand consciousness is to disentangle the enormous complexity of the brain's billions of internal connections - a task of great practical difficulty, but not in principle impossible. Penrose argues that the computational model cannot explain consciousness, and especially the all-important conscious phenomenon of 'understanding.' The reason lies in the notion of 'computation' itself. As the term suggests, computation is what computers do. It consists in the ordered running of specified procedures, even in the case of 'bottom-up' systems which can teach themselves and thus modify and evolve as they go along. In Penrose's view, even the most sophisticated computational models cannot simulate consciousness for the good reason that the latter has something fundamentally non-computational about it. In the first part of his book he explains what this means. In the second he tries to identify non-computational features of the human brain's activity. It is crucial for Penrose that 'non-computational' should not be taken to denote something mystical or non-scientific. He believes that consciousness can be understood by science - but that it will have to be an extended science: one which includes new ways of thinking about the 'intermediate level' between the microscopic world described by quantum physics, and the everyday world of ordinary objects described by classical physics. This is the topic of the book's second part, where Penrose explores new ways of thinking about the connections between brain-cells - the synapses - the proposal being that they behave in non-computational ways describable only by laws intermediate between the quantum and classical levels. There is a great deal of challenging mathematics and science in this book. Penrose's argument against the computational model of mind turns on a particular application of the famous theorem discovered in 1930 by the Czech mathematician Kurt Godel, which proves that no set of rules for proving propositions in some formal system can ever be sufficient to establish all the true propositions of that system. Penrose takes Godel to have shown that no set of proof-rules can ever prove all those propositions of, say, arithmetic which humans can know to be true. From this it follows that 'there must be more to human thinking than can ever be achieved by a computer.' There is such a wealth of scientific, mathematical and philosophical ideas in Penrose's book - all presented with extraordinary clarity, in a mixture of straight discussion, fables, dialogues and diagrams - that debate about the merits of its arguments promises to be extensive. But Penrose is offering a genuine attempt to advance understanding of the complex questions which surround consciousness, and even if his colleagues remain unpersuaded by the more speculative arguments in physics and physiology in the book's second part, there is much in the first part which those who favour the computational approach are going to have to think about very hard indeed. Whether or not one is persuaded by Penrose's arguments, reading them gives one a highly absorbing education in much contemporary science and philosophy at their sharpest cutting edges.</p>

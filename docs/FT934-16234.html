			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Clinton may send 2,000 more troops to Somalia PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is considering sending up to 2,000 more US troops to Somalia and may set a date for the withdrawal of all US forces from the country. The possible developments, including sending as many as another 50 armoured vehicles, were revealed by administration officials last night. They suggest Mr Clinton has decided to escalate attacks on the forces of General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali faction leader, prior to a withdrawal. No details were immediately forthcoming, but earlier, in brief but carefully worded remarks, the president had insisted it was essential the US conclude its military mission in Somalia but that it do so 'honourably' and without leaving behind 'a reversion to the absolute chaos and terrible misery that existed before'. In the US view, Gen Aideed is culpable on two main counts - for the killing of 12 US servicemen last weekend and the desecration of their bodies, graphically captured on TV pictures, and for the threat he poses to the US and UN humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Mr Clinton said he would confer today with leaders of both parties in Congress. An address to the nation at a later date was also planned, he said. The president has been forced to set aside for the moment his domestic policy agenda in the face of political and public pressure for clear-cut action in Somalia. Earlier, a possible confrontation with Congress was averted when the Senate agreed to postpone by at least a week a vote that could have led to a cut-off in funds for the operation. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, made it clear the delay was designed to give the president more time to formulate policy and to allow congressional emotions, inflamed by the grisly TV pictures of dead US servicemen in Mogadishu, to cool down. In fact, the congressional debate, while frequently critical of the administration, has also cut across party lines. Yesterday a letter signed by 65 Republican congressmen demanded an early withdrawal, but Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, argued that 'this is not a time for panic'. Democrats were similarly divided. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, while criticising the administration's fixation with getting rid of Gen Aideed, argued that the wrong global signals would be sent by a premature US retreat. Michael Littlejohns adds from New York: Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, will travel to Mogadishu next week to review military operations. In advance of his trip, Mr Kofi Annan, head of UN peacekeeping operations worldwide, is to visit the country to demonstrate 'solidarity with the troops on the ground' and confer with force commanders.</p>

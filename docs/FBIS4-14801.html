			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F> Butrus-Ghali by unidentified RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent,  commissioned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA; date, place not given:  "Butrus Butrus-Ghali: I Am Inspired by the Active Efforts of  Russian Diplomacy"]    [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on  an official visit in Moscow yesterday. He plans to meet with  President Boris Yeltsin, the leadership of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly State Duma and Federation Council,  the foreign and defense ministers, and also with Aleksiy II,  patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.    Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointed out that he visited Moscow many  times while he was Egyptian foreign minister. This is the  second time that he has been to the Russian capital in his  capacity as UN secretary general. He said that one of the main  aims of his visit to the Russian Federation is to "strengthen  direct ties with the country's leadership" and also to help  "boost Russia's contribution to UN activity."    Before his arrival he gave an exclusive interview for  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Do you support the idea that Russia's  efforts to avert and resolve conflict situations on the  territory of the former USSR should receive international  status? To what extent and in what way is the United Nations  Organization prepared to take part in peacekeeping efforts in  places like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Tajikistan, and the  Dniester Region?    [Butrus-Ghali] As for the conflicts that have been unleashed  in certain independent states on the territory of the former  Soviet Union, the United Nations and the CSCE have agreed on a  division of labor with a view to preventing duplication of  effort. In accordance with this formula the CSCE has assumed a  peacekeeping role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in Moldova,  and in Georgia -- South Ossetia. While the United Nations, on  the other hand, has taken the lead with regard to the conflicts  in Tajikistan and between Georgia and Abkhazia. You may be  aware that the United Nations opened a small mission in  Tajikistan in late 1992. My new special envoy to Tajikistan,  Ambassador Piriz-Ballon [name as transliterated], recently got  the parties to the conflict to agree to meet in Moscow.    A UN observers' mission in Georgia was opened by the  Security  Council last August. This is the first operation of its kind on  the territory of one of the former Soviet republics. My special  envoy in Georgia, Ambassador Brunner [name as transliterated],  has held several rounds of political talks with representatives  of the Georgian Government and the Abkhazians. The Russian  Federation is acting as mediator in the Georgian-Abkhazian peace  process and my special envoy has received vigorous support from  [Russian] Deputy Foreign Minister Pastukhov, President Yeltsin's  special envoy in Georgia. We are continuing our efforts to seek  an all-embracing solution to this conflict.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Whenever questions of the former USSR's  Baltic republics are examined, the United Nations only places  emphasis on the Russian troop withdrawal, while Russia  underlines its concern over the violation of ethnic minorities'  political and civil rights in the Baltics. Do you think that  this problem exists and merits the attention of the United  Nations?    [Butrus-Ghali] The General Assembly has extended my  mediator's mandate with regard to the troop withdrawal from the  Baltic republics. Last year my special envoy, Ambassador Tommy  Cox, visited Moscow and the three Baltic countries and I  reported back to the General Assembly on his information and  findings. I am inspired by the recent Latvian-Russian agreement  and I hope that the talks between Estonia and Russia, which are  expected to resume early in April, will also be completed  shortly.    I know that 25 million Russians have ended up outside Russia  as a result of the breakup of the former Soviet Union. What is  more, I know about the difficulties which Russians living  outside their homeland, including in Estonia and Latvia, are  experiencing.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The moves to form a Muslim-Croat  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to some extent contravene the  peace plan that was agreed with the participation of the UN  special envoy, a plan which presupposed creating a confederation  of three ethnic states in Bosnia, precisely indicating their  territories and borders. Does the United Nations intend to  formulate a new initiative for an all-embracing settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the former Yugoslavia as a whole? How  do you see Russia's role in resolving the Yugoslav conflict?    [Butrus-Ghali] I welcome the recent agreement between the  Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Croats regarding the formation  of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The cochairmen of the  Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former  Yugoslavia also welcomed this accord. At the same time I very  much hope that representatives of the Bosnian Serbs will take  part in the talks to find a settlement to the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near future. The Conference on the  Former Yugoslavia will continue its work since it is the  Security Council's approved means of securing an all-embracing  settlement to all the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.    I am inspired by Russian diplomacy's vigorous creative  efforts with regard to the former Yugoslavia. In particular, I  welcome the recent talks between representatives of Serbian  Krajina and the Croatian Government that took place in Russia's  embassy in Zagreb under the auspices of Deputy Foreign Minister  Churkin. I am grateful to Russia for its help for the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in unblocking Tuzla Airport and for  Russia's willingness to send an extra 300 servicemen to the  UNPROFOR.</p>

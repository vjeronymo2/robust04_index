			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Negative equity may not be as severe as recent estimates suggest The problem of negative equity in the housing market - when the outstanding mortgage on a home is larger than the value of the property  - may not be as severe as recent estimates of its total value suggest, according to the Bank of England's report yesterday, Motoko Rich writes. In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said the total estimated value of negative equity - Pounds 5.6bn - obscured the fact that a high proportion of affected households had very small gaps between mortgage and property values. The Bank said that of an estimated 1.1m households with negative equity, more than one-third had shortfalls of less than Pounds 2,000, while more than half had gaps of less than Pounds 5,000. Only 3 per cent had shortfalls exceeding Pounds 15,000. A 5 per cent increase in UK average house prices across all regions would cut the total value of negative equity by about two-fifths, while a 10 per cent increase in house prices would reduce it by more than two-thirds, the Bank said. The south-east, Greater London, the south-west and East Anglia accounted for 95 per cent of the total value.</p>

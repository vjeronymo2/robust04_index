			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K Swart] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- The accord on Afrikaner  self- determination signed in Pretoria on Saturday [23 April]  makes provision for a 20-member volskstaat [homeland] council to  constitutionally pursue the establishment of a white homeland.  The accord was signed at the Union Buildings by Freedom Front  leader Gen Constand Viljoen, African National Congress National  Chairman Thabo Mbeki and government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer.    Under the accord, constitutional provision is made for any  community sharing a common cultural and language heritage,  "whether in a territorial entity or in any other recognised  way". The final constitution may now give expression to any  form of self- determination provided there is substantial proven  support within the community for self-determination.    The accord constitutionally establishes a volkstaat council,  which will gather and make available information regarding  possible boundaries of the volkstaat, its powers and functions,  and the constitutional relationship with government at national  and regional level. The volkstaat council will be elected by  members of parliament who support the establishment of a  volkstaat.    The Freedom Front will invite the public to nominate  candidates to the council. A short list of possible appointees  will be drawn up by a panel. After formal hearings and  interviews, 20 "experts in their fields" will be appointed as  councillors.    The accord states the procedures in the constitution  regarding the finalisation of present provincial boundaries  should not be construed as precluding the establishment of the  volkstaat.    A national advisory body attached to the volkstaat council  could be established, consisting of 25 representatives elected  by local communities supporting the ideal. If a volkstaat is  realised, this body will represent the communities in a  volksraad [national council] of the volkstaat.    Citizenship for people residing in a volkstaat will not be  racially-based and shall be compatible with  internationally-accepted norms.    The accord also provides for further negotiations on  Afrikaner self-determination after the election. The  possibility of local, regional and other forms of  self-determination will be considered.    Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat  will be indicated by the support gained in the election of  parties with a mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat.  Electoral support should not only be measured nationally, but  also by counting votes at provincial level.</p>

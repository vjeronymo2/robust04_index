			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Helene Despic-Popovic] </F>   [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs attacked a  British UN patrol in northern Bosnia, UN officials said Monday  [13 June], in the latest violation of a three-day-old ceasefire  aimed at breaking the cycle of violence in Bosnia. But while  also reporting other clashes, a UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  spokesman insisted that the ceasefire had generally held since  coming into force Friday [10 June]. The truce signed in Geneva  last week was intended to make time for talks on an overall  settlement.    "Conflict continued to decrease substantially over the past  two days indicating continuing compliance with at least the  spirit of cessation-of-hostilities agreement," UNPROFOR  spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The British UNPROFOR patrol,  comprising two Warrior armoured troop carriers, fired back after  being targetted by 15-20 mortar shells and several bursts of  machine gun fire Sunday evening, Chaperon said.    "The Warriors were clearly showing the UN flag, therefore it  was a deliberate attack against UNPROFOR," said a UN Protection  Force report issued in Kiseljak, northern Bosnia. The incident  happened on a Moslem-Serb frontline north of Maglaj, near the  village of Halilovici, it said.    Chaperon said 30 machine gun bullets hit the armoured  vehicle, but there were no casualties. The British UN forces  responded by firing 80 7.62 mm shots before withdrawing a short  distance. The patrol was targetted again about two hours later  by about 20 mortar shells, Chaperon continued. Ten of them  landed some 10 metres (yards) of the Warriors. Following the  second attack the patrol withdrew to Halilovici, Chaperon said,  adding that on both occasions the shots were fired from Serb  positions. He added that UNPROFOR commanders on the ground did  not request air support from North Atlantic Treaty Organization  planes. The British patrol was in a new zone, which could have  surprised the Serbs, he added. [passage omitted]    In a separate development, a Jordanian UN soldier was  injured  Sunday in a mine explosion in southern Croatia, a UNPROFOR  spokesman said in the Croatia capital Zagreb. The officer lost  a foot in the incident, which happened on a road on the front  line between Croatian and Krajina Serb forces, the spokesman  said, quoted by the HINA news agency. It said the road in  question had been cleared and demined by the Jordanian UN  battalion in the region during the day.</p>

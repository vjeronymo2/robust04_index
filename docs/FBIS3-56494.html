			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our listeners are greatly interested in the results  of the 16 January presidential election in the Crimea.  According to reports from our Simferopol correspondent, out of  the six candidates running, no one received the required number  of votes for an outright victory. Viktor (Alsufiev), chairman  of the Central Electoral Commission, said that the commission  will have to discuss a runoff between the two candidates  receiving the most votes in yesterday's election. Yuriy  Meshkov, leader of the Republican Party of the Crimea, came in  first in both Simferopol and Sevastopol, as well as in many  rural areas. Yuriy Meshkov received 540,000 votes altogether.  The second-place candidate for the presidential office is  Mykola Bahrov -- chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet -- who  received 245,000 votes. Third place is occupied by Serhey  Shuvaynikov, of the Russian Party of the Crimea, who won 186,000  votes. Leonid Hrach, leader of Crimean communists, received  some 180,000 votes.</p>

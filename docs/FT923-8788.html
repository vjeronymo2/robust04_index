			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Banks divided on Prima plans CREDITOR banks were yesterday divided in their response to debt repayment proposals made this week by Prima Inmobiliaria, one of the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled Spanish holdings, Reuter reports from Madrid. Two of the company's largest creditors, Banco Central Hispano and the state-owned Argentaria group, have declined to give written acceptance of the proposals and will hold further negotiations next week. Other creditors, among the 60 banks attending a meeting called by Prima, have accepted the deal which involves delaying principal payments for two months until a more comprehensive debt restructuring plan can be worked out. The KIO has undertaken to provide Pta3.5bn (Dollars 37.2m) to service interest during the period on the loans, the bulk of which are covered by mortgage guarantees.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Reuters Reuters is currently standing at the confluence of several investment streams and is in danger of being swept away in the flood. The shares are washing up against the Pounds 20 mark, which must make a share split a real possibility. The purchase of Quotron has provided the immediate cause for the rise. But the buoyancy of the world's financial markets and the re-rating of media sectors on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks to multi-media induced intoxication, provide the underlying rationale. The cancellation rate for Reuters' trading screens has reduced as a result of currency turmoil and surging markets. The growth of emerging economies has also fuelled demand for new screens, helping to swell Reuters' terminal base, which had stalled at around 200,000. Reuters is also seeking to expand into new markets, through the provision of on-line information services to the advertising and medical markets, although few of these projects are likely to yield substantial returns in the immediate future. The step-up in the rate of acquisitions and the working capital demands of installing new screens make it unlikely that Reuters will repeat its share repurchase scheme. The tax credits which facilitated that scheme have also been exhausted. Reuters' attractions therefore rely wholly on its earnings prospects, which investors have dangerously over-egged before. Still, Reuters' rating remains well below its 1987 peak.</p>

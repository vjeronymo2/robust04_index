The bureau's activities will also embrace Lithuania and  Estonia, Halasek said. The main office will be situated in Riga  because of the city's advantageous geographical position and the  successful operation of the Latvian National Drugs Control  Commission.    The bureau will coordinate the efforts of police, customs  and  frontier guards to curb the spread of narcotic drugs.    Latvia reported 219 criminal cases connected with drugs'  abuse in 1993, said Vilnis Kipens, a spokesman for the Riga  Criminal Police Department. In 1993, 47 people died from  overuse of drugs, the figure increased by 27 death cases  compared with 1992.    Drugs are trafficked to Latvia mainly from Lithuania and the  Kaliningrad district of Russia, Kipens said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, has met with the brother Interior Ministry leaders and  officials in charge of security organizations in the Republic.  They discussed a number of security issues and the role of the  security agencies in bolstering security and providing peace of  mind in society, especially in the current delicate  circumstances experienced by our country as a result of the war  fueled by the rebellious secessionist gang in the leadership of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP].    Speaking at the meeting, the brother chairman of the  Presidential Council praised the security men's recent efforts  to maintain security and citizens' lives and property. In his  speech, the brother chairman reviewed the crimes of the  rebellious secessionist elements in the YSP against the homeland  and the people since the crisis began on 19 August 1993. He  said those elements have dealt with the children of the homeland  mercilessly and irresponsibly. He noted that the latest of  these practices was last night's heinous crime in which the  cowardly criminals indiscriminately fired a missile against  innocent, secure citizens, striking one of Sanaa's densely  populated districts, resulting in 53 [number as received]  casualties. He said: This cowardly, treacherous act will not go  unpunished. In war, it would be acceptable to hit military or  strategic targets. But when peaceful citizens' homes and  civilian targets are hit, verily this is a disgraceful,  treacherous act and an odious crime that is contrary to all  morals, norms, values, and laws. This crime is evidence of the  state of complete bankruptcy and despair that has gripped that  criminal secessionist clique in the YSP command. This clique  has acted mercilessly towards its own members. How can it have  mercy on the homeland and the people?    The brother chairman: I would have preferred that the  elements of the al-Bid-led secessionist gang turn themselves in  for trial. We will give them a fair trial. Let them choose  whoever lawyers they want in order to preserve the lives of the  remaining Armed Forces personnel under their control, as well as  the innocent citizens. This is the required nationalist stand.  We are not against the YSP. We are against the apostate  secessionist elements in the YSP command.    The brother chairman added: I call on all officers,  noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the Armed and Security  Forces who are under the control of the secessionist clique to  reject orders in their camps and to pledge loyalty to unity and  constitutional legitimacy. I am ready to issue instructions to  the Defense Ministry to stop the process of confronting them to  give those elements the chance to leave the Port of Aden for  Djibouti or anywhere else.    This is better and more honorable than continuing a losing  war and shedding more innocent blood. Those who are doing this  now will pay a high price and will lose the people. The  unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party should clearly define  their position on that criminal gang, rally around unity and  Constitutional legitimacy, and reject the decisions of the  secessionist gang that decided to launch the war, in order to  curb chaos and the shedding of more Yemeni blood, to maintain  public security, and to let their behavior set an example. I  urge tribal chiefs, social figures, and all citizens to deal  with local and internal organizations to maintain security in  society.    It is time to end the problems of four years of security  chaos and financial and administrative corruption and to start  building a modern Yemeni state, a state of law and order, and to  impose the state's prestige. It is not a Sanaa, Hadhramaut,  Aden, or Abyan republic, but a Yemeni Republic, which we all  accept. We take pride in its development within the framework  of constant principles, namely, unity and the republican system  based on our tolerant Islamic doctrine.    Salih urged the employees of the Interior Ministry and all  security organizations to make every effort to maintain public  security and punish those who cause chaos or harm. All these  elements should be deterred, at a time when we highly appreciate  the security mens' activity over the past days.    At the beginning of the meeting, Interior Minister Brigadier  General Yahya al-Mutawakkil welcomed the brother president and  said: We pledge to you that we will stand by you and by  legitimacy against all those who have departed from legitimacy  and against all acts violating security. Since the very  beginning, we, in the Interior Ministry, have been in a state of  alert to confront those who tamper with security and exploit the  circumstances. The security men are standing in one rank along  with their brothers in the Armed Forces, and feel that the  security battle completes the true battle. We are responsible  before you for citizens' security and safety. We promise you  that we will continue to epitomize the spirit of unity and  national responsibility represented by legitimacy. We beseech  God to grant us success in our work and to allow our people to  achieve victory and to continue construction and development.    The meeting was attended by Colonel (?Muhsin al-Muski), head  of the general authority of meteorology and civil aviation.</p>

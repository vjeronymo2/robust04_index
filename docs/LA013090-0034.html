			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> REPUBLICAN 'EAGLES' MARK ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> Show business stars joined President Bush and 800 Republican Party donors at a  Kennedy Center gala in Washington to celebrate the first anniversary of the  Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched from the presidential box. Vice President  Dan Quayle, fresh from his fence-mending trip to Latin America, joined them  with his wife, Marilyn. The price of a ticket was $1,000 on top of the  $10,000-a-year dues that the donors pay for the privilege of being designated a  Republican Eagle -- a club created 15 years ago as one of the GOP's most  successful fund-raising devices.  </P></p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Heseltine in talks with TV chiefs MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has called together Britain's leading broadcasters to try to draw up a co-ordinated industrial and export strategy for the industry. Those invited include Mr John Birt, the director-general of the BBC, Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend Television, Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications and Independent Television News, and Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television. The meeting to be held on November 3 will be divided into three parts looking at programme production, distribution, and technology and research. It symbolises a sea change in the government's attitude to UK broadcasting. It contrasts with a notorious meeting in 1987 when Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister, denounced ITV as 'the last bastion of restrictive practices'. In contrast the emphasis of next week's meeting will be to encourage the export potential of a UK industry seen as high quality and internally competitive. Mr Heseltine's search for an industrial and export strategy could have policy implications for ITV and the BBC. The big ITV companies arguing for changes in ownership rules to allow the largest nine ITV companies to take each other over see Mr Heseltine as a likely ally. They say ITV is too fragmented to compete internationally. Meanwhile, the National Heritage Department has proposed the BBC licence fee should be linked to retail prices for three years.</p>

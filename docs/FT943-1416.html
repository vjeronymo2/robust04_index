			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Half of trains run as strike talks go on Talks aimed at ending the three-month railway signalling dispute will continue today as the RMT transport union and Railtrack, which runs the rail network, negotiate a package of measures to modernise working practices among the signal workers. During yesterday's 24-hour strike by signal workers an estimated 61 per cent of the rail network was open with an estimated 53 per cent of services operating normally. Plans are still in place for a 48-hour stoppage from midnight on Wednesday.</p>

[Begin recording of Herman Von Richthofen, German  representative to NATO, in English with superimposed Polish  translation] The purpose of our mission is, to a certain extent,  to demonstrate that NATO is treating the Partnership for Peace  scheme seriously. We would like to begin political and military  cooperation within this scheme as soon as possible. [end  recording]    Members of the mission declared that, before the end of this  year, joint exercises of Polish and NATO armed forces will be  held. [video cuts to show General Stanislaw Wozniak speaking to  camera] For the time being, we are not considering the number  of divisions assigned to the scheme. We are considering the  possibility of selecting small forces. We are talking here about  a platoon, a company.    An agreement that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will sign  tomorrow concerns political consent for Poland's participation  in the scheme. A detailed document is being prepared, and, in  the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it will be signed  in a few weeks' time. It is still not known how much  participation in the scheme will cost us: This year's budget  does not envision any expenditure for this purpose.    Representatives of the NATO mission discussed Poland's  participation in the scheme with Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski and Jerzy Milewski, head of the National Security  Office. Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the minister of national defense,  and General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General Staff, could  not meet the NATO delegation because they are on vacation with  the president in the Karkonosze Mountains.</p>

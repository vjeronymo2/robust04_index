			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Water group faces funding inquiry The French justice ministry said yesterday it had asked police to conduct two 'preliminary' inquiries into alleged irregularities by Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), the construction, utilities and communications group, in funding political parties. CGE yesterday denied one allegation that it had paid money to a company associated with the Communist party for what CGE knew to be bogus services, but said that it understood that police were inquiring into whether it had exceeded the FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,240) limit on what a company and each of its subsidiaries can give political parties per year. CGE has 2,400 subsidiaries. Meanwhile, France's other big contracting-communications group, Lyonnaise des Eaux, said it had yesterday brought a libel suit against Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former magistrate, who last month was elected to the European parliament. In May Mr Jean-Pierre published a document claiming that '80 per cent of political corruption was organised by two big groups. . . .carrying out services for public authorities'. Lyonnaise des Eaux said the reference was 'sufficiently clear and precise for a large number of newspapers to designate it (the company) without hesitation'. It complained that these 'groundless' allegations had caused 'real prejudice' to the company's interests. The share prices of Lyonnaise des Eaux and CGE fell immediately after Mr Jean-Pierre's allegations. Police interest in CGE's political funding stemmed from a corruption investigation in the French territory of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. A magistrate there, in his investigation of alleged kickbacks in the awarding of building and waste treatment contracts, has formally charged the former Socialist mayor of St Denis, the island's capital, as well as current or former local managers of CGE and Lyonnaise subsidiaries. Pursuing his inquiries at CGE's offices in Paris in March, the Reunion magistrate came across some company papers, unrelated to the St Denis affair but which he considered suspicious enough to pass on to Paris prosecutors. These papers form the starting point of the police inquiry that the justice ministry confirmed yesterday. This week's edition of the Canard Enchaine satirical paper claimed that Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, was deliberately restraining the inquiry by refusing to call in an investigating magistrate at this stage. But a ministry spokesman said yesterday it was first important for police to check whether there was 'any reality to the suspected infractions'. CGE, which under French law would only have a right to see the results of any police or magistrate's investigation if formal charges were brought, said it believed the allegation of irregular funding of political parties related to 1992, the last year for which parties had filed full accounts. But in the 1993 parliamentary elections it said it had only given FFr11m out of the national FFr1.4bn total that went to candidates. 'This 0.8 per cent of the total is derisory,' said a spokesman.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle will not pay over ADollars 4.10 per share for Bundaberg TATE &amp; LYLE will not pay more than ADollars 4.10 per share for Bundaberg Sugar, the Queensland sugar miller and refiner, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the world's largest sweeteners group said yesterday. The ADollars 321m (Pounds 146.18m) offer will be extended shortly to allow the Australian Foreign Investment Board time to decide on whether to let the deal proceed, Mr Shaw said. Tate and Lyle needs 90 per cent of shareholder acceptance and is facing stiff opposition from Bundaberg. If the deal goes through it is likely to have a mildly dilutive effect on Tate &amp; Lyle's earnings in 1992, given the low level of world sugar prices. But after a six-month period in which Tate &amp; Lyle has shown its resilience as others have felt the heat of recession, Bundaberg is one of the few areas where the group appears vulnerable in the short term, notwithstanding its longer term benefits. Staley, the US cereals sweetener, mildly disappointed in the six months to March 1991 with flat profits in dollar terms. This softness could persist in the second half, primarily because drink bottlers have reported a slow start and are likely to keep the price pressure on sweetener suppliers. Although Tate &amp; Lyle insists that room remains for profits growth from further squeezing of costs, there are limits to the benefit this year. Brokers therefore forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 230m for the full year, which would give earnings of 33.2p and a prospective multiple of over 11. Longer term, Tate &amp; Lyle can look forward to high margin profits on Sucralose, its high-intensity sweetener which it hopes to begin selling in Canada later this year. In the US, Monsanto's Nutrasweet is almost certain to have to relinquish some of its 95 per cent market share if and when the US Food and Drug Administration approves Sucralose. In 1992, Tate &amp; Lyle will also benefit substantially from a stronger dollar and could enjoy pre-tax profits of Pounds 282m. This would give a prospective multiple of a little over 9, which leaves scope for further growth in the share price, even though it has risen Pounds 1 in the last four months.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: A&amp;P cuts payout and makes Dollars 165m provision Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea, the troubled US supermarket group better known as A&amp;P, has slashed its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 20 cents and announced that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 165m in its third quarter to December because of continuing problems with its Canadian operations. It also warned that these actions would make it necessary to seek a renegotiation of its covenants with bank lenders, but said it believed fresh agreements would be achieved on satisfactory terms. A&amp;P, which is 52 per cent owned by Tengelmann, the German food retailer, made net profits of Dollars 379,000 on sales of Dollars 2.3bn in last year's third quarter. The company said its US operating results had posted a strong improvement, but its Canadian operations were showing substantial losses. As a result, it was taking a third-quarter charge to include the write-off of goodwill, previously recognised tax benefits and certain long-lived assets of its Canadian subsidiary. A&amp;P said it was strengthening its efforts to turn round the Canadian operations which were suffering from low-cost competition. It said it would convert a number of Canadian stores to low-cost formats, resulting in a further pre-tax charge of Dollars 25m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- The Chinese foreign ministry  said Tuesday it was ``not aware'' of any upcoming nuclear test  by China, as announced by the Japanese government. ``China  keeps the attitude of utmost restraint towards nuclear tests.  The number of nuclear tests it has conducted has been quite  limited,'' a ministry spokesman said. ``I am not aware of any  nuclear test in the near future.''    Deputy Japanese Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito on Monday  said China would soon carry out a nuclear test, and called on  Beijing to scrap the operation. A western expert in Beijing  said ``it would not be surprising'' if there were a nuclear test  in the near future, as China carries out such tests in the  spring and the autumn for climatic reasons.    China's last nuclear explosion took place at the underground  Lop Nor site, in the northwest of the country, on 5 October. It  was the 38th test -- other counts put it as the 39th -- carried  out in the autonomous region of Xinjiang since 1964. Foreign  experts said the test, with a yield of 70 to 80 kilotonnes, was  apparently part of a miniaturisation programme aimed at  developing a multiple-warhead missile.    The United States has carried out around 950 nuclear tests,  Russia about 600, France 200 and Britain 60.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colette Braeckman: "Burundi: New Tutsi Prime </F> Minister"]    [Excerpts] Calm has returned to Bujumbura, where they are  awaiting the presentation of the new government formed by Prime  Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, responsible for public works and  infrastructure under President Ndadaye.    Mr. Kanyenkiko, age 40, is a member of the Tutsi people and  of Uprona [Unity for National Progress], the principal  opposition party and formerly the country's only party. In  appointing him as prime minister the new President Cyprien  Ntaryamira has thus respected the agreement reached last week to  free the country from its present deadlock and prevent any  further upsurge of interethnic violence that left 50 dead last  week. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Special Mission...To Liege </H5>   Various sources report of Burundian officers or  intermediaries close to the army being charged with "secret  missions."    Last week an interlocutor introducing himself as former  President Bagaza told us by telephone that 14 officers,  putschists or close to the putschists, were in Europe, four of  them in Belgium. Their mission could be to try to purchase arms.    Information from Germany also indicated the presence in  Europe of putschist soldiers or those close to the faction  members. Interviewed by telephone, Colonel Bikomagu seemed to  confirm the defections of some officers and the fact that  meetings had been held in Brussels and Charleroi.    According to the chief of staff, these officers are in  France  at the moment, after having had to leave Belgium due to the  vigilance of the Burundian Embassy.    Certain sources also report that several Burundians, Messrs.  Jean-Claude Ndiyo, Bondo, Nahimana, and Busuguru, stayed at the  grand hotel in Liege from 24 to 28 January last, charged with  taking delivery of 1,500 machine guns destined for the criminal  investigation department.    A Belgian is apparently in Bujumbura at the moment providing  training in the use of these weapons.    Information from the FN company of Herstal, a possible  supplier of these machine guns, states that the company is not  in the habit of divulging the names of its customers and any  intermediaries.    FN nevertheless states that it is subject to very precise  regulations: Every six months, it contacts the Economic Affairs  Ministry to check that the beneficiary countries are not subject  to an arms embargo.    In the case of Burundi, the FN management checked with the  ministry just recently, and the reply was categoric: No export  licences are at present being granted, with an embargo on all  arms, and no contracts concluded under President Ndadaye may be  respected.    The present Burundian Government has also decided to block  any delivery of arms to the Burundian Army and a cargo is  immobilized at the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, despite the  efforts made by soldiers to take delivery of it.</p>

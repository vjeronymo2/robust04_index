			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGGING A DITCH AT THE BORDER  </P> <P> Building a ditch to exclude "undesirables" is not a new idea. For example, the  Romans often constructed an elaborate ditch and rampant (vallum) even going so  far to ring a whole city (circumvallation) in order to starve its inhabitants.  Hadrian's Wall, crossing Britain for 70 miles to connect the current sites of  Carlisle and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was intended to stop incursions by the Picts  and the Scots. That wall was usually paralleled on its "friendly" side by a  substantial vallum.  </P> <P> Does that strategy work? I recently spent a year in Durham, 20 miles south of  Hadrian's Wall. Never during that time was I molested by a marauding Pict.  </P> <P> NATHANIEL GROSSMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

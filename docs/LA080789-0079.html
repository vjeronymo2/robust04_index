			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALMAN RUSHDIE'S LIFE ON THE RUN  </P> <P> While their captors play with the lives of the hostages in Lebanon, another  hostage to Islamic fundamentalism remains on the run, living underground in a  prison without walls, serving a sentence with no end.  </P> <P> Author Salman Rushdie has not been seen publicly since British police bundled  him and his wife into a car and sped off from their north London home on Feb.  14, following a death threat from Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Since  then, friends say, they have been moved at least 56 times and are never alone,  always in the presence of at least one armed bodyguard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat Still in Force  </P> <P> For nearly six months, Rushdie and his wife, American-born novelist Marianne  Wiggins, have lived in limbo, the reluctant guests of Britain's Special Branch  security police, waiting for a reprieve that never came. Although Khomeini has  since died, the death sentence he imposed on Rushdie for writing "The Satanic  Verses," a novel that the ayatollah and many other Muslims condemned as  blasphemous, remains in full force.  </P> <P> A wall of secrecy surrounds the whereabouts and lives of Rushdie and Wiggins.  He has issued only a few brief statements -- one of which, expressing "profound  regret" that the book had distressed Muslims, was immediately rejected by  Tehran. Rushdie has granted no interviews.  </P> <P> But small glimpses of their existence have begun appearing in the British press  in recent weeks, provided by friends who have had fleeting contact with the two  fugitives. And last week, Wiggins broke her silence to give a brief interview  to Lucy Hughes-Hallett of the Sunday Telegraph and mark the publication in  Britain of a new edition of "Herself in Love," a collection of Wiggins' short  stories.  </P> <P> "It's a terribly frustrating, terribly lonely existence for them both," said  Lisa Appignanesi, a friend of Rushdie who has spoken to him on the phone in  recent months and has co-edited a new book summarizing the events and furor  surrounding his novel. "After a while you become a symbol of the issue at stake  and people begin to forget that you're also a human being living an incredibly  difficult life."  </P> <P> At first, the couple was allowed to live the semblance of a normal life.  Accompanied by detectives, Wiggins returned to their home in the neighborhood  of Islington to pick up clothes and books. There were also occasional dinners  and social meetings at the homes of friends. At one, which reputedly took place  at the London home of Michael Foot, a Labor Party member of Parliament, Rushdie  dined with party leader Neil Kinnock.  </P> <P> But those occasions ended in late March at the insistence of Rushdie's  bodyguards, according to David Lister, arts writer for the Independent  newspaper. Now there are no dinners, no trips to the supermarket or the movies,  nothing that might endanger their lives or divulge where they are living.  </P> <P> Since then, the couple's isolation has been all but complete. They receive mail  and phone messages only through Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken. He does not  know where the couple is, but passes on material through the police.  </P> <P> Aitken's standard response to reporters is this: "We really have no comment.  The policy is simply not to speak and not to explain. I'm not allowed to say  anything more."  </P> <P> Wiggins had little more to say in her interview with the Sunday Telegraph. She  said there were times when she and Rushdie do not have access to television,  newspapers or the phone. In March, when an all-star lineup of American authors  staged an all-night reading of "The Satanic Verses" to express their support,  it was more than two weeks before the couple learned of the event.  </P> <P> What they do have are books. Wiggins said she and Rushdie have been reading  works from the 18th-Century Enlightenment by Rousseau, Thomas Paine, Diderot  and Voltaire. Rushdie reportedly has been working on a children's book -- the  one thing that might escape the controversy that has plagued "The Satanic  Verses."  </P> <P> The flight into exile has been particularly hard on Wiggins, an author with a  growing reputation here. As Lister points out, she spent the evening before the  death threat at a lavish reception marking the publication of her new novel,  "John Dollar." She even insisted on attending a book signing at a London  bookstore soon afterward but was forced to cancel an American publicity tour.  </P> <P> She told the Sunday Telegraph that she had no doubts about what she had to do.  "If I weren't married to him, if I didn't know him, I would be signing  petitions, I would be reading in public from his text, I would be picketing  bookstores," Wiggins said. "But I am married to him, and what I needed to do  was to be with him to make his life go forward, and that meant I had to go into  invisibility, too."  </P> <P> Wiggins was reluctant to comment on the Rushdie affair itself. "Salman has,  from the beginning, refused to enter into a debate because there's no debate to  be had," she said. "A death threat is an ultimatum, not an argument. What is he  supposed to do? To beg for his life? You can't begin a discussion from such a  debased level.  </P> <P> "We were as appalled and stunned and confused and gobsmacked (punched on the  mouth) as anyone else. My visceral reaction to tyranny is the same as any  rational thinker's. I abhor it. But I didn't have any kind of inside track for  understanding it. I was just making decisions from day to day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support From Muslims  </P> <P> Rushdie himself has had little to say since Khomeini scornfully dismissed his  "apology" nearly six months ago. He issued a brief statement through a press  conference held two weeks ago here by an international committee set up for his  defense. He said he had received many letters of support from Muslims that  showed the apparent gap between himself and the Muslim world was not  unbridgeable and that some Muslims recognized the book was written within the  Islamic tradition. As a result, Rushdie said, he was encouraged to hope for  "mutual understanding and reconciliation" with his fellow Muslims.  </P> <P> Although Rushdie has all but disappeared, the controversy over the novel has  not. Labor Party leader Kinnock's statement of support for Rushdie's right to  publish brought a critical response from some other party leaders concerned  that they might lose votes among their Muslim constituents.  </P> <P> Similarly, a BBC-TV broadcast earlier this week of a program entitled  "Blasphemers' Banquet," a spirited defense of Rushdie by playwright Tony  Harrison, brought condemnation from some Muslim leaders.  </P> <P> The broadcast was also criticized by the office of Robert Runcie, the  archbishop of Canterbury, whose spokesman said he feared the program would  damage "community relations" between Muslims and other Britons. "There are  times when restraint should be exercised," said John Lyttle, Runcie's  assistant.  </P></p>

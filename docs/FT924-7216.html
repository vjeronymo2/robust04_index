			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Petrobras president quits as fuel price row surfaces MR Benedito Moreira, president of Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil giant, resigned yesterday along with his finance director after a dispute with Mr Itamar Franco, Brazil's new president, over fuel prices. The move came after a meeting in which Mr Franco again delayed approving increases in fuel prices to keep up with inflation, now running at more than 26 per cent a month. Mr Moreira said last week that the company was losing Dollars 10m per day because of the failure to make the usual monthly adjustment for inflation. Mr Moreira is not the first president of Petrobras to complain about the government using fuel prices as a tool to repress inflation. Last year the company - one of the largest in Latin America - made its first loss. Mr Moreira first offered his resignation six weeks ago after the suspension of President Fernando Collor amid a multi-million dollar corruption scandal. He resubmitted it last week amid the furore over prices. The company's new president is 54-year-old Mr Joel Mendes Renno from Mr Franco's home state and a former president of Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company. He previously worked at Petrobras between 1981-1986 and will be the company's sixth president in just two and a half years.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> SCOUTS: MORE THAN JUST SELLING COOKIES  </P> <P> Back in the fourth grade, almost half the students in my class proudly wore  either navy-blue Cub Scout uniforms or patch-laden Girl Scout sashes.  </P> <P> But some time during junior high, many of these same kids began to think the  uniforms looked too uncool, and scouting became a social liability.  </P> <P> Pressure from friends and busy schedules crowded out scouting for most. Yet  those who stayed involved say the drawbacks are minimal compared to the  rewards.  </P> <P> Richa Varma, 14, a freshman at El Toro High School, quit Girl Scouts after the  sixth grade but decided to rejoin this year.  </P> <P> "I missed it," she said. "There was so much to do, and it was so interesting. I  love camping. You meet new people, and I just enjoyed it a lot.  </P> <P> "When I first joined (again), I didn't tell anybody. But as soon as I started  selling Girl Scout cookies at school, people would say, 'You're still a Girl  Scout?' There are some people out there who are like, 'You're in Girl Scouts!  Get away! Don't be such a baby.' But it's something I like to do, and if they  can't accept that, that's their problem."  </P> <P> Karin Carlson, director of program services for the Girl Scout Council of  Orange County, said: "If they can tough out the peer pressure, there are so  many opportunities that open up to them for leadership, for service, for  travel."  </P> <P> High school students in scouting, called seniors, do more than go camping and  sell cookies. Scouting combines community service with training in such diverse  areas as surfing, cooking and career planning. Similarly to the younger Scouts  who earn badges for activities, senior Scouts participate in special projects  to earn patches that show they have mastered certain skills.  </P> <P> Senior Boy Scouts work toward achieving Eagle status, the highest honor in  scouting, while senior girls aim for the Eagle's equivalent, the Gold Award.  </P> <P> To earn the rank of Eagle, a Boy Scout must plan and organize a 100-hour  service project. David Jedynak, 18, a Mission Viejo High senior, expects to  earn his Eagle honor next month after setting up a project to resurrect a dying  trail in Trabuco Canyon.  </P> <P> Jeeps roamed the Trabuco Canyon Trail 25 years ago, but weather and plants  eroded the path, making it almost too narrow in places to walk. For his  project, Jedynak and his fellow Scouts cleared trees, moved rocks and chopped  down plants to make it a usable foot trail again.  </P> <P> Scouting has also allowed Jedynak to backpack in the sand dunes along the  California-Arizona border, where the third movie of the Star Wars trilogy,  "Return of the Jedi," was filmed.  </P> <P> On one rock-climbing trip that placed the Scouts in a 300-foot vertical cave,  Jedynak had a chance to practice rescue techniques when one of the climbers  fell. With his troop, he has also canoed 14 miles in Mission Bay in San Diego,  helped with a local children's Easter egg hunt and collected food and shoes for  children in Mexico.  </P> <P> Jedynak said that besides the satisfaction he has gained by serving his  community, he has experienced personal rewards.  </P> <P> In 1988, he was named Orange County's outstanding senior patrol leader for his  commitment to planning and organizing his troop's activities. As a result,  Orange County developer William Lyon invited him to lead the flag salute at a  $5,000-a-plate charity dinner at a country club in Coto de Caza.  </P> <P> Jedynak is near the top of scouting, and he has had to face the negative  reactions of others all along the way. Peer pressure was greatest in junior  high school, he said, although he adds it was never particularly troublesome.  </P> <P> "It didn't bother me because I was proud of what I was doing," he said. "I was  a leader, and I did get chosen to go to this fancy lunch at this very, very  fancy country club. . . .  </P> <P> "It hurts a little bit when you see people (putting down scouting). The biggest  way that it hurts is they don't know what they're talking about. They haven't  been in Scouts, and they're missing things. It's like, 'You wouldn't say that  if only you knew what it was like.' "  </P> <P> Maarten VanGestel, a 14-year-old freshman at El Toro High, agreed: "Some people  do have that attitude, but then I tell them what we do, and they don't say  anything anymore. They've never climbed Mt. Whitney, gone rock climbing or  anything."  </P> <P> VanGestel, who has climbed Mt. Whitney, has also camped in the Sierra Nevada,  learned first aid and become a certified lifeguard through scouting. He used  his lifeguarding skills at a wheelchair sports camp at Saddleback College last  spring vacation.  </P> <P> "Scouting has helped me learn leadership, and I've made a lot of friends  through scouting," VanGestel said.  </P> <P> Girl Scouts "is like a whole different set of friendships," said Cheri Keller,  a 16-year-old junior at Mission Viejo High. "We're all really close, and it's  like a second family."  </P> <P> Through scouting, Keller said, she has participated in several service  projects, such as working with the Red Cross to assemble friendship kits --  shampoo, conditioner and hairbrushes -- for the homeless.  </P> <P> "It gives you self-confidence and makes you more aware of what's going on in  the community," she said.  </P> <P> Between community service, interest projects for patches and camping trips,  scouting can sometimes interfere with school activities.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of competition out there from school activities and all," the  Girl Scout Council's Carlson said, "but the girls we get are usually involved  in sports or honor society or something else, and they have learned to juggle  all of that."  </P> <P> This year, a senior scouting event in Newport Harbor that will instruct girls  in maritime skills such as rigging and Morse Code will be held on the weekend  of El Toro's prom.  </P> <P> Often, El Toro High's Varma said, Scouts "have to choose between Girl Scouts  and something else."  </P> <P> Varma, who originally left scouting because she anticipated a busier schedule  in junior high, said: "My parents were happy when I dropped out. They thought I  was taking too much on.  </P> <P> "There are times when I wish I wasn't in (Scouts) so I could do other things,  but I think it's worth it. To be really committed to Girl Scouts is just  something that makes me feel good about myself."  </P> <P> Jason Miller, 16, a sophomore at El Toro High, said scouting has helped build  his self-image.  </P> <P> "I've learned that I can do a lot more than I thought I could do," he said. "I  never thought I could hang on the side of a cliff face while rock climbing, but  I've done that in scouting. And I never thought I'd get used to leading people,  but I've done that in scouting."  </P> <P> Added Jedynak: "I learned things about myself, things about leadership, how to  deal with people, dealing with the public, all these different skills that  there would have been no chance for me to get anywhere else. I couldn't have  gotten it from varsity sports or marching band or anything like that.  </P></p>

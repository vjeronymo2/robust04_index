			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRITAIN;  </P> <P> THATCHER POPULARITY PLUNGES IN 2 POLLS  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's popularity sank to the lowest level  of her 10 years in power in two new polls. Only 24% of 935 voters sampled in a  National Opinion Poll said they were satisfied with her performance, and 61%  blamed her for last Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor of the  Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Thatcher is lukewarm toward fully joining the European  Monetary System, while Lawson supports it. A Harris poll found 50% of the  respondents in favor of the opposition Labor Party and only 37% backing  Thatcher's Conservative Party, with the others favoring minor parties.  </P></p>

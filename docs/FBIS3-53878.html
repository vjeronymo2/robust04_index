Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front  for  the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], believes that the Geneva  summit results will not have a negative effect on the existing  alliance between Syria and the Alliance of Palestinian Forces  [APF] which is opposed to the Israeli Palestinian agreement.    Habash's stand was revealed in an answer to a question by  Salim Badawi related to the possible effect of the Syrian-U.S.  summit on the opposition methods adopted by the PFLP:    [Begin Habash recording] I do not think so. This is because  our struggle in the PFLP, and this also applies to Hamas, is  based on struggle inside the occupied territories. Concerning  this issue, Syria is still strongly supporting the intifadah.  Therefore, I do not believe that we are facing a great  diversion between the APF and Syria. Moreover, we must consider  that despite the Geneva summit, Syria continues to demand the  implementation of all UN resolutions, not only with respect to  the Golan but also with respect to Lebanon, and the occupied  territories, including Jerusalem. This means that this issue  will be a long drawn out one, especially since we must take into  consideration the intransigent Israeli attitude.    What was Israel's attitude throughout the summit and in its  aftermath? Israel's answer was to hold a referendum. I see this  as a kind of escape from the process on the Israeli track.

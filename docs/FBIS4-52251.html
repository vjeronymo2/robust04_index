			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- On April 28, North Korea  offered to meet with the United States to discuss replacing the  Armistice Agreement on the Korean war with a peace treaty.    A Foreign Ministry statement issued that day said the  situation on the Korean peninsula required replacement of the  cease-fire pact with a peace treaty to ensure "genuine peace and  safety."    Pointing to the deployment of Patriot missile batteries in  South Korea and "Team Spirit," the joint South Korea-U.S.  military exercise, it charged that the United States has  "completely renounced the Armistice Agreement it concluded with  us in the name of the United Nations."    It added, "the Armistice Agreement has become an empty sheet  of paper that can no longer guarantee peace on the Korean  peninsula," taking note of the March 1991 appointment of a South  Korean officer as chief U.N. delegate to the Military Armistice  Commission, replacing the U.S. officer who had until then  served as chief U.N. delegate.    It was on March 25, 1974, that Pyongyang first proposed a  North Korea-U.S. meeting on replacement of the truce pact with  a peace treaty.    The offer, then and now, is considered by North Korea  watchers here to be part of a propaganda offensive against the  South.    Naming only the United States as the other party to the  peace  talks is totally wrong, according to many North Korea watchers.  South Korea not only took part in the truce talks through the  commander of the U.N. Forces but also participated in the  Geneva political talks on Korea held under a U.N. General  Assembly resolution adopted on Aug. 28, 1953.    North Korea must therefore name South Korea as a party to  the  talks if it really wants a workable peace treaty.    That is why the proposal has not been accepted by the  international community over the past 20 years since North Korea  first made it in 1974.    In January 1984 North Korea revised the proposal, offering a  tripartite meeting, apparently recognizing what was wrong with  its 1974 proposal.    The North Koreans' true intention behind the peace talks  offer is to increase "the revolutionary forces in South Korea,"  North Korea watchers say.    In the above-mentioned Foreign Ministry statement, North  Korea called for a non-aggression pact, removal of war threats,  a ban on additional deployment of troops and arms, and a U.S.  troop pullout from South Korea, with a view to neutralizing the  South Korea-U.S. defense treaty to break the balance of military  power on the peninsula in the interest of South Korea's  "revolutionary forces."    It should also be noted that North Korea, when making the  first peace offer in 1974, tried to cash in on the withdrawal of  20,000 U.S. troops from South Korea in 1971 under the 1969  Nixon doctrine calling on Asians to guarantee their own  security. This new U.S. Asia policy also resulted in normalized  relations between Washington and Beijing and Tokyo and Beijing.    Until its first peace offer to the United States in 1974,  North Korea had insisted on an inter-Korean peace talks proposal  made in June 1962, while launching campaigns to "increase the  three great revolutionary powers" and to strengthen "the four  great military lines" on the domestic front.    Pyongyang's peace offer to Washington is considered to have  three aims, according to North Korea watchers.    The first is exclusion of the South from the peace talks so  that the North can take the initiative in inter-Korean  relations. This, the North may hope, will promote  anti-government sentiment against Seoul and further Pyongyang's  scheme to increase revolutionary forces in the South.    The second is neutralization of the South Korea-U.S. defense  treaty and the last is diplomatic isolation of the South from  the world community.    A peace treaty with the United States would justify the  legitimacy of North Korea as the only sovereign state on the  Korean peninsula.    Pyongyang's second peace offer appears to be aimed at  securing a third round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, as  it came when the nuclear standoff remains unsettled. North  Korea may want to raise the issue of establishing a peace treaty  in the next meeting with the United States in a bid to divert  the world's attention from the nuclear issue.    And if the third round of talks broke down, the Stalinist  North would blame the United States for heightening tensions on  the Korean peninsula and use this as an excuse to renounce the  Armistice Agreement.    So the new peace offer, along with Pyongyang's withdrawal  from the Military Armistice Commission, is regarded by North  Korea watchers as psychological warfare against South Korea and  the United States.    The peace proposal is just another tactical variation of the  Stalinist country's strategy to unify the divided country under  communism.</p>

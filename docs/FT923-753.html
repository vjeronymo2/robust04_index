			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Flat-rate taxes THE OWNERS of the freehold of my home also own a vast number of other residential properties. To the best of my knowledge these properties are all leased on full repairing leases. As all the tenants pay for maintenance and a lot of these properties were built in the 1830s and require considerable maintenance, should the landlords be entitled to claim tax relief against depreciation or, what seems to be more equitable, should not the tenants be able to make such a claim? Can landlords claim tax relief for insurance of properties in their portfolios - when the tenants pay for insurance, albeit in the name of the landlord? Under section 25 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, a landlord can obtain tax relief for payments in respect of maintenance, insurance etc which he has made personally. He gets no tax relief for depreciation of the property. The tenants cannot obtain tax relief (unless they receive rent from subtenants). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

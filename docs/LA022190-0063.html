			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Great Northern Agrees to Buyout: Great Northern Nekoosa said it agreed to a  $5-billion buyout by Georgia-Pacific, dropping its vehement four-month  opposition to a deal that would create the largest U.S. forest-products  company. Great Northern agreed to the deal after Georgia-Pacific sweetened its  offer to $65.75 a share from $63, a spokesman said. In addition to acquiring  Great Northern's 57-million common shares outstanding for $3.7 billion,  Georgia-Pacific will assume $1.3 billion in Great Northern debt.  </P></p>

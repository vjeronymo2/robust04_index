			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Shared interest Last year will go down in UK stock market history as one in which all but the most optimistic expectations were exceeded. The starting point was not auspicious. Worries about inflation after sterling's humiliating exit from the ERM were compounded by fears that the economic recovery would falter. Above all there was widespread scepticism about the government's ability to finance its surging deficit. Having been so badly wrong-footed - most expectations a year ago, including those of this column, were that the FT-SE 100 would end 1993 closer to 3,000 than to 3,400 - forecasters are naturally reluctant to pour cold water again. Nor are they short of positive arguments. Inflation has fallen to the lowest point in a generation; interest rates are still moving downwards; the recovery is reasonably well established; and two budgets have restored some semblance of order to government finances. Yet the market must overcome a number of obstacles to justify its present level, let alone to achieve further price increases. Will enthusiasm for equities wither in the face of any further US bond market or Federal Reserve tightening as the recovery gathers pace? How will the UK economy react to the tax increases that start to bite in April?</p>

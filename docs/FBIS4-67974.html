			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian police guarantee  that the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group has split. In a  report released today by the Counterterrorism Directorate, the  police speculate on the possibility of a clash between the two  factions into which the group has allegedly split.    The report states that the leaders who support peace --  which  government officials believe is led by Abimael Guzman, the SL  founder and leader -- have been expelled. The other faction  does not regard him as a leader -- although it recognizes him as  "ideologist" -- because he "does not address (the party or the  war) from jail."    Government officials believe the faction that does not  accept  Guzman's leadership believes the alleged peace proposal is not  genuine, they consider it a government "hoax."    The police report points out that the group split after the  establishment -- under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez Durand,  alias "Feliciano" -- of a new central committee in March in the  Huanta Province mountains. This new central committee agreed to  pursue the war that began in 1980.    The police report states that this group described the  members of the central committee allegedly headed by Guzman as  "debased people, traitors, weaklings, and old revisionists."    Government officials state that the rejoinder issued by  Guzman's loyal followers was disclosed in a communique also  dated March. In this communique, Guzman's loyal followers  charge the rebels with feigning loyalty to their leader and with  "undermining the party" over "personal and opportunist  ambitions."    Therefore, the police believe "the internal dispute has  entered the elimination phase and a settlement of accounts has  not been ruled out."</p>

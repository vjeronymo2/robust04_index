			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Senior civil servants fight off moves to reform jobs TOP civil servants appear to have fought off attempts to open their jobs to greater competition and to introduce fixed-term contracts of employment. A year-long study of career management and succession planning for senior civil servants has rejected proposals for advertising all vacancies in the top 600 Whitehall jobs. The study, carried out by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit, has also rejected the idea of fixed-term contracts for those in the three most senior civil service grades. The unit's recommendations will be presented to Mr John Major, the prime minister, at a seminar in No 10 Downing Street this morning. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, will also attend with top mandarins such as Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, and Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary. An early draft of the efficiency unit report recommended open competition for all vacancies in the three top grades. Where possible, it said vacancies should be advertised outside the civil service, as already happens with some specialist jobs and management posts in executive agencies. Jobs likely to be filled by career civil servants - such as policy advisers and parliamentary draughtsmen - would still have been advertised, but internally. Subsequent drafts have been watered down in the face of implacable opposition from Whitehall's top mandarins who currently select candidates for promotion. Acceptance of the early draft would have brought top civil servants more into line with other parts of the public sector, such as local government and the health service, where all senior jobs must be openly advertised. Advocates of change in the civil service have included Sir Peter Levene, the businessman and former civil servant who is the prime minister's efficiency adviser, and Mr Graham Mather, the influential president of the European Policy Forum, an independent think-tank.</p>

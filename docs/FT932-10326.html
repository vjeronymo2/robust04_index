			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / IG Metall is confident of fresh support IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, is confident it will receive support for further strike action when it holds fresh ballots in three of the remaining eastern states today. The ballots, which coincide with a second week of strikes, the first in eastern Germany for more than six decades, will be held in the metal and engineering sectors in Berlin-Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. They will conclude the union's balloting of its 400,000 members in eastern Germany. The strike, and the additional ballots, are primarily aimed at putting pressure on Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' grouping, to reinstate a contract signed between the employers and the union in March 1991 designed to equalise west and east German wages by next year. Employers cancelled the contract because of deteriorating economic conditions throughout Germany. East German wages are about 60 per cent of those in the west, and productivity is lagging by as much as 70 per cent. The strike is also to remind employers that IG Metall still has political clout - even though the stoppage, organised by west Germans rather than east Germans, could lead to higher unemployment in the east and sap union membership further. The unemployment rate, taking into account job creation schemes and short-time work, is about 30 per cent. So far both sides, publicly at least, have hardened their positions. IG Metall is insisting it will not return to the negotiating table until employers reinstate the contract, while Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, yesterday said the timetable towards income parity must be discarded. However, both sides are willing to negotiate away from the limelight, in Dresden, capital of Saxony. Talks which broke down last week are due to resume early this week, and may break the deadlock. If not, a number of foreign companies could consider shifting their suppliers from east to west Germany, following a warning last week. By yesterday, IG Metall had already called out 38,000 workers from 70 plants. More enterprises, located in Saxony, part of eastern Germany's industrial heartland, and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the poorest of the five states, will be affected today.</p>

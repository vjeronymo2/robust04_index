			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Anglo Pacific returns to the black In the first half of 1993 Anglo Pacific Resources, the mineral exploration and coal producing group, returned to profitability with Pounds 119,000 pre-tax. That compared with losses of Pounds 147,000 in 1992, which had increased to Pounds 670,000 by that year-end. Turnover rose from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 1.83m. Earnings per share were 0.15p (losses 0.19p). Operating results at Fife Silica Sands and Anglo Tulloch Minerals showed considerable improvement. Initial royalty contributions were received from the Gordonstone coal project; the income should increase considerably in the second half as production rises to planned levels. The group is entitled to royalties on a significant portion of the coal to be produced from the Crinum undergroundmine. Production should commence towards the end of 1994 with a planned capacity of 2.5m tonnes a year in 1996.</p>

To  accommodate the crowd, 32 volunteered in advance to sit in a side room and one  table of eight agreed to dine in the kitchen.  </P> <P> This year, Mickey Bodek chairs the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood Guild. That  meant that her husband, Gordon Bodek, automatically became chief sous chef  under tutelage of Bruce Marder, DC-3 chef proprietor, and Bill Hufferd,  executive chef.

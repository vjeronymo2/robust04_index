			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / French pollsters shift into top gear RARELY a day has gone by in France over the past fortnight without publication of an opinion poll on next month's crucial referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Opinion polls, or sondages, are a familiar feature of French life. The French are probably polled more regularly and thoroughly than any other nation. This summer, as the threat of a negative referendum result has grown, the pollsters have been busier than ever. Newspapers and television news programmes are filled with political pundits poring over the polls; the Paris stock market has fluctuated so wildly on rumours and counter-rumours of the next set of results that the market authorities have issued a stern warning about the dangers of sondage speculation. Polls are not only more prolific in France, they are also taken more seriously. 'This is the land of Descartes,' said Mr Pierre Weill of Sofres, one of the largest polling groups, refering to the 17th century mathematician. 'Statistics are at the heart of France's intellectual tradition.' Political polling has a reasonably high level of accuracy. BVA, one of the sector's leaders, claims a margin of error of less than 3 per cent. The success rate raises the question of whether polls actually influence public opinion. Mr Weill suspects that, while many committed voters may not allow them to affect their decisions, the polls probably persuade uncommitted voters. This could prove crucial over the next few days, when new polls will show how the French have responded to last week's news that, for the first time, the anti-Maastricht faction could command a majority in the referendum. Local authorities in Reims yesterday banned Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the French far right, from holding a campaign meeting against the Maastricht treaty, Reuter reports from Paris. The meeting, planned for next Sunday, was to have been held in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral in the city.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Tunnel handover smooths troubled waters Rows over payments and delays will be set aside today as British and French contractors celebrate the end of construction of the Channel tunnel with an official handing over of the project to its operator, Eurotunnel. Commercial services are not expected to begin until March when freight wagons should start using the tunnel. Car passenger services are likely to begin shortly after Easter. Compared with some grand civil projects Eurotunnel has not had a bad deal although the project is almost a year late and cost more than twice its original estimate of Pounds 4.7bn when it was started in 1988. The Suez and Panama canals each cost more than 50 times their original budgets. The single-bore Seikan rail tunnel, which connects Hokkaido to the mainland of northern Japan, took 24 years to build - 14 more than planned - and caused 34 deaths. Its budget overshoot was far more than that of the Channel tunnel. The Channel tunnel cost the lives of 10 workers - eight on Britain's side and two on the French. There was a slow start on the British side when salt water, percolating through fissures in the rock, affected the delicate controls on the 200m-long tunnel-boring machines. Initial attempts to insulate equipment caused overheating, periodic engine fires and many breakdowns. At one stage progress under the Kent coast was less than 20 metres a week, compared with more than 300 metres a week later. Mr John King, director responsible for the British tunnelling, later admitted: 'There were several times when I thought we might not make it. 'One of the worst moments was when, with water still pouring through tiny fissures in the roof of the tunnel, we had to decide whether the modifications we had made to the machines would be sufficient to let us proceed. Fortunately, they worked.' Since then engineers have gone on to break a number of records in the course of digging about 150km, in three adjoining tunnels, removing more than 20m tonnes of spoil and building the world's largest undersea tunnel. The tunnel was just a beginning. The terminals at Folkestone in Kent and Sangatte near Calais in northern France represented two of Europe's biggest building projects. The French site is equivalent in size to Heathrow. The tunnel is one of the world's most sophisticated transport systems including more than 200km of track in the two running tunnels which are separated by the central service tunnel. There is computer-controlled signalling as well as monitoring and override devices along the track and in trains to assist the managers of the new railway. These will operate from control towers at each end of the tunnel, either of which can operate the system on its own. Information is carried through miles of fibre-optic cable capable of handling 700m pieces of data per second. Power for the overhead railway will be drawn from the British and French national grids from two sub-stations at each end of the tunnel. Either of these can operate singly. Stiff safety requirements, in the wake of London Underground's fire at Kings Cross and the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in Zeebrugge harbour, have helped increase the project's cost and added to delays. Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the inter-governmental Channel tunnel safety authority, said this week that a full-scale evacuation test, involving 1,000 Channel tunnel employees and their families, will be conducted before commercial services can start. He could not rule out further delays, but said: 'We are confident that the design and concept of the project ought to be able to work safely. Once you are inside, you should be safer than you were on the journey to the tunnel.' Observer, Page 17</p>

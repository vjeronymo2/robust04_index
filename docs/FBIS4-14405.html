			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksey Berezhkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- "The actions of the Russian  leadership and the results of the country's economic development  during the first three months of 1994 have confirmed the Russian  Government's and president's determination to continue the  course of reforms," Russian vice-premier and economics minister  Aleksandr Shokhin said during the opening of a roundtable here  today. It is being attended by representatives of the Russian  Government and business circles and a U.S. delegation led by  Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown.    "Voiced during the past two months, including in the United  States, were doubts about the Russian Government's readiness to  continue the course of reforms," Shokhin said. "I think nobody  has such doubts now."    "The rates of inflation in February and March," he noted,  "were the lowest as compared to 1992 and 1993. The January  upsurge of inflation can be largely explained by heightened  inflationary expectations, provoked for purely political  reasons. They were in no way linked with the government's  economic efforts."    "The orientation of the Russian Government's reformist  efforts," Shokhin stressed, "are confirmed by the recently  reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  which is to grant Russia the second part of the envisaged system  credit. The agreement with the IMF is important for us not only  because a decision is to be adopted this April on granting  Russia a 1.5 billion dollars credit. This sum, frankly speaking,  is not decisive for our national economy's financial development  and investment process," Shokhin noted. "It is important for us  as proof of the international economic and financial community's  readiness to back the Russian reforms."    On the other hand, according to Shokhin, the reached  agreements should pave the way for an IMF decision to grant  Russia a reserve credit, to an agreement with the Paris Club on  the postponement of payments for the debts of the former USSR,  which are to be made in 1994. Moreover, the World Bank is  expected to pass a decision not later than June to grant the  second rehabilitation credit to Russia, amounting to 600 million  dollars.    The visit of the delegation of the U.S. Department of  Commerce is proceeding at a time when trade exchange between the  two countries is expanding. According to data received from the  Russian Foreign Ministry (the Department for Economic  Cooperation between the United States and Russia) Russia had a  deficit of 2.2 billion dollars in trade with the United States  in 1992. The export of Russian goods to the United States  trebled in 1993, growing from 693.9 millions to 2.05 billion  U.S. Dollars. But a slight deficit remained, because Russia  imported 2.2 billion dollars worth of goods from the United  States that year.    According to a reference note, released by the U.S.  Department of Commerce before Ronald Brown's visit, American  exports to Russia reached three billion dollars in 1993, which  is 40 per cent more than in 1992. American imports from Russia  grew by 262 per cent and amounted to 1.7 billion dollars in  1993. Nevertheless, the sum total of American investments in  Russia is still very small and amounts, according to some  estimates, to only one billion dollars, which were invested by  American companies based in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the  United States believes there are great potentialities for  capital investments in Russia, especially in the oil and gas  industry.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom shows sharp gains ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering giant, yesterday reported a higher-than-expected 20 per cent rise in net annual profits and forecast a further improvement in the current year. Mr Pierre Suard, group chairman, said net profits had risen to FFr6.2bn (Dollars 1.1bn) last year from FFr5.1bn in 1990, thanks to increased sales and earnings across the main divisions - communications systems, energy and transport, electrical engineering, and batteries. The net gain came after a FFr2.7bn restructuring charge. This was an excellent performance in difficult economic conditions and compared well with competitors, said Mr Suard. Group sales rose by 11 per cent to FFr160bn. The underlying increase was 7 per cent, after stripping out the first contribution from acquisitions made during one of Alcatel's busiest years for takeovers. The main acquisitions have been centred on North America, Germany and Italy. They include the transmission equipment division of Rockwell of the US; Telettra, the Italian maker of transmission equipment; Canada Wire, the cable producer; and AEG Kabel in Germany. As a result of the growth in investments, net debts rose from 7 per cent of shareholders' funds to 16 per cent over the same period. Over the past five years, the proportion of Alcatel's sales outside France had risen from 30 per cent to 70 per cent, Mr Suard said. 'We consider the European market to be our domestic market, and furthermore, a buoyant market which will remain so.' The communications systems division, where Alcatel is Europe's largest supplier of telecommunications equipment, saw an 18 per cent rise sales to FFr109.8bn, representing just over two thirds of the group total. Divisional operating profits rose by 23 per cent to FFr11.8bn. GEC Alsthom, the energy and transport equipment group jointly owned with GEC of Britain, contributed FFr25.9bn to the group's sales, a 16 per cent rise on the previous year.</p>

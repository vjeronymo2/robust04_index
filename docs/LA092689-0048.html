			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ON PAPER, ORIOLES JUST DON'T STACK UP TO STRONGER BLUE JAYS  </P> <P> Evaluating the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays, two birds of a distinct  and different baseball species, leads to this overwhelming conclusion on paper:  There's absolutely and positively no comparison when it comes to measuring the  talent available. It's a telling contrast.  </P> <P> That's right. The Orioles come off as inferior to the Jays in a  position-by-position analysis. So what are they doing carrying the battle for  first place into the last week of the season, conceivably going down to the  ninth inning of the final day?  </P> <P> It's another reminder, yes, once again, that sports mirrors life itself and  there's no guarantee the richly endowed will succeed. Why else would the  multitalented Blue Jays, who should be on top by at least the length of a city  block, still be trying to hold off the ever-pressing Orioles, who refuse to  "spit the bit"?  </P> <P> It's not a mirage nor a fantasy. The Orioles have gotten to where they are, the  upper echelon of the American League's Eastern Division, because of one trait  -- persistence. Their drive and desire, plus the early surprise aspect of  shocking other clubs who deceived themselves into believing the Orioles were as  bad as the shameful last-place record in 1988 indicated, worked in Baltimore's  behalf.  </P> <P> Now to the lineups, the pros and cons ...  </P> <P> First base -- Fred McGriff over Randy Milligan. More power and consistent  hitting. There's some similarity on defense. Neither one, in the field, would  make you forget Joe Kuhel or Mickey Vernon. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Second base -- The Blue Jays make use of Manny Lee and Nelson Liriano. The  Orioles have employed a troika of Billy Ripken, Rene Gonzales and Tim Hulett.  It's possible none of the three, an opinion manager Frank Robinson indeed has  expressed, could make the Blue Jays' squad. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Shortstop -- Cal Ripken Jr. Does the job in the middle. There's not a play he  can't make. Strong, accurate arm. Doesn't have the flamboyance of Tony  Fernandez, who can carry Ripken's glove but not his bat. Pick: Baltimore.  </P> <P> Third base -- The only thing Kelly Gruber does better than Craig Worthington,  who keeps getting better, is run the bases. A close call. Pick: Baltimore.  </P> <P> Left field -- George Bell over Phil Bradley by a wide margin. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Center field -- It's a standoff between Toronto's Lloyd Moseby and the pair of  Mike Devereaux and Steve Finley. Toss a coin, if you want, but there's little  difference. Pick: Even.  </P> <P> Rightfield -- Veteran Mookie Wilson, acquired from the New York Mets, arrived  at precisely the time when Junior Felix slumped. Joe Orsulak, vastly  underrated, and Stanley Jefferson largely share the position for the Orioles.  Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Catching -- Ernie Whitt and Pat Borders rate slightly ahead of Jamie Quirk and  Bob Melvin. All four have better than adequate arms. The loss of Mickey  Tettleton to knee surgery hurt Baltimore behind the plate, but his value as a  designated hitter can't be minimized. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Starting pitchers -- John Stieb and Jimmy Key, plus Mike Flanagan, John Cerutti  and Todd Stottlemeyer, vs. Jeff Ballard, Bob Milacki, Dave Johnson, Pete  Harnisch and Dave Schmidt. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Relief pitchers -- Strength in the middle innings from Mark Williamson, who  throws double-play balls, gives the Orioles a clear edge on David Wells and Jim  Acker. As a closer, Gregg Olson is almost unhittable. The Blue Jays, though,  offer an equally respected reliever in power pitcher Tom Henke, plus Duane Ward  and Frank Wills, all with outstanding arms. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Designated hitter -- Mickey Tettleton over anyone the Blue Jays send up. Pick:  Baltimore.  </P> <P> Home field advantage -- The last three games of the season will be played in  the Blue Jays' park. Pick: Toronto.  </P> <P> Psychological advantage -- It's bothersome to the Blue Jays that they have a  well-earned reputation for being "choke artists". Little was expected from the  Orioles. Pick: Baltimore.  </P> <P> As to team qualities regarding defense, speed, hitting ability, pitching and  power, give Baltimore the margin only on defense -- they wouldn't be where they  are without it -- and Toronto the best of it in the other four categories.  </P> <P> So, from the aspect of talent on the field, the Blue Jays should have long ago  closed out the race, except the Orioles refuse to surrender. The Blue Jays act  as if they want the title handed to them in gift wrapping. Despite their  overall superiority, they usually find a way to lose, which continues to play  on their psyches.  </P> <P> Remember, the race doesn't always go to the swiftest nor the fight to the  strongest.  </P></p>

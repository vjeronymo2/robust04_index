			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RYBAKOV NAMED TO LEAD MOSCOW CHAPTER OF PEN  </P> <P> Leading writers here have elected liberals to head the Soviet Union's first  branch of PEN, an international literary organization that for years has  denounced by Moscow as anti-communist, members said Friday.  </P> <P> The president of the new group -- to be known as the Russian Soviet PEN center  -- will be anti-Stalinist novelist Anatoly Rybakov and among its seven vice  presidents are poets Andrei Voznessensky and Yevgeny Yevtushenko.  </P> <P> "This is a vital moment for literature and the intelligentsia," the 78-year-old  Rybakov told reporters. "Our center will work for freedom of creation, for the  rights of writers and against censorship everywhere."  </P> <P> About 50 founder-members of the group, a product of the freer cultural policies  followed under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev program of glasnost  (openness), gathered Thursday night for the elections after sending a  delegation to a recent Pen congress.  </P> <P> Efforts by dissenting writers to form a PEN chapter in Moscow in the 1960s and  1970s were quickly squashed by the authorities, although the international  organization includes some of the best-known figures in world literature.  </P> <P> Arkady Vaksberg, a specialist on the Soviet legal system and one of the vice  presidents, said the Moscow center will take part in international campaigns in  support of persecuted or threatened writers like Salman Rushdie or Vaclav  Havel.  </P> <P> Rybakov and Vaksberg, with other founder members, issued protests earlier this  year over the Prague's jailing of Havel, a leading Czechoslovak playwright, and  of a death sentence against British author Rushdie by Iran's late revolutionary  patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  </P> <P> "We regard it as very important for Soviet writers to publicly express their  support for writers in similar situations everywhere, not just in the Soviet  Union itself," Vaksberg said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Righteous Struggle of South Korean Students Cannot Be </F> Blocked" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The current anti-U.S.,  anti-war, anti-"government" struggle mounting among the South  Korean students is a righteous struggle, which shows their  strong will to defend the dignity and interests of the nation,  declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    Recalling that the South Korean Federation of General  Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon) at a press conference on April 25 on the  first anniversary of its inauguration expressed the  determination to intensify the anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam  struggle, saying there is nothing to expect from the Kim  Yong-sam puppet regime, the analyst goes on:    The U.S. imperialists are deploying massive reinforcements  of  the aggression forces including Patriot missiles in South Korea,  crying for the resumption of the "Team Spirit" nuclear war  exercises and staging war gambles against the DPRK almost every  day together with the puppets, while putting an undisguised  pressure on the DPRK in the international arena over its  "nuclear issue".    Unable to tolerate the dignity and interests of the nation  being encroached upon by outside forces and the beloved fellow  countrymen being threatened with a nuclear disaster, the South  Korean students have risen up valiantly in the anti-U.S.,  anti-war struggle to remove their root cause.    The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now running about like a  headless chicken to block the righteous and patriotic struggle  of the students.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique ruthlessly cracking down on  their righteous struggle will face curses and denunciation by  the whole nation.    The just struggle of the South Korean students cannot be  blocked with anything.</p>

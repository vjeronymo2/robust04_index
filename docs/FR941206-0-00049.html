			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the first difference, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) use the term ``vegetative'' ground cover, implying that the ground cover used to control erosion must be living plants. Colorado's explicit use of the term ``living plants'' simply adds specificity to the Colorado regulation. The use of the term ``living plants'' supplements the more general Federal term ``vegetative ground over'' and does not conflict with it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the second difference, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.133, and 817.133 do not restrict when changes in the postmining land use may occur. Colorado has discretion to approve a change in the designated postmining land use for a reclaimed area after final grading has occurred if such a change will satisfy the environmental protection requirements of the Colorado program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, with respect to these differences, Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.116(b)(4), 816.133, 817.116(b)(4), and 817.133. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado also proposed at Rule 4.15.10(2) allowance for a limited exception from the requirement for living ground cover by reference to proposed Rule 4.15.10(3). Proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) provides an exception from compliance with the revegetation requirement of Rule 4.15.10(2) specifically for mine support facilities located within areas where both the premining and postmining land use is industrial or commercial, if it is (1) demonstrated that the mine support facilities will support the approved postmining land use, and (2) requested in writing by the landowner, and if the Division determines, that revegetation is not necessary to control erosion. Colorado stated in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose'' that, in limited cases, living ground cover could be in conflict with the proposed land use, and that alternative erosion control measures such as gravel surfacing and appropriate site grading would effectively control erosion. Colorado cited as the most common example of this situation a pre-existing railroad siding utilized by a coal company to store and load coal for railroad shipment. Colorado stated that, in such cases, revegetation would often be impractical due to the historic industrial nature of the site and could conflict with railroad right-of-way fire hazard provisions and adjacent industrial uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no allowance in the Federal program for exceptions to the requirement for ground cover as a revegetation success standard on areas designated for use as industrial or commercial; however, the stated goal of the requirement for ground cover is to control erosion, not to demonstrate the capability of the soils to support a land use such as grazing or crop production. Although Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) allows, under limited circumstances, that ground cover need not be ``living,'' Colorado does not propose to waive the requirement for erosion control. As explained in Colorado's ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' alternative erosion control measures such as gravel surfacing and appropriate site grading would effectively control erosion. Therefore, the allowance proposed at Rule 4.15.10(3), for erosion control measures other than live vegetation on lands with premining and postmining land uses of industrial or commercial, is not inconsistent with the ultimate goal of the revegetation requirement for erosion control in the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3) are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3), 816.116(b)(4), 816.133, 817.116(b)(4), and 817.133, and approves them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION AND HOMOSEXUALITY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times has long been a smug and pious defender of wrong ideas  and narrow-minded people. Your editorial ("Pro-Family Initiative Rooted in  Prejudice," Jan. 15) supporting the homosexual rights ordinance of Irvine is  further proof of this.  </P> <P> The Times calls me and my colleagues homophobes and guilty of "ignorant  prejudice" because we happen to resoundingly support the heterosexual ethic,  the traditional family. What we know is that mainstream, professional  psychology, confirming the most fundamental of human instincts, views  homosexuality as an acquired behavior and even "perverse" in the clinical  sense.  </P> <P> The American Psychological Assn. does accept homosexuality as normal, something  homosexuals will point out, but this view ignores the political aggression of  homosexuals as they terrorized the APA into submission on this issue back in  1973.  </P> <P> Americans are discriminating people. We do care who we work with, we do care  who lives next door to us, we do care who sits next to us on a bus, we do care  what we eat, drink, watch on television, and what clothes we wear.  </P> <P> We recognize each of these concerns as legitimate because they fall within our  realm of personal choice. On the other hand, Americans find discrimination  based on race, sex, physical handicap, etc., as abhorrent because we are all  born into these situations, we did not have a choice how we were to be born.  </P> <P> Homosexuality is a personal choice, and a deleterious choice at that. Americans  have the right to "discriminate," to wonder why they must be forced to legally  and morally recognize one distasteful personal behavior when they are not  obliged to do the same for other behaviors.  </P> <P> To deny housing to an avowed homosexual is similar to denying housing to an  alcoholic or drug abuser. A landlord should have the discretion to protect the  integrity of his or her property when harmful personal behavior is in question.  If homosexual behavior is not a problem to a landlord, then so be it. But if it  is, then an ordinance such as the Irvine law becomes an offense.  </P> <P> Homosexuality is but a symptom of the disease of moral decay that exists where  citizenry deny God. Our fight to repeal the Irvine ordinance is really an  appeal in support of traditional family values and the Judeo-Christian ethic.  </P> <P> America is a place where even persons who choose adverse life styles can  petition a citizenry for support. This right, however, does not make the  substance of the appeal morally proper or even constitutional. The Times is  wrong once again to lend its seemingly undying support in favor of  homosexuality.  </P> <P> The goal of the homosexual movement is to hop from small city to small city and  from town to town promoting ordinances of the type in Irvine. One of my goals,  and that of others, is to stop them in their political advance. This is my  right as a citizen of the United States and I intend to exercise it.  </P> <P> If leaders in America, whether in business, news media, education, public  health, or those in government, are unwilling to affirm the heterosexual ethic  and the Judeo-Christian ethic, then we should be honest enough to recognize  that homosexuals will succeed in tearing down the most fundamental values of  Western civilization, our God-given heterosexual identities and our  God-ordained traditional family unit.  </P> <P> WILLIAM E. DANNEMEYER  </P> <P> Member of Congress  </P> <P> 39th District  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bard Wormdal: ``Norwegian Equipment in Place at </F> Russian Nuclear Plant''--first paragraph is AFTENPOSTEN  introduction]    [Text] Important Norwegian safety equipment is finally in  place at the nuclear power plant at Kola.    Murmansk--For more than three months Norwegian authorities  have worked to get this equipment cleared through Russian  customs. Russia has demanded an importation fee and value-added  tax on the equipment, which is a gift from Norway.    The problem was solved when Minister of Foreign Affairs  Johan  Jorgen Holst last week got in touch with the head of the Russian  Ministry of Nuclear Affairs, Viktor Mikhailov. The equipment has  now been delivered to the nuclear power plant duty free.    Director Knut Gussgard at the National Radiation Protection  Board says that this decision is important for nuclear safety  work.    ``The customs problems almost put a halt to the entire  Norwegian-Russian work to improve safety at the nuclear power  plant at Polyarny Sori, which is not up to Western standards in  several areas,'' he says.    The Kola power plant, which opened in 1973, has four  reactors. Two of these are of the same type as those at the  nuclear power plant in Greifswald in the former East Germany.  The Greifswald plant has been closed for safety reasons.  <H5>  New Million [Kroner] Gift </H5>   The National Radiation Protection Board did not want to  continue with the work of improving safety conditions at Kola  until the first shipment of maintenance equipment and batteries  were in place.    ``Since the problem now has been solved, we will order an  emergency generator unit worth 10 million kroner. If everything  goes according to plan, the unit will be installed at the power  plant just after the new year,'' Gussgard says.    The National Radiation Protection Board realized a long time  ago that the emergency power supply was not good enough. A power  failure at the nuclear power plant on 2 February clearly showed  this. The reactor cores were then in danger of a meltdown. Only  after two hours did the power plant manage to get the power  supply up again. A catastrophe was probably averted.    The emergency power unit from Norway will prevent such a  situation from arising again, according to the National  Radiation Protection Board.  <H5>  Customs Dispute </H5>   Both the Russian Consulate at Kirkenes, the Norwegian  Consulate in Murmansk, and the embassy in Moscow have worked to  get the Norwegian equipment out to the power plant duty free.  The head of the customs department in Murmansk thinks that the  safety equipment is a form of emergency aid and therefore should  be duty free. However, customs officials in Moscow demanded both  an importation fee and value-added tax on the equipment. Tariff  rates are high in Russia. All told tariffs and taxes on the  Norwegian equipment would have amounted to almost half a million  kroner.  <H5>  High Priority </H5>   The political advisor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  Tore Gundersen, says that environmental problems in northwestern  Russia have top priority in the cooperation in the Barents  region, and that the solution of the customs problems is of  importance for any further nuclear safety work.    ``We are planning to expand the aid package of 20 million  kroner. But first we want to see the result of the first grant.  It is important that the customs problems have been solved. We  are prepared to grant additional millions for environmental work  in the northwestern part of Russia,'' Gundersen says.</p>

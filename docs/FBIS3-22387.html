The study will be launched later this year and will focus on  the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption  of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and  other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the  officials said.    Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn  entire regions into deserts.    The team of scientists from the ministry's Institute of  Population Problems and Institute of Public Health hope to  improve long-term forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in Asia  by examining the causes of population growth and the impact of  rural migration to cities, they said.    The group will also look at how global warming affects the  spread of malaria, they said.    The results of the study will be used to draw up population  and energy conservation policies that could help reduce the  impact of global warming.    The Environment Agency will incorporate the findings in its  "Eco- Asia 21 Plan" and will try to enlist support from other  Asian countries, the officials said.    World population is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by  the turn of the century from 5.3 billion in 1990. According to  United Nations population fund forecasts, it will further swell  to 8.5 billion in 2025, with more than half of the growth  occurring in Asia, mainly China and India.    Rural migration is likely to continue, raising the portion  of  people living in Asian cities from 30 percent of total  population to over 50 percent in 2020.    The National Institute for Environmental Studies estimates  that Asia's energy consumption will show annual growth rates of  3.2 percent, far outstripping the world average of 1.6 percent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 9 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas on Wednesday the UN decision to create "safe areas" in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must be enforced to deter further attacks and  ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to the war-torn region.  Action should now be taken against Serbian forces in the event  that they attack the safe areas or block humanitarian and aid  operations," he said at the key-note address of the consultative  meeting of Nonaligned Movement (NAM) foreign ministers.    Alatas said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)'s  mandate to enforce and establish a unified command structure for  all troops in Bosnia should be more effective. He also stressed  the need to launch air strikes against Serbian forces and stop  its arms supply.    "The air strikes against Serbian forces and an interdiction  of arms supplies to their units in Bosnia must now be put into  effect," Alatas said, adding that the arms embargo on Bosnia  should be lifted to rectify the acute imbalance of armaments in  the field and to motivate the Serbs to come to the negotiating  table. "Our current efforts on Bosnia are focused on these  endeavours and on the feasibility of convening an international  meeting on Bosnia."    The minister also expressed concern over the crisis in  countries such as Somalia and in the Middle East. He said the  current situation in Somalia was complicated by the intended  pullout of American, French, Italian, and Turkish troops that  once made up the UN peacekeeping forces in the country.    In addition, he also mentioned that Israel had not yet  fulfilled the December 13 date to withdraw from designated areas  as stipulated by the peace accord it signed with the PLO last  September.    "Further aggravating the situation is the persistence of  oppressive Israeli policies and practices in the occupied  territories and the inflexibility shown in its negotiations  which cannot but have broader ramifications," he said.    In his speech, Alatas said he hoped to see the Joint  Coordinating Committee (JCC) establisted by NAM and the Group of  77 (G-77) begin its operations this year.    "For this purpose, an ad-hoc working group comprising of  members of NAM and G-77 will be established to formulate its  term of reference," he said.    The idea of forming the JCC was first mooted by heads of  state at the 10th NAM summit in Jakarta two years ago. They had  all stressed the need to harmonize, consolidate, and whenever  necessary integrate the economic activities of both NAM and  G-77. G-77 is a consultative forum for economic affairs of  developing countries with Egypt as the leader.    The JCC is expected to harmonize NAM's action programme for  economic cooperation and the G-77's Caracas Program of Action  (CPA).    "When the JCC starts operating, we can expect South-South  cooperation to be more focused and more efficient as it brings  about the harmonization of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation] and CPA programs," said Alatas.    The two-day NAM ministerial consultative meeting was  attended  by foreign ministers and representatives of 22 member countries.</p>

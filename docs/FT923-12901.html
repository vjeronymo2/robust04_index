			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Drop Nafta, Mulroney told ONTARIO, which contributes 40 per cent of Canada's economic output, has joined calls on Mr Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister, to pull out of talks on a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's social democrat premier, urged Ottawa to suspend its participation, in protest against 'virtually unending trade harassment' by the US. British Columbia, which also has a left-of-centre government, recently made a similar call. But the Mulroney government has given no indication of bowing to growing pressure to withdraw from the Nafta talks with the US and Mexico. Mr Michael Wilson, international trade minister, is expected to join his US and Mexican counterparts on July 25 for the 'final push' towards a Nafta pact. However, a US trade official said last night the talks could last until September before all disputed areas were resolved. A Canadian official said yesterday that Ottawa's commitment to Nafta remained 'rock-solid'. He acknowledged that selling the accord to a sceptical public would be tough in the run-up to a general election next year, but said: 'The bottom line is that we have no choice but to be there.' Opinion polls show most Canadians oppose Nafta and the existing free trade agreement with the US. They blame the latter for job losses and fear that Nafta will bring an exodus of jobs to Mexico.</p>

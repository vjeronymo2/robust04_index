			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Ford returns to the black in Europe Ford's European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) achieved a Dollars 310m turnround in the second quarter with a net profit of Dollars 244m compared with a net loss of Dollars 66m in the same period a year ago. The financial improvement in Europe, following three successive years of losses, reflects the gradual recovery in the west European new car market as well as far-reaching restructuring. Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, remained in the red in the second quarter with an unchanged operating loss of Dollars 62m. However, Ford said Jaguar was expected to return to profit in 1995, ending six successive years of losses. Ford's European automotive operations suffered total losses in 1991-93 of Dollars 3.3bn, including Jaguar, and Dollars 1.5bn excluding Jaguar. The return to profit in Europe follows two years of retrenchment in which the Ford of Europe workforce (excluding Jaguar) has been cut by 15.4 per cent to 83,000 people by the end of last year from 98,100 in November 1992. Ford said the financial recovery reflected higher sales volumes with demand picking up in most European markets from the depth of last year's recession, as well as cost-cutting primarily in manufacturing and purchasing. In the first half of the year Ford of Europe (excluding Jaguar) achieved a net profit of Dollars 353m compared with a loss of Dollars 47m in the corresponding period a year ago. Jaguar's operating loss in the first six months was reduced to Dollars 102m, compared with Dollars 118m. Ford's European automotive operations including Jaguar (operating losses and acquisition costs) improved to a net profit of Dollars 160m in the first six months from a deficit of Dollars 257m in the same period last year. In the second quarter, Ford of Europe has increased its market share and has raised production in order to build up dealer stocks in the expectation of strong demand in the third quarter. Ford said there had been an underlying improvement in Jaguar's operating results following progress in lowering costs and raising product quality. Jaguar increased its worldwide retail sales by 14 per cent in the first half of the year to 14,800, against 13,000 with increases of 25 per cent in the US and 16 per cent in the UK partially offset by a 37 per cent decline in Germany. Ford has increased its share of the western European new car market in the first six months to 11.7 per cent from 11.5 per cent a year ago helped by strongly rising sales of the Mondeo, which have offset a loss of market share by the Escort and Fiesta ranges. It has gained market share in the UK, Germany and Spain but has lost ground in France and Italy.</p>

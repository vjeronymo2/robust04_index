			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jl": "Relations With Slovakia Are a Priority"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--The new Hungarian Government will not  be the government of 15 million Hungarians but the government of  the 10.5 million citizens of Hungary, Imre Szekeres, executive  deputy chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP],  declared at a meeting organized by the Sandor Marai Foundation  in Bratislava yesterday.    Szekeres and Balint Magyar, head of the election campaign  team of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, were speaking  about the probable future Hungarian coalition government of  Socialists and Liberals. They stressed that they ascribe  priority significance to the settlement of relations with  Slovakia. The coalition government will look after the fate of  ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries, but in a style  different from that of the present government--without  interfering in the internal affairs of neighboring countries,  pragmatically, so that these relations with the minorities  become a factor of enhancement of trust.    Imre Szekeres was received yesterday by Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik. The Hungarian politician informed him that the new  Hungarian prime minister, who will probably submit the new  government's policy statement to parliament toward the end of  this month, will wish to meet him within the shortest possible  time. He also said that talks on the drafting of a basic treaty  on relations between Slovakia and Hungary, which would contain  guarantees of present borders and of the rights of ethnic  minorities in both states, should start as soon as possible.    Szekeres also held talks with Peter Weiss, deputy chairman  of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic and chairman of the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], with whom he discussed,  among other issues, the possibilities of future cooperation  between the SDL and the MSZP. The Hungarian politician also met  with Jaroslav Volf, chairman of the Social Democratic Party in  Slovakia.</p>

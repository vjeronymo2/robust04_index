The official said Japan thinks there is no need to change  the  summit format from that of the Seattle meeting last year, and  added that other APEC member countries are of the same opinion.    At China's insistence, the U.S. Government did not invite Li  to the first summit in APEC's four-year history in Seattle on  November 20.    Instead of Li, Taiwan's top government economic planner  Vincent Siew attended the 17-member APEC economic forum before  the summit meeting.    The original members of APEC, founded in 1989, are  Australia,  Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, and  the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand.    China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan joined the consultative forum  in  1991. Papua New Guinea and Chile were also granted admission at  the Seattle summit.</p>

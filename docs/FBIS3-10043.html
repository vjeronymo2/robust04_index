Upon  returning from Cuba, Arce voiced his concern that while the  government celebrates the fourth anniversary of its electoral  victory, it has not yet appointed an ambassador to Cuba.    There are thousands of Nicaraguan students in Cuba, health  cooperation agreements are maintained, and many people travel to  that country to receive medical treatment for exceptional health  problems.    He stressed that Cuba renegotiated its debt with Nicaragua,  reducing it to almost symbolic levels, and that those  obligations have not even been honored by the Nicaraguan  Government.    In addition to meeting with Fidel Castro, Arce met with  other  government leaders and members of the Communist Party of Cuba,  including Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State;  Osmany Cienfuegos, member of the PCC [Communist Party of Cuba]  Politburo; Pedro Arbizu [name as published], director of the  America Department; Foreign Trade Minister Carlos Cabrizas [name  as published]; and Hector Rodriguez, president of the National  Bank of Cuba. As for the subjects discussed, Arce said that he  reviewed with the Cuban leaders aspects related to the Cuban  economic opening and Nicaragua's domestic situation,  particularly the Sandinist process and the party's upcoming  special congress.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Differences emerge over treaty Wide differences of interpretation have emerged between Belarus and Russia over their economic union treaty, which seems to hand over all economic levers of power to the Russian government and central bank, writes Leyla Boulton in St Petersburg. A senior Belarus minister has said Minsk would be allowed to keep a separate central bank and that Russian President Boris Yeltsin supported this position. However, a senior Russian minister has flatly denied the claim, threatening resignation if it were the case. Mr Mikhail Myasnikovich, deputy prime minister of Belarus, said that both the Russian president and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, had agreed during a CIS summit last week to let it keep a central bank. A treaty foreseeing the liquidation of the Belarus Central Bank was signed on Tuesday despite the objection of its chairman. But Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister, said the government was 'categorically opposed' to allowing Belarus' own bank to issue roubles alongside the Russian central bank. He said Russia had agreed to swap Belarus citizens' savings for roubles at a generous one-to-one rate only after Minsk's agreement to give up its central bank. 'I will resign from government if we go back on this,' Mr Shokhin said. He claimed that Mr Chernomyrdin was also opposed to a change in the deal. He had initially agreed to let Belarus retain a central bank with responsibility for monetary emission within limits set by Russia, but later changed his mind.</p>

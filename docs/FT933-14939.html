			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Jaguar move played down SPECULATION that Ford intends to switch production of Jaguar cars to plants in North America was played down by the US motor manufacturer at the weekend, in spite of visits by Jaguar executives to Ford plants in Ohio and Michigan. Executives at Ford's Dearborn headquarters are trying to dampen reports in the US that the company has decided to build the new 'small' Jaguar, the X200, on the same body platform as new US Ford and Mercury models. Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary since 1989, is due to start production of its new model in 1998 - at the same time as the new US cars. Officials in Britain and the US said no decision had been made about whether to base the Jaguar on a Ford body platform or to develop one specifically for the Jaguar. They said visits by Jaguar engineers to US plants were aimed at developing further co-operation between Ford's luxury car plants and Jaguar's in the UK. Mr David Boole, Jaguar's public affairs director, said a decision on where to build the new Jaguar 'is at least 18 months away'. Jaguar engineering and production teams have been relatively frequent visitors to Ford's plants at Lorain, Ohio, which makes the sporting up-market Thunderbird model, and at Wixom, Michigan, where the Lincoln luxury car range is produced. Jaguar executives in the UK readily acknowledge that production and management systems at Jaguar's Browns Lane manufacturing plant have already benefited from the liaison with the US plants.</p>

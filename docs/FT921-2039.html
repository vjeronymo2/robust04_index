			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Waste Management The pathfinder prospectus for the flotation of Waste Management International confirms that its US parent has posed a teaser for UK investors. Assuming WMI increases its earnings per share by one third this year, its shares will be on a prospective multiple of 23 if priced in the middle of the range suggested by the group's advisers, or 26 at the top of the range. That compares with historic multiples of 19 for Caird after yesterday's results, and 18 for Shanks &amp; McEwan. It is just possible that both valuations are right. The flotation could prove a lively affair all the same.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / People: Neil Davidson to make his mark in milk Neil Davidson, a director of Northern Foods, one of the UK's biggest food manufacturers, was yesterday elected president of the Dairy Industry Federation, the new body representing milk processing companies. His election coincided with the deregulation of the milk market, under which the statutory Milk Marketing Board was abolished and Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative, launched as its successor. Davidson, 43, is responsible for all Northern Foods' milk activities, representing 50 per cent of turnover. He joined the group in 1977 and for the past two years has been responsible for milk buying. Under deregulation, the federation, formerly known as the Dairy Trade Federation, loses its statutory right to negotiate milk prices on behalf of the dairy trade. As an industry lobby, however, it will now grant automatic seats on its council to all major dairy companies. Davidson signalled that he wanted a more constructive relationship with other parts of the industry following the acrimony that has marked the past 18 months of preparation for deregulation. 'My aim is to lead an organisation which represents the interest of both large and small buyers of milk, is clearly focused on what it is trying to achieve, and is positive and constructive in its outlook,' he said. Under its retiring president, Jim McMichael-Phillips, the federation was accused by the House of Commons agriculture committee earlier this year of 'intransigence' in its opposition to the new arrangements. Davidson says he looks forward to a healthy dialogue with William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, and farmers' leaders. But he noticeably did not refer to Milk Marque, with which the dairy trade is engaged in a fierce row over prices. He also maintained the dairy trade's assault on the new system, saying it had 'distorted the market and led to artificial raw milk price increases'.</p>

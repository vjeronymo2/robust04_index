			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: EIB completes shelf registration for yen issues THE European Investment Bank yesterday completed the first shelf registration for yen-denominated bonds, potentially lowering its borrowing costs in future by shortening the time it takes to launch yen issues. The arrangement, which is intended to cover all of the bank's expected yen borrowing this year of more than Y200bn (Dollars 1.6bn), will make it possible for the EIB to seek bids from underwriters and then launch a yen issue on the same day, an official said. The process takes two days at present, due to the need to obtain Ministry of Finance approval for the lead-managers and co-managers to the issue. The bank has now obtained the Japanese authorities' permission to use any managers selected from a pre-notified list of some 50 to 60 banks, doing away with the need for specific authorisation for each issue. The shorter time between inviting bids and choosing underwriters should prompt banks to submit more competitive bids, the EIB official said. 'If counter-parties are on risk for less time, it should lead to finer pricing,' he said. The official added the relationship between yields in the Japanese government bond, Euroyen and swap markets worked in a less predictable way than in some other currencies, and that this added to the costs when banks or the EIB wanted to hedge any Euroyen position. This further discouraged banks from submitting the tightest possible bids. The shelf-registration, arranged by Nikko Europe, covers an initial Y250bn of bonds. Last year, the EIB raised around Y200bn in the Euroyen market, making it the second-largest borrower behind the World Bank. The agreement also follows the recent trend for borrowers to reduce their issuing costs by standardising the documentation of their Eurobond and medium-term note issues. The EIB's arrangement is expected to reduce the fees on each individual transaction from around Pounds 30,000 to some Pounds 10,000.</p>

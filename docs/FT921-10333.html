			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Voice input frees concealed talent For 11 years of his life, Christopher Nolan, who was severely brain-damaged at birth, sat imprisoned in his wheelchair unable to communicate in any way. It was not until he was given the muscle-relaxant drug Lioresal that he was able, with the aid of a wooden stick attached to his head, to type out on a word processor the thoughts and emotions that had long crowded his brain. It emerged that he had been composing and memorising poetry since the age of three. Nolan serves as an example of how scientific and technological advancements can unleash the potential of disabled people. Voice recognition in computers could be a highly significant development. Brian Payne, who is congenitally blind, has been using voice input systems since 1985. Payne, who runs his own consultancy - Electronic Services for the Blind - began with the Kurzweil Voice System (KVS), a pioneer model on which he managed to write the first two chapters of his autobiography. However, the KVS was slow and thrown off by background noises such as clicks, which it interpreted as words or commands. Changes of voice, caused by a head cold or even tiredness, would throw the system off. Payne gave up. Two years ago, he began to use the DragonDictate system, developed by Dragon Systems of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He dictates to the machine through a noise-cancelling headset microphone, pausing briefly between each word. Voice recognition can be extremely useful for non-keyboard users (such as tetraplegics or those with spinal injuries) who also have severely impaired speech; so long as utterances are consistent the computer will pick up the intended word or phrase once it has adapted to the user's idiosyncrasies. Payne points out that, by employing the user-defined functions one utterance could generate a procedure which could, for example, type a standard paragraph of a business letter or access a database. Because voice commands do not vary, users can move between software packages without having to learn a new set of instructions. That may be useful for disabled people, especially the blind for whom wading through computer manuals can be a real chore. Payne has DragonDictate hooked up to a voice synthesiser which converts text on the screen to simulated speech free of Dalek-like warblings. He also has a braille pad connected to the terminal which enables him to finger-read text on the screen line by line. 'If you can use voice, you free up your hands to do other things. In that lies the power of the system,' he says. Payne consults braille notes jotted down during meetings and dictates a more polished version into the computer. The manufacturer claims 30-40 words per minute can be achieved. Payne is excited by the prospect of 'searching' by voice, accessing, for example, a CD-Rom database of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, company profiles or a phone directory. In the latter case, if the system were hooked up to the telephone, a disabled user could 'dial' a number simply by reading out the name. Bill Fine, information specialist at the IBM Support Centre for People with Disabilities, cautions against regarding voice recognition as a 'magic wand', since it is still in the early stages of development and beyond the price range of most disabled people. He also feels that, for office use, constant dictation into a microphone might disturb fellow workers and further isolate the disabled user socially. 'I don't want to be negative about voice, rather positive about the other solutions, some of which can change someone's life for as little as Pounds 30.' For example, IBM's AccesDos package tailors the keyboard for a range of disabilities. Keys can be slowed down so they do not repeat characters when pressed clumsily. Fine says that technology must be selected according to its practical ability to improve the lives of disabled users. 'There are no technological solutions,' he says. 'Technology simply makes possible human solutions.'</p>

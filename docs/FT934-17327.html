			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK retailing Sears' observation that its margins will start to come under pressure from the delayed effects of sterling's devaluation raises the issue of how much inflationary pressure is still in the pipeline. Price rises yet to come as a result of sterling's exit from the ERM may not be enough to shift the overall level of inflation much, but it may have an impact on retailers like Sears which operate longer-term forward foreign exchange cover for imported products. Other buyers of imported finished goods may well be in a similar position, since the lead times in such businesses are long. Clothing and footwear retailers which source overseas may thus come under pressure to raise prices this autumn. In contrast, buyers of raw materials like yarn, which have shorter cycles, will already have seen some of the pressure. Several factors will, however, mitigate any inflationary impact. Devaluation in countries like Spain and Italy, and weak economies worldwide, have made it difficult for hard-currency manufacturers to increase prices. With the yen very strong, this effect has hit Japanese companies particularly hard. Since consumers are reluctant to spend, retailers have had to absorb some of the costs in margins. In areas such as textiles and cars, where quotas apply, margins will have been built up in good times, and can be run down without excessive pain now. Still, as soon as world markets show any degree of strength, the pressure to raise prices and rebuild margins will return.</p>

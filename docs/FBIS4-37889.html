			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Foreign Policy Desk] </F>   [Text] The sensitivity of Iran's position and the  miscellaneous plots that are planned against the internal and  foreign security of our country demand a serious approach and  the need to take greater security measures.    The revelation of Britain's espionage plot against our  embassy in London once again highlighted this point for our  officials, that we should take security measures seriously.    The sensitivity of the situation and stances of the Islamic  Republic of Iran necessitates a closer look at our security  measures abroad.    A newspaper published in Turkey claims that the building of  the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in Moscow is being  constructed by a Turkish company. According to a report in the  newspaper VAKET published in Istanbul, the Iranian Embassy is  being constructed by the Alarco company, the proprietors of  which are Turkish Jewish investors.    According to a report in the Alarco news bulletin, the  building of the Iranian Embassy complex will be handed over to  the Iranian officials on 1 September.    If the claims of the Islamist newspaper VAKET are true, the  relevant officials should view this matter in a more serious and  precise manner. We wish to draw the attention of our relevant  issues to this point, that the British Embassy was renovated in  Iran a while ago, but even the cement, gravel, and all other  materials for the purpose were transported from London to Tehran  in sealed containers. However, our embassy in London was  renovated by British contractors and listening and espionage  devices were planted in it.    If the report of the Turkish newspaper is true, it will have  unpleasant repercussions especially since the Turkish Jews have  undertaken this task!</p>

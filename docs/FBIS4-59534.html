			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  To the sincere sons of our Yemeni people in Aden, the economic  and trade capital. To those who defeated colonialism and upheld  the values of truth, justice, and equality. To those who have  been afflicted by the gang of a new brand of party dictatorship  and by the elements of the clique of repression, apostasy, and  secession. To the faithful ones who fight and struggled for a  free Yemeni life but reaped instead slavery, oppression, and  tyranny and paid a high price for the worst and most horrible  Marxist and atheist experiment, which spread repression,  nationalized property, and confiscated rights and liberties and  forced on the good elements, even in the Socialist Party itself,  ideological estrangement, homelessness, and harassment.    To those who offered dozens of relatives as sacrifices to  end  the nightmare of the militias and to escape the massacres of the  killers in the Socialist Party leadership for over 27 years of  totalitarian regime, which severed the sinews of love between  one brother and another, and between father and son, and  destroyed the bridges of trust among the groups of society and  shook people's confidence in themselves and in their ability to  get rid of the party's shackles, of its rabid dogs, and the  torture in its dungeons.    To the free Yemeni people in the brave city of  Aden--military  and civilian, shopkeepers and laborers, men and women, boys and  girls. To those who were at the forefront of the masses who on  22 May 1990 shouted long live the unity, and raised the banner  of unity and democracy, and wiped out the partition and its  deplorable remnants.    To the fathers, brothers and sons; to the mothers and  sisters, we ask you to take a firm, unwavering stand against the  barbaric trap that has been set for you by the secessionist  elements in the Socialist Party. Beware of them and know that  the Armed Forces and security forces are your own forces, the  forces of constitutional legitimacy, the protectors of unity and  democracy. Therefore, these forces are to be trusted in caring  for your life, security, and stability because they are  responsible for the life of the entire people. Therefore, we  are confident that you will always be with them, especially  today when they are embarking on the heroic path and confronting  the latest chapter in the plot of the secessionist gang, which  the is taking of the tranquil life in Aden as a trench to  protect it from the just punishment of heaven and from people's  will. This gang is endeavoring to drag the Yemeni Armed Forces  into storming this trench at the expense of your security and  stability, a thing which this gang failed to realize, thanks to  the astuteness of the political leadership of brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who has  been issuing firm instructions to the Armed Forces' brave  brigades and battalions and to the splendid men of the  homeland's protectors that they should not be dragged into the  plot prepared by the sanguinary elements of the Socialist Party,  which aim to destroy the proud city of Aden in the wake of their  utter and expected defeat.    O free brothers, you are aware of the secessionist gang's  hatred toward Aden and its inhabitants. You are aware that this  sanguinary plot is an extension of the policy of destruction  that the Socialist Party devils led on 13 January 1986. That is  why we appeal to you to take the initiative, foil the plot, and  join the trench of defending unity and democracy under the  fluttering banner of constitutional legitimacy, and to face the  secessionist gangs firmly, bravely, with conviction, and with an  unwavering stand.    We appeal to you to rob all those who rebel against  constitutional legitimacy at any opportunity and to extend all  kinds of support and backing to your heroic sons of the Yemeni  Armed Forces, who will uproot the elements of apostasy and  secession with God's backing and your support. They will  eliminate those who endanger the homeland and bargain at the  expense of the supreme people's interests.    O free brothers, let the people's will, which is the will of  justice, proceed with daring, strength, and capability. Let  your cry roar and let us work together along the same path to  save the unionist city of Aden from the secessionist plot so  that it will remain safe and free and an honorable landmark of  the new Yemeni homeland, which now belongs to the procession of  the free world, thanks to its unity and democracy.    Accursed be the plotters, the enemies of God and the people,  the enemies of unity and democracy, and the enemies of life and  democracy.</p>

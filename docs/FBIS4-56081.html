			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, by 1100, a general danger alarm had been  sounded three times in Doboj as Muslim [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army]  artillery constantly shelled the city center from the direction  of Tesanj. The fiercest Muslim attacks in the last few months  started shortly after 0800 this morning. They were stepped up  at 0900, and after a brief break, resumed at 1030. More than 10  tank and mortar shells landed on and around the city center area  during this period. According to first reports, the material  damage is considerable. There are no reports on possible  casualties yet, although ambulances are to be heard in the town.  Owing to the artillery attacks on the town yesterday and today,  schools, shops, businesses, and other public institutions are  not functioning in Doboj. Only the hospital, the police, and  the civil defense are working. This has been a report by our  correspondent Brane Bozic.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / People: The art of persuasion at TransTec Richard Carr, the former Tomkins executive who was appointed chief executive of TransTec just three weeks ago, has persuaded two of the unsuccessful applicants for his job to join the specialist engineering group. Peter Summerfield, 47, (far right) who is to be managing director of the newly formed manufacturing division, joins from British Aerospace, where for the past five years he has been managing director, operations, for the regional jet business at Avro. The other new director is Tony Kirkman (near right), a 49-year-old engineer who has held a number of senior positions at GEC's Avery subsidiary. He will head up the new controls division. Carr, 41, said the pair took some persuading. 'They are both highly qualified managers with their own egos. But I managed to sell them my vision of the group. It's great that we have got them so quickly - it could well have taken six months or more - and it puts us in a very strong position.' Carr was brought in earlier this month when TransTec's founder, Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson, agreed to split his role as chairman and chief executive following pressure from institutional investors. Previously in charge of US acquisitions for Tomkins, Carr picked up a Pounds 10m bonus before he left.</p>

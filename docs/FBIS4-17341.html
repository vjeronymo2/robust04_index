			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Russian Communists said today at an all-Russian  conference of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation that  the memorandum on civil accord in its present form is not  acceptable. Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov made a speech at the  conference and said that political measures and not declarations  should be the basis for civil accord. Their purpose should be  the elimination of sources of civil confrontation, which he  believes are the sharp property stratification, the violation of  social and economic rights of working people, the increase in  crime, and the spiritual degradation of the public. The head of  the party believes that a civil accord in Russia is possible but  it should be agreed upon not by confrontational branches of  powers but by various political forces. The communists intend  to set up a wide coalition of left, centrist, and national and  democratic forces in order to win the elections and to come to  power legally.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Carlos Azedo, from Sao Paulo] </F>   [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] has been  brought to a standstill awaiting a decision by Senator Fernando  Henrique Cardoso; namely, whether he will run for the presidency  or stay in office as finance minister until the end of Itamar  Franco's administration. The party plans to field its own  candidates in the country's leading states at the forthcoming  general elections, but needs a decision to consolidate alliances  in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo,  Bahia, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Para, Goias, and the Federal  District.    The PSDB leadership is confident of the upward trend in its  popularity at last elections. Meanwhile, compromise agreements  to establish alliances are waiting for the cat to jump. Only  Cardoso's decision is missing to complete the PSDB tickets, as  the names of the running mates and of the two candidates for the  Senate have already been chosen.    Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Parana] said the minister's  decision is personal and will depend on circumstances. Now that  the economic program has been approved, the economic situation  and the management of the economic policy will decide Cardoso's  position.    The former Parana Governor contends that if Cardoso chooses  to stay in his post, the PSDB must seek an alliance with the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and field Antonio  Britto [PMDB-RS] [Rio Grande do Sul] as its presidential  candidate, even though Orestes Quercia has already launched his  candidacy to head the PMDB ticket. Richa says the so-called  PMDB ethical group may support a PSDB candidate.    Exercising more caution, former Sao Paulo Governor Franco  Montoro argues that the success of the program to curb inflation  is far more important for the country than a discussion about a  candidacy. Montoro believes that deciding who will be candidate  can come later, and may very well not be Cardoso.    He said: We must discuss a program as the basis for our  alliances. The party has other candidates: [PSDB Chairman]  Tarso Jereisati, [Deputy] Jose Serra [PSDB-Sao Paulo], [Ceara  Governor] Ciro Gomes, Jose Richa. [Senator Mario] Covas [Sao  Paulo] is not on this list because his candidacy for Sao Paulo  governorship is decided.    Senator Covas, PSDB leader in the Senate, is of the opinion  that pressures exerted by the opposition and even from allies to  drop Cardoso's name from the list of possible candidates are  unacceptable.    He said: It is the party that decides when to field its  candidate. Cardoso has the right to be a candidate and I am  going to endorse his candidacy at the appropriate time.    Covas dismisses charges that the extension of the deadline  for resigning from office in order to campaign for election to  another public office seeks to favor Cardoso's interests. He  said: We are against the proposal of Deputy Nelson Jobim  [PMDB-RS], the constitutional revision rapporteur, concerning  the re-election of the president and ending the need to resign  from one office in order to run for another public office. The  proposal to shorten the deadline for resigning from office is  just a move of PMDB and PFL [Liberal Front Party] governors, and  I am against it.    Covas, leader in the race for the Sao Paulo governorship  according to public opinion polls, is in favor of alliances. He  nonetheless believes the grassroots will expect the party to  field its own candidate. He thinks it will be difficult to  enter into alliance with the PMDB on account of Quercia's  candidacy and the race in Sao Paulo. Covas rules out the  possibility of reaching an agreement with the PFL.    This agreement with the PFL, which some members of Cardoso's  team and some congressmen from both parties wish would come  true, is only a dream because of the dispute between PSDB  members and "Carlists" -- followers of Bahia Governor Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes.    Salvador Mayor Lidice da Matta said: I do not believe in  this  alliance which goes against the PSDB platform and the tradition  of its members.    The PSDB has registered the greatest expansion since the  last  elections. It moreover has a charm that enables us to compete  in the elections at all levels and throughout the whole country,  she stated, adding that instead of an alliance with the PFL, she  considers the party is much closer to the PT [Workers Party].</p>

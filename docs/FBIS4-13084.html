			<p>BFN     [Text] The commerce minister has strongly justified India  signing the new GATT deal, saying the opposition stand is based  on narrow partisan considerations. Mr. Pranab Mukherji, who  returned to New Delhi from Marrakesh this morning, said there is  no rationale in the demand for opting out of the global trading  system. He pointed out that 20 more countries want to join the  new trade agreement in addition to the 125 countries which are  signatories to it.</p>

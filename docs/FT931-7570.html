			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Argentina to close debt deal in April THE Argentine government will conclude an accord with international bank creditors on April 7, said Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine economy minister, and Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, in New York yesterday. Citibank heads Argentina's bank advisory committee. Argentina will conclude the deal by exchanging two types of new concessional bonds for the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) in bank loans held by more than 750 creditors. Creditors holding 99 per cent of the debt have already signed the debt accord, which was agreed in principle last April 7. Argentina will also issue Dollars 8bn of new bonds covering interest arrears, but they will be placed in an escrow account until the claims from creditors for past due interest are fully reconciled.</p>

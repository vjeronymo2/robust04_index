			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong stabilises as Tokyo turns round A break in the yen's appreciation against the dollar supported the futures market and the Nikkei index gained ground for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Buying by arbitrageurs and public funds lifted the 225 average by 130.82 to close at the day's high of 20,511.60. It hit a low of 20,311.96 in the morning session, but revived on buying by public pension and insurance funds. Futures traders were encouraged by the Bank of Japan buying dollars. Meanwhile cross trading - the selling and buying back of stocks to realise profits without changing the portfolio - among corporate investors and banks before the September book closing also lifted activity. Volume totalled 273.6m shares against 192m. However, other than domestic institutions buying back some steel and electrical stocks, there was a lack of investment demand. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.91 to 1,638.70 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.35 to 298.35. Gainers led losers by 565 to 423 with 193 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.55 to 1,329.78. Steel makers were higher with Nippon Steel up Y8 to Y370. Some electronic makers and high-technology companies, which had been hit by the yen's rise, picked up. NEC gained Y20 to Y1,180 and Ricoh added Y12 to Y955. In contrast, Toshiba lost Y7 to Y733 on profit-taking and Hitachi, although traded actively, remained unchanged at Y978. TDK, the tape maker, sank Y110 to Y4,270 on reports of a fall in quarterly earnings. Drugs stocks were higher. Takeda Chemical advanced Y10 to Y1,260 and Mochida Pharmaceutical gained Y110 to Y2,250. Stocks traded actively on cross-trading included Nikko Securities, which rose Y10 to Y1,170, Nissan Motor, up Y3 to Y783 and Daiei, which added Y20 to Y1,760. DDI, the telecom company listed on the second section, gained Y46,000 to Y960,000 on bargain-hunting. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 30.63 to 22,810.31 in volume of 56m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y40 to Y4,880. Roundup Hong Kong stabilised after Tuesday's sharp drop while other markets slid back after profit-taking. HONG KONG erased early weakness following Tuesday's disappointing land auction with a late round of bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index closed 4.63 higher at 9,238.69 after a morning low of 9,130.07. Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 3.67bn, up from Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 3.17bn. But brokers said sentiment remained wary before today's interim profit announcements from Cheung Kong, the property developer, and the conglomerate, Hutchison. The H-share index, tracking Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, rose 13.11 or 1.10 per cent to 1,206.21. SINGAPORE slipped as participants continued to book profits following recent gains. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 24.06 to 2,278.82 as 299.7m shares changed hands. Malaysian shares traded over the counter were also under pressure, with the UOB-OTC index shedding 9.28 to 1,248.97. Brokers said that the OTC market was affected by unsubstantiated rumours, including possible resignations by Malaysia's transport minister and the chief minister of Malacca. Singapore Press Holdings rose 50 cents to SDollars 27.00 after issuing 13m new foreign shares. News of a 71-per cent jump in pre-tax profit at mid-term boosted Cycle &amp; Carriage 10 cents to SDollars 11.30. KUALA LUMPUR saw its heaviest trading in six months as volume rose to 593m shares. But blue chips failed to keep pace with speculative stocks and the KLSE composite index closed 4.78 lower at 1,141.57 as investors took profits. TAIPEI finished off its highs as profit-takers moved in but financial shares benefited from strong buying late in the day. The weighted index closed 63.95 better at 6,862.14 as turnover rose to TDollars 100.3bn from Tuesday's TDollars 87.56bn.</p>

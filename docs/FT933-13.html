			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (33): How a giant keeps growing - Profile, RPG Enterprises TWO big business houses grew at a phenomenal rate during the period of government controls. Reliance and RPG Enterprises both had close links with the ruling party. But they developed differently. Reliance set up new industries, but has had difficulties with its only takeover - of the engineering and cement giant Larsen &amp; Toubro. RPG Enterprises, however, grew largely by acquisitions. Its leading subsidiaries - Ceat, Calcutta Electric, Harrisons Malayalam, Searle, KEC International and International Computers - were all acquired through takeovers. RPG Enterprises, headed by 63 year-old Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, raised its turnover to Rs31bn in the year to March 1993 from Rs800m in 1979-80. Mr Sanjiv Goenka, the vice chairman, admits that not all RPG's takeovers were wise. 'But in the highly regulated regime, we wanted to grab all the opportunities that came our way. Otherwise, we could not have grown at this rate.' Remington Rand, which makes typewriters and telephones, and Gramophone Company have proved disappointing acquisitions. With their low turnover and mounting losses, they have not been an asset to India's fifth largest business house. It is now trying to sell Remington, but says it will retain Gramophone Company for 'emotional reasons' and because of its 'very rich repertoire of music built for nearly a century'. 'Except for certain aberrations, our takeover of companies has followed a pattern', says Mr Sanjiv Goenka. 'The corporate strategy has been to strengthen our presence in automotive tyre, thermal power, chemicals and infotech through acquisition and also by setting up of new units.' Calcutta Electric supplies electricity in the Calcutta region. The group also owns KEC International, the world's second largest builder of electricity pylons, and Asian Cables which makes high tension power lines. It also has a power consultancy. RPG Enterprises has similarly integrated its business connected with tyres, of which it is a leading manufacturer. It produces all the major tyre components, including rubber, nylon cord and carbon black. In the new deregulated business climate, says Mr Goenka, RPG Enterprises 'will seek growth where it already has a critical mass. Similarly, it will strike out in new fields if only there are prospects for creating a critical mass.' That is why it decided to sell its holding in India Polyfibres, a small player in polyester staple fibres, and also two small electronic units in Kashmir. The group, which thinks its turnover could reach Rs100bn by the turn of the century, is giving 'maximum attention' to the development of new coal fired power stations. Calcutta Electric is to build a 500MW plant at Budge Budge and a 1,500MW complex at Balagarh at a total cost of Rs60bn. Its interest in power is not going to be confined to West Bengal. It has bid for the Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking, a government unit which is to be privatised. 'We are also going to set up a 250MW power station at Chandel in Bihar. We have proved ourselves to be an efficient producer of power and we are not afraid of foreign competition,' says Mr Goenka. The group also claims to be internationally competitive in tyres. 'Ceat, which is among the top 20 tyre companies in the world, is a large exporter of tyres to the US and Europe. This would not be possible unless our prices and quality are right,' says Mr Goenka. RPG would have been even stronger had it not lost control of Dunlop India, in October 1988, to Mr Manu Chhabria, a non-resident Indian industrialist with whom it had managed the company jointly for four years. But RPG is not sorry that its petrochemical projects in West and Tamil Nadu did not take off. With import restrictions lifted, their viability was doubtful. For the same reason, the group pulled out of a nuclear medicine project. 'We cannot look up to the government for protection. Before we make any investment, we must be sure that we can withstand foreign competition. After all, the government will further reduce the import duty,' RPG says. As part of a rationalisation policy, it has started looking abroad. It has recently commissioned a tyre plant in Sri Lanka where it also manages two plantation companies. The group has been invited to manage rubber estates in Vietnam and is to set up a task force to take advantage of business opportunities in China. But RPG Enterprises will restrict itself to areas where it has the expertise.</p>

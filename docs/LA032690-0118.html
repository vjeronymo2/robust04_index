			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOXER PASSES UP MATCH FOR OUTSIDE FRACAS  </P> <P> The bell had just started for the beginning of the third and final round when  boxer Geoff McCreesh saw another fight erupt just outside the ring.  </P> <P> He couldn't resist it.  </P> <P> McCreesh leaped into the front row of the seats to join in the brawl.  </P> <P> "There was a disturbance going on in the crowd and the next thing, he just  dived straight over the ropes and into the public at ringside," said Peter  Blenkinsopp, secretary of the Midlands division of Britain's Amateur Boxing  Association. "I've never seen anything like it."  </P> <P> ABA officials began an investigation Monday into what prompted the second  unconventional conclusion to a British bout in six months.  </P> <P> In September, professional light-heavyweight Steve McCarthy was floored by the  mother of opponent Tony Wilson. Minna Wilson climbed into the ring during the  third round and clobbered McCarthy with her high-heeled shoe. The fighter need  three head stitches.  </P> <P> In Saturday's incident at Longbridge, a suburb of this English midlands town,  McCreesh was quickly grabbed by his cornermen after abandoning his amateur  welterweight fight, a national semifinal, against Robert McCracken.  </P> <P> He was ushered back into the ring but the damage was done. McCreesh was  disqualified.  </P> <P> Newspaper reports said the crowd disturbance may have involved McCreesh's  father and supporters of McCracken, a local Birmingham fighter. Officials said  that whoever caused it, McCreesh was still out of order.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying it was anybody's fault, but I would blame the boy for leaving,  whatever the provocation," Blenkinsopp said. "He should have been sticking to  his job."  </P> <P> Neither McCreesh nor McCracken were available for comment.  </P></p>

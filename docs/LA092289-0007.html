			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING UP FOR ZSA ZSA;  </P> <P> WOMAN TESTIFIES SHE THOUGHT SAME OFFICER 'WOULD KILL' HER  </P> <P> The defense in the police officer-slapping trial of Zsa Zsa Gabor presented its  star witness Thursday, a Virginia woman who tearfully testified that she was  roughed up by the same Beverly Hills cop Gabor is accused of assaulting.  </P> <P> "I thought he would kill me," Melanie Yonkers of Alexandria, Va., said,  referring to her October, 1988, encounter with Officer Paul Kramer.  </P> <P> Yonkers said she was pulled over by the motorcycle officer after her 2  1/2-year-old daughter, Lacy, had "slithered" out of her car seat and was  sticking her head out a back window.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Threw Me'  </P> <P> The witness said that, after she refused to sign a citation for failing to  strap her daughter in the car seat, Kramer "grabbed my arms and threw me  against the back of the car and handcuffed me."  </P> <P> At that point, Yonkers said, her daughter became traumatized and began crying.  </P> <P> "Every time my daughter sees a police officer or hears a siren, she says, 'Is  that mean man going to take mommy away?' " said Yonkers, who flew to California  at her own expense "to try to set the record straight about how abusive this  man is."  </P> <P> Yonkers, the sister-in-law of Hollywood executive Michael Medavoy of Orion  Pictures, said she refused to sign the citation because she was in the process  of moving to Virginia and Kramer told her she would be required to stay in  California to appear in court.  </P> <P> Yonkers, sobbing throughout her testimony in Beverly Hills Municipal Court,  described the 6-foot-4 Kramer as "very abrasive, arrogant and smug."  </P> <P> Gabor's lawyer, William Graysen, had been heralding Yonkers as his star  witness, and her testimony was intended to support Gabor's assertion that  Kramer roughed her up after stopping her for a routine traffic violation June  14.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, a doctor testified that he was thrown to the ground by  Kramer after he was pulled over for speeding in 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pattern Alleged  </P> <P> Graysen has said he would present testimony from several other people who have  had run-ins with Kramer to illustrate a pattern of "abuse" by the veteran  officer.  </P> <P> Gabor, who has admitted that she slapped Kramer but only in self-defense,  completed her third day of testimony Thursday.  </P> <P> After advising Judge Charles Rubin that she had a "terrible headache," the  Hungarian-born glamour queen spent only a few minutes on the witness stand,  sipping water and taking deep breaths throughout.  </P> <P> She again charged that Kramer called her an "(expletive) whore" during the  altercation and acknowledged that she responded by using the same expletive,  because "I learned it from your wonderful Police Department."  </P></p>

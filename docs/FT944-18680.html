			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Hospital offers land in return for services A leading London hospital plans to give away land and buildings on its prestigious Chelsea site to private bidders willing to develop and run hospital services. The proposal, by the Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital Trust, is one of the most novel responses to government calls for more private finance in the National Health Service. Private consortia have been invited to finance and build a Pounds 20m second phase of the hospital's redevelopment programme, housing outpatients' clinics and research departments. An unusual feature of the proposal is a requirement that the development consortium will also have to run a range of the hospital's support services - including catering, domestic and off-site laboratories - for seven years, and manage its 28-bed private-patient unit. The idea generated bids from 14 private-sector consortia. These have been reduced to four, and the hospital's board is due to select a partner with which it will enter detailed negotiations on October 11. Formal government approval will then be required but ministers are already aware of the plan. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said in June that involving the private sector offered the NHS real advantages and could improve services for patients. Some potential private-sector partners, however, accuse senior NHS managers and officials of showing unnecessary caution towards joint ventures, and the Royal Brompton proposal is regarded as an important test of the health department's willingness to endorse imaginative schemes. The successful bidder's payment will be the opportunity to redevelop a redundant clinical building and nurses home - located in one of the capital's most sought-after residential areas - and part of the hospital's phase-two site bordering King's Road, Chelsea. Construction groups submitting bids include George Wimpey, Tarmac and Sir Robert McAlpine. The plan to transfer the support services - which cost around Pounds 5m a year - to the private sector as part of the deal has brought construction groups and property developers into partnership with contract-service organisations. Mr Bill Bain, Royal Brompton chief executive, said: 'We aim to achieve the expansion of the hospital at no cost to the taxpayer, hopefully doing so in a way which will improve overall efficiency and enable us to lower our prices in the NHS internal market.' The hospital has engaged Newchurch, venture management consultants, and Hambros Bank to help develop its plans. Mr Bain acknowledged that critics might fear the Royal Brompton risked disposing of valuable sites too cheaply. But he added: 'We are not commercially naive. The hospital management is taking top quality advice.'</p>

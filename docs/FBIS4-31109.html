			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister for Privatization Milan Janicin by </F> Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not given: "HZDS Privatization  Methods Cannot Be Used"]    [Text] Milan Janicin, deputy chairman of the National  Democratic Party [NDS], was entrusted with the post of minister  of privatization. He spoke with the Bratislava reporter of  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY about how he envisions his management of the  ministry.    [Zabojnik] What were the conditions in the ministry when you  took it over?    [Janicin] I'll repeat what I already said in response to an  American journalist's question: What I appreciate about my  predecessors is the fact that they did not succeed in alienating  or firing all the able people in this ministry.    [Zabojnik] Have you also found some things about your  predecessors that were on the borderline of legality, or even  went beyond it in the feverish privatization before the change  of government?    [Janicin] They may have been on the borderline, but in  Slovakia there is still concern that some residuals may be  brought back to life. People are still afraid and do not want to  testify on certain matters. For example, I know without a doubt  that in the case of the Piestany Spa there existed or still  exists a silent partnership agreement concerning two former  members of the government and one high legislative official. But  I cannot make their names public because they refused to turn  over a copy of the agreement to me.    [Zabojnik] What would give courage to people who have  information not to keep silent and furnish the evidence?    [Janicin] I am convinced that after the elections, when it  will be clear to everybody that Meciar will not be forming a new  government, the evidence will see the light of day.    [Zabojnik] As far as methods are concerned, you took over as  a kind of legacy the emphasis on employee-owned corporations and  more or less a distaste for the voucher system of privatization.  What concept do you intend to apply?    [Janicin] The management in those enterprises established in  some instances the so-called employee-owned corporations. With  various promises and sometimes even with pressure they obtained  signatures of the other workers in the enterprise. Following the  political line of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  and later also of the Slovak National Party [SNS] they made  every effort to acquire the property. Then in the populist  style "sold" it to the employees and these were the famous  employee-owned corporations. As far as the voucher privatization  is concerned, the method was declared marginal, because  according to the HZDS the shares would have been sold below  price in view of the weak Slovak resources, and according to  that line of thinking foreign capital would easily gain control  over the Slovak economy. Therefore, for example according to Mr.  Huska, it is necessary to first and foremost enable Slovak  entrepreneurs to acquire property in the privatization. I admit  that for a certain time even I was, so to speak, blinded by such  thinking. But when one ponders this matter, and most of all when  one saw how it was being realized in practice, when for example  the Vrutky Railroad Repair Shops with a book value of 950  million korunas were to be sold for 120 million to party  followers of the HZDS and the SNS, one's thinking necessarily  had to change.    [Zabojnik] What conclusion do you draw from it for your  specific course of action as minister?    [Janicin] I came to the conclusion that for Slovakia coupon  privatization is at present obviously the quickest method for  transforming ownership. Moreover, credit resources here are so  exhausted that it would not be logical to use them to change the  ownership structure. And there are also the social aspects.  Coupon privatization is a certain positive step toward the  social sphere. It is also related to the need for political  stability in Slovakia, without which we shall not be able to  join the developed countries. Therefore we can no longer afford  any more experiments a la the HZDS.</p>

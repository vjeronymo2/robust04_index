			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAS in joint venture with Cambodian carrier Malaysia Airlines (MAS) says it is forming a joint venture with Royal Air Cambodge (RAC), the Cambodian carrier, which could involve taking up an equity stake, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Tajudin Ramli, the Malaysian entrepreneur who gained control of MAS earlier this year through a highly-leveraged MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 691m) deal, said the joint venture with RAC would be similar to one recently formed between MAS and Air Maldives. Under that agreement Air Maldives is leasing an Airbus A300 with crew from MAS. Mr Tajudin has said that MAS intends to take a 49 per cent stake in Air Maldives and turn it into a fully-fledged international carrier.</p>

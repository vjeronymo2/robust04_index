			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Rengui (6392 0088 6311): "People's </F> Congress Deputies Discuss in Groups the `Government Work  Report'; Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Gyaincain Norbu Participate in  Discussions"]    [Text] Reform, development, and stability became the focal  points of heated discussions by deputies during the second  session of the sixth regional people's congress. Yesterday,  deputies began discussing in groups the "Government Work Report"  delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu.    Deputies Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Gyaincain Norbu arrived at  the conference center early in the morning [of 16 May]. They  participated in discussions and attentively listened to other  deputies' speeches.    At a group discussion held by the Lhasa city delegation,  when  the delegation convener invited Comrade Chen Kuiyuan to take the  floor, the latter said laughingly: "I am just an ordinary  deputy. Let everyone express his or her views." At group  discussions of the Nagqu and Xigaze delegations, Comrades Raidi  and Gyaincain Norbu attentively listened to the deputies' views  on the "Report," added remarks during the deputies' speech from  time to time, and earnestly took notes. When reporters were  present as visitors at group discussions of Nyingchi, Qamdo,  Ngari, Shannan, and People's Liberation Army delegations, they  noticed deputies of these delegations unanimously maintained  that the 20-character principle -- "Seize the Opportunity,  Deepen Reform, Open Up Wider, Promote Development, and Maintain  Stability" -- decided upon by the central authorities had been  conscientiously implemented and had produced concrete results in  Tibet. It was also embodied in the entire "Report." Deputy  Kong Qinghua, from Maizhokunggar County said: It is a realistic  "report" without any exaggerations or empty words, and has a  high possibility of being put into operation.    Deputy Caiwang Bandian, of Xigaze Prefecture, explained the  economic development and stability enjoyed by Tibet as a result  of reform and opening up and in light of Xigaze's actual  conditions. He deeply felt that 1994 is, indeed, a very crucial  year. He said: The "Report" affirmed the main aspects, and  found out the problems that Tibet needs to solve badly. It has  new ideas and proposes many measures. The crux of the matter  lies in implementation.    Deputies believed we must focus attention on improving  peasants' and herdsmen's income in our endeavor to promote  economic development at agricultural and pastoral areas. The  "Report's" plan in this respect conforms to Tibetan realities.  The crux of the matter lies in doing a good job of propaganda  and explanation to win the understanding and support of the  masses as well as their participation. The establishment of a  market system, enterprises' "transformation of operating  mechanisms," education, trained personnel, exploitation of  resources, grain circulation, and foreign trade were also hot  points of deputies' discussions.    The special importance of stability in Tibet was a topic to  which deputies paid very close attention. They believed the  third part of the "Report" offered a clear, definite, and  specific explanation on how to create a favorable social  environment to ensure the smooth progress of reform and  development. Deputies suggested that emphasis be laid on the  grass roots when carrying out the work of maintaining stability,  and that all problems be resolutely addressed in the bud while  efforts are made to do a good job of propaganda and guidance.</p>

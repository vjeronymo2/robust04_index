			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Motoring: Audi breaks the mould - The A8's conservative styling disguises its many technological treats. Stuart Marshall takes it for a drive on the autobahn and finds it quiet and nimble Audi's new 4.2-litre V8 engined A8 luxury car breaks a number of moulds. Its structure is entirely of light alloy, not the usual pressed steel. It is neither front nor rear-wheel driven but a quattro - the 300 horsepower 4.2-litre V8 engine drives all four wheels. The transmission is Tiptronic, like that fitted to the Porsche 911 Carrera I enthused about two weeks ago. A driver may treat it as fully automatic or use it as a four-speed manual gearbox on which clutchless changes are made instantly, under full power if desired. As if that were not enough, the A8 also has a traction control system. Should the combination of an insensitive right foot and a low grip road surface provoke any of the four driven wheels into losing grip - say when restarting on an icy hill - electronic differential locking stifles wheelspin. The side windows are double glazed; but there is nothing trendy or new fangled about the interior. A typical Jaguar or, for that matter, Bentley owner would feel perfectly at home, cosseted by the soft leather seats and plentiful wood veneer. From the outside, the A8 driver has little idea what a high-technological treat is in store. There is nothing wrong with the A8's styling, though there is nothing exceptional about it, either. I detected a lot of Audi 100 and overtones of Lexus LS400 - the car, incidentally, that Audi's development engineers used as their benchmark for silence and refinement. (Yes, I know the Lexus is Japanese but it was designed to look uncannily like the result of a coupling between the last Mercedes S-Class and the still current - but only just - BMW 7-Series). When driving the A8 in Germany last week it was the silence that impressed me first. Turn the key, and the only clue that the V8 engine is running is a slight movement of the rev counter needle. With the Tiptronic selector in automatic, I headed out of Stuttgart on a mercifully uncrowded autobahn. Slight pressure on the accelerator and the A8 surged forward, the transmission shifting almost imperceptibly until moving into top at around 70mph / 112kph. (Audi's claimed 0-62mph / 0-100kph in 7.3 seconds should be obtainable on wet or dry roads.) The rustle of wind around the door mirrors at 100 mph / 161kph became more noticeable at 125mph / 201kph but only because engine and road-induced tyre noise was minimal. Top speed is a governed 155mph / 250kph. The all-aluminium alloy construction saves weight; the A8 is about 200kg lighter than it would have been if made of steel. Clearly, this helps fuel consumption. A British driver who stays within sight of motorway speed limits and does not spend too much time in city centres or on very short journeys should see around 21-22mpg (13.45-12.84 l / 100km). It has to be said that most big cars feel fine on an autobahn. But the A8, in spite of its size, was exceptionally nimble on country roads. It handled more like a small and sporting car than a full five-seat luxury saloon with a huge boot. One of the benefits of quattro transmission, which spreads engine power among all four wheels, is that a car's balance is unaffected by hard acceleration. Heavy snow had fallen a few days earlier and was still heaped up by the side of the schwarzswaldhochstrasse but, alas, the surface was mainly dry. It would have been interesting to assess the A8's security in arctic conditions. I doubt that any high-performance luxury saloon with only two-wheel drive could match its driving security. When the A8 V8 reaches Britain in September, it is likely to cost about Pounds 46,000. But a 2.8-litre V6 version with front-wheel drive and a choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission will be much cheaper. At about Pounds 34,000 it will be an ultra-roomy Jaguar alternative, still extraordinarily quiet if not quite as sibilant as the double-glazed V8. An electronically controlled differential prevents unruliness by curbing wheelspin if one front tyre is on a high grip surface, the other on lower grip, when the driver accelerates. It is not quite so fast as the 4.2-litre  -the maximum is 140mph / 225kph, a matter of academic interest to most of us - and the automatic is three seconds slower from 0-62mph / 100kph than the Tiptronic V8. The manual gearbox 2.8-litre A8 I drove would be an improbable choice for British business motorists, most of whom sensibly prefer automatics. (Second-hand luxury cars with manual transmission are very hard to sell in Britain). Its V6 engine was silky at high speeds, still smooth in top at low revolutions. Although its 178 horsepower output might seem on the low side for so big a car, the A8's relatively low weight compensates. Although all Audi dealers in the UK can handle the A8, most of the 400 to 500 cars Audi expects to sell in a full year will be bought from 60 dealerships in metropolitan areas. Although aluminium space-frame construction demands different repair techniques, Audi says any of its approved bodyshops should be able to handle 90 per cent of accident damaged cars. Only those with severe structural damage will have to go to one of three A8 specialist sites.</p>

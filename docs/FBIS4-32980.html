			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 31  May.    The Central Bank of Honduras has ordered private banks to  transfer 50 percent of the foreign exchange they receive from  export transactions to the Central Bank. This measure will  worsen the liquidity situation experienced by the Honduran  private banks. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1847 GMT 25 May 94)    The Honduran Government on 26 May ordered a freeze on the  price of all petroleum byproducts. The measure is aimed at  ensuring that distributors do not arbitrarily increase the price  of these products. The freeze will continue in effect until  further notice.

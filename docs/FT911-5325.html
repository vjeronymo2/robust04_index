			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / No European defence identity without Nato Defence is being dragged into the discussions about European union. Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and others have proposed in recent weeks that the European Community should have its own defence policy. There is a creeping belief that the debate on a common foreign and security policy is empty unless it extends to include defence. A foreign policy without a military element is a policy of gestures, runs the argument. Advocates of change in Europe's defence must answer the question: 'Why not Nato?' For 40 years Nato has provided the peace in which we Europeans have built our prosperity and political unity. We have had these benefits cheaply. We Europeans provided much of the perseverance and the men. Our American partners provided much of the money and the nuclear guarantee which made Europe's defence credible. Stability was - and is - Nato's gift to western Europe, a stable environment in which to make adventurous political and business choices. In the east, instability is now the greatest threat. In managing their transition to new political arrangements, East as well as west needs Nato. The east Europeans tell us that Nato continues to underpin the stability of the whole continent. We should not be tempted into tossing Nato aside casually, just because the east Europeans have forcefully thrown away the Warsaw Pact. We need Nato. It is tried by the west Europeans; it is trusted by the Americans; it is respected by the east Europeans. But Europe has changed for the better, and Nato must match those changes. Nato needs a stronger European input. The 12 are making progress towards European union and Europe is seeking a bigger role through a common foreign and security policy. Europeans now realise that their security is affected by problems beyond Europe, in neighbouring areas like the Middle East, not just by adversaries within Europe. America has reviewed its global strategy in the light of Soviet withdrawal and is making reductions in its ground forces stationed in Europe. Both the US and Europe recognise the continued need for Nato. The question is how a stronger European input should be developed and how it should relate to collective defence in Nato? This is the nub of three inter-locking debates: in the European Community's inter-governmental conference, the Western European Union and the Nato strategy review. Parallel progress must be made. The prize is a new arrangement to bring together the European union and the renewed Atlantic alliance to guarantee a strong political partnership and maintain as effective a collective defence as we have had in the past. There is a case for a stronger European defence identity. Defence consciousness among Europeans is a good thing; and it is time a more mature and affluent Europe not only made its voice heard but also pulled its weight in the alliance and western defence. Our approach in the inter-governmental conference is to say: 'Let us be European but let us not be arrogant or unrealistic.' Nato must be an integral part of the future defence of Europe. It provides irreplaceable elements in our security, not just for the time being but permanently. We need to work out in detail how the alliance, the European input and European union will be linked. Inter-dependence, not exclusivity, is the key. An approach which emphasised the separateness of Europe would seriously weaken our real security. The argument that Europe must be united and sovereign, that structures should be created to bring that about, is seductive - at first sight. But, in defence, is the ultimate goal of a European union standing by itself what we really want or need? In defence, it does not follow that binding procedures designed to enforce a common policy would make us react more effectively. Where would the European military contribution to the Gulf crisis have been if formal voting procedures had been required? Defence involves supreme national interests unsuited to the hazards of majority voting; national freedom of action is still important. The Community already has one neutral member and may have others in future. Nato has been successful in providing western defence. The US has been vital to Nato's success; the EC cannot hope to maintain such a strong link. All these limits on a Community role still hold true. Moreover, the sovereignty of the 12 is not absolute in defence. The transatlantic community will continue to be important to us, whether we like it or not. The 12 could not guarantee its own security in a continent which includes a military superpower in the form of the Soviet Union. The costs of self-sufficiency in Europe would be astronomic. We could not acquire satellites, heavy-lift capability and the rest of the necessary high-tech paraphernalia overnight. Despite the force of all these arguments, some claim there is a need to build up the European defence identity because the US might withdraw. I see no evidence of a US wish to disengage. But the surest way to bring that about would be for Europeans to treat Nato as an alliance of last resort while shifting their effort elsewhere. Practicality and principle will have to be reconciled in the end. Britain's proposals show a way forward. We agree that the construction of an integrated Europe must include security and defence. But European defence without the United States does not make sense. The common foreign and security policy should include some broad security issues (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, arms control and non-proliferation, for example) but it should not compete with the military tasks in Nato. A mechanism to ensure co-ordination between common foreign and security policy and Nato will be crucial. The Western European Union is in our view the answer most likely for European co-ordination within the alliance and as the defence arm of the union. This re-invigorated WEU would need an operational capability. It would be complementary to Nato. It would give Europe both more influence within Nato and the capacity to respond with the US to world events. The WEU helped to co-ordinate European forces in the Gulf. It is now helping to get humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees. We could build on the WEU's experience in the Gulf when looking at how a European military role could be further developed. A European Rapid Reaction Force for use outside the Nato area would be logical and compatible with Nato's responsibilities to defend Nato territory. In practice WEU forces and staffs will inevitably be drawn from units and personnel also assigned to Nato roles. They could come under either Nato or WEU commands, depending on the contingency with which they were dealing. Nato's own force and command structures will need to be adapted to reflect a greater European voice and input. With fewer total resources the case for integration is stronger than ever. In the new Europe, with Nato linked via the WEU to the defence of the union, I see no reason why all allies should not be equally and fully involved. I would like to see our French and Spanish friends engaged in renovating the alliance's structure and command arrangements. Renewing the alliance and deciding how European defence should be strengthened are two of our most important tasks in 1991 - they are two sides of the same coin. Britain has put forward many ideas which are both constructive and realistic. It is vital for the future safe defence of our continent that we get the outcome right.</p>

[number as published] My Budget this year will once again  reflect the solid performance of the economy and its robust  prospects for the year ahead. 1993 was the 27th successive year  in which the economy grew in real terms since the start of the  GDP figures in 1966. A whole generation has grown up in our  community which has never known anything other than unbroken  economic expansion. It is a staggering fact that GDP per head  has more than trebled in real terms since 1970. [passage  omitted]  <H3>  The Economy  1993 Performance </H3>   8. I turn now to our economic performance and prospects. In  1993, Hong Kong's economy once again performed handsomely. We  achieved a satisfactory growth rate of 5.5 percent in real  terms. I say satisfactory because this is a good level of  growth for an economy as mature as ours. We are not rising from  a low economic base, as are many of our neighbours. We are now  a service-based economy, and what we have to offer is our  expertise, not low-wage factory labour.    Our role in the Asian economic miracle is to provide the  expertise which countries in the region need in order to raise  their own standards of living. I will have more to say about  this later this afternoon, when I describe the remarkable  transformation which has been achieved over the last fifteen  years.    A transformation which has taken us to an advanced service  economy based increasingly on our skills in management, design,  marketing, finance and communications.    9. Let me start by giving you the basic facts of how well we  did last year.    -- As I said, GDP grew by 5.5 percent in real terms, the  fastest increase since 1988.    -- GDP per head in 1993 reached US$18,500.    -- Total exports grew by 13 percent in real terms, led by  re-  exports.    -- Exports of services grew by 8 percent in real terms.    -- Inflation retreated still further, to 8.5 percent for the  year (compared with 9.4 percent in 1992).    -- Median household income grew in real terms by 3.8  percent.    -- Unemployment remained at around 2 percent, a very low  level by any international standard.    10. In producing this performance, I have no doubt that the  business community has been looking beyond current political  controversies to the long-term growth potential of both Hong  Kong and China, and indeed to the promising economic outlook for  the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.    This bullish attitude affects foreign investors too. For  example, investment from around the world has continued to flow  into our asset markets, and more foreign companies continue to  establish their presence here in Hong Kong.  1994 Prospects    11. 1993, in short, was a very good year, and we have no  reason to be any less confident about our prospects for 1994. I  say this because the factors which led to last year's success  will persist, while recent developments in the world economy  offer additional encouragement.    -- The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has  boosted  trade potential and blunted protectionist pressure.    -- Prospects in our major overseas markets have improved.  The U.S. and UK economies are set to grow by around 3 percent  in the year ahead.    -- Even more important for Hong Kong, the Chinese economy  should have little difficulty in continuing to achieve an annual  growth of about 10 percent in real terms.    -- Our other neighbours in East Asia are likely to maintain  their dynamic growth, with trade within the region expanding by  around 15 percent in 1994.    12. We have entered 1994, then, in better shape than we  might have expected. Inevitably, however, we also face some  uncertainties. The annual battle for the renewal of China's MFN  status in the United States will have to be fought yet again.  Hong Kong must hope that politics is not allowed to damage this  important trading relationship. For our part, we shall do all  we can to emphasise to our friends in Washington the importance  of trade between China and the United States.    We will go on arguing that politics should not be allowed to  damage trade.    13. This is not only a matter of Hong Kong's self-interest,  although this is clearly a key factor. And for good reason. We  estimate that failure to renew MFN would slash Hong Kong's GDP  growth by up to three percentage points, and employment by up to  75,000 jobs.    But there are wider issues at stake too. It is trade which  generates growth, the growth essential for economic and social  progress. The avoidance of trade discrimination -- the  encouragement of a level playing field and the virtues of free  trade -- are aims which underlie the GATT. It is for this  reason also that China's wish to rejoin the GATT is of such  significance.    14. Another factor bearing on our prospects for 1994 will  be the success of the Chinese Government in managing high rates  of economic growth while avoiding serious overheating. The  Chinese Government has recognised the dangers of inflation and  has announced measures to deal with it. We must hope that these  measures are successful.    15. In producing our forecasts for the coming year, while we  have to bear in mind these downside risks, we must also give due  weight to our underlying strengths. For 1994, I am forecasting:    -- GDP growth in real terms will again reach 5.5 percent,    -- GDP per head will reach some US$20,600,    -- Total trade will increase by around 17 percent in real  terms, and    -- Inflation will keep to an average of around 8.5 percent.    16. The continuing development of the Chinese economy  matters considerably to the whole international community. But  to us in Hong Kong, it is increasingly the key to our future  economic success. Through servicing and investing in China, we  continue to find new markets for our expertise in manufacturing,  marketing, banking, communications, tourism and professional  services.    17. Already, we play a vital and increasing role in China's  economic modernization.    -- China accounted for 35 percent of our total external  trade  in 1993.    -- Hong Kong accounted for around two-thirds of total  external investment in China. In turn, China is probably the  largest external investor in Hong Kong.    18. The relationship is not simply about the flows of goods  and services. There is also an enormous flow of people.    -- Hong Kong residents made no less than 23 million visits  to  Chinese destinations in 1993.    -- In addition, nearly 2 million foreign visitors used Hong  Kong as their gateway to China.    -- There were 7.4 million road crossings by cars and  lorries.    -- Hong Kong handled 34,000 flights to and from China.    19. But this momentum is our trade and traffic with China  cannot be taken for granted. It has to be nurtured. As I shall  describe later, it is crucial that we continue to develop our  road, rail, air and sea links with Guangdong province, and the  rest of China. We must match the flows of people, trade and  investment with the infrastructure to support them. [passage  omitted]  <H3>  Challenges Ahead  Air and Sea Links </H3>   48. It is vital that we forge ahead with our airport and  port development, if Hong Kong's growth is to be sustained  beyond 1997, and with it the growth of southern China. Latest  indications are that both air and container traffic are  increasing faster than previous forecasts had anticipated.    49. It is painfully clear that Kai Tak is an airport working  beyond its capacity, despite the considerable improvements being  made. Even if you never travel, but are one of the 300,000 or  so people living nearby, Kai Tak is becoming a more and more  noisy neighbour to live with.    50. The economic benefits of the new airport can best be  described by looking at what Hong Kong would stand to lose if we  did not have the new airport in 1997. Economic losses would be  HK$3 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in the first year after 1997,  another HK$6 billion in the following year and a massive HK$10  billion the year after that.    51. We shall do all we reasonably can in dialogue with the  Chinese Government to ensure that the expansion of the container  port and the financing of the Airport Core Programme can proceed  as swiftly as we would all wish. It is because of these  economic benefits, and the good financial position we now find  ourselves in, that we made our fourth financing proposal to  address the Chinese Government's concerns. I shall refer again  to this proposal in discussing the Medium Range Forecast.  The Land Links    52. Every day, more than 20,000 goods vehicles pass through  the border crossing points. The figure is growth by about 15  percent a year. This traffic is the life blood of our economic  growth. But the road arteries are becoming increasingly clogged  by a volume of vehicles far beyond what they were designed to  handle.    53. As I have explain in previous Budgets, we must invest  heavily in improvements to the road and rail links which serve  our trade, tourism and investment in China, as well as the  everyday needs of our population. Much work is already in hand.    -- In September this year, the Yen Long Southern Bypass will  be completed at a cost of HK$400 million. This will bring more  relief to the Western New Territories.    -- In August, we shall be awarding the HK$3.7 billion  construction contract for the Ting Kau Bridge. When it opens in  mid-1997, traffic will be able to bypass the container port and  its bottlenecks in Kwai Chung.    -- By the end of this year, we hope to award the franchise  to  construct and operate the Country Park Section of Route 3. When  it comes into operation in late 1998, it will provide a fast new  route linking the border, the container port and the urban areas.    -- We have reached agreement in principle with the Chinese  authorities to open the Lok Ma Chau crossing point round the  clock, for implementation, we hope, in the first half of this  year. Meanwhile two additional channels have just been opened.    -- A major expansion of the Lowu Station will be completed  early next year at a cost of HK$280 million.    54. Much of the cross-border freight is far more suited to  be moved by rail than road. But existing rail capacity simply  cannot cope with demand. Last year, the Railway Development  Study was completed. This set out ambitious but costly  proposals, including the construction of a new rail track to  link up with the Chinese national rail system, which itself is  being rapidly upgraded.    We are not yet in a position to make a firm decision on the  best way forward. But I suspect a consensus will emerge that  high on the list of our long-term transport priorities should be  a new railway to the border through the Northwest New  Territories. [passage omitted]    The Medium Range Forecast    147. As in previous years, I have published the Medium Range  Forecast in Appendix A to the printed version of this Speech.  Before I discuss the forecast, I should like to make four points.    148. First, in accordance with our normal practice, this  forecast covers the current financial year, the estimates year,  and three further years, Hence, my forecast will for the first  time include the 1997-98 financial year, a period most of which  follows the transfer of sovereignty. I should emphasise that  this is a forecast only, presented today solely to provide the  appropriate context for Hong Kong's planning. It is no way  imposes any commitment on the future SAR government.    149. Secondly, in previous forecasts, we have allowed for  the financial implications of the first airport financing  proposal put to the Chinese Government. And specifically, in  addition to public works expenditure, for equity injections of  HK$20.3 billion from the reserves. Whilst the financing  arrangements have yet to be agreed, it is clearly desirable to  make our forecasts as realistic as possible. Without going into  details of the fourth financing proposal at this stage, in our  latest forecast we have allowed for a further equity injection  of HK$20 billion from the reserves.    We have also estimated the likely additional revenue to be  obtained from airport railway-related land, and how much of that  sum would be used as a further equity injection.  Notwithstanding the great increase in land values since 1992,  no more than about HK$40 billion in gross premium from airport  railway-related land is expected to be received in the limited  period up to June 1997, half of which would of course go to the  Land Fund. These estimates are reflected in the new forecast.  [passage omitted]    153. Now for the Medium Range Forecast itself. Two  different factors are at work.    -- First, revenues have been buoyant over the past three  years. And revenue forecasts have been increased to reflect this.    -- Secondly, on the expenditure side, the forecast reflects  a  more realistic estimate of our capacity on public works.    154. On this basis, I forecast that we shall add HK$7.7  billion to our fiscal reserves in 1994-95. Throughout the  forecast period, we shall continue to see a healthy surplus on  the operating account. However, in 1995-96 and 1996-97, we are  forecast to draw on our reserves to take account of an  increasing spending capacity on public works, as well as  increased investment in our physical infrastructure, including  most notably the Airport Core Programme.    155. I forecast that on 31 March 1997, our fiscal reserves  will stand at an impressive HK$120 billion. This is a dramatic  increase over the figure of HK$78 billion which I forecast in my  Budget last year. This HK$120 billion is all the more  remarkable an achievement when you remember that it takes into  account both the spending proposals and the tax concessions I  have announced today. And it also fully allows for the proposed  additional equity injection into the Airport Core Programme, and  explains my willingness to make such a large investment.    156. Moving to the last year of the forecast, namely  1997-98, the Medium Term Forecast predicts an overall surplus  for the year of HK$21 billion. This very satisfactory figure  reflects the fact that, in accordance with the Joint  Declaration, the SAR government will receive the full proceeds  from land sales, and will collect rents for the extension of New  Territories leases. The end result is that the forecast  predicts that the fiscal reserves will total HK$141 billion at  the end of 1997-98.    157. Nor is this the full picture, as these figures do not  take into account the position of the SAR government Land Fund,  which represents a significant asset for the future SAR  government. Members will recall that a senior Chinese official  has been reported recently as indicating that the fund was  likely to exceed HK$100 billion in 1997. Our own estimate of  HK$105 billion, before taking into account the disposal of sites  along the airport railway, is broadly in line with this.    But when account is taken of the fund's share of the likely  additional receipts from these sites the balance of the fund in  1997 should reach HK$125 billion.    158. Thus, at the end of 1997-98, the SAR government is  likely to have combined reserves, including interest, of about  HK$269 billion, incorporating both the fiscal reserves and the  Land Fund. Fortunately, therefore, we are able to continue to  build up reserves greater than our annual expenditure. This is  something we have been able to achieve in recent times. And  something that few other communities have been able to do.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   159. To a considerable extent we are engaged in managing the  prosperity we have achieved, and in ensuring that it continues.  In practice this has involved me in striking the right balance  between spending and savings:    -- Spending, both to improve the quality of life for the  community as a whole and to create the infrastructure for our  future growth, and    -- Savings, to meet future liabilities and unforeseen  contingencies, because economic success cannot be taken for  granted year after year.    There will always be a temptation to spend a little more and  save a little less. It might sometimes seem tempting  politically to bow to some of the inevitable pressures to do so.  But it would not be responsible government. And it would risk  increasing consumption and fuelling inflation.    160. I hope that this Council will agree that we have found  the right balance this afternoon. My Budget proposals will:    -- Put HK$38 billion back into the taxpayer's pocket over  the  next five years,    -- Implement the ambitious expansion in social services set  in motion by the Governor's first two Policy Addresses, and    -- Put an additional HK$8 billion into our fiscal reserves  next year and put us on course for total fiscal reserves of  HK$269 billion by the end of the forecast period.    161. It is not the Government which has made today's Budget  possible. This has been achieved by the hard-working men and  women of Hong Kong. It is, first and last, their success and  their money on which we rely, and it is their way of life, their  livelihood we are all trying to secure.    162. Mr President, I move that the debate on this motion be  now adjourned.</p>

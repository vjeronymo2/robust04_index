			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Petrov: "Local Authorities: Many Rights But </F> No Money"]    [Text] The principle of federalism in forming Russia's  state budget is based on one firm postulate: Having received  substantial financial independence, local authorities assume  increased responsibility for the state of affairs in their  region. It would seem that this is a completely sensible and  well considered approach: New rights entail new obligations.  Indeed, when matters take such a turn, the center begins to have  fewer headaches regarding what, how and in what amounts to  finance this or that in Taldom or Kostroma.    But in practice, as often happens, a good idea for some  reason unfailingly takes a negative turn. The authorities in  small cities and settlements, instead of an easing of the  federal tax burden, which permitted them to hope for resolution  of many local issues, acquired a whole pile of new problems  without any financial levers whatsoever. Figuratively speaking,  it was proposed to the local authorities that they swim a  hundred meters but it had been forgotten to untie their hands  first.    Such are the basic themes in the open letter sent to the  leadership of the country by the chairman of the Association of  Heads of City and Regional Administrations of the Moscow Oblast  Roman Popkovich. It is reported in the letter, in particular,  that the change in the norm for payments to local budgets from  various kinds of taxes, designated by the President's December  edicts, is leading to a situation where even such a rich oblast  as the Moscow Oblast, which gives the federal treasury almost  half of its income, cannot now get along without substantial  subsidies.    Moscow Oblast's budget deficit under the new normative  payments, according to R. Popkovich, will increase in 1994 by at  least one trillion rubles. This will make it impossible to  finance departmental residential housing and social  cultural-facilities that have been transferred since January of  this year to municipal ownership.    Only retention of differentiated norms for payments from  federal taxes into the budgets of the regions, in the opinion of  the members of the association, can provide a way out of the  situation that has been created. For the Moscow oblast, these  payments should be no less than 75 percent with respect to the  value added tax (VAT) and a full 100 percent with respect to the  individual income tax.    A letter from representatives of the executive authorities  of  the Moscow region, which is filled with disconcerting forecasts,  was written immediately after the draft of the federal budget,  prepared by the Ministry of Finance, had become public.  According to the letter, almost 13.4 percent of gross domestic  product (GDP) is allocated for support of the territories. This  is a gigantic sum, if one takes into account that the slogan of  the federalization of the budget, as has already been stated  many times, was supposed to become the fundamental watchword of  the government in 1994. In other words, the local authorities  are to rely on their own financial resources. But for many  regions, these resources, as is rapidly becoming clear, are  catastrophically insufficient.    Thus, according to data for January to November 1993, the  federal budget transferred 2.4 trillion rubles to territorial  budgets on the basis of mutual settlements, 967 billion rubles  in the form of subventions, and--to certain regions for  resolving "burning" issues--103 billion rubles in the form of  short-term loans. In the fourth quarter, the volume of funds  allocated from the center sharply increased, totalling 2.6  billion rubles [as published], or 11.7 percent, of the total  expenditures of the Russian budget.    But how can the level of social security for the population  of the country be effectively equalized if certain subjects of  the federation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechnya) have  directed practically all taxes they have collected into the  budgets of their own territories. Last year, for example, 100  percent of the profits tax, 99 percent of the VAT, and 94  percent of excise taxes were transferred to the budget of the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya). In the Republic of Karelia, the  corresponding transfers to the budget of the territory were 96  percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent. And, nevertheless, this was  not enough money.    As you know, over 51 percent of the total expenditures from  the consolidated budget goes to expenditures from the federal  budget. Twenty-eight percent of all revenue was allocated from  the resources of the federal budget just for the support of the  national economy in 1993. This money is used to help the coal  industry, the agro-industrial complex, the defense complex, and  many other entities.    Will the local authorities be able to cope with the economic  and social problems of their own territories? They should be  able to. In any case, they say they can. But in order to do so,  as a minimum, they require more financial and taxation  independence. The federal government, it seems, should provide  them such an opportunity. Local leaders will then not have  reason to make declarations about the "tax robberies" of the  center. Then, perhaps, we will forever rid ourselves of the  currently appealing watchword of oblast and regional  "independence."</p>

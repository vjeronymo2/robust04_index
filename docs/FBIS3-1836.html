Li Peng said in his motion: To meet the requirements of  establishing a socialist market economic structure; promote  reform of the labor system; protect laborers' legitimate rights  and interests; establish, safeguard, and develop a stable and  harmonious labor relationship between employers and laborers;  and promote economic development and social progress, the  Ministry of Labor and departments concerned have drawn up a  draft labor law. The draft has been discussed and adopted by  the State Council's executive meeting.    Entrusted by the State Council, Labor Minister Li Boyong  briefed the meeting on issues concerning the draft labor law.  Li Boyong said: In compliance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  direction on formulating a labor law, which he proposed at a  central work conference, the former State Bureau of Labor had  initiated the drafting of a labor law with departments  concerned. Over the past decade or so, the draft has been  revised over 30 times following a great deal of investigations  and studies as well as repeated assessments. Since the 14th CPC  Congress, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the State  Council, the Ministry of Labor, and the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions have further studied, assessed, and revised the  draft law. Presently, various departments are of the opinion  that it is extremely necessary and imperative to formulate a  labor law; conditions are ripe for this work.    Li Boyong said: It is necessary to draw up a labor law to  protect laborers' legitimate rights and interests and maintain a  stable and harmonious labor relationship between employers and  laborers. Since reform and opening policies were adopted,  China's non-publicly-owned economic sectors have developed  significantly, and publicly-owned enterprises are also stepping  up the pace of changing operating mechanisms; thus the labor  relationship is becoming more complicated and diversified. In  the course of such a profound transformation, a sound and  perfect development in labor legislation is, in an objective  sense, necessary for correctly readjusting and safeguarding the  legitimate rights and interests of both sides of a labor  relationship and for resolving contradictions between employers  and laborers; it is very pressing to keep laborers' legitimate  rights and interests from being infringed upon through  legislation. In fact, the practices of extending laborers'  working hours at will, cutting their wages, rejecting necessary  labor protection for them, and even humiliating and physically  punishing workers, which lead to seriously vicious incidents,  have been frequently reported in some localities and  enterprises, particularly nonpublicly owned enterprises, in  recent years because a law that will provide better protection  for laborers' legitimate rights and interests is absent. Some  foreign-invested enterprises openly harmed laborers' interests  under the pretext that there is no labor law in China,  deteriorating the labor relationship and disturbing social  stability. Many deputies and members from every past term of  people's congress and committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference have submitted motions and  suggestions for accelerating the legislation of a labor law.    He said: Formulating a labor law is a pressing need for  developing a socialist market economy. Under the market  economic structure, a market is required as a basic means for  allocation of the labor force. As the market economy develops  and labor reform deepens, China is gradually improving its labor  system, developing it in the direction of requiring a market to  allocate the labor force; the development, allocation, and  employment of the labor force are markedly more commercial and  social; and openness and competition in the labor market are  increasingly prominent. These developments objectively lead to  the requirement that all aspects of the labor relationship be  incorporated into the track of market operations. The behavior,  rights, and obligations of the subjects in a labor relationship,  as well as the order of the labor market, need to be  standardized and safeguarded by law. Therefore, we badly need  to draw up a labor law.    In his briefing, Li Boyong also elaborated on the guiding  ideology for legislating the draft labor law, to what extent it  is applicable, labor contracts, cutting staff and workers,  working hours, and other issues.</p>

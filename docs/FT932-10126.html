			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Patten refuses to give ground on testing MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday insisted that national curriculum tests in schools will go ahead this year, in spite of opinion polls which showed a majority of parents thought they should be abandoned. 'If we were to bring these reforms juddering to a halt now, I believe we will find them extremely difficult to get back on the road again,' Mr Patten said. Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, are already boycotting the tests. The largest, the National Union of Teachers, is expected to join them when it announces the results of its ballot on a test boycott on Thursday. Mr Patten, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, denied that last week's setbacks for the government in the Newbury by-election and the county council elections meant that the tests should be made voluntary. He said: 'We are at a critical moment in the introduction of our education reforms. Sometimes the price of success is a period of unpopularity.' The Department for Education then stepped up the publicity campaign supporting the tests by distributing an information pack called 'Testing: The Facts'. The pack, which has been sent to trade unions, employers' organisations, universities and church leaders, says that testing is inseparable from the process of introducing a national curriculum. Two polls published yesterday showed that parents supported the claim by teachers that the tests should be abandoned. One in The Independent found 52 per cent of parents in favour of abandonment. The other, in The Daily Telegraph, found that 77 per cent of the public believed that education reforms had been introduced without sufficient preparation, and that 62 per cent sympathised with the teachers' claim that the tests are too complicated and time-consuming. In another setback for the government, the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations has voted to ballot its members on a boycott by parents of the tests. The National Association of Head Teachers has already advised its members not to hinder parents who withdraw their children on testing days. The department said the tests for seven-year-olds were already almost complete, and there was no point making them voluntary at this stage. Sir Ron Dearing, who has been appointed by Mr Patten to review the curriculum and testing, tried to distance himself from the political row surrounding the tests. Four weeks ago he called on the tests to go ahead to provide him with information necessary to improve them next year. Yesterday, he said: 'I don't want to add to that. I don't think it's for me to get involved in what has become an industrial relations issue.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy  has instructed the ministries of communications and power  engineering and Ukraine's TV and Radio Company to resume  broadcasting TV programs in full throughout the territory of  Ukraine. This decision was taken in response to requests to the  Cabinet of Ministers by citizens.    I would like to recall that since the end of last year, all  TV channels have only worked in the evening due to the energy  shortage. An exception was made for the duration of the winter  Olympic games.</p>

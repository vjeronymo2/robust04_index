			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / S Korea to spend more on economy THE South Korean government yesterday proposed a 26 per cent increase in spending on economic development, which includes support for small and medium businesses. At the same time, the Bank of Korea predicted that economic growth this year would be the slowest since 1981. The government's 1993 budget sharply curbs defence spending growth in order to fund expanded infrastructure projects that will relieve the country's congested transportation networks. The 9.8 per cent rise in defence spending, which accounts for a quarter of the national budget, is the lowest rise since 1985. Defence spending is normally an important component of the South Korean budget because of the military confrontation with North Korea. The 1993 budget is set to increase by 14.6 per cent to Won38,050bn (Pounds 28bn). Significantly higher spending is planned for small and medium-sized businesses, education, science and technology, and infrastructure projects.</p>

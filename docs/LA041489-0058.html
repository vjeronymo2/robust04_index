			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS KILL 4 PALESTINIANS IN WEST BANK RAID  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers shot and killed at least four Palestinians in a pre-dawn raid  on the hilltop village of Nahhalin on Thursday in the worst single clash of the  Arab uprising this year.  </P> <P> The incident highlighted the contrast between the almost daily violence inside  the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the slow pace of peace moves in foreign  capitals, where the United States is spearheading a step-by-step process aimed  at setting up Israeli-Palestinian talks.  </P> <P> The bloodshed at Nahhalin, a village of 2,000 residents not far from Bethlehem,  came just after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ended a 10-day tour of  the United States, during which he presented his own peace plans to the Bush  Administration. Israeli officials, apparently reacting to a potential public  relations problem, took the unprecedented step of convening domestic and  foreign reporters to announce an investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Villagers Say 6 Died  </P> <P> Villagers said that six residents perished. Four dead could be confirmed at  hospitals. Another victim, shot in the head, was brain-dead at Mokassed  Hospital in Jerusalem and was expected to die at any time, doctors said. The  estimates of the number wounded ranged from 11, the army's figure, up to 20.  </P> <P> In Nahhalin, bloodstains were visible in a cemetery next to the village mosque,  atop the roof of a house and in a field where the victims, mostly men in their  20s, were hit.  </P> <P> Fatma Shukarna, one of the wounded at Beit Jala Hospital, told reporters that  she was shot in the back by a border policeman. After her uncle, Kamal, and a  neighbor bundled her into a car to take her to a hospital, troops fired on  them, too, wounding both Kamal and the neighbor, she said.  </P> <P> The bloodiest incident of the 16-month-old Arab uprising occurred last  December, when soldiers shot and killed eight Arabs during a violent funeral in  the West Bank city of Nablus. In all, more than 400 Arabs have been killed in  the uprising, known in Arabic as the intifada.  </P> <P> It was difficult to get a complete account of Thursday's shootings. Villagers  said that a unit from the army's border police entered Nahhalin, along the  single road that runs through it, sometime after 3 a.m. The inhabitants had  just finished a late-night breakfast that is common during the month of  Ramadan, when Muslims fast during daylight hours.  </P> <P> From debris on the road, it appeared that the soldiers had to overcome numerous  makeshift barricades to reach the town center. Often, such obstacles of  boulders and trash slow the approach of soldiers so that townspeople can throw  rocks and then retreat.  </P> <P> When the troops reached the center of town, some took up positions in an  unfinished house, witnesses said, and shot at villagers who were on the street  or hidden in the cemetery.  </P> <P> "It was not like, for example, I hit him with a stone and he shoots back," said  one excited local resident. "No! He just seeing and shooting."  </P> <P> Omar Shukarna, who witnessed the shooting from his home nearby, added: "It was  like a street war. There was no reason for it."  </P> <P> Israel's version emphasized the danger in which the troops found themselves.  Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the Israeli commander on the West Bank, said his men  had gone to Nahhalin to arrest suspected stone-throwers who had harassed  traffic on nearby roads. About 30 soldiers entered the town around 5 a.m., he  said, and were met with "exceptional resistance."  </P> <P> The border police, part of the army, were armed with tear gas, rubber bullets  and regular metal rounds, he said. The shooting lasted for 45 minutes, Mitzna  added, confirming that four Arabs died.  </P> <P> "It is not in our interest to have casualties on the West Bank. On the  contrary, casualties grease the wheels of the uprising," said Mitzna, who  contended that leaders of the rebellion encourage Palestinians to get in harm's  way in order to renew anti-Israeli fervor.  </P> <P> The border police, who are trained in riot control, have been accused of  brutality in trying to suppress the uprising. They were recently dispatched to  several areas of the West Bank and Gaza to replace reserve army units, and  there have been many recent Arab fatalities in the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Several Israeli commentators remarked that use of the border police served only  to ease political pressure on the government, both from reservists who  complained about serving in the occupied territories and from high-ranking army  officers who warned that using the regular army as an occupation police force  was eroding training and moral standards.  </P> <P> In a newspaper interview last week, Meshulam Amit, the new head of the border  police, responded to the accusations of brutality. He argued that his troops  are "not trigger-happy," saying a border police officer opens fire only if "his  life is in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Also on Thursday, a Bethlehem stone-thrower shot in the back last week by a  soldier died, setting off a small demonstration there.  </P></p>

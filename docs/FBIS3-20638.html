			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xun Peiwen [6737 1014 2429]] </F>   [Text] China's largest oil field, Daqing oil field,  produced 55.9019 million tons of crude oil last year, an over  production of 501,900 tons, setting its highest level of  production in history. The oil field went into operation in  1960, and its output of crude oil has risen every year since. In  1976, annual crude oil output broke the 50-million-ton mark, and  it has now been operating steadily for 18 years, having produced  a cumulative total of over 1.22 billion tons of oil for China,  setting a new world record of longevity for oil fields of its  type throughout the world.    Experts claim that Daqing is the world's largest terrigenous  oil deposit, and has geological features very different from the  world's major marine deposits which make it a difficult oil  field to develop. Daqing oil field had, therefore, to make  creative advancements in applying the water flood recovery  method widely used around the world. Daqing employed a range of  advanced technological measures to deal with its low-, medium-,  and high-water stages and was able to effectively sustain a high  and stable level of productivity.    It is estimated that an annual crude output of 55 million  tons can be maintained up to 1995, and a 50-million ton output  level can be maintained until the year 2000.</p>

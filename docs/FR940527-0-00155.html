L. 101&hyph;510, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, as amended. The purpose of the Program is to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide incentives to major DoD contractors, performing under at least one active approved subcontracting plan negotiated with DoD or other Federal agencies, to assist small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Increase the overall participation of SDBs as subcontractors and suppliers and DoD contracts, other Federal agency contracts and commercial contracts and; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Foster the establishment of long term business relationships between SDBs and such contractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs as protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of SDBs to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. According to the law, the DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost reimbursement, credit against SDB subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies, or a combination of credit and reimbursement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An increase in the dollar value of subcontracts awarded to SDBs by mentor firms under DoD contracts; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies and under commercial contracts) since the date of their entry into the Program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An improvement in the participation of SDBs in DoD, other Federal agencies, and commercial contracting opportunities that can be attributed to the development of SDBs as protege firms under the Program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An increase in subcontracting with SDB concerns in industry categories where SDBs have not traditionally participated within the mentor firm's vendor base; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The involvement of emerging SDBs in the Program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) An expanded relationship between mentor firms and protege firms to include non-DoD programs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The development of protege firms that are competitive as subcontractors and suppliers to DoD or in other Federal agencies or commercial markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered into between DoD and the mentor firm_company is interested in reimbursement through a separate contract, cooperative agreement or other agreement with DoD or, a combination of reimbursement through such agreement with DoD and credit against SDB subcontract goals for any unreimbursed costs incurred under the Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Program Manager funded reimbursement_company has identified a DoD program manager willing to fund the Program and the company is interested in reimbursement for technical assistance costs to a protege firm(s) through a separately priced cost reimbursement contract line item added to a DoD contract, with credit against SDB subcontracting goals for any unreimbursed costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Indirect reimbursement and credit_company is interested in receiving reimbursement for indirect costs incurred under the Program as well as credit against SDB subcontract goals for these indirect costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Credit only_company is interested in receiving credit only against SDB subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> I&hyph;101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> I&hyph;101.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Emerging SDB concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A small disadvantaged business whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the standard industrial code for the supplies or services which the protege firm provides or would provide to the mentor firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

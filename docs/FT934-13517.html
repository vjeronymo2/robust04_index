			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Goodwill towards Smiths Some engineering companies may bleat about poor markets, but Smiths Industries has quietly focused on getting its costs in line with its prospects. Nor has consistent performance been bought at the price of future development. Smiths' research and development expenditure is at an all-time high. Strong operational gearing means the company is well placed to profit when the aerospace upturn finally arrives, while its lack of financial gearing and growing medical business mean that the wait should not be too painful. Yet one aspect of accounting does place a potential constraint in the path of the management's development programme. The high-tech medical businesses it has acquired have justified the ratings paid for them, but the Pounds 416m goodwill write-offs of recent years have left the company with only Pounds 267m of shareholders' funds on the balance sheet. That is a poor reflection of the underlying strength of Smiths' business. Worse, such accounting conventions serve companies poorly if managements feel inhibited about justified expansion or shareholders misunderstand the situation and the company's rating is damaged. Vested interests have thus far resisted change in the conventions. Perhaps the Accounting Standards Board should now recommend that goodwill is retained on company balance sheets and steadily written off through the profit and loss account. That would also form a useful discipline against overpaying for acquisitions. Investors have had to put up with goodwill write offs and share issues hiding the sins of poor companies. How much more serious if the rules start to damage the prospects of good companies too.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE  </P> <P> The Temptations, fresh off an appearance on the season finale of "Murphy  Brown," will hook up with CBS once again when they perform a revamped version  of their classic Motown hit "Get Ready," to be used in the network's new fall  promotional campaign. The tune will be featured in TV and radio spots beginning  this summer.  </P> <P> Joanna Kerns has been cast as a housewife who is emotionally and sexually  abused by her psychiatrist in the ABC movie "Nowhere Safe." The film is a  fictional account based on real-life facts extracted from a number of  litigations that have taken place across the country.  </P> <P> Production has begun in Los Angeles on the six-hour NBC miniseries "Jackie  Collins' Lucky," starring Nicollette Sheridan and Vince Irizarry in a story of  passion, power and greed. The miniseries is scheduled to be telecast in October  as part of NBC's strategy for counter-programming this year's baseball playoffs  on CBS. Anne-Marie Johnson, Michael Nader, Mary Frann, Stephanie Beacham, Leann  Hunley and Eric Braeden also star.  </P> <P> "The Arsenio Hall Show," trying to stay on the cutting edge, recently began  broadcasting in Dolby Surround sound stereo -- a high-tech sound processing  system that splits signals into four channels to create a concert-like  ambience. "Television viewers whose homes are equipped with Surround sound  receivers will feel as if they are part of the audience," producer Marla Kell  Brown said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with RPF spokesman Dr. Jacques Bihozagara by C.B. </F> in Brussels; date not given]    [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is opposed to  France's planned intervention. RPF Political Bureau Member Dr.  Jacques Bihozagara, whom we questioned, repeated that to us  bluntly:    [Bihozagara] The answer is no! France is not qualified to  carry out this kind of operation for several reasons. First,  because we think that France was aware of, if not an accomplice  of, the plans for genocide: The training of the commandos was  carried out by the French, it is they who supplied them with  weapons; 80 percent of the weapons we have seized from the  government forces have been supplied by the French.    The Interhamwe [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic  Militia] were divided into three categories: Demobilized  members of the Presidential Guard, who had kept their weapons,  commandos, trained by French soldiers, and ordinary peasants who  had been given weapons. Today the genocide plan has been  carried out: Two thirds of Rwanda's Tutsis have been  exterminated as well as 90 percent of the Hutu intellectual and  political elite.    We also think that France is not qualified because we have  information that it participated in the attack on the  president's plane. From the start, we said that the plane's  black box was in Paris and nobody has denied this. But the  information from the black box has never been analyzed or  released.    [Braeckman] Are there still civilians to be saved?    [Bihozagara] Yes, and the RPF is capable of doing it. We  also note a change in the Rwandan Army's attitude to the  militias: When the latter burst into the Hotel des Milles  Collines, it was the government army which intervened against  them. In addition, we have noted conciliatory remarks about the  RPF from the chief of staff and we know that the government  troops are demoralized. We have the feeling that the Rwandan  Army is not ready to do what is necessary to release the  hostages and it is at this precise moment, when things could be  resolved, that France wants to make a gesture.    [Braeckman] How can this attitude be explained?    [Bihozagara] There are several reasons: The first is that  France feels a moral debt toward Rwanda, and that the government  feels urged to do something, including to launch into the  adventure. But we also think that among the scattered troops  there are embarrassing witnesses who could call France into  question and who ought to be eliminated. I would also like to  tell you that the UN special representative who is in Rwanda  might, during his investigations on the ground, be forced to  implicate members of the Akazu (the president's entourage -- LE  SOIR editor's note) who are currently in France.    [Braeckman] Do you have information that French soldiers are  in Rwanda and are trapped alongside the government forces?    [Bihozagara] Yes, we also have reports that some French  soldiers have been discovered in military camps in Kigali and we  think that the current operation also has the aim of bringing  them out. We even think that this is the decisive reason for  the operation planned, and this is why it is necessary to move  so quickly. France wants to cover its tracks and we oppose  that. We have asked all Rwandans in Europe to return to the  country to oppose this action.    [Braeckman] Bernard Kouchner [French state secretary for  humanitarian affairs] is currently in Rwanda, and has passed  through RPF lines. In what capacity?    [Bihozagara] When I saw him in Geneva and he told me he  wanted to make another visit, I suggested that he went to the  government side to plead with the militias to release their  hostages. He had tried previously but the militias had refused  and he returned empty-handed.    He has now returned to Rwanda, passing through the North,  but  he was there on a private basis and was accompanied by Mr.  Larome, who is in charge of humanitarian operations.    If we refuse France's intervention it is also in memory of  our country's countless victims. We also refuse the  intervention of former French colonies with excessively close  ties with Paris, like Togo for instance. As for Senegal, we  agreed to its participation in a UN intervention, which we still  accept, but if the Senegalese return alongside the French, as  [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe is asking them to do, that  is a different matter.</p>

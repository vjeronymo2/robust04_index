			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Pelts: "The Army Is Performing Its </F> Tasks Despite All the Complications and Problems"]    [Text] Yesterday Minister of Defense of the Russian  Federation General of the Army Pavel Grachev held his regular  press hour for Russian and foreign journalists. At the beginning  of the conversation, in accordance with established tradition,  he informed the journalists about what has happened in the Armed  Forces of Russia since the last meeting. Let us remember that it  took place at the end of December 1993.    First of all, the Minister stressed that a reform process  has  continued in the forces in accordance with the plans and tasks  that are included in the president's message to the Federal  Assembly. Planned measures were taken to improve the  administrative system, to establish new force groupings and  naval forces, to improve the system to bring the army and navy  up to strength, and to provide them with the necessary equipment  and armament. The defense minister singled out several of the  most important directions in the reform of the armed forces.  Above all, he stressed, the improvement of the system of  military legislation was continued. The Ministry of Defense has  already prepared more than 20 bills and they are preparing bills  for new laws "On the Military Status" and "On the Military  Police."    Other measures in the reform of the Armed Forces were also  also being carried out strictly according to plan. One of the  important problems continues to be that of the reduction of the  numerical strength of the troops and forces. The Minister of  Defense stressed that after a comprehensive analysis the  decision was made to propose confirming a strength level of 1.9  million men. It is thought that the lower level that was  proposed earlier is simply unacceptable.    At the beginning of the year, it was also possible to  reverse  such a negative trend as the nonfulfillment of the plan for  conscription. As of today, 88 percent of those drafted (from the  existing plan) are fulfilling their constitutional duties in the  ranks of the army and navy. It is proposed that the induction  level be increased to 95 percent by the end of March.    A significant improvement was also noted in the state of  military discipline. The total number of crimes and violations  has been reduced by one-quarter in comparison with 1993.  Nonstatutory relations decreased by more than 22 percent and  cases of evasion of military service by 20 percent. Overall, the  defense minister stressed, the nature of the violations in the  army and navy reflects the situation in society.    The Minister of Defense expressed his greatest concern in  connection with the formation of the military budget and the  financing of the Armed Forces. He said that if the negative  tendencies continue and no fundamental and decisive measures are  taken in the near future, then it will be impossible to speak  not only of the further reforming of the army but also of the  security of Russia as a whole. Presently, the Ministry of  Finance is proposing less than 50 percent of what is required  for the needs and normal functioning of the army and navy.  Naturally, such a situation is unsatisfactory. The Minister of  Defense emphasized that he will continue to seek the budget  necessary for the armed forces. He noted that even under these  circumstances there are possibilities for additional financing  of the forces, above all in connection with the right of the  Ministry of Defense itself to determine quantities and to sell  combat equipment, with the sale of surplus military property to  the national economy, the reduction of orders from the military  military-industrial complex, and the further reduction of the  armed forces. Of course, the existence of this plan does not  mean that the reform of the Army and Navy will proceed precisely  in these directions. The minister of defense stressed that we  will not permit a devastating reduction of the army, since this  is disadvantageous for the state and in general. Furthermore,  the Defense Minister emphasized that, as before, the established  military budget will have a clearly expressed social  orientation. It is proposed that more than 50 percent of all the  budgetary funds allocated for the Ministry of Defense be  directed to the social protection of service personnel.    In the course of the press conference, Minister of Defense  Pavel Grachev answered many questions involving the problems of  military cooperation with the countries of the far as well as  the near abroad. In particular, he noted the good prospects for  cooperation with France, the United States, the FRG, and also  with Belarus, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and other  countries of the Commonwealth. Commenting on the latest events  that took place with respect to the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel  Grachev stressed that the present problems must not influence  the unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements, and  that despite certain difficulties, he hopes for the close  cooperation of the minister of defense of Ukraine.    Just as in past meetings with journalists, there were also  questions of a political nature. In particular, the Minister of  Defense was asked whether his presence in Moscow at this time  has to do with the need for a "strong hand" in the capital.  Pavel Grachev categorically rejected the political nature of the  question and emphasized that the army was busy resolving its own  problems.</p>

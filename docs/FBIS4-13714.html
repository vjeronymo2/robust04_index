			<p>BFN     [Text] General Sakhi, known as Sakhi Broot, a militia  general, was killed by Golboddin's militia in Dasht-e Saqawa  south of Kabul in Logar Province. Security sources reported to  BIA's correspondent that this professional criminal some days  ago fought Golboddin's militia over looted goods; as a result of  which he was killed along with his three bodyguards. The  general's body still lies in Dasht-e Saqawa and is decomposing.  No one has come to remove his body. Sakhi Broot some time ago  stole the carpets of Sayed Abdolqader Jaylani mosque in Sayd Nur  Mohammad Shah Mena, killed an innocent shepherd in the same  area, and divided up his sheep among the militia. He was a  notorious Dostum general and had a hand in many crimes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Russian special envoy to  the former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin said after talks with  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb that Knin-Zagreb  talks were likely to resume soon and that the deadlock would be  broken. After the signing of a ceasefire agreement, this would  be a significant move forward in the process of normalizing the  Knin-Zagreb relations, he said. As for the venue of the talks,  he said he believed a place acceptable to both sides would be  found.    The agreement on cessation of hostilities and troop  pull-out,  reached in late March between the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK)  and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, took effect in  early April. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 by local Serbs in  their ancestral land within Croatia in response to Croatia's  forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation and its  attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. The  territory was placed under U.N. protection in March 1992.    In a statement to the press, Churkin said that all sides  were  preparing for a resumption of talks on a ceasefire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are scheduled to open in Geneva on  Monday [6 June]. He described the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina as complex, stressing as important that all  sides should attend the talks and warning that this was also a  duty to the international community in the process of reaching a  ceasefire agreement. He added that this could be the first step  towards implementing the programme adopted in Geneva by the  European Union, Russian and U.S. foreign ministers. He said  that all preparations were completed and added that now the time  was right for resolving the crisis. He also pointed out  Moscow's engagement in seeking a solution for the entire  territory of the former Yugoslavia.    Churkin on Tuesday visited Belgrade, where he conferred with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, RSK President Milan Martic  and senior officials of the Bosnian Serb republic. After  Zagreb, Churkin on Wednesday leaves for Sarajevo, where he is  scheduled to meet with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic  and probably with Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Bosnian  Muslim-Croat federation.</p>

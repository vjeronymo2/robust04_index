			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dow move linking prices to DM 'sustains margins' DOW, the US chemical company which last week said it was formally linking its prices in Europe to the D-Mark, says customers will still be invoiced and be able to pay in their local currencies. Prices billed will be converted into the local currency at the D-Mark rate on the day orders are received or regular orders placed. The action will sustain margins during a period of exchange rate instability. Mr Fernand Kaufmann, sales and commercial vice-president of Dow Europe, said: 'Now with the ERM uncertainty, we have to adjust these prices to restore the value of the D-Mark. We really need the D-Mark equivalent. We cannot live off the devalued rate.' Mr Michel Demare, assistant treasurer, said that unless Dow formalised its D-Mark pricing policy, it would be sacrificing about 5 per cent on one-third of its revenues. A substantial proportion of its production costs are in D-Marks. Four-fifths of the European company's trade is in ERM countries, with the remainder in Switzerland, Scandinavia, the Middle East and Africa.</p>

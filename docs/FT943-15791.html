			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Competing on a level playing field - British Vita has been lured into Poland by its low production costs Western Poland, much of which was part of Germany before the second world war and retains excellent road, rail and canal links to the west, is rapidly becoming a preferred location for foreign investors. Unusually, it has also attracted a growing number of British industrial investors who, thus far, have generally been slow to invest in former communist central Europe. Significantly, the attention of one of the latest British investors, British Vita, was attracted by executives at its German subsidiary. If Mr Marek Krojcig, a mild-mannered Polish entrepreneur with a ready smile, hadn't turned up to buy blocks of foam for cash five years ago at Veenendaal, British Vita's German foam operation, the UK-based company might conceivably not now be the proud owner of a brand new polyurethane foam production facility at Brzeg Dolny in western Poland. For it was Mr Krojcig's return visits, each time with a suitcase full of D-Marks, which attracted the attention of Mr Joachim Gronebaum, the managing director of Deutsche Vita. Two years later, in December 1992, it led to the establishment of Krojcig Mebel, a foam-cutting and marketing joint venture at Zielona Gora, also in western Poland. Mr Krojcig's success in selling the foam to Poland's furniture producers, both large state-owned companies and small producers, pointed Vita in the direction of building its own plant in Poland, duly opened last month. 'We saw that the furniture businesses we were supplying in Germany were moving their production to Poland and decided to go with them,' says Mr Rod Sellers, British Vita's chief executive. 'We also recognised Poland's relative political stability and prospects for growth as well as geographical location near to the Czech Republic and on the way to the former Soviet Union,' he adds. Others have followed this path. BOC owns a technical gases facility next door to the Vita Polymers Poland plant at Brzeg, as part of its Dollars 90m (Pounds 59m) investment plan in Poland. Paterson Zochonis of Manchester has a Cussons Imperial Leather soap factory in nearby Wroclaw where Cadbury Schweppes is building a chocolate plant. Coca Cola has sited one of its main bottling plants at Sroda Slaska in the vicinity. At Brzeg, Vita's 9,000 tonne annual capacity foam fabricating plant is located just across the fence from the giant Rokita chemical works built during the second world war by IG Farbenindustrie to produce poison gas. Now Rokita not only pipes energy and nitrogen to Vita Polymers, but also supplies polyol, one of the main raw materials for the foam. TDI, the other raw material, comes from Zachem in Bydgoszcz in the north, a plant which itself produces foam and is a direct competitor. Mr Sellers cites the fact that the main raw materials for production are present in the country as another reason for taking the decision to invest. But Brzeg will also be looking to companies like Dow Chemical and Rhone Poulenc to provide one third of supplies. For all the confidence about the future, British Vita has been very careful not to overspend on the project which has cost Dollars 8m to date, of which Dollars 5m went on the construction of the 12,000 sq m plant. This is roughly 25 per cent of what a similar plant would have cost in the United Kingdom. The work was done by local contractors, with the machinery coming mainly from Laader Berg in Norway. The small labour force of about 30 at Brzeg will also be earning about one eighth of the wages of their British counterparts. For the moment, however, all Vita's main competitors in Poland have similar advantages in a Polish market estimated to be worth Dollars 75m a year. Up to 30,000 tonnes a year of foam is now produced domestically, and a further 4,000 tonnes is imported. The two existing Polish competitors are Zachem in Bydgoszcz and Organika in Malbork. They are flanked by Polopren, a German joint venture in Zgierz and Polymer Gdansk, an Australian venture. But, in an interesting sign of the times, current producers are facing another private sector challenge from Mr Stanislaw Kremona, an independent Polish entrepreneur who farms in the lush, undulating countryside 12km from Brzeg Dolny, and has now built his own foam factory. The facility, which came on stream last year, has an annual capacity of 20,000 tonnes, but Mr Kremona is believed by his competitors to be producing well below capacity. For British Vita, Mr Kremona's plant represents no more than a small cloud in an otherwise blue sky. But the fact that an individual Polish entrepreneur is capable of putting up a plant of this size and sophistication shows how far the Polish private sector has developed in the five years since the fall of communism.</p>

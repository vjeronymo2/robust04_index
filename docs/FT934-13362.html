			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Russia bows to Japan pressure on dumping THE RUSSIAN government yesterday bowed to Japanese pressure and said it had abandoned its plans to release more nuclear waste into the seas around Japan. However, it warned that unless Russia received international help to build a Rs10bn factory to process the waste within the next 18 months, it would be forced to start dumping again. Japan yesterday welcomed the decision and said it would press for a world ban on ocean dumping of low-level material. Russia's decision came in response to a late-night telephone call by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart. Mr Hata demanded that Russia cancel plans to dump a second load of waste, after the first load of 900 cu metres of liquid radioactive waste was dumped on Sunday, or risk souring recently improved relations. 'The Russian government has. . . made a political decision on the immediate halting of that dumping and the government of Japan values this point,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. The dumping of coolant and cleansing water from decommissioned nuclear submarines sparked an outcry among environmentally sensitive Japanese. It also threatened to increase popular distrust of Russia, coming less than a week after Russian president Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo. Japanese officials in Tokyo said that Japan was considering calling for an complete international ban on nuclear waste-dumping at sea. Japan has said it will consider releasing some of the Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) it has offered to help Russia disarm its nuclear weapons. Russia has repeatedly warned that its economic crisis has left it with little alternative to dumping waste at sea to dispose of its huge stocks of radioactive waste. But in a defiant note, Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Russian environment minister, yesterday insisted that the international outrage over the dumping had been exaggerated. 'It's a question of priorities. We can't dispose of waste in a region with millions of people,' he said, admitting that he had been taken aback by the strength of protests from Japan, America and South Korea. He added: 'I have to deal with worse ecological problems (in Russia)'. A team of Russian experts is due to travel to Japan to discuss collaboration over the issue, which is expected to include specific Japanese aid to build the processing factory, Russian officials added. Japan has despatched a research vessel to measure radiation off the northern coast, and plans to call for a complete ban on dumping of low-level waste at a future meeting of the London convention on nuclear waste disposal at sea. The convention bans dumping of high-level waste and contains a voluntary resolution, signed by neither Japan nor Russia, against the dumping of low-level waste.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT'S FOES WIN ANOTHER ROUND;  </P> <P> APPEAL COURT UPHOLDS DRIVE FOR MIRAMAR RANCH REFERENDUM  </P> <P> An appeal court Tuesday refused to block a citizens group's drive for a  referendum on the Miramar Ranch North housing project, setting the stage for a  San Diego City Council decision on whether to place the measure on the ballot.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal refused to reconsider Superior Court Judge  Kevin Midlam's April 3 decision that a petition drive by the Save Miramar Lake  Committee was conducted legally.  </P> <P> James Milch, attorney for the developers of the project, BCE Development, said  Tuesday that he plans to take the battle to the state Supreme Court today.  Milch said he will argue again that the petition drive was invalid because each  of the 37,718 signers was not shown the entire 25-page development agreement  that authorized the project north of Scripps Ranch.  </P> <P> The development agreement between BCE and the city sets the terms for  construction of the Miramar Ranch North project, which consists of 3,360 homes  on 1,200 acres. It calls for BCE to construct certain improvements, including a  road, a library, two parks and a fire station.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposed to Part of Project  </P> <P> The Save Miramar Lake committee is not opposed to the entire development, only  to 658 of the homes, a four-lane road and an industrial park planned on the  hills of the lake's northern shore. But the group said it had no choice but to  seek rescission of the entire development agreement in order to make the  changes.  </P> <P> The ruling sends the issue to the council, which on Monday will be asked to  decide whether to place the referendum on the ballot or rescind the development  agreement. Councilman Ed Struiksma, a strong supporter of the development in  his district, announced unexpectedly last week that he would ask the City  Council to rescind the development agreement if the appeal court upheld  Midlam's decision.  </P> <P> But the Save Miramar Lake Committee's attorney said Tuesday he will urge the  council to put the issue on the ballot, unless repeal of the development  agreement includes provisions to protect the hills north of the lake from  development.  </P> <P> Struiksma's plan to send the issue to a task force of Scripps Ranch community  groups is merely an attempt to delay the issue and keep it off the September  ballot, on which he is running for re-election in the city's first  district-only elections, said Bob Glaser, the attorney. Slow-growth activists  have targeted Struiksma for defeat, and at least one poll has shown him to be  vulnerable on the Miramar Lake issue.  </P> <P> Struiksma could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rogelio Varela, Jesus Rangel, and Connie Ochoa] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 13 Apr -- The Latin American  and Caribbean nations "have observed the new U.S. attitude  toward the region," by considering us current and potential  associates, said Pedro Aspe [Mexican finance and public credit  secretary], president of the IDB [Inter-American Development  Bank] Governors Assembly. Meanwhile, Enrique Iglesias, IDB  president, noted that the first guarantee to control a nation's  foreign debt is to maintain "clean public finances and good  administration by the government."    Both officials closed the 35th annual meeting of the IDB  Governors Assembly and the Inter-American Investment Corporation  (CII), where they stated that the IDB's new commitments and new  agenda are to support the overall economic and social  development of the region through dialogue and attention to the  programs that combat poverty and encourage the private sector.    In a news conference at the end of the meeting, Enrique  Iglesias said that the economic liberalization policy undertaken  by the Latin American governments "is totally coincidental with  the policies of social improvement. Other models that were  applied did not solve this issue, they made it worse, as is  clearly demonstrated by the hiperinflationary crisis, which is  the greatest burden on the most destitute in Latin America."    When reporting on the new organization of IDB capital  shares,  Aspe explained: There is a new attitude on the part of the  United States toward the region as well as toward extra-regional  European and Japanese participation. "What we have said is that  the United States truly regards the region increasingly as a  current and potential associate; this is resulting in a much  more balanced and solid relationship. By reducing its shares in  the IDB, the United States will participate in capital  replacement without resorting to additional budget resources.    The official explained that the IDB Governors Assembly will  meet on 10 June in Washington DC to establish the strategy to be  followed in restructuring the CII so that its activities are not  duplicated by those carried out by the IDB in the programs  earmarked to finance the private sector, particularly  infrastructure works.    Enrique Iglesias suggested that the IDB members who insist  on  pushing the economic reform process specifically improve  internal savings with procedures similar to those used in the  southeastern nations.    Iglesias said that the IDB has indicated its willingness to  support the governments in implementing voluntary family  planning policies and in reducing military expenses so that  investments are directed toward productive activities.    Meanwhile, Iglesias disclosed that the IDB will seek to  reduce its internal costs "because we feel we cannot preach  austerity to the governments without practicing it in our own  home. It is said that charity begins at home." The IDB  president also explained that as a result of restructuring the  bank's capital, two additional seats were created on the board  of directors which still have not been assigned to any nation.  In the next 60 days, a decision on this will be discussed with  the multilateral organization's. One seat will be for a Latin  American nation and the other for an extra-regional nation.  Nevertheless, it has transpired that one of these seats is  practically assured to Japan, while the other is being disputed  by Chile with other Latin American nations.    In this context and during his participation in the fifth  full assembly, Mario Read, a Dominican Republic minister,  acknowledged the eighth replacement of IDB capital took place  amid fierce debate. At times, the possibility of transforming  the IDB from a promoter of economic and social development into  an institution with a predominantly financial tone, was  considered.    Meanwhile, Barry Hudson, UK alternate governor, indicated  that the mission at this time is to make the best use of the  large increase available in the bank's financing.</p>

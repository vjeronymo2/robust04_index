			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 April, the Industrial Science and Technology  Agency [ISTA] in the Ministry of International Trade Industry  disclosed its plan to drastically review Japan industrial  standards (JIS), which are often criticized by other countries  as being a trade barrier. The plan is aimed at actively  supporting efforts to standardize industrial products in Asia,  which has become the center of the world's growth; at launching  measures for Asia to create international standard  specifications, and at using revised JIS as a guide to maintain  the transparency of trade. To clarify its policy to give  importance to consumers, the ISTA will consider abolishing  standards which attach too much importance to manufacturers.  The agency is to formulate a draft plan for the review by the  end of April. After being discussed by the Japanese Industrial  Standards Committee (chaired by Isamu Yamashita), the plan will  be included in the eighth five-year products standardization  program, which is to come into effect in fiscal year 1996.    The main pillars of the revision will be: 1)  internationalization; 2) a shift of importance to consumers; and  3) the flexible adjustment of JIS to new processes such as  multimedia technology.    Japan has tried to internationalize its industrial standards  primarily through adjusting them to those of the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). However, because ISO is  composed mainly of European countries, only 20 to 30 percent of  JIS have so far been adjusted to ISO standards. Meanwhile, it  is considered certain that many new products will be developed  in Asia, a region with a strong momentum of growth, and various  problems will crop up concerning new standards. The government  plans to actively participate in the work to establish  international standards by such means as promoting  standardization mainly in Asia and strengthening efforts to have  the ISO approve Asian standards as official ones.    This month, the government started discussions on the  establishment of a system to promote standardization with the  ASEAN Association for Standardizing Quality Control (ACCQ)  [acronym as published], which is composed of six Southeast Asian  nations. With reference to Japan's know-how, they will work out  their own five-year programs for the promotion of  standardization and will carry them out beginning April 1995.    Japan will also work to establish standards for such  products  as hearing aids and walking sticks, which are essential to  living in an aging society and for a rich life. There are  currently no standards for them. On the other hand, it will  abolish standards established to promote exchanges of parts  between manufacturers, and those for mature products such as  sewing machine parts whose shapes are not expected to diversify  any further.</p>

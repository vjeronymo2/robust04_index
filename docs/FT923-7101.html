			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / India's external debt may reach Dollars 93bn in five years INDIA'S external debt will rise to Dollars 93bn (Pounds 48.6bn) in five years from Dollars 74bn now, mostly because of increased foreign aid, the World Bank said in an annual confidential report to India's aid donors, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The bank said India would need about Dollars 10bn a year for the next five years to finance the current account deficit, repay its debt and increase foreign exchange reserves. India's current account deficit in 1992-93 is expected to double to Dollars 6bn from Dollars 3bn the previous year mostly due to the lifting of import curbs, the report said. The curbs were imposed in April 1991 when India was in the throes of a severe balance of payments crisis, amid caste and religious strife and political upheaval. Foreign bankers refused to extend new loans. The crisis forced Delhi to borrow Dollars 2.2bn from the International Monetary Fund and embark on a reform programme. 'Despite the large (debt) repayments, the substantial inflow of official assistance required to support the adjustment programme would raise India's external debt. . .to Dollars 93bn in 1996-97,' the report said. It said much of the aid to India in the past had not been used because of bureaucratic logjams and the government's inability to raise matching funds for projects. Foreign investment has had a small role in India. It averaged Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m a year from 1985-90, as opposed to Dollars 700m to Dollars 1bn a year in Indonesia, Dollars 1bn to Dollars 2bn in Thailand and Brazil and Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn in China.</p>

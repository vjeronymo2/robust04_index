			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Spirits sector active SHARES IN the big spirits distilling companies showed a mixed performance, with Guinness reacting most favourably to news that the European Community intends to leave current rates of excise duty unchanged. Guinness jumped 21 to 534p, but Grand Metropolitan gained only a penny to 415p in spite of hefty turnover of 6.8m shares, while Allied-Lyons lost ground. Mr John Wakely, drinks analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the decision to freeze excise taxes at a lower rate for southern Europe than generally applies in the north will have very important implications over the next few years. Duty in southern Europe is little more than the equivalent of Pounds 1 per standard bottle, compared with about Pounds 5 per bottle in Britain. From the beginning of next year, UK consumers will be able to import from the Continent substantially higher amounts of beer, wine and spirits, and Mr Wakely believes that if the UK authorities wish to maintain a reasonable level of sales 'in the long run they will have to cut excise duties'. Such a development is likely to boost sales of spirits in the UK. MMC rules Allied-Lyons finished well above the day's low, helped by the European Community ruling on excise taxes, to leave just a net decline of 3 at 602p on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's (MMC) recommendation that Allied's proposed brewing deal with Carlsberg should not go ahead in its present form. The shares fell to 592p on disappointment with the decision of the MMC - which had generally been expected to approve the deal - as the ruling argued that there were several reasons why the joint lager brewing agreement 'may be expected to work against the public interest unless modifications are made'. Before the MMC announcement, Allied shares had been boosted by a buy recommendation from County NatWest. Business was brisk, with 4.1m shares changing hands during the day. Generators upset The two English and Welsh power generation companies, PowerGen and National Power, were respectively the day's second and third worst performers in the Footsie list amid fears that they may face a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The referral worries emerged after news that Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, has requested an explanation from the generators as to why electricity prices have risen so sharply since May. PowerGen fell 11, or 4.3 per cent, to 245p on heavy turnover of 5.2m shares, while National Power retreated 10, or 4.1 per cent, to 232p on 8.1m traded. Specialists were surprised at the market's strong response to the news, saying it was too early to gauge whether the generators' reply would be sufficient to head off the likelihood of an investigation into electricity prices. 'But the market has obviously taken fright at the uncertainty,' said one analyst. New BAe setback The long-running story that the European Commission may yet require British Aerospace (BAe)to repay alleged illegal state aid, or 'sweeteners', paid by the UK government to the group when it took over the Rover Group triggered a slide in BAe shares. The day's weakest individual performer among the Footsie's constituents, the stock closed a net 10 lower at 180p, or some 5.3 per cent down, having been as low as 178p. Turnover was 3.3m shares. BAe is alleged to have received around Pounds 45m when it acquired Rover in 1988. Mirror Group Newspapers encountered its first sustained bout of selling pressure since the relisting a week last Friday. The shares, which were requoted around the 50p mark, faltered at the outset yesterday and retreated from an opening 74p to touch 67p before stabilising and ending another busy session only a fraction easier at 73p. Turnover reached 5.2m. Reuters, badly mauled over the past couple of weeks, staged a strong rally, with bear-closing said to have been a big factor in pushing the shares up 42 to 1027p. A series of savage profits downgrades caused Kwik-Fit, the tyres and exhaust replacement company, to plunge 44 to 125p, the day's steepest individual decline on the London stock market. The drop in the share price was accompanied by some exceptionally heavy activity in the stock, with some 4m shares changing hands. The company's joint brokers were among those houses downgrading. Panmure Gordon was said to have chopped its current-year profits forecast from Pounds 36m to Pounds 23m and that for next year from Pounds 40m to Pounds 30m. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was thought to have lopped Pounds 11m from this year's estimate to Pounds 24m, and Pounds 12m to Pounds 28m for the following year. A block of 7.7m Pilkington shares were traded at 78p - well below the ruling price of 89p - minutes before the official close. The deal was thought to have been a bed and breakfast (or tax-related) deal. British Gas, up 4 at 245p, benefited from a series of sizeable switches from the power generators. Diploma fell 11 to 268p as a profits downgrade from Smith New Court coincided with a hefty selling order from another top UK broking firm. A large line of stock in BOC sent the shares down 10 to 614p. Fibre maker British Vita suffered in similar circumstances as dealers reported difficulties in placing a line of 400,000 shares. The stock finished 4 down at 240p on turnover of 1.2m. A Pounds 15.8m one-for-10 rights issue from ML Laboratories left the drugs group 28 adrift at 735p. Continuing positive noises from the tour operators that summer bookings were picking up and discounting going down lifted selected holiday stocks. Property and leisure group Ladbroke benefited from positive notes from County NatWest and SG Warburg, the former advising a buy on secure dividend consideration. The shares rose 6 to 177p. Market sentiment also helped Thorn EMI, 15 ahead at 732p, and Granada, 12 up at 245p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (3).

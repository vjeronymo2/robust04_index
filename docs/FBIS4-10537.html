			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio by reporter </F> Juan Luis Font at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City on 6  April -- first two paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] It is the first Wednesday of April at 2200, and the  Presidential Palace is full of people. President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio has been talking for more than one hour with a delegation  from the private sector, among whom are Peter Lamport and Victor  Suarez. It appears the give and take on tax reform--seen by the  government as salvation from the financial chaos in which it  finds itself--still have a long way to go. In the Room of  Mirrors more than 30 union leaders are waiting for the  government's last proposal to end the two-and-a-half-month old  bureaucratic strike. Via the president's private telephone  line, the deputies are requesting a midnight meeting to discuss  the implications of this afternoon's attack on Obdulio  Chinchilla.    The economic difficulties, the confrontation with the  public,  the new acts of violence, which have added to the air of  xenophobia, and the murder of the Constitutional Court president  all seem to indicate a slowly simmering plot and an urgent need  for a state of emergency. The stew of the crisis is on the  verge of boiling over now, and the president has his back  against the wall.    [Font] It appears someone is bent on forcing the suspension  of guarantees.    [De Leon] There are many theories on the origin of violence.  One of these points to a group which wants to destabilize the  government, create anarchy, and force me to decree a state of  emergency.    These sectors believe a suspension of guarantees would bring  benefits, but they do not realize if this is decreed we would  utilize the full extent of the law. Our security forces would  be ready to operate efficiently. We are already prepared should  this occur.    [Font] If the government is prepared to take action in a  state of emergency, does this mean the decision to implement  this state of emergency is imminent?    [De Leon] Every president can count on this resource. I do  not rule it out.    [Font] Why did you decide to postpone the measure?    [De Leon] Because it has its disadvantages. Our security  forces do not have enough training to act in these  circumstances. Meanwhile, the state of emergency would interrupt  the legislative election process. In addition, our image would  suffer internationally.    [Font] Could the UN Verification Commission, which was  recently agreed upon with the guerrillas, carry out their duties  with suspended guarantees?    [De Leon] Probably not. It is possible the liberties granted  to the Verification Commission in the agreement with the  guerrillas, such as unrestricted access, would be restricted in  this case. The subversives could use this as a pretext not to  fulfill the agreement.    [Font] You only mentioned specifically the guerrillas as one  of the sectors that could be interested in putting you up  against the wall concerning a state of emergency decree. Who  are the others?    [De Leon] The sectors that after 30 years of war still have  not understood democracy is the best road for the nation.    [Font] Are there members of those sectors in the Army?    [De Leon] No, not there. Outside the Army it is possible,  not inside.    [Font] You have given a greater role to the Army than your  predecessors in formulating your government policy.    [De Leon] No. I have not given a greater role to the  military than other governments. To which officers are you  referring?    [Font] It is said the center of power revolves around the  Presidential Staff chief and the G-2 [military intelligence].    [De Leon] Many things are said. It is also said Finance  Minister and Presidency Secretary Ana de Molina has all the  power, or that Foreign Minister Martiza Ruiz is the  superminister. Both are excellent government officials. This  is the case of Colonel Otto Perez Molina. He is a leader within  the Army, and, of course, he had power because he is near the  president.    [Font] Is that why he is establishing your government  strategies?    [De Leon] He does have some degree of participation in  defining government policy, but it is limited to certain areas.  So much is being said, but a president needs his team.    [Font] Why did you appoint Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida,  former military intelligence director, as the deputy government  minister?    [De Leon] I need him to coordinate the security forces. He  is a brilliant and very capable officer, and the people are  demanding security.    [Font] Doesn't that mean the military is gaining greater  influence within your government?    [De Leon] The Army did not suggest the appointment, nor did  they impose him upon me. I asked him to take a job in which he  will he extremely useful to me. His experience and the kind of  information he handles make him the best possible coordinator I  could have for the security forces. Military cooperation is  needed now. The Armed Forces and I agree on the need to  demilitarize the public security system, but there must still be  a transition period from one state to the other.    [Font] First, you appointed a completely civilian security  team. What made you change your mind?    [De Leon] I realized we had made a mistake. We tried  cutting off military participation in matters of public security  completel but we were unable to do this. I realize this could  be seen as regression, but I do not mind. I am sure I will lay  the foundations for a professional civilian security force.    I avc not given the military more participation than other  governments have, as you charged. What I did do was consolidate  the Army's institutionality. That, I did manage to do. I feel  fully in control now. The current military leaders back the  president, and they have a very clear picture about my  government's objectives and their commitment to democracy.    [Font] Most people believe, however, removing General Jose  Luis Quilo Ayuso has also created division within the  institution, between those who believed in him and those who  follow you.    [De Leon] No one questioned my decision to remove Gen.  Quilo. One does not question an order in the Armed Forces; one  obeys it. Quilo's outburst was an understandable reaction to his  discharge.    [Font] Many say you are a dubious and undecided president  who has let things get out of hand.    [De Leon] There are very few who say I am dubious and  undecided. When I tour the countryside, even here in the city,  people always tell me encouraging things in the street. If the  polls say my popularity is slipping, we must remember no one has  ever received a country in worse condition than I did.  Furthermore, I have not exactly chosen the easy way of solving  problems.    [Font] You and your government have been criticized for  being slow to react to the Constitutionality Court president's  death, for example.    [De Leon] It is unfair to say the government or the  president was late in reacting to the death of Chief Justice  Gonzalez. Barely minutes after the incident we put all our  resources into motion to investigate the crime and protect his  family. I went to the funeral, and almost all the cabinet  members were there.    [Font] The investigations do not seem to have produced any  results. Will international experts be called in to resolve the  case?    [De Leon] I understand the desperation caused by an  unresolved political crime, such as the Epaminonda Gonzalez  case, but we do not plan to bring in international experts to  conduct investigations.    Violence is the country's most difficult problem I have had  to face. Certain people have asked me to act stronghandedly,  knowing this cannot be done. We must act in accordance with the  law. Under current circumstances, with a judicial branch as the  one we have and the kind of Congress we have had thus far, what  do you expect me to do?    I cannot promise I will stop violence, as first I would have  to resolve the problems that cause it. After so many years of  social injustice, I hope to lay down the foundations for future  solutions.    [Font] Are you concerned about rumors the U.S. Embassy has  reinstated an old plan to evacuate U.S. citizens should there be  more violent actions against them?    [De Leon] There is a xenophobia in Guatemala that has even  reached the U.S. Embassy. The media should help eradicate that  xenophobia, which has become another method of destabilization.    [Font] On another subject, at the current pace it seems by  the end of your presidential term the economic crisis will be  worse than now.    [De Leon] No. We will straighten out public finances. We  will achieve our goals in tax revenues and social investment.  For the first time in many years, 28 percent of the budget will  be invested in the country. We are working in the country's  interior, although you may not see it.    [Font] Why have you found it so difficult to implement tax  reforms?    [De Leon] Who says it has been difficult? Only a short  while ago we started evaluating, together with the private  sector, the tax reform options recommended by the economic  cabinet.    [Font] Don't you believe you are making too many concessions  to the private sector?    [De Leon] Of course not. If for any reason whatsoever I have  taken my time in approving the tax reforms it is because I want  to take the necessary precautions so as not to affect the people  and to ensure those who can afford to pay more taxes.    [Font] Will you be the president who sells off state  property?    [De Leon] I plan to be the president who breaks up  monopolies whenever necessary, privatize whenever it is  necessary, and sell off state property whenever it serves to  benefit consumers and modernize the country. I do not plan to  do it just to get rid of any debt but, rather, to reorganize the  state.    [Font] Are you willing to end monopolies and privatize in  exchange for the private sector being willing to pay more taxes?    [De Leon] There is no on-going negotiation between the  private sector and the government leading to tax reform in  exchange for privatization. Decisions related to ending  monopolies and privatizing were already included in the  government's agenda when I began my administration. If anyone  has any doubts, they simply have to check out the documents we  published at the time. This process is going to take place  openly.    [Font] Do you agree with the concept of fiscal crime?    [De Leon] I do. I believe certain minimum penalties could  ensure more efficiency in the process of tax collection.    [Font] Concerning the rapprochement between the executive  branch and Congress, can this be interpreted as a political  understanding that eases the way to the approval of new laws?    [De Leon] No. There is no other agreement between the  government and the political parties except that which was  signed before the bishops.    [Font] Do you feel the people appreciate you?    [De Leon] I feel misunderstood by a vast majority of the  public.    [Font] How do you want to be remembered?    [De Leon] I want to be remembered as an honest president who  combated corruption and achieved peace.    [Font] What assets have you declared?    [De Leon] Two homes, my office, my bank accounts, and my  wife's Antigua farm and home. The house from which I escaped  through the roof on 25 May was rented, but I am going back to  live there.    [Font] Do you consider yourself a daring president?    [De Leon] Yes, but I have my own style. I do not go boasting  about it like others. I play chess, and I venture to play on  several boards at the same time.    [Font] Do you consider yourself as daring in your private  time?    [De Leon] I can tell you that several days ago I was  swimming  in the turbulent waters of the Pacific. I like to climb  mountains. Nevertheless, I would say in my private life I do not  run so many risks.    [Font] What dictatorial action tempts you?    [De Leon] I would like to resolve the nation's violence.    [Font] How did you react to problems as a child?    [De Leon] I always faced them. My mother insists I never  told lies.    [Font] Invalidation of the preliminary hearing against you  infers something else.    [De Leon] It does not. Invalidation of the preliminary  hearing against me is irrelevant. I was surprised by this  action and not at  all happy the deputies put me in the same boat as the others.  Besides, the preliminary hearing against me is based on a  ridiculous accusation of human rights violations, given the hike  in electricity rates.    [Font] Do you fear the coming months?    [De Leon] Not at all, the coming months will be difficult  but  not insurmountable. I am sure, thanks to the measures we are  taking, the force of order, the force of a government that is  not weak, will be felt.    [Font] With an electoral process on the doorsteps, it is  easy  to assume the violations will be heightened in the coming months.    [De Leon] We are at the end of three decades of political  and  common violence. Following the signing of the agreement with  the guerrillas two weeks ago we are very near to securing peace.  The road we still have to cover is very thorny. To that, one  must add violence, which an electoral process always generates.  I am well aware of all of this, but I believe this will be the  last breath of violence in Guatemala, but what can I do? The  people approved the legislative elections in a referendum.</p>

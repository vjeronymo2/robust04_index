			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Rapid Deployment Brigade Is Not Only </F> for the United Nations's Needs"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Army has devised a different  system for combat readiness and combat alert than under the  former regime. At that time, "an enemy attack was expected  every minute." This ensues from the current military-political  situation within whose framework a so-called unexpected war in  Europe can no longer break out. Therefore, even the Slovak  Army's special battalion, intended to fulfill UN peacekeeping  tasks, cannot be deployed without lengthy intergovernment  negotiations and decisions. This statement was made by Defense  Ministry State Secretary Major General Andrej Sabol.    He was reacting to a report published at the end of last  week  in the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which, in connection with the  formation of a special unit intended for the UN's needs, stated:  "Specifically, this means always keeping on alert at home a  battalion of professional soldiers who have to be ready for  immediate deployment." Gen. Sabol added, in this connection,  that it should be the so-called rapid deployment brigade that is  the best trained and ready for deployment anywhere on Slovak  territory. He emphasized that it should not only be deployed  for the Army's needs, but also, for example, in ecological or  technological accidents. The special battalion may also be  deployed for UN peacekeeping purposes; however, it is necessary  to overcome several problems. These include mastering the  English language, and the command system has to be compatible  with that of the United Nations.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The state's Fair Political Practices Commission agreed that San Francisco Mayor  Art Agnos should pay a $7,000 fine for failing to disclose $441,521 in real  estate income while a state legislator. The fine also covered Agnos' failure to  disclose the source of a political mailing. The five-member commission voted  unanimously to accept a settlement negotiated by Agnos and the commission  staff. Agnos admitted failure to disclose the property transactions while he  was an assemblyman, as required by law. Last September, he used stationery from  the mayor's office, rather than from a campaign committee, for letters  supporting the stationing of the battleship Missouri in San Francisco.  </P></p>

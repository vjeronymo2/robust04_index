			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Ripa di Meanawill not attend Earth Summit THE European Commission is refusing to send its environment commissioner to the Earth Summit in Brazil next week because of the failure of world leaders to agree to binding commitments to reduce global pollution. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana said yesterday he would not go to a meeting 'where everything has been fixed in advance' and which would just produce 'words, rather than binding obligations and precise understandings' on how to cut carbon emissions. Brussels will send the director-general of its environment service instead. Mr Ripa di Meana's absence from the Rio summit is a further sign of the disarray among the industrial countries and it will further reduce popular expectations about the outcome. However, Mr Ripa di Meana's views appear not to be widely shared among EC governments, whose top representatives will attend. It was the prospect of non-binding treaties emerging from the summit that eventually persuaded President George Bush to attend. He had made clear he was unwilling to commit the US to specific targets. Like the US president, Mr Ripa di Meana had tried to use doubts over his presence in Rio as leverage. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby, yesterday said his boycott exposed the 'hypocrisy of Mr Bush and others who are going along to the meeting pretending everything is fine'. Mr Ripa di Meana's protest action was largely directed at EC environment ministers, who failed in Brussels on Tuesday to do more than 'note' the Commission's plans for a carbon tax and specific energy-saving measures. He was particularly irritated at being criticised by northern 'green' countries for making the EC carbon tax plan conditional on similar US and Japanese action. Mr Ripa di Meana's move came as a UN panel of scientific experts reaffirmed earlier warnings about the dangers of global warming ahead of the Rio gathering. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that emissions of greenhouse gases could push up the world temperature between 1.5 and 3.5 degrees over the next 100 years.

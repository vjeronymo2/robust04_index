			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Consultative Council, which was formed  last year to oversee Malawi's political transition to multiparty  democracy, has been wound up. Speaking at the final press  conference in Lilongwe, the chairman of the council for the  month of May, Mr. Lovemore Munlo, commended the role of the  council played during the transition period. He explained that  the council was instrumental in changing the political scene in  Malawi, thereby producing the first parliament and president in  a multiparty system.    On the council's final discussions, Mr. Munlo said members  had appealed to the newly-instituted government to consider  funding political parties to pay their election monitors. He  explained that it is a constitutional requirement that  government should fund political parties, to ensure their  continuity, and also allow competitive politics as a pillar of  multiparty politics in Malawi. Mr. Munlo also said that the  council had agreed to turn the (?returnee) committee into a  commission which will cater not only for returnees but also for  destitutes.</p>

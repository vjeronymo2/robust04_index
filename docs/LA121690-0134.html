			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TITANS GET THEIR POINTS ACROSS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MISSISSIPPI VALLEY STATE STAR FORD SCORES 39, BUT CAL STATE  FULLERTON PICKS UP THE 109-100 VICTORY.  </P> <P> Mississippi Valley State guard Alphonso Ford got his points Saturday night, but  Cal State Fullerton got a victory, defeating the Delta Devils, 109-100, before  1,715 in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> Fullerton Coach John Sneed said earlier this week that his team would make  Ford's 40 minutes in Titan Gym "miserable," and he guaranteed Ford would not  score his average, which was 34.1.  </P> <P> Sneed was partially correct. The Titans made life miserable for Ford, throwing  several different defenses at him and making him work hard for most of his  shots.  </P> <P> Fullerton forward Bruce Bowen's elbow into Ford's face even knocked Ford out of  the game for a few minutes in the second half.  </P> <P> Ford still finished with a game-high 39 points, but it was Sneed who was  smiling afterward.  </P> <P> "He got his average, but we got a win," Sneed said. "I didn't say those things  because I didn't have respect for him. I just wanted to motivate my players. We  had guys who were hungry to play defense tonight."  </P> <P> The Titans apparently had a big appetite for offense, too. Their point total  was the most since Fullerton scored 117 against U.S. International University  in 1985.  </P> <P> Joe Small scored 29 points, making 12 of 17 shots from the field and five  three-point baskets. When Mississippi Valley State cut Fullerton's lead to  84-80 midway through the second half, Small made two consecutive three-point  shots to make it 90-80.  </P> <P> Reserve forward J. D. Green, the former Fairfax High standout who transferred  from Southern Methodist, had his best game as a Titan, scoring 23 points and  grabbing 14 rebounds, eight of them offensive. He also made a clutch  three-point shot after the Delta Devils had pulled to within 79-74.  </P> <P> Fullerton center Aaron Wilhite added a career-high 18 points and eight  rebounds, forward Agee Ward had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and reserve center  Ron Caldwell had 10 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Fullerton outrebounded Mississippi Valley State, 66-40, coming up just short of  its school-record 68 rebounds in a game.  </P> <P> The Titans led by as many as 15 in the first half, scoring 10 unanswered points  -- seven by Small -- to go ahead, 44-29, at the 6:36 mark.  </P> <P> Defense set up two Fullerton baskets during the run, with Bowen's blocked shot  starting a break that resulted in Small's three-point basket and Caldwell's  block, on a three-on-one Delta Devils break, leading to Small's jumper.  </P> <P> Mississippi Valley State came back with its own 10-0 run to pull to within  47-43 with 4:28 remaining, but Fullerton outscored the Delta Devils, 8-2, the  final four points scored by Green, to close the half with a 57-47 lead.  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Bentsen tax team in place MR Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, has put his tax team into place with the nomination of Mr Leslie Samuels to be assistant secretary for tax policy, and of Mrs Peggy Richardson to be commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, George Graham writes from Washington. Mr Samuels is a partner with the New York law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton. Mrs Richardson is a partner in the Washington office of Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, specialising in tax and insurance regulation. The appointments to the senior tax positions at the Treasury have been the subject of considerable interest for foreign companies and tax specialists, because of the recent attention which has been paid to issues of transfer pricing and multinational taxation. Washington lawyers said Mr Samuels was a widely respected practitioner with an extensive background in foreign taxation issues. In addition, he has worked closely before with some of Mr Bentsen's aides from the Senate finance committee who have already been installed in the second tier of the tax policy division.</p>

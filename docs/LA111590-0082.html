			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> RETIRING DISTRICT HEAD TO BE HONORED  </P> <P> A reception today will honor Helen Beebe, who is retiring next month as board  president of the Simi Valley Unified School District after more than 20 years  in various district positions.  </P> <P> Beebe, who has served on the board for nine years, started with the district in  1968 as a junior high school principal and retired in 1981 as director of  curriculum.  </P> <P> She was appointed to the board in February, 1982, to fill a vacancy created  when a member moved, and voters twice returned her to office.  </P> <P> She did not seek reelection this year, saying that she wanted to spend more  time volunteering for her church and for the American Cancer Society.  </P> <P> She is credited with pushing for smoke-free campuses and voluntary drug testing  for athletes, and was a strong supporter of implementing a middle-school system  in the district.  </P> <P> "This community has a good school system, but I don't think they always  appreciate it," said Beebe, who is 67. "They sometimes get bent out of shape  about one issue and forget about the whole picture."  </P> <P> The two board seats at stake in the Nov. 6 election were filled by political  newcomer Carla Kurachi, who had 31.8% of the vote, and businessman Douglas  Crosse, who had 20.1%, unseating incumbent Lewis Ross.  </P> <P> The reception for Beebe will begin at 3:30 p.m. at the district's headquarters,  875 E. Cochran St. Her last school board meeting will be Dec. 4, and the new  board will meet Dec. 18. STEPHANIE STASSEL  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to Cairo talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place  and date note given; from the "With the Midday Events"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, good evening.    [Sha'th] Good evening. You are welcome.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, hopes are rife that the negotiations  will end before the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. Is what remains only  time to draft the clauses of the agreement or are there other  substantive issues?    [Sha'th] No substantive issues remain to hamper this  agreement. Naturally, one always tries to confine his optimism  to the framework of what is possible and realistic. Therefore,  I cannot be absolutely certain, but can say we may conclude all  these matters before 'Id al-Fitr, God willing.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the Israel Defense Forces'  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, has agreement been  reached on dates?    [Sha'th] Agreement has been reached on the withdrawal plan  and dates, but the first day of withdrawal depends on the day of  signing. Consequently, it is an integrated timetable which  lacks only the date of signing which will be the starting day of  withdrawal.    [Mu'addi] What was agreed regarding the Palestinian police  force? When will the vanguards of this force arrive in the Gaza  Strip?    [Sha'th] Several officers will go there as of now to make  the  necessary preparations and contact the Israeli military  commanders in Gaza in order to define the Palestinian police  positions and what is required before the rest of the police  forces arrive. Once the agreement is signed, the Palestinian  police forces will begin to leave for the Strip and Jericho.  They will do so before the Israeli withdrawal starts so that  they will accurately learn all positions and needs on the  ground. These forces will arrive in stages and gradually take  up their positions prior to withdrawal. The withdrawal will then  immediately commence from the positions, one at a time.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you realize that the issue of releasing  prisoners is the main preoccupation of the people on the street.  What stage have you reached in this regard?    [Sha'th] This subject preoccupies us as well. I think there  is a favorable Israeli response in this regard and a feeling of  its importance for Palestinians and the coming peace and the  start of a new stage of relations. Therefore, we are conducting  these negotiations, in addition to all other activities, day by  day. I think we got closer in some points and others need to be  finalized. What is important is to agree to a timetable for the  release of all prisoners, even if this timetable is spread over  a period of time that includes withdrawal and completion of the  agreement on the West Bank, too. We want all prisoners to  eventually return home in peace. We want to see an end to this  period so a new era of peace can begin.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. When do you expect a  summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat?    [Sha'th] This, of course, depends on the day of signing.  They might meet one or two days before the signing to discuss  those issues left for them to finish. Therefore, if the signing  is ready before 'Id al-Fitr, then the two leaders will meet  before 'Id al-Fitr.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation to Cairo talks, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you and welcome.</p>

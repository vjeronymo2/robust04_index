			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interviews with four recaptured prisoners by Mouloud </F> Benmohamed; place and date not given: "The Lambese Prison: Five  [as published] Escapees Speak"--first paragraph is EL MOUDJAHID  introduction]    [Text] "The attackers were wearing prison guard uniforms."  "Some were wearing military uniforms." "There were vehicles in  which the death row inmates were driven away." "No. There  weren't any vehicles." Even if they seem contradictory, these  reports by escapees--who were either arrested or taken into  custody--tell us one thing at least. Or rather they confirm  something. The breakout was carefully organized down to the  tiniest detail. We spoke with five of the recaptured prisoners.  [sentence as published] Their statements are more than eloquent.  <H5>  M.M. (Serving a Life Sentence): "Get Out or Die" </H5>   [Benmohamed] How did you escape?    [M.M.] I have been in jail for three years. I was sentenced  to life in prison. I was alone in my cell, I had just broken the  fast and heard shouts of "Allahu Akbar." For me, that was the  usual thing, so I didn't try to find out anything else. Suddenly  there were shouts. Some people were breaking the locks on the  cells. One of them opened the door to my cell with some keys and  he spoke to me saying: "Get out!" He had a Kalashnikov rifle and  I was standing opposite him, next to the bed. I asked him:  "Where?" He answered: "The mountains." "Why?" I asked. He then  loaded his weapon and told me: "Either you get out or I shoot  you. You have a choice. It's up to you to decide but do it soon  or I'll decide for you." What should I do? I got out. Once I was  at the main entrance gate, another armed man pointed out the  road I should take and repeated "go up to the mountains." There  were a lot of us. I was among the last ones.    [Benmohamed] Did you notice any vehicles in front of the  prison's entrance gate?    [M.M.] No, no vehicle.    [Benmohamed] Then what happened?    [M.M.] A few minutes later, maybe a half hour, we stopped  running to rest.    [Benmohamed] How many of you were there?    [M.M.] Between 50 and 60 prisoners. We were in the middle of  the forest. One of the armed men asked us to split into two  groups. In one there were those who had been sentenced by the  special courts and in the other the common criminals. Then he  spoke to the common criminals saying: "As of now, we don't know  you; may Allah help you." He was the oldest one, 35 or 36 years  old. He had a beard. He was wearing a prison guard uniform. He  set off together with the men who were accompanying him and the  special court prisoners. As for us, we went in our direction. We  walked day and night in the mountains. There were 10 of us. We  consulted one another. On the second day, the eve of the Aid, I  couldn't fast. We had nothing to eat. On Sunday I suggested to  my companions that we become prisoners. We were eating grass.  They didn't agree with me because they were afraid. We were in  the Ain Touta mountains. As of that moment, my companions began  to distrust me. In the evening, I pretended to go off to tend to  my bodily functions in the forest and left them. I walked for a  long time at night. I was cold and hungry. I made a wood fire to  warm up. I was very tired. On Tuesday, at dawn, I saw a military  roadblock. I came down from the mountains and went straight  towards the soldiers. I raised my arms as a sign that I meant no  harm. I became a prisoner. That morning I was introduced to the  prosecutor. I have just been sent to the Lambese prison. Between  yesterday, when I was an escapee, and today, when I'm a  prisoner, it's the difference between life and death. These  aren't human beings.    [Benmohamed] Why?    [M.M.] They get us out of prison, they send us to the  mountains, then they leave us in the middle of nowhere. Nothing  to eat, no notion of the road, no money...No.    I was forced to escape. Either escape or die. Anyone else in  my shoes would have done the same thing. That's what I told the  prosecutor. I wasn't the only escapee in his office. There are  others who are waiting to be questioned.    [Benmohamed] Have they become prisoners?    [M.M.] Some yes. Most were arrested. There are a lot of  them.  <H5>  B.M. (Sentenced by the Special Court in Constantine, the </H5> "Fax Network"): "Why Escape?"    [Benmohamed] Could you say why you took part in the  breakout?    [B.M.] I was sentenced by the special court in Constantine  as  part of the fax network. I taught computer science at the  university of Batna. I've got three years left to serve. I  didn't take part directly in the escape.    [Benmohamed] But you're an escapee...    [B.M.] Yes, I'm an escapee. I got out of the prison because  I  had problems. The prison gates were open for everyone. I had to  leave the prison just like everyone else.    Together with all the prisoners who had been sentenced by  the  special courts, I was in room 10. We heard rounds of gunfire; we  started to look through the windows and we didn't understand.  The lights were out for about a half hour; then the door to the  room was opened by an armed man who told us: "All your  companions have gone; you have to leave the room." So we all  left, no problems, no obstacles, all the doors to the cells and  the prison were open, everyone got out without any problems. I  did the same thing but I understood that it wasn't normal. I  didn't want to have any problems.    [Benmohamed] Did you notice something unusual on the day of  the breakout? Was it planned for that day?    [B.M.] Everything was normal. Personally I wasn't warned.    I'm convinced it was the same for my fellow prisoners. We  were all thinking about a general amnesty on the eve of the Aid.  Nobody, as far as I know, was informed with regard to this  escape.    [Benmohamed] What happened once you were outside?    [B.M.] The prisoners were sent towards the mountains. There  were a lot of people. I too went in the direction of the  mountains but I stopped just behind the houses of Tazoult. Two  hours later, once there was nobody else around, I decided to  return to the prison. From afar, I saw that the prison gates  were shut. There were also some gendarmes, policemen, and  soldiers. I was afraid. So I took the Batna road. On the road I  met a police car. I turned myself over to them and I spent the  night at the police station.    [Benmohamed] Why did you turn yourself over to the  policemen?    [B.H.] First, I've been sentenced to a short term. So why  should I escape and risk a longer one? Second, I was expecting  an amnesty. What the newspapers are writing proves that the  situation is going to improve with the arrival of the president.  So why should I escape? I'm not convinced about escaping, about  creating anarchy and experiencing other problems. That's my  opinion. When he came the president said two words to us:  "Fraternal dialogue." That's the main thing. I'm convinced, so  why push? It's better to wait for a solution for everyone.    Furthermore, I didn't want to leave because the mountain  isn't easy. You need an organization and I'm not part of it. I  don't have any weapons. To go means dying. I have five children.  I chose to analyze the situation.    [Benmohamed] Were your fellow prisoners of the same opinion?    [B.M.] Some were. These were university teachers and  engineers who were expecting a pardon. They were expecting a  rahma. They were even afraid of even more serious problems. I  should mention to you that these were prisoners sentenced by the  special courts, all for terms of under five years. They have  nothing to do with the blood that's been shed.    The others think the president should demonstrate his  sincerity and accessibility by, for example, issuing an amnesty  to the prisoners to encourage dialogue. I'm speaking of amnesty  on behalf of prisoners who have no link to crimes connected with  terrorism. Who forced this multiparty system of which we're the  victims? They wanted to imitate Europe. There are other problems  to solve. Personally I'm back in prison while my children have  been left to themselves.  <H5>  B.M. (Sentenced to a 12-Year Term): "I Turned Myself Over to </H5> the Gendarmerie"    [Benmohamed] What happened at the time of the breakout?    [B.M.] I'm the No. 2 man in room 20, where there were only  special court prisoners. Two or three minutes after the Maghreb,  there were gunshots. We thought there was a revolt in room 11.  Certain prisoners told us: "No. The brothers are here."    [Benmohamed] In your opinion, did they know about the  escape?    [B.M.] Perhaps. You can't tell. No one trusts anyone. There  were 42 of us. Next, there was some noise, some shouts, and some  rounds of gunfire. One of us broke a bed to break the lock with  an iron bar. That didn't help. Some of us prevented him from  breaking down the door. Through the window we saw a guard run  upstairs. Behind him there were some armed men. We called to  them to open our door. They asked us to wait. We were the last  ones to leave. Then we escaped. When I got to the entrance gate  to the prison I saw a Golf that was taking one of the death row  inmates away from the infirmary. He had lost both his legs in an  altercation before his arrest. It seems he's their chief.  Everyone was in a rush. I saw the death row prisoners in the  vehicles. As for me, I left on foot. With me were only special  court prisoners sentenced to detention. Some were accompanied by  cars up to the edge of the forest. I decided to part company  with them because I knew it would end badly. I slipped between  the houses. I met a men I asked to show me where the police  headquarters were. You could hear rounds of gunshots everywhere.  He advised me to flee saying they were going to kill me. This  man was one of the attackers and I didn't know it. I was going  to tell him that the prison had been attacked but I shut up when  I saw he was dressed strangely. He asked me if I was a brother  and I answered that I was. Then he pointed behind the buildings  to show me the mountains. I pretended I was following. Once I  had escaped I hid. Then I recognized some guards in town. I went  up to them and I explained things to them. Finally the  gendarmerie came. I became a prisoner.    [Benmohamed] Did you notice anything abnormal before the  breakout?    [B.M.] No. That morning some prisoners were pardoned. Those  who were in the same room with me weren't affected. They said  they would leave the prison by force just as they had been  jailed. We'll get out by force, they said.  <H5>  S.D. (Serving a Life Sentence): "I Followed Them, I Was </H5> Forced To"    [S.D.] At the breaking of the fast, there were rounds of  gunfire and gunshots. We went to the windows. I saw the  prisoners leave and run. I hadn't understood anything because we  saw people wearing uniforms and carrying weapons. They opened  the door to our room and told us to get out.    We were all special court prisoners. As we left the prison,  we were sent towards the moutnains. As we were walking, there  was an armed man practically every 100 meters. I couldn't follow  them because my leg hurt. I tried to flee them. I left because I  was afraid they'd kill me. After 2 km, we stopped. One of them  spoke to us. He told us that we weren't obligated to follow him  to the mountains. He gave 200 Algerian dinars to anyone who  didn't want to go up to the mountains. I thought and I decided  to go to Batna. I walked through the night and I hid in the  countryside. It was cold and I was hungry. My leg hurt. In the  morning in Batna, I bought some bread and I hid in order to eat.  I couldn't fast... Truly, I was afraid when I saw all those  armed men. I'm not trying to justify myself; it was the truth.</p>

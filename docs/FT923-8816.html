			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Panic orders prison camps to be closed: Yugoslav PM responds to worldwide anger MR Milan Panic, prime minister of Yugoslavia, yesterday said he would order the closure of all Serbian prison camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina following international condemnation of the existence of detention camps throughout the independent republic. 'I'm going to order Radovan Karadzic (leader of Bosnia's Serbs) to close down all the camps. I'm the leader of all the Serbs in the world. If he doesn't he will have to resign and go away,' said Mr Panic during a visit to Budapest, the Hungarian capital. However, he admitted he did not have full control over Mr Karadzic. Mr Karadzic, who yesterday denied prisoners had been systematically killed or tortured, said he wanted to investigate 'disobedience' by camp guards. Speaking to the London-based Independent Television News from Belgrade, Mr Karadzic repeatedly tried to shake off mounting criticism from western governments which yesterday insisted that camps be opened up to inspection. Many Moslems, forced to flee the fighting in Bosnia or forcibly deported from the republic, have described how Serb gunmen have rounded up thousands of Moslems, put them in camps, and let them leave once they have signed over their property and quit the republic. But Mr Karadzic has repeatedly denied the existence of 'ethnic cleansing', a policy aimed at creating ethnically pure Serb regions in Bosnia-Hercegovina. He also said Croats and Moslems had rejected his offer to release prisoners from the camps. Mr Panic met Mr Franjo Greguric, prime minister of Croatia. They discussed the exchange of prisoners captured last year during the Croat-Serb war in which 10,000 people were killed. Both sides agreed to 1,500 prisoners. Despite the televised film of Serbian-run detention camps in Bosnia, Mr Panic yesterday insisted that Yugoslavia had fulfilled the main condition towards the lifting of United Nations sanctions imposed on May 31 on Yugoslavia by claiming the Yugoslav army was no longer present in Bosnia. In the besieged capital of Sarajevo, artillery fire struck the headquarters of the UN forces, injuring four French peacekeepers.</p>

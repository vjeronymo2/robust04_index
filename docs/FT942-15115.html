			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The mother of all whistlers - Clive Fewins meets the man who makes and sells the famous Acme brand When Simon Topman received a letter from Sweden addressed only to 'Mr Whistle, Birmingham' he was not surprised. His company, Hudson's whistles, is familiar to the local post office and Sweden is one of 80 countries where the company's products are sold. 'We have been established so long and our trademark - Acme - is so well-known that it is not uncommon to get people from the other side of the world knocking on our door wanting to buy, or even give us a whistle,' said Topman. The gifts are from elderly users who want to send their trusty whistles back 'home' to the little works in Hockley, Birmingham for safe keeping. There they join the Acme hall of fame, just like the gift from the Irish railway guard that arrived a few weeks ago. It was an ancient Acme Thunderer, given to him in 1915 by his father, a gaelic football referee. 'Although it had been used by two men throughout their working lives it was still in excellent condition,' said Topman, 40, who placed it alongside the first Acme Metropolitan Police whistles dating from 1870, and some other rare survivors, like the only example of an ill-fated model made to imitate the sound of a tiger. The latter was designed for the British troops in the Burma campaign of 1941-2 to scare the Japanese. 'There was nothing wrong with the sound the device produced but it proved too large to form part of a soldier's kit,' Topman said. The tale of the Irish railwayman's whistle underlines Topman's worst headache. 'I don't like to blow my own whistle too much but our brass whistles don't wear out,' he said. Topman's best hope is that the owners either lose their whistles or opt for one of the cheaper plastic versions, in which case there is a chance they might become soiled or chewed round the mouthpiece. Not that the metal ones are that expensive. The Acme Thunderer costs less than Pounds 3. The price underlines Topman's other headache. To make a good profit from manufacturing such low value items means you have to make - and sell - a lot of whistles. 'In an average year we make and sell about 4m whistles, of which abut half are plastic and half metal,' Topman said. To achieve this - and a current net profit of Pounds 40,000 - the company turns over Pounds 1.5m and Topman does a great deal of travelling. 'We can't really justify a sales force, so I have to be a super-salesman and make frequent visits to our distributors all over the world,' he said. 'I call them whistle-stop tours. Most of our effort goes into manufacturing. We have a full-time workforce of 58 and, apart from a small amount of foundry work, all the processes are carried out here.' The factory is a 26,000 sq ft turn-of-the-century building just beyond Birmingham's jewellery quarter. Lurid green floor-to-ceiling tiles in the listed two storey front section of the building give it the look of a Victorian public lavatory. Behind this, in characteristic Victorian Birmingham metal-bashing fashion, the factory mainly comprises a series of ground-floor floor workshops, including the shop where Paul Nicholls hand tests every whistle Hudsons make. 'He is the country's only professional whistle tester,' said Topman. 'We are safe in saying this as we are the country's only whistle manufacturer of any size. I wish I could say I always whistle while I work]' When Topman is abroad the business is under the control of Mike Sharp, co-director and production manager. The third director is Topman's father, Arthur, 72, who has worked for the company for 37 years and is related to the Hudson family by marriage. He visits the factory for a few hours every week. Sharp is responsible for putting the trill and the shrill into the 62 different types of whistle Hudsons produce. It is a task in which he finds his clarinet playing ability (Topman is also a musician) useful. It is important that a style of whistle like the Thunderer, that has existed for 101 years, should have a consistent sound, because devotees of a particular type of whistle have an enduring loyalty. 'Calculating the pitch is a skilled business. Surely only a man named Sharp can tell when a whistle is flat]' said Topman. 'Basketball and netball referees, like a whistle with a really high pitch as the crowds are noisy and close to the players. Rugby referees like the more macho sound of an Acme Thunderer number 58, whch has a lower pitch.' The company makes game and bird calls, song whistles, orchestral whistles and sirens used by drummers for producing wind effects. They also sell to sailors, the military, and police forces in the UK and traffic police in the US and continental Europe. 'Only about 20 per cent of sales are in this country,' said Topman. 'It's not that we are swamped by cheaper foreign competition, simply that the UK market is not big enough to keep us going. We certainly couldn't survive on the UK market alone. 'Likewise we could not survive if we were to reduce our range very greatly. We make all models to order, in batches. No single line is justifiable in its own right, but it is vital to retain the entire range. It is important that our customers, some of whom come to us for several different kinds of whistle, know that we can supply all types. This spread of whistle products also means we can achieve economies of scale, and helps to cushion us against downturns in some segments of the market. 'In the last few years the European sports goods market has been down, but we have been doing very well in the far east - curiously enough in some of the countries that in the past have attempted to counterfeit our products. Nowadays people are often wealthy and successful in some of those countries and their sports referees and police demand the best  - or as I like to say, guaranteed sound.' J. Hudson and Co (whistles), 244 Barr Street, Birmingham B19 AH. 021-554-2124.</p>

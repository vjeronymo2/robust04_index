			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The annoyance of a one-man band - Andrew Bolger looks at the mounting pressure to remove Spring Ram's chairman IT IS difficult for anyone to imagine life at Spring Ram Corporation, the bathrooms and kitchens group, without Mr Bill Rooney, its 53 year-old chairman, chief executive and co-founder. That is the main reason for the current extraordinary stand-off between the City and the board of the Yorkshire company, which was a stock market star until last year. Mr Rooney is under pressure from institutional investors to resign after Spring Ram issued three profit warnings within eight months, leading to a collapse in its share price. The move is led by the Prudential Corporation, and is believed to be supported by institutions which own 35 per cent of the group's equity. Spring Ram's board met on Wednesday and issued a gnomic statement which said it both remained united in its support for Mr Rooney but 'recognises and accepts the need for immediate and major changes in the structure, style and management of the company for the 1990s.' Since then there has been only silence from the company, although with its share price languishing the board is under huge pressure to break the stalemate with some of its biggest shareholders. Mr Rooney founded the original bathrooms and kitchens fittings business in 1979. A graduate of Liverpool University, he decided to set up his own business after a management career that had started with the Milk Marketing Board and ended up with Gower Furniture in Halifax. His partner was Mr Bob Murray, a former wages clerk at the old Consett iron works who qualified as an accountant and worked with Mr Rooney at Gower Furniture. A brilliant salesman, Mr Rooney was Spring Ram's high-profile spokesman while the low-key Mr Murray concentrated on the financial side. When asked about the secret of the company's prodigious growth, Mr Rooney liked to reply 'magic beans' and run from the room to bring in a jar full of brightly coloured little balls. 'We tell people that we each eat one of these every day because they won't believe that it is just common sense.' Magic beans aside, his explanation of the group's success falls into three categories: market-led products of guaranteed quality at lower, unchanging prices; short delivery times - the company's standard is 48 hours; and motivated people, notably the directors. The companies operate separately and often compete with one another, with individual managers teams under great pressure to keep up sales. Last November the group itself blamed this 'growth culture' for serious misrepresentation and false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary. Analysts believe a key factor in Spring Ram's crisis was the departure of Mr Murray, who left the company in 1990. Mr Derek Reed, an analyst with Smith New Court, wrote recently that Mr Murray employed a degree of financial skill which, backed by his commercial acumen and intellectual rigour, has since been sorely missed. He added: 'With Mr Murray on the board, Spring Ram was run with an attention to detail which now seems to be lacking. There is no doubting the entrepreneurial skills, the innovation and the brilliant generation of ideas of Mr Rooney, but Mr Murray was patently not awarded the credit he deserved for his part in the development of the group.' In spite of the widespread perception that Spring Ram is too much of a one-man band, it has so far improved impossible for the institutions to get rid of Mr Rooney, whose family owns 16 per cent of the group. Mr Rooney has said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or chief executive, but not both. Company sources have suggested that the other executive directors would not be prepared to work with an imposed chairman. However, institutional investors insist they will fall in line with the wishes of shareholders, in spite of their loyalty to Mr Rooney. A measure of City opinion after Spring Ram's most recent profits warning came from Smith New Court: 'Incredulity and despair now best describe our emotions on discovering the latest down spiralling fortunes of Spring Ram. 'We continue to believe there is physical value to be unlocked in the company, but equally maintain that the stock is untouchable by serious investors until such time as radical progress is seen in improving management and structure. 'It is now of deep concern that the group, if left unattended by change, could implode as quickly as it grew.'</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (12): Wiser and sharper - Machine tools Few industries in Germany have suffered such a buffeting over the past four years as the 350-odd makers of machine tools - the world's largest machine tool industry after Japan and comfortably the biggest in Europe. Recession at home, naturally, took its toll. But exports account for about 65 per cent of output, and foreign sales have suffered both from the severe downturn in western markets and the collapse of markets in eastern Europe, where Germany was the dominant foreign supplier. Reunification, far from bringing the benefits - however transient - enjoyed by other industries, failed to generate extra business for machine tool builders, and decimated all but the technologically brighter stars amid the hugely overmanned east German industry. The strength of the D-Mark made it harder to make money in export markets. At the same time, the industry's customers in German manufacturing were seeking to cut their own costs and modifying their buy-German stance. Recent statistics from the VDW, the German Machine Tool Builders' Association, paint a sorry picture. Employment in the old West German industry was more than 100,000 in 1990/91, but had fallen to 73,000 by the end of last year, excluding the remaining 9,500 workers in eastern Germany. Production fell from DM17.2bn in 1991 to DM10.7bn last year, and domestic consumption from DM12.3bn to DM6.4bn over the same period. Things are now looking up - the industry's order intake for the first eight months of this year was up 22 per cent on the same period of 1993. But the traumas of the past four years have punctured the arrogance of the industry, possibly permanently, and some of its famous names, both corporate and individual, have been humbled. The intertwining, and eventually starkly contrasting, fortunes of four companies in particular, Gildemeister and Traub in turning machines and Maho and Deckel in milling and boring machines, bear witness to the upheaval in the industry. All four were separate, independent companies in the late 1980s, but even then faced strategic disadvantages vis-a-vis their Japanese competitors. Now, through a succession of sales agreements, a failed merger and a corporate collapse, Gildemeister has emerged as the owner of Deckel and Maho, combining its own turning technology with their milling and boring technology. The key event was the appointment in April of an administrator at Deckel Maho, two companies which had been at each other's throats for 20 years. 'Everybody expected that it would happen, but it was a tremendous blow for our strategy,' says Mr Axel Kemna, Gildemeister's chairman. By that stage, Deckel and Maho products were accounting for 55-60 per cent of the volume in Gildemeister's newly-formed Deckel Maho Gildemeister sales joint venture. The Deckel Maho collapse gave Gildemeister the opportunity to buy only what it needed to continue its strategy, and in July it paid DM90m to buy a package of Deckel Maho assets out of bankruptcy. Gildemeister took on about 1,000 of the 1,700 Deckel Maho employees at the time of the administration. It left behind the Deckel plant in Munich and Maho's DM160m plant at Kempten in Bavaria, a lavishly-constructed white elephant that contributed to the downfall of former Maho chairman Werner Babel. Mr Kemna believes that, with a streamlined organisation and shorn of the debts of the past, Gildemeister has a 'good chance to make something' out of Deckel Maho, whose cost base has been reduced by DM150m a year. The new, broader Gildemeister group is a stronger competitor in global machine tool markets, he says. As a measure of the upheaval, however, its workforce stands at about 2,200, against 5,000 for the three formerly independent companies, based on continuing operations. On the same basis, next year's sales are expected to be about DM550m, compared with DM1.5bn for the three companies before the recession. Traub, which was a rival bidder for Deckel Maho, has also been through considerable upheaval since 1990. Internally, production costs have been significantly reduced, with 'design for manufacturing' techniques, modular construction and fewer parts. Machines are made much more quickly, and with fewer people, than five years ago. This has raised the competitiveness of Traub's products among UK subcontractors, says Mr Paul Maynard, managing director of Traub's UK sales organisation, renamed Traub-Heckert UK in October. The name change, which is being repeated throughout most of Traub's worldwide selling organisation, reflects last year's acquisition by the Reichenbach-based company of Heckert, based at Chemnitz in former East Germany. Once again, this brings together turning and milling technology as part of a long-term global strategy - Heckert makes sophisticated machining centres. And the upheaval caused by reunification gave Traub the opportunity to buy only what it wanted from the former Honecker-regime showpiece that was employing 4,000 people in 1989. Traub currently employs just over 500 people at Heckert. 'We have bought the high-technology part of the company, which is one of the most advanced machine tool factories in Europe,' says Mr Maynard, one of Traub's senior European executives. Traub did not want Heckert's heavy-duty milling machine business, which used to make about 2,500 machines a year mainly for eastern European markets. It has turned what remains of Heckert into a centre of excellence for computer-numerical controlled (CNC) machining centres. Manufacture of Klink and Variomatic machines, formerly made in western Germany at companies acquired by Heckert, has been transferred to Chemnitz, which is to make machine beds for the Traub turning machines produced at Reichenbach. Early this month , Traub also announced it was taking a majority shareholding in Hermle, the western German milling and boring machine manufacturer with which it made a sales and distribution pact early last year. Overall, Traub's workforce has fallen from 2,500 before the recession to just over 2,000, even with the Heckert purchase. But the takeover is aimed at giving the company a better balance and, in the long-term, the Heckert range will contribute about 40 per cent of turnover, says Mr Maynard. In the first half of this year, it accounted for DM36.3m out of total turnover of DM161.1m, which itself was up 50.6 per cent from the first half of 1993. Gildemeister's Mr Kemna says he believes the industry took the right actions through the recession, but says it can hardly be blamed for not having moved quickly enough. For some German machine tool builders, especially volume producers, the decline was 60 per cent. Most machine tool executives will privately admit the recession has, paradoxically, been a good thing for the industry. It has forced it to shape a corporate and financial structure that matches the undoubted strength of its product ranges and research and development, which has been maintained throughout the downturn.  --------------------------------------------------     GERMAN MACHINE TOOL INDUSTRY 1990-93* (DMBN)  -------------------------------------------------- Year    Output      Home demand     World orders  -------------------------------------------------- 1990     16.4          11.4            17.5 1991     17.2          12.3            15.3 1992     14.2           9.5            11.6 1993     10.7           6.4             9.3  -------------------------------------------------- *Eastern Germany included from 1991  -------------------------------------------------- Source: VDW  --------------------------------------------------</p>

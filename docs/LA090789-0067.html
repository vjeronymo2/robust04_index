			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATURATION REPORTAGE MAY AID BUSH POLITICALLY;  </P> <P> MEDIA GOING ALL-OUT ON DRUG COVERAGE  </P> <P> He gazed into the camera and spoke as earnestly as he could:  </P> <P> "If this is a war," he said of the national drug crisis, "we're all soldiers.  Not a war that can be won with more money alone, or just tougher laws, or  better treatment . . . . This is a test of our national will."  </P> <P> The speaker was not President Bush giving his first prime-time address on  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> It was NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw signing off his broadcast a few hours before.  </P> <P> The American news media have responded to the President's drug policy  initiative, after a little prodding from the White House, with an extraordinary  outpouring of coverage on the drug issue.  </P> <P> Much of it, the White House believes, may work to the President's political  advantage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drugs Make Cover Story  </P> <P> Major newspapers, including this one, are filling whole pages with the subject.  The major news weeklies all made drugs their cover stories. And, in an  unprecedented move, all three major television networks are devoting most of an  entire week's worth of news coverage to the drug issue.  </P> <P> ABC calls its coverage "Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land." NBC's is "Drug Watch."  CBS, which will do its part next week, calls it "Drugs: One Nation, Under  Siege."  </P> <P> Even ABC's weekend health and business programs will focus on drugs, as will  each of the networks' morning, evening and weekend morning programs.  </P> <P> And, although not all the coverage so far has echoed the President's message  nearly as closely as Brokaw's Tuesday sign-off, White House officials believe  that saturation air time serves the President's purpose and will help them sell  to Congress a policy that is still controversial in its details.  </P> <P> Although the coverage may quote critics, White House communications director  David Demarest said, "the President is the only one with a plan. There may be  people who want their program to have more funding . . . or across the board  more money, but those kinds of comments are not a substitute for a strategy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Video Obscures Audio  </P> <P> News executives disagree, even though they concede that predicting the effect  of news coverage is often difficult. It is particularly hard to interpret the  impact that television coverage has on viewers because the visual images  generally overwhelm whatever spoken message the story might try to convey.  </P> <P> "If the discussion of the exact programs and their possible shortcomings . . .  is done on an honest basis," said Richard C. Wald, senior vice president of ABC  News, "the Administration doesn't get a free pass."  </P> <P> In fact, some of the coverage has been rough. Follow-up stories Wednesday on  "The Today Show," for instance, generally characterized the President's  proposals as offering little change from the status quo, as did the analysis  stories in The Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times.  </P> <P> But, on Wednesday night, each of the three networks devoted half of their news  broadcasts to drugs, and, although everyone covered the critics of the plan,  most of the coverage concentrated on the evils of the drug problem.  </P> <P> Whoever is right about the nature of coverage, the White House is getting the  amount of coverage it wanted despite far less advance selling of its political  initiative than usually characterized the Ronald Reagan White House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't Release Key Lines  </P> <P> The Bush Administration did not even release key lines of the speech in advance  for the Tuesday evening news, a regular technique of Reagan handlers to ensure  additional coverage.  </P> <P> "In terms of drugs, they didn't have to do a sell," NBC White House  correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said.  </P> <P> In the absence of any other presidential agenda, and with the economy stable  and the Soviet threat apparently diminishing, the drug issue stands out, Wald  said.  </P> <P> And, with children returning to school and public opinion polls showing drugs  as the No. 1 concern of Americans, White House officials privately say that  they expected the media to respond with generous coverage. The only thing the  White House deliberately did was announce three weeks ahead of time that Bush  would give the speech, so that the networks would have time to plan other  stories related to drugs.  </P> <P> Within a week, two networks obliged. "We think we have an obligation, once  again, to try and portray to the American public the enormity of this drug  threat," CBS News President David Burke said in announcing CBS's plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Reinforce Speech  </P> <P> The White House has learned the lessons laid out by Reagan communications  adviser Michael Deaver about reinforcing a speech's impact by following it up  with major events staged for the media.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, for instance, seven Cabinet members gave roughly 50 interviews  with local TV stations in key cities nationwide via satellite.  </P> <P> The President also has a week's worth of follow-up events to reinforce his drug  strategy in the public's mind, including Wednesday's supposedly spontaneous but  thoroughly planned trip to a Washington hospital to visit children of drug  abusers.  </P> <P> In addition, he conducted a briefing for 70 local crime reporters invited to  the White House. And he had briefings with law enforcement officials and drug  treatment professionals, in advance of which the White House public relations  staff contacted media from the officials' home areas. Also, the White House  allows the local officials to be interviewed on the White House lawn.  </P> <P> Drug czar William J. Bennett also appeared on all three network morning  programs Wednesday and delivered a speech to the National Press Club that was  carried live on CNN.  </P> <P> All this may make up for a speech that even some in the White House privately  concede was disappointing, at least in presentation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inappropriate Smiles  </P> <P> The President seemed to smile inappropriately during the speech, officials  conceded privately, suggesting that he was unexpectedly nervous during the  address. He had not been so during rehearsals.  </P> <P> Deaver used to estimate that 25% of the audience will tune out after the first  five minutes of a presidential address, and, by that standard, some thought  Bush should have packed more into the beginning of his speech.  </P> <P> "If I would have been a casual observer, I wouldn't have been dragged into the  tent by the first five (minutes)," Miklaszewski said.  </P> <P> In earlier drafts of the speech, White House officials had included more  anecdotes early in the speech. They removed them, in part for length, and hoped  that Bush's lifting of the packet of crack cocaine would be sufficiently  dramatic. Some worried Wednesday that it had not been.  </P> <P> Yet, some early evidence suggests that, if the public is pleased that Bush is  tackling the drug issue, the theatrics of his speech may be largely irrelevant.  </P> <P> Georgetown University government professor Michael Robinson, who specializes in  political media, watched the speech with 25 college students, who came away  impressed, even though they disdained Bush's presentation and actually laughed  when the President said that the plan would not require higher taxes or an  increased federal deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Right Speech' at 'Right Time'  </P> <P> They liked the speech for three reasons. First, a majority said "that this was  the right speech at the right time about the right issue," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Second, they came away with the impression that Bush's proposal called for an  $8-billion increase in spending to fight drugs, even though the actual amount  of the increase is only about $1 billion, Robinson said, because the President  kept repeating the $8-billion figure, which is the rough total amount to be  spent.  </P> <P> And third, "They regard George Bush as a so-so rhetorician and public speaker,  but they disdained the notion that presentation really matters," Robinson said.  </P> <P> The students criticized Bush's use of graphics and anecdotes as too imitative  of Reagan. And they thought picking up the crack bag, a trump card in the White  House planning, seemed hokey.  </P> <P> When one student in the group criticized Bush's speech overall because of his  delivery, he was shouted down, Robinson said. Said one student defending the  President: "He's not an anchorman, just President."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation is very serious in the Rwandan  capital, Kigali. [passage omitted] It now seems quite clear that  hard-line factions, including President Habyarimana's  Presidential Guard are hunting down the moderates, be they Hutu  or Tutsi. [passage omitted]    There are reports of sporadic gunfire in several quarters of  Kigali, where there are clashes between youths and soldiers. We  have not yet received any toll for these clashes. What seems  clear is that there is growing tension between the Presidential  Guard and the United Nations. The spokesman for the UN  peacekeeping forces in Rwanda has said that they were prevented  by the Presidential Guard from going to the scene of the crash  of the presidential plane.    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who is currently on an  official visit to Romania, said he planned to call on the United  Nations to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations mission  in Rwanda. Willy Claes stressed that the Belgian peacekeeping  forces should intervene to defend Kigali airport.</p>

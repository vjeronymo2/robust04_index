It seems surprising that television makes so few programmes about dogs, given the widespread enthusiasm for them.

The seven-part series roams the world to tell the story of man's best friend ..and slave, and sometimes dinner (9.30). Small Objects Of Desire, is a series in which the subject matter is at times obscured by the programme-making techniques. Today's object, the sandwich, must have been with us since the invention of the loaf, even if the Earl of Sandwich did do his famous three-layer trick in 1762 (10.10 BBC2).</p>

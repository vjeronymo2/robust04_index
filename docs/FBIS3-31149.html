			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 9 (BTA) -- There are no insoluble  problems between Bulgaria and Albania, the chairmen of  Bulgaria's Parliament Aleksandur Yordanov and of Albania's  People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori pointed out at their meeting  here today. Mr. Arbnori is leading an Albanian parliamentary  delegation which has arrived on a three-day visit here.    According to the Press Centre of the Bulgarian Parliament,  Mr. Arbnori told Mr. Yordanov about the structure of the  Albanian Parliament and its work. It is full of bitter  political struggle, but it is much better to have it inside the  parliament than out in the street, he reportedly said. Mr.  Yordanov elaborated on Bulgaria's efforts to attract more  foreign investment. He pointed out that the political forces in  Bulgaria are unanimous in their attitude to the rights and  freedoms issue and explained that both Christians and Muslims  have their representatives in parliament and take part in  lawmaking.    Mr. Arbnori expressed concern over the situation in the  Balkans and the possible expansion of the conflict in former  Yugoslavia to Kosovo and Macedonia. He pointed out that Albania  is facing serious problems owing to the fact that only half of  its population lives within the country's borders and the  remaining part lives outside them. Mr. Yordanov said that the  problems can only be solved on the basis of the assumption that  there cannot be an ethnically clean state in the Balkans. He  added that Bulgaria is willing to help maintain stability in  this region.    The Albanian delegation met with representatives of the four  parliamentary forces: the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the  Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms (DPS, representing the ethnic Turks), and the New Union  for Democracy (NSD, consisting of former members of the  parliamentary SDS), to discuss home policy issues.    The MP's discussed the developments of the past few years  and  the specifics of the transition period. Interesting coincidence  was discovered in the ineptness of the shock therapy as a  transition model, BSP deputy floor leader Aleksandur Marinov  said after the meeting. "The Albanian delegation was interested  in our stand on the land reform and particularly on the problem  of production recovery, so that our country is not reduced to  merely a market for imported goods," he explained. Another  issue which is to be discussed in the European Parliament as  well is the detention of Albanian Socialist Party leader Fatos  Nano, who will probably be stripped of his parliamentary  immunity. "We believe that such repressive acts, regardless of  their motives, are harmful to the democratic process," Mr.  Marinov pointed out. The Albanian delegation answered that the  detention of Fatos Nano has nothing to do with political  motives, as he is facing criminal charges. "We discussed the  situation in the Balkans and shared the stand that all Balkan  states should stick to the principle of non-intervention in the  Yugo-conflict," Mr. Marinov added. "Naturally, we could not  discuss the problem about Kosovo," he concluded.    SDS floor leader Stefan Savov told the Albanian delegation  about the political realignment in Bulgaria's parliament and  voiced his concern about the recommunization trends (passage of  reform-blocking acts and political dismissals of SDS members),  the Parliamentary Press Centre reported after the meeting. Mr.  Savov suggested that the regional problems could be solved by  erasing borders in the Balkans rather than by redrawing them.  Mr. Arbnori approved of this stand but he pointed out that  until that happens, Albania will protect the rights of Albanian  minorities abroad.    Later today the Albanian delegation met with representatives  of the parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms. "We  discussed the situation in the Balkans in the context of this  region's role in Europe, the world and particularly Western  Europe should stop regarding the Balkans as a powder keg," DPS  deputy floor leader Yunal Lyutfi said after the meeting. It was  pointed out that the Balkans should become a zone of peace and  good-neighbourly relations. "In both countries the process of  transition is remarkably peaceful, which is a guarantee for  stability in the Balkans," Mr. Lyutfi explained.    "We discussed common problems concerning the legal framework  of the democratic form of government and the problems of  Albanians in former Yugoslavia," Professor Petur Markov said  after the parliamentary New Union for Democracy met with the  Albanian delegation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Growth in State Firms Is Forecast"] </F>   [Text] Casting aside wariness about their teetering  profits, State-run industries are likely to expand production  this year by 7 percent to 8 percent, the State Information  Centre said.    In comparison, State industrial output last year grew by 6.4  percent, said Xu Hongyuan, an economist with the centre's  economic forecasting department. The State Information Centre  is an arm of the State Planning Commission.    Hindered by some small and medium-sized money-losing  factories, State industry only saw a limited production growth  of 2.2 percent in March and 5 percent in April, Xu added.    However, he predicted that in the months to come large  factories will lead State manufacturers to stepped-up  production, aided by a slight loosening of the government's  controls on credit.    "Their production growth may stand at around 7 percent in  May  and June," he noted.    The higher industrial production will help push up growth in  the gross national product by 12 percent during the first six  months, Xu said.    During the first half of this year, State factories are  expected to turn over to the government 30 percent more in taxes  than in the same period last year.    Xu believes that the big factories are propping up the  entire  State sector, which accounted for nearly half of the country's  industrial output last year. Big factories make up one-fifth of  all State industrial enterprises.    Official sources say that slow sales and outdated products  are responsible for "quite a lot" of the operational losses of  small and medium-sized firms.    Xu said that State enterprises turn over to the government  as  much in taxes as do foreign-funded firms, but that growth in  their production and profits is much slower. This reflects  slower improvements in efficiency in small and medium-sized  State enterprises.    Heavy financial burdens are hobbling State industries trying  to increase their profitability, Xu noted.    For example, he said, "A worker in a State-owned factory now  has to support the pensions of at least two retirees."    Meanwhile, wage reform has raised workers' salaries by 28  percent even as State factories struggle for profits and  inventories pile up.    Economists with the State Information Centre suggest that  State firms take bold steps to strengthen their internal  management. For instance, they say that linking employee  salaries to company profits would raise morale and improve  productivity.    In addition, they believe that since the central government  urges State factories to finance the pensions of many retirees,  it should also consider slashing plants tax burdens.    Xu said the government should give most money-losing State  factories a chance to recover, since they are struggling hard to  cope with sweeping reforms in finance and taxation.    However, those State firms that stubbornly cling to  discredited management methods and continue to lose money should  be declared bankrupt or be merged with other factories.</p>

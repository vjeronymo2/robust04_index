			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank to sell stake in Holzmann Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and a holder of substantial stakes in dozens of other companies, is planning to dispose of its blocking minority in the Philipp Holzmann construction group. According to Mr Lothar Mayer, Holzmann chairman, the bank diluted its stake last year from 27.3 per cent to 25.3 per cent by not participating in a rights issue. In the long-term, it wanted to withdraw completely within a time-span to be agreed with the Holzmann board, Mr Mayer said. His comments, following predictions this week from Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chairman, that Deutsche is to reduce its holding in Daimler, adds weight to speculation that the bank's long-term strategy is to run down its outside interests. German banks' intricate networks of outside holdings and cross-holdings, largely built up in the post-war economic reconstruction, have come under increasing fire from small shareholders and activists who complain that financial institutions have too much influence on industry. Bank directors are commonly among the most prominent figures on the supervisory boards which govern companies' investment policies. Commenting on Thursday on Mr Reuter's forecast that Deutsche's Daimler stake would be cut from 25 per cent to between 15 and 20 per cent within 10 years, the bank said there were no immediate plans for changes. 'I would not like to speculate over a period of 10 years,' a spokesman added. The timing of Deutsche's withdrawal from Holzmann is likely to hinge on the ownership of other important chunks of the group's stock.</p>

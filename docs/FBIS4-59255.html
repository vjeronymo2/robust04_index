			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to Channel 3 of Algiers radio, Prime  Minister Mokdad Sifi answered a number of questions on various  topics such as the national economic and social council, which  he described as a step forward. The prime minister stated that  the National Transitional Council will be installed soon and  that sufficient time has been given to all parties to consider  the issue of participating in the council.    Regarding the priorities of his government's agenda, Mr.  Sifi  stressed three points: economic stimulation, the strengthening  of the state's institutions, and national solidarity.    In his reply to a question on the possibility of calling  early elections before the end of the transitional period, the  prime minister said that the matter depends mainly on the  existence of stable conditions.    On the agreement with the IMF, which he preferred to call  the  Algerian restructuring program, which was accepted by the IMF,  the prime minister said that it has positive and negative  effects and that we should wait for the talks with the Paris  Club and the duration of the debt rescheduling period. He added  that there is a plan to help low-income social classes.    Regarding Algeria's educational system, the prime minister  expressed hope that it would be changed from within the regime  itself with the participation of the administration, staff, and  parents.    In conclusion, the prime minister said that he prefers a  policy of consultation with the administration and all parties.</p>

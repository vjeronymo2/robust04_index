			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: No place for a party pooper A SENIOR City banker recently bemoaned the passing of the tradition by which banks entertained their staff at Christmas. Not so the EBRD. Last Christmas it entertained more than 600 people to a party at London's prestigious Grosvenor House Hotel - 500 of these staff and the rest members of the board and long-term consultants. The party took place in the hotel's Great Room, the largest banqueting hall in London. The most the hotel's marketing manager Ms Suzy Barry is prepared to say about what went on in a ballroom, with a capacity for up to 1,500 guests, is that the Pounds 80-a-head occasion included a three-course meal which was 'one of our cheaper menus'. The event, which was described by Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, as 'not incredibly lavish', cost Pounds 52,000. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the director in charge of planning and budget, said: 'We wanted to mark the move to the new offices with a party because the conditions for some people at the old offices in Leadenhall Street were terrible.' The event was booked and organised by the assistant to the president, Mr Francois Olive, who selected the menu: Japanese consomme, English roast beef and fruit salad. The red and white wine was from Bulgaria. 'French wine is more expensive, and anyway we thought it was better to spend more on trade with eastern Europe,' Mr Olive said.</p>

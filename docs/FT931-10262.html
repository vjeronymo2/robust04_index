			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / State move boosts US gun control supporters US GUN control advocates believe they may have made an important breakthrough with the likely passage of a law controlling handgun sales in Virginia, one of the principal markets in the eastern US. Mr Douglas Wilder, the state's governor, yesterday announced a compromise bill that slightly eases his original proposal to limit buyers to one handgun per month. Mr Wilder, who campaigned briefly last year for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, secured support from Republicans in the state legislature by agreeing to allow people to buy more than one handgun a month, provided they obrained a certificate from the state police. The Virginia legislation is viewed as important since the state - because of its very loose controls - has been a major source of guns used by criminals. New York police have found than more than a quarter of weapons used in crimes there originated in Virginia. 'This proposal will do the job to stop trafficking and proliferation of handguns in our state,' said Mr Randolph Rollins, Virginia's secretary of public safety. But the 'one gun a month' approach is also attracting interest on the national level, because its commonsense simplicity appears to have confounded opponents of gun control. Gun controls advocates have mostly worked on two types of restriction: a ban on multiple shot automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and a mandatory waiting period before a buyer can take a weapon home. Legislation imposing such a waiting period passed Congress last year in a comprehensive crime bill but was vetoed by President George Bush. It became known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Senator Howard Metzenbaum and Congressman Charles Schumer are expected to reintroduce the Brady bill in Congress this month. President Bill Clinton said during his election campaign that he would support the bill, as well as a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. More than 90 per cent of those questioned in a recent Gallup poll favoured a national waiting period, and support for an outright ban on handgun possession, although still in a minority, has risen from 31 per cent to 43 per cent over the last decade. The US criminal justice system is 'on a fast track to collapse' because of excessive concentration on drug offences, the American Bar Association has warned. The ABA's criminal justice section reported that drug offences were pushing other cases off court calendars and that long mandatory sentences ordered by Congress were forcing states to release violent criminals to make room for drug offenders. The number of adult drug offenders in prison quadrupled between 1986 and 1991, six times as fast as other offences, while surveys indicated that the proportion of the population using drugs fell from 12 per cent to 6 per cent.</p>

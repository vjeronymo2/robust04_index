The first move has been made with the  announcement of a merger between Alsys (French branch) and IGL  Technology; the latter is a Syseca affiliate dedicated to  software (product sales and consulting) and a long-time  exclusive distributor of IDE tools (including the famous STP,  Software Through Pictures), as well as being now involved in  marketing Centerline and McCabe products.    The industrial group has made numerous software acquisitions  in the past four years or so. In 1989, it started off in style  with Atherton (and its Software Backplane structure), definitely  purchased in the spring of 1991. In September of the same year,  Alsys became part of the group, organizationally linked to  Syseca, but it was clear that as a result of its international  status, the Ada specialist would quickly become the group's  spearhead in the marketing of software products outside France.  This was confirmed the following year with the merger of Alsys  and Telesoft, ranked third on the Ada market. Today, Alsys has  an annual turnover of 227 million francs. This result is  comparable, on the software market, to those achieved by CGI  with Pacbase.</p>

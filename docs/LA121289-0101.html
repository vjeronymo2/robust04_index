			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTHS, POLICE SKIRMISH IN FIRST VIOLENCE OF CHILEAN CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Campaigning in Chile's first presidential election in 19 years ended Monday  with tear gas and rock-throwing skirmishes involving youths claiming to be  followers of the rival candidates, the first violence in an otherwise peaceful  race.  </P> <P> After the final rally by rightist candidate Hernan Buchi, youths chanting  slogans in favor of opposition front-runner Patricio Aylwin stoned police  patrolling Alameda Bernardo O'Higgins, a broad avenue in the center of the  capital. Police responded with barrages of high-pressure water and tear-gas  grenades.  </P> <P> No more than 200 youths appeared to take part actively in the clashes that  lasted nearly three hours.  </P> <P> By mid-evening, hundreds of Buchi supporters marched from the rally site to the  Alameda, and scattered fighting broke out between the Buchi marchers and the  groups that had been fighting the police. Several people were hit by stones. It  was unclear whether any of the injuries were serious.  </P> <P> The race to succeed outgoing President Augusto Pinochet, who took power after a  bloody 1973 coup, had evolved calmly. By law, campaigning ended Monday to allow  voters two days of reflection before Thursday's balloting, which also will  decide 120 House and 38 Senate seats.  </P> <P> Aylwin, far ahead in the polls, heads a 17-party coalition of parties ranging  from center to left. Buchi, Pinochet's former finance minister, is supported by  two rightist parties.  </P> <P> Buchi has stressed the social order and economic progress brought by the  Pinochet government, in contrast to the turmoil of the 1970-73 rule of Marxist  President Salvador Allende, which ended with Pinochet's coup.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether the rock-throwers who attacked the police and the Buchi  supporters were far-left militants, thugs out to stir up trouble or  provocateurs. Any violence ill serves the Aylwin coalition in its attempt to  project an image of moderation and accommodation.  </P> <P> Earlier, tens of thousands of people filled a major Santiago avenue for Buchi's  final rally, far fewer than the hundreds of thousands who attended Aylwin's  final campaign celebration on Sunday.  </P> <P> The athletic 40-year-old Buchi repeatedly attacked the opposition alliance for  including parties and candidates who had participated in Allende's Popular  Unity coalition. Buchi suggested that Aylwin, a centrist who leads the  Christian Democratic Party, would prove unable to control the leftists in his  alliance.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows if a vote for Patricio Aylwin is a vote for the Christian  Democrats or the Socialists or the Communists," Buchi said. "Are you against  violence and terrorism? They are not."  </P></p>

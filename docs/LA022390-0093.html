			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GILLESPIE ASSAILED FOR 'PASSIVE STANCE' ON  AIDS  </P> <P> A dozen AIDS activists from the ACT UP Los Angeles organization demonstrated  Thursday at the Los Angeles offices of Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie,  protesting what they said was Gillespie's failure to try to stop discrimination  by health insurers against AIDS patients.  </P> <P> "As the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade, insurers are systematically  conspiring to diminish their policy holders coverage," said a statement from  the group.  </P> <P> It went on to accuse the Department of Insurance of taking "a passive stance"  as many persons have been denied coverage.  </P> <P> Gillespie responded by having aides hand out a statement that said her  department has tried to consult with concerned parties on the problem, but that  there have been few actual complaints. The statement said that this, in part,  was because people with AIDS are afraid they will be identified publicly if  they make complaints.  </P></p>

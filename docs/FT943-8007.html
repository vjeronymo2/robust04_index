			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kode shares halved after loss The market value of Kode International halved yesterday following a fall into pre-tax losses of Pounds 515,000 in the 26 weeks to July 1, against profits of Pounds 710,000. The computer services and printed circuit boards maker was also cautious over short-term prospects. The shares fell 37p to 38p. Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 12.3m and there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 350,000 relating to the computer services division. Losses per share were 5.5p (earnings 4.3p) and the interim dividend is passed (2p). DCM Services, the services activity, was severely affected by the sudden fall in prices in the third party maintenance market in the second half of 1993. Kamtronics, which markets pcbs, suffered depressed margins following disruption at its principal supplier which had a serious impact on profitability in the first four months. Margins were now beginning to improve. Kam Circuits, the pcb maker, saw export sales continue to grow and profits were slightly ahead.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: How GPA will restructure GPA was much better at managing its aircraft than managing its liabilities. That sentence sums up not only how GPA got into its current mess, but also the hope it has to regain some of its shareholders' lost value. As part of the restructuring plan detailed yesterday, GPA will pass the management of its assets to a new GE Capital subsidiary. This is an ingenious method to prevent GE Capital becoming responsible for GPA's liabilities. In fact, the same people will operate the business, the new company, GE Capital Aviation Services, being staffed by GPA employees. And it will be based at Shannon, in the Irish Republic, as is GPA. About 160 of GPA's staff will move to GECAS, the remaining 25 will stay with GPA. GPA will continue to own the assets, paying GECAS a management fee of 0.43 per cent of the value of the aircraft, and will remain responsible for its liabilities. But the 15-year management contract between GPA and GECAS should give creditors confidence. Even if GPA were to go into liquidation, the management contract would hold. If GPA were to raise further cash by securitising aircraft - through Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation or Alps - investors will have the comfort of the GECAS management contract. The deal, if completed, should also make it easier for GPA to make outright aircraft sales. While GPA's future hung in the balance potential purchasers held back in the hope of lower prices. GPA has also cut its order book from Dollars 11.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) for 242 aircraft to Dollars 3.6bn for 57 aircraft, requiring a Dollars 462m provision. It has sold one aircraft to GE Capital and agreed to sell a further 44, which will provide Dollars 465m of cash to GPA. Even so, as the prospectus for the Dollars 150m issue of convertible and non-convertible notes says in bold capital letters 'an investment in GPA's securities is speculative and high risk'. The convertible notes would represent between 23 per cent and 25 per cent of GPA's capital, and are being offered to existing shareholders. Subscribers have already been found for Dollars 129m of the notes, which is understood to be sufficient for the company's needs. The company still faces a tough time if it is to cut its debt to a manageable level. The Dollars 750m of debt deferred now will largely fall due in September 1996. In the year to March 1997 GPA must repay or refinance debt of Dollars 2.36bn. Risk factors outlined in the document include the need to sell aircraft to meet these debt obligations, its ability to refinance its debts in 1996, and litigation against the group. If GPA overcomes these difficulties, GE Capital may decide to exercise its options. It can buy a near-two thirds stake by March 1988 at a price determined by the value of GPA's shareholders funds, but will fall between Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m. It can then buy any shares created in the restructuring over the next three years, at a fair market price, and would then make an offer for the rest.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 29/4/1994 -- "The declaration  of Moldovan and Dniester leaders," signed by Mircea Snegur and  Igor Smirnov on April 28th, "is another step of the process of  Bessarabia's subjugation to Russian interests," states the  declaration of the Christian-Democratic Popular Front of Moldova  [FPCDM]. According to it, "Moscow representatives who hold the  key posts in Moldova seriously injured our national interests  and undermined Moldova's independence and unity" with this new  agreement between Chisinau and Tiraspol. The April 28th  declaration implies official recognition of the "Dniester  Moldovan Republic" which is considered synonymous with Moldova.  The declaration says that the presence of the CSCE mission at  this meeting mars the prestige of this international  organization and makes "it an advocate of Russian imperial  policy." The FPCDM "considers that the deal on April 28th aims  at annulling the national unified state and jeopardizes the  nation's fundamental right to self-determination," concludes the  declaration.</p>

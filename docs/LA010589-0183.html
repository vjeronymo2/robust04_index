			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Nicaragua devalued its currency by 54%, the seventh drastic adjustment in a  year, and cut subsidies on transportation to combat an economic slump and  soaring inflation. The official exchange rate of the cordoba against the dollar  has been set at 2,000 to 1. The government cut the subsidies as part of a plan  to avoid printing money to cover a widening budget deficit. President Daniel  Ortega has announced major budget cuts for 1989, including a 29% cut in  military spending. Prices rose 21.742% in 1988, according to Ortega.  </P></p>

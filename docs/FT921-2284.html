			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe faces equity options row on eve of merger ON THE EVE of the official merger of the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and the London Traded Options Market (LTOM), another row over the future of equity options trading at the new exchange has blown up. Firms which came forward to act as market-makers in individual stock options are urging Liffe to appoint a managing director in charge of stock options trading under the new exchange. The options traders charge that a business plan designed to jump-start the market  - and someone to put it into action  - is urgently needed. Liffe, so far, appears to be resisting such pressure, but officials at the exchange were unavailable for comment. The disagreement is the latest in a long series of disputes which dogged the merger's history for several years. With the legal merger about to go ahead this weekend, and trading under the new London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange  - still to be known as Liffe  - set to start on Monday, the latest row is not serious enough to jeopardise the merger at this late stage. However, the deadline for signing the official market-making agreement by the end of trading yesterday was not met by some of the six market-making firms as they increased pressure on Liffe. The merger was postponed in January because an insufficient number of firms came forward to make markets in the 67 equity options traded on LTOM. While hopes are running high for the FT-SE index option, there seems little sign that the low volume currently recorded in individual options will be substantially boosted by the merger, at least initially. The argument over the future of open-outcry trading, which the large banks argue should be replaced by a screen-based system, could also resurface. 'The equity product is sufficiently different (from Liffe's mainly interest rate and currency products) for someone with specialist equity derivatives knowledge to offer important benefits to the Liffe staff,' said Mr David Wenman, head of European equity derivatives at Swiss Bank Corporation, one of the six market-making firms. Mr Tony de Guingand, who ran the LTOM, will become finance director of the merged exchange, which will be headed by Mr Michael Jenkins.</p>

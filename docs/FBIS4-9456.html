			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The method of  privatization of the Czech petrochemical industry will be  determined at a meeting of economic ministers within two to  three weeks, said Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy  today. Regardless of their decision, the following requirements  will be upheld, said Dlouhy.    1.) There will be no quotas or other trade barriers set for  petrochemical products and oil imported into the Czech Republic;    2.) Certain uniform direction of the two main petrochemical  enterprises, Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov, must be  ensured;    3.) The decision reached at the ministerial meeting on May  4,  1993 concerning the separation of refineries from petrochemical  producers and the creation of one Czech refining company will  have to be re-assessed and possibly revoked.    The first possible method for the oil industry's  privatization involves the international consortium of Agip,  Conoco, Shell, and Total, who are interested in Kaucuk and  Chemopetrol. The second method is the "Czech way," according to  which the Czech refining and petrochemical industry will remain  in Czech hands, provided 27 billion crowns be made available for  its current needs. The latter method would lead to oil being  imported mostly from Russia, whereas the consortium would import  oil from other sources as well, said Dlouhy.</p>

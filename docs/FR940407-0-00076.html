			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Program audit provisions for market-response EIP's must be accompanied by reconciliation procedures, designed to compare credited emissions (i.e., adjusted projected emissions) with actual emissions achieved through the implementation of the program. The reconciliation procedures must specify a range of appropriate actions (e.g., invoke part of a general SIP contingency plan or a program-specific contingency), revisions to the program requirements (e.g., increase the fee, include more sources) that will make up for any shortfall between credited and actual emissions revealed by the audit, or reductions in the credit taken for the EIP in the SIP (provided that RFP and attainment requirements continue to be satisfied area-wide based on such reduced EIP credits in combination with the effects of all other SIP programs). Such measures must be automatically executing to the extent necessary to make up the shortfall, with State action required only to identify which of the specified actions are necessary to make up the shortfall. Such measures must not require a revision to the implementation plan to be effectuated once identified by the State; rather, the measures must be built into the original EIP design (or incorporated by reference).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Greater burdens should not necessarily be imposed on EIP's, compared to traditional regulatory programs, by virtue of the audit and reconciliation requirements. These audit and reconciliation procedures are consistent with the general approach to implementing the Act being taken by the EPA, as illustrated in the Agency's rules for vehicle I/M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and for reformulated gasoline, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and in the Agency's general guidance on the implementation of title I dealing with the rule effectiveness of stationary source control measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Further, in appropriate cases, routine ongoing air program management procedures may be sufficient to fulfill the audit and reconciliation requirements. In designing audit procedures, the State should consider the relative uncertainty associated with the EIP and specify the scope and extent of the audit procedures to be commensurate with that level of uncertainty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Inspection/Maintenance Program Requirements, 57 FR 52950, November 5, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, 59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule Effectiveness Guidance: Integration of Inventory, Compliance, and Assessment Applications, EPA&hyph;452/4&hyph;94&hyph;001, January 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Implementation Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EIP must contain a schedule for implementing the program. The schedule must include dates for notifying potentially affected sources, as early as possible, about the impending EIP; program initialization and start-up procedures; compliance and submittal requirements for affected sources; and audit and reconciliation processes, including subsequent actions required to make up for any shortfall that occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Administrative Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of any EIP design, the State must establish appropriate administrative procedures, specific to the type of incentive strategy, necessary to implement all of the elements of the EIP. For example, in a fee program a State must assure the proper administration of the fee collection process, and if rebate provisions are included, the administration of the rebate distribution process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative procedures specific to marketable emissions permit programs which the State must address in a program design are the mechanisms required for conducting, approving, verifying, recording, and tracking trades. The EIP must clearly describe the administrative system, and any State commitments to implement and maintain the system, that enables market participants to conduct valid and legally protected transactions. The State must design the program to ensure that all program requirements are met by sources involved in trades, such that the trades result in enforceable changes in allowable emissions levels. A well-designed EIP will include the minimum amount of transactional oversight, approval, recording, and tracking provisions necessary to create a verifiable and enforceable system. Unnecessary or excessive administrative requirements in a trading system increase the cost of the program and inhibit trading. An active trading market increases the opportunities for cost-savings. However, a State must establish sufficient administrative procedures to ensure that the environmental goals of the EIP are met, and that the program is adequately enforceable (see paragraph IV.J.2. and the discussion of emissions trading markets in Appendix X).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Enforcement Mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EIP must include adequate enforcement consequences for noncompliance with any source requirements, including MRR requirements. Each program must include provisions ensuring that State/local and Federal statutory maximum penalties preserve the deterrent effect of traditional regulatory programs. Enforcement provisions should preserve the criminal sanctions (for knowing violations) authorized in the Act for violations of SIP requirements per se.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditional regulatory programs provide for enforcement against noncompliance with emissions limits at both the Federal and State/local levels. The statutory maximum Federal penalties under the Act are $25,000 per day, per source in violation. To preserve the existing level of deterrence under the Act, an EIP that imposes multiday and/or multisource emission limits must define violations of those limits in such a way that the violations will translate into some combination of sufficient numbers of violations, sources in violation, and days of violation. One possible approach would be for the EIP to authorize predetermined penalties based on the amount of an exceedance of such a cap, provided the predetermined amounts are sufficiently large (see paragraph IV.H.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIP's that impose multisource emissions limits must require facilities to develop enforceable plans for remedying noncompliance in those cases where facilities have exceeded emissions limits for the specified averaging period. Such plans must identify appropriate and enforceable control measures or other procedures or strategies sufficient to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable emissions limits. Further, for sources subject to title V requirements, the elements of such plans must, at a minimum, be consistent with any applicable title V permit requirements concerning compliance plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with MRR requirements is critical to the integrity and success of EIP's. Thus, an EIP must include enforcement provisions that establish a regulatory structure which clearly and effectively deters inadequate or improper MRR, providing for both State/local and Federal penalties. Further, the enforcement provisions must include methods for determining required data when MRR violations result in missing, inadequate, or erroneous monitoring and recordkeeping data. These methods must ensure that sources have a sufficiently strong incentive to properly perform monitoring and recordkeeping in the first place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

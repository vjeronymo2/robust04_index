			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the December 1991 regulations, the Gateway is applied in the same basic manner as the nondiscriminatory classification test under the section 410(b) regulations. Those regulations establish an unsafe harbor ratio percentage for a plan, that is, a minimum ratio of the relative coverage rates of nonhighly compensated and highly compensated employees. The unsafe harbor percentage applicable to a plan depends on the concentration of nonhighly compensated employees in the employer's workforce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a qualified separate line of business has a disproportionate share of the employer's highly compensated employees, the plan maintained for that line of business may have a very low ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis, even though it covers a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in that line. The December 1991 regulations therefore provide a reduced unsafe harbor percentage if the plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis. Although most plans pass the Gateway test in its current form, some commentators on the September 1993 proposed regulations have noted continued difficulty in the case of plans maintained for certain lines of business that cover a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in those lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to those comments, these final regulations provide that, if a plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, but its employer-wide ratio percentage falls below the plan's reduced unsafe harbor percentage, the plan nonetheless is deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis if the Commissioner determines that, based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits such employees as qualify under a classification of employees that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. For this purpose, included among the relevant facts and circumstances are facts and circumstances such as those listed in &sect;1.410(b)&hyph;4(c)(3)(ii). In making these determinations, the Commissioner will determine which other facts and circumstances are relevant, including any of the facts and circumstances listed in section 5 of Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;41, 1993&hyph;2 C.B. 536, that the Commissioner determines are relevant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations also make the following changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Expansion of the minimum and maximum benefit safe harbor to apply to career average plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Allowing more flexibility in the employees taken into account for purposes of the minimum benefit safe harbor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Clarification of the application of section 401(a)(26) to employer-wide plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Clarification of the disaggregation population rules after a change in disaggregation population groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Finalization of the regulations under section 414(q) relating to employees excluded for purposes of the 50-employee requirement under section 414(r)(2)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Notice 92&hyph;36 relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A concern has been raised that the anti-cutback rules of section 411(d)(6) might eliminate an employer's option to comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (including the provisions of section 414(r)) and related legislation by amending its plans in the 1994 plan year to reduce the level of benefits provided to highly compensated employees for that year. Employers are reminded that Notice 92&hyph;36, 1992&hyph;2 C.B. 364, provided broad transition relief giving employers the opportunity to retain their amendment options until the last day of the 1994 plan year without being treated as violating section 411(d)(6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Patricia McDermott of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS.

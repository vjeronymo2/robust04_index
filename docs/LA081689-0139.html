			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUAYLE FOCUSES ON GOOD NEWS AND IGNORES THE BAD  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle said today a new poll shows "I'm off to a very good  start," even though it found that more than half the people surveyed thought  that he isn't qualified to be President.  </P> <P> The Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly a 2-1 approval ratio for the way  Quayle is handling the vice presidency. However, 52% of those questioned said  he was not qualified to take over the presidency. And 43% said Bush should  select another running mate if he runs for reelection. (Poll in Part 1, Page  17.)  </P> <P> "I am very delighted to see that by a ratio of 2-1 Americans think I am doing a  good job as vice president," Quayle said today at a photo session. "I feel I'm  off to a very good start."  </P> <P> Asked how he explained the 52% figure, Quayle said, "I tend to accentuate the  positive, and I have a very positive ratio of support with the American people  of 2-1 on how I am doing the job. They approve of the way I am doing the job.  That's good news for me."  </P> <P> Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the poll's findings  today. "We think the public does have confidence in the vice president," he  told reporters en route to Miami with President Bush.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush "thinks the vice president is doing an excellent job; he  has outstanding qualities in many areas." Asked whether he had faith in public  opinion polls, the spokesman said: "I never believe in the bad ones."  </P> <P> Quayle talked about the poll as he posed for pictures with Han Xu, who is  returning to Beijing after serving as ambassador to the United States.  </P> <P> Quayle called it a "final courtesy call" and said the two would have "a frank  discussion."  </P> <P> "Clearly I will be giving him messages that he can take back to his  government," the vice president said.  </P></p>

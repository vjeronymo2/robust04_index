			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa price touches Pounds 900 as surge gathers momentum COCOA PRICES soared yesterday as the market got to grips with a stream of forecasts predicting a shortfall in this year's crop. The December futures contract closed at a three-year high of Pounds 899 a tonne, up Pounds 37 a tonne on the day. At one point the London Commodity Exchange closed the cocoa market for 15 minutes as the March and May futures contracts hit their limit of a Pounds 40 a tonne rise - the first time this has happened for about 18 months. December futures touched the key psychological barrier of Pounds 900 a tonne but slipped at the close to Pounds 899 a tonne. 'It's unbelievable, nothing seems to be stopping it,' one trader said. The cocoa market has gathered momentum over the past couple of weeks on a steady stream of poor harvest projections and analysts' forecasts of a shortfall against demand for the third season in a row. Trading was hectic yesterday as speculators and industry buyers piled in to the rapidly rising market. Some manufacturers have kept out of the cocoa market in recent weeks for fear they were witnessing a speculative rally that would soon fizzle out. 'It's not a rally any more but a bull move and some people are talking a couple of hundred pounds higher in the next two months,' said one trader. The problem with the cocoa crop is that prices have been depressed for so long that farmers have had little to invest in their crops. This has caused many trees to weaken, reducing their yields as well as leaving them open to attack by parasites. Last week ED &amp;F. Man, the London trade house, forecast a deficit of 200,000 tonnes in the 1993-94 cocoa crop and a further shortfall of 150,000 tonnes the following year. Particular problems have hit the harvest in the Ivory Coast, which produces a third of the world's cocoa. Although there have been output shortfalls for the past two seasons, cocoa prices, depressed by seven years of surplus, hit their lowest level since the mid-1970s last year. Now that the market move has taken off, traders are not worried that plans to liquidate the International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock of cocoa will depress prices. Delegates are due to hold their final meeting this morning to agree a plan to sell cocoa over four and a half years at a rate of 51,000 tonnes a year. Coffee prices slipped as traders began profit-taking following a producers meeting on Wednesday on the export retention scheme that is to come into force on October 1. The November futures contract closed Dollars 6 a tonne lower at Dollars 1,290 a tonne after touching Dollars 1,280 a tonne at one point. 'There is some confusion in the market, but if you expect the producers' retention scheme to work, you will see higher prices in the next couple of months,' said Mr Peter Kettle, analyst at ED &amp; F. Man.</p>

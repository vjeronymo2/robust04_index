			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON DANNEMEYER  </P> <P> Rep. Dannemeyer claims that his views on homosexuality reflect probably  three-fourths of the American people. However, a New York Times article on July  10 -- "Studies Discover Clues to the Roots of Homophobia" by Daniel Goldman --  states that recent polls "show more Americans are beginning to accept  homosexual men and women and support their rights".  </P> <P> Dannemeyer's Proposition 102, his 1988 attempt to halt anonymous AIDS testing  in California, failed at the polls. It even lost badly in his own conservative  Orange County congressional district. Furthermore, because his embarrassing  Prop. 102 was so at odds with the entire public health Establishment, including  President Reagan's Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, the 1988 Bush presidential  campaign dropped Dannemeyer as a surrogate speaker in California.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer is out of step with the societal change taking place in America: the  increasing openness of gays and their becoming accepted even in his own  Republican Party. In a recent flap within the California Republican Party over  whether the gay Log Cabin Clubs should be thrown out, Dannemeyer again lost.  Both Gov. George Deukmejian and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson supported the continued  inclusion of the gay clubs over Dannemeyer's vociferous objection.  </P> <P> Since Dannemeyer is a self-avowed Christian, it's not too late for his personal  redemption. Jesus Christ, the author of Dannemeyer's own religious faith, never  ever spoke one negative word about gay men, lesbians or even about  homosexuality, Dannemeyer's self-righteous obsession. In fact, Jesus frequently  socialized with the outcasts of society, preferring them to the stiff-necked  Pharisees, the conservative fundamentalists of his day.  </P> <P> MARSHAL ALAN PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Phillips is former statewide constituency coordinator for gays and lesbians,  California Democratic Party, 1988 campaign.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, Feb 28 (AFP)--The head of a former Christian  militia said Monday [28 February] the Lebanese government was to  blame for a bomb attack which killed nine worshipers in a church  north of Beirut, dismissing claims that Israel was responsible.    "Even if there is an external plot it is the duty of the  state to protect its citizens," said Samir Ja'ja' of the  disbanded Lebanese Forces, at a press conference at his  fortified home in Ghidras, north of the capital.    "The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime," he  said, referring to Sunday's bomb attack in Our Lady of  Deliverance Church, in which 55 people were also injured.    "The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they  have realised that the security the authorities promised to  restore is still a mirage," Ja'ja' added.    Information Minister Michel Samahah and several other  Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the bombing and linked the  blast to Friday's massacre of 52 Palestinian worshipers in  Hebron on the West Bank.    "By blaming external factions these officials are trying to  cover up for their own impotence," Ja'ja' said, stressing that  the authorities had no tangible lead on which to base their  accusations.    Displaced Persons Minister Walid Junblatt said Monday he  feared a wave of attacks against places of worship in Lebanon by  supporters of partition backed by Israel.    The Druze leader, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party  (PSP), called for "radical steps against those who undermine our  security."    He rejected claims of a link between the church bombing and  the Hebron massacre, saying the theory was "unconvincing" and  Israeli agents were "well known in Lebanon."    Prosecutor Tarabay Rahmah said on Sunday that a suspect had  been arrested in connection with the blast, but he had been  seized days before it happened.    The blast was the second against Christian targets since a  December bomb attack on the right-wing Phalange Party  headquarters killed three people and wounded 100.    Relatives of the victims held a mass funeral in the church  on  Monday.    President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in  Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call to his Lebanese counterpart  Ilyas al-Hirawi late Sunday to help track down the bombers.</p>

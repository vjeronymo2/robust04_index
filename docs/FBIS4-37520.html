			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nabil 'Amr] </F>   [Excerpts] A senior Palestinian official has told AL-DUSTUR  that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will visit Jordan at  the end of this month, prior to his return to Palestine. During  'Arafat's visit, the Palestinian official said,  Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be held on the highest  level, and the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will be signed.  The signing of the agreement has been postponed several times.    The official, who requested anonymity, said that the next  Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be extremely important, as  conferees will discuss a Jordanian-Palestinian mechanism of  action that is much more exhaustive than coordination. The  official added that the Palestinian self-rule authority, which  is the first Palestinian experience of its kind, needs an Arab  effort to strengthen it and to protect it from the Israeli side,  which is superior in terms of its economy, scientific knowledge,  and technology. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the same Palestinian official revealed a  Palestinian's wish to reassess the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement. He indicated that this agreement has only been  initialed, and that the Palestinian side is not committed to  implementing it if it harms the Palestinian people or will harm  Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations, which are viewed by  the Palestinians of the West Bank as the core of their  Arab-Islamic extension.    He said that all the agreements that have been signed with  Israel are temporary, since there are Palestinian rights that  must be addressed and numerous topics of negotiations that must  raised with Israel prior to the final peace accord. He said  that this requires everyone to be careful when raising issues of  a pan-Arab dimension and that Jordanian-Palestinian efforts  should be united to safeguard these issues, chiefly the issue of  Jerusalem, which should be the focus of Arab and Islamic  efforts, rather than Jordanian and Palestinian efforts only.</p>

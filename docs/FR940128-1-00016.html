			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Alternatives Other Than HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Continuous visual inspection of seafood is not a viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative. Few hazards associated with seafood are detectable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through visual inspection. Moreover, the costs of such a system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would likely exceed the nearly half-billion-dollar public outlay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now required to operate this kind of system for meat and poultry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another alternative would be to direct significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional resources toward greatly increasing the frequency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's inspection of seafood, as well as increasing the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling, laboratory analysis, and related regulatory activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to seafood. While thousands of samples of domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and imported seafood products are collected each year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in FDA laboratories, and these samples are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientifically designed to represent a broad range of products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are generally perceived by the public to represent only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small fraction of the total poundage of seafood consumed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country. Substantial new expenditures would be needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase laboratory analyses to nationally statistically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even if the funds for increased inspection and increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling and analysis were available (which they are not), this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach alone would likely not be the best way for the agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spend its money to protect the public health. Reliance on end-product testing involves a certain amount of inefficiency that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can require very large sample sizes to overcome. NAS recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed that ``the statistical uncertainties associated with lot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling make this an unreliable method for ensuring safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food products *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 7, p. 283). FDA has traditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought to minimize this type of inefficiency by targeting its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts based on its experiences, but some inefficiency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavoidable. NAS recommended the HACCP system as an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 7, p. 283).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Current Import System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similar considerations apply to imports. FDA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally inspect processing facilities in other countries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether seafood products are being prepared, packed, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held there under appropriate conditions. Such inspections are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely costly and require an invitation from the foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country. Traditionally, therefore, FDA's primary strategy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood imports has involved: (1) Reviewing all customs entries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents to determine which imported products to examine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample; (2) conducting wharf examinations of selected products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on that review; and (3) sampling and laboratory analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One concern about this process that has been voiced with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some regularity in the media, Congress, and elsewhere is that FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physically looks at less than 5 percent of all imports. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure is somewhat misleading because it refers to seafood lots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can vary substantially in size. Also, it does not take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account such factors as the representative nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations, FDA's automatic detention program for imports that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires importers of products with a history of problems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain a laboratory analysis and certification prior to entry, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fact that imports receiving further processing in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States become subject to domestic inspection. Nonetheless, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certainly true that most imported seafood is not physically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampled or examined by a Federal health official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total number of customs entries for seafood each year is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaching 200,000 (Ref. 27) from about 135 countries (compared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to about 33 countries for beef and poultry (Ref. 28)), and huge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sums of money would be needed to enable FDA to increase its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical examination and sampling program to nationally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistically significant levels. Still, many developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries export seafood products to this country, and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory protections tend to be comparatively weak, if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist at all. Processing conditions in such countries do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always meet U.S. standards for sanitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While many importers are conscientious about the safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of the products that they import, others have little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of potential hazards. The denial of entry of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violative lot may be regarded as simply a cost of doing business,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is offset in many cases by insurance purchased against just  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such an eventuality. Such policies are identified as ```FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejection' insurance'' and usually the premium is 2 to 3 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the value of the shipment (Ref. 29). It is reasonable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume that this cost is being passed on to the consumer. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance also permits importers to buy seafood from foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors without first ensuring that it meets FDA requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., that it is safe, wholesome, and properly labeled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This system leaves much to be desired. It, too, is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``snapshot''-type approach that places a significant burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government to uncover problems without fostering or promoting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry responsibility. It lacks the preventive controls that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency has tentatively concluded are the minimum necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure safety. Moreover, it has not provided full public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence in the safety of imported seafood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Public Confidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Continuing public concerns about the safety of seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide additional evidence that the current regulatory system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not well-suited for seafood. Consumers have become increasingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about the effects of pollution on seafood. Medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes washing up on beaches, ocean dumping of toxic wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical run-off, and multiple oil spills continually dramatize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fact that bodies of water, no matter how large, can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affected by human activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Media and other public attention on seafood safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality, and on the adequacy of the current regulatory program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for seafood, has been substantial in recent years, and there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no reason to expect that this attention will decrease. Problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with some seafood products draw attention to, and has tended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raise concerns about, all seafood, a situation that is bad for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers because seafood is a low fat product, and bad for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry that can ill afford it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

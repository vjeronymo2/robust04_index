			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Hurd opposes wider role for EC on labour issues HOPES IN the European Community that Britain might be softening its opposition to EC labour market legislation were dashed yesterday. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told other EC ministers in Brussels that he was against proposals to extend majority voting - as opposed to unanimous voting - to labour and social issues. Majority voting would prevent Britain, or any member state, from vetoing parts of the social policy programme and allow the EC a greater say in labour and social issues. 'It would be foolish to commit the community to policies in the social and employment field which involve potentially enormous costs without regard to growth,' Mr Hurd said. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I feel like someone who at the start of this century heard people say that the abolition of child labour would cause the general collapse of the economy.' The foreign secretary said Britain had dispelled the cloud of bad industrial relations that had long hung over it. 'We do not want any pretext for leading industry back into that situation,' he said. The UK has been the only opponent of the EC Social Charter but it appeared to come to terms with some of the legislation, such as written proof of contracts. On Monday, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Britain now supported most elements of the social char-ter. Mr Delors countered Mr Hurd's complaint that social matters would be subject to over-centralised regulation by saying that the commission was relying heavily on dialogue between European employers and trade union organisations. Other EC ministers re-sponded angrily to Mr Hurd's remarks. Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Italian foreign minister, warned that Britain could not hope to get away with vetoing the whole EC political union on social policy grounds alone. Mr Mark Eyskens, Belgian foreign minister, suggested that the UK might be left out of EC social policy-making. It is unlikely such a compromise would be acceptable to other member states which might complain that UK industry was escaping the costs of labour regulation. The Luxembourg presidency was proposing to extend majority voting to issues of contractual conditions of employment and management consultation of workers. Majority votes now apply only to measures to improve workers' health and safety, which generally have UK support. Under the Luxembourg plan, unanimous voting would only be retained for social security issues. Parliament, Page 11</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Further delays for Iraq arms inquiry THE Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry faces further delays because of difficulties in arranging the appearance of key witnesses, it emerged yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes. Public hearings are now expected to continue possibly into April, with publication of the final report unlikely before the summer. Lord Justice Scott began public hearings in May, and had hoped to begin writing his report last month. The schedule was later revised so that the hearings would end early this year. Officials close to the inquiry blame the delays on the problems encountered in securing ministerial support for a 'rolling programme' of witness appearances. Lord Justice Scott is understood to be particularly concerned by the attitude towards his inquiry of Lord Trefgarne, a former defence and trade minister, who has not replied to two separate questionnaires sent to him in September and November. Lord Trefgarne said at the weekend that he would be letting the judge know during the next two weeks whether he was prepared to appear as a witness.</p>

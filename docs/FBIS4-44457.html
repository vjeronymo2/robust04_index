			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in "Observation and Thought" column by He Shouguang </F> (6320 1108 0342): "Warning: Misplacement of Moral Concepts in  Contemporary China"]    [Text] Marx said: The price of society's advance is always  the sacrifice of some traditional morals. This is true. In  recent years China has greatly developed its economy, a  development that has been the focus of world attention; at the  same time it has also made a big sacrifice of its traditional  morals. Some of them deserved to be sacrificed and should have  been sacrificed. For example, the birth concept of "there are  three things that are unfilial, and to have no posterity is the  greatest of them"; the marriage concept of "a woman must be  faithful to one husband all her life"; the economic concept of  "the gentleman does not manage money matters, and the scholar  does not engage in commerce"--etc. But there are some concepts  that do not deserve to be sacrificed and should not be  sacrificed. For example, the major misplacement of the concepts  of honor and disgrace has already endangered the entire nation's  moral system, and this requires a high degree of attention and  vigilance on our part.    Misplacement of concepts of advanced and backward.  Now, in the eyes of many people, being backward is not  disgraceful and being advanced is not honorable. It is hard to  be an advanced person: People do not like to do advanced deeds  or speak advanced things. Some people hide the good deeds they  do, fearing that if the deeds were known they would be the  target of other people's freezing irony and biting satire. In  the sixties, whoever found a wallet and returned it to its owner  would win everybody's respect; today, whoever did this would be  considered by people to be a "fool." In the sixties a "living  Lei Feng" was an honorific; now, in many situations it has  become a term of disparagement. If someone, irrespective of  remuneration, does something to help the public good, someone  else will mock him with a sneer: "Are you a living Lei Feng who  is studying and using Mao Zedong Thought?" A "living Lei Feng"  has become a synonym for someone who is foolish and stupid and  who does not make money and is not good at gaining his own  interests. It is precisely those people who haggle over every  penny and who are insatiable whom, on the contrary, are looked  upon by everybody as capable, skilled, and having a head for  economics. Even mischievous people who do not abide by law or  discipline, who do not obey leaders, and who "curse the mother  while sucking the breast" have actually become heroes in the  eyes of many people. Backward people no longer fear other  people's criticism of their backwardness. If one of them is  called a "backward element," his face does not turn red with  embarassment, and he could, not without some pride, ask in  return: "Advanced element, do you have money?"    Misplacement of civilized behavior and ignorant  behavior. Smoking and spitting anywhere in a public place  are clearly uncivilized acts, and to strengthen the supervision  and control over them is, without a doubt, correct. However, in  bus and train stations, markets, cinemas and theaters, and even  street corners, some people are often observed spitting anwhere  they like and smoking indiscriminately, and they are not  educated or fined by control personnel. Public opinion on the  scene is often unfavorable to the controller while being  sympathetic and supportive of those who disobey the controllers.  It is also natural that car drivers who break the law by running  red lights, not fastening safety belts, and not parking in  designated places should be educated and fined. But public  opinion on the scene always sides with the lawbreaker, and  generally likens the police to "dogs trying to catch mice"--too  meddlesome. Some people do not care for their elders when the  latter are alive, but give them elaborate funerals when they  die, commiting a lot of property to the flames and even burning  Renminbi as an offering to the dead. Their behavior is extremely  benighted, and is regarded by people as filial piety carried to  a ridiculous extreme... and so on and so forth.    Misplacement of thrift and extravagance. Thrift is  a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, but at times it  seems to have become a synonym for the "small peasant's economic  mentality." Extravagance is generally acknowledged as stylish  and daring. The news media has even admired and publicized  "golden banquets," "schools for aristocrats," as well as  high-spending, lavish styles of consumption. For a considerably  long period of time, when we publicize the excellent situation  in the rural areas we will talk about how the peasants compare  each other's wealth, which symbolizes the "soft" criteria for a  peasant's wealth -- "nutrition in eating, smartness in clothes,  and high quality in what is used," publicizing the starting up  of markets and the stimulation of economic development by means  of high consumption. The formulation "being thrifty and  economical is a virtue" has already almost been forgotten. The  tenet "being economical" means being incompetent and that one  should stage "luxurious" scenes derive from the concept that  "poverty is shameful and wealth is honorable." Therefore, some  people, even if heavily in debt, have to slap their own faces  and compare themselves to other people in what they eat, wear,  and use. Those who are officials compare their sedans, housing,  and ....    Misplacement of honesty and dishonesty. Because of  the objectively existing phenomenon of "flogging the fast cows,"  officials in some places have taken the lead in hiding the truth  about output value, hiding the truth about interest and taxes,  and would rather for a long period of time wear the label of  being officials of "a county in sore straits," so as to get  subsidies from the higher authorities. Therefore, in the view of  some people, officials of "counties in sore straits" have been  "blue skies"--just judges--and leaders who have thrown off the  label of "a county in sore straits" have, on the contrary,  become people "who sell out the county to seek honor." Because  they want "to dispense rewards or honors according to merit,"  many people falsely report output values, calculate unhatched  chicken eggs as live chickens that count as peasant income, and  calculate overstocked rejects in warehouses as the year's output  value. Afterward they divide up the bonuses and don the hat of  an official. When personnel changes are made and it is found out  that the funds available cannot pay the debts, then the  state-owned enterprise becomes an empty shell. Fake commodities,  fake receipts, fake diplomas, fake professional titles--fake  people and fake things can be found everywhere, and the extent  of a disaster, based on need, is at will magnified or minimized.  When cheating in this manner, already people's faces do not  change colar and they are not flustered. A popular rhyme in  society is: "Honesty is not worth a penny. If you joke and lie  you will win a prize every year."    Misplacement of law-abiding and lawbreaking. In  their economic activity, some places advocate "a policy of using  feet and using talk," and go on to promote the slogans "Dare to  run a red light" and "Dare to hit an edge ball [a table tennis  term]" and make them experiences to popularize. The illegal  evasion of taxes is shameful, but now many people think it is  honorable, to such an extent that the phenomenon of corporate  tax evasion has become an open secret. For example, signboards  of false "three kinds of enterprises" are hung out, signboards  of false "handicapped persons welfare enterprises" are hung out,  in order to enjoy the benefits of tax reduction or exemption.  After tax evaders are investigated and prosecuted, there are  constant intercessions for them. The Qing government once,  because it had given up its customs control rights to  foreigners, was reviled by all the people in the country, and  this was regarded by later generations as a great national  humiliation. Now, many local officials openly propose that  smuggling be made the new growing point of the economy. Even  smuggling under armed protection. Using the armed forces to deal  with one's own customs for the purpose of having lawbreaking  foreign businessmen drive right in one's national gatge  precisely matches the idiom "throwing the door open for a  thief." If this shameful act is regarded by some people as a  magnificent feat, then "the gauze cap will be carried away,"  there will be a deep feeling of being wronged, and people will  think that whatever one does is for the purpose of becoming an  official and making money.    Misplacement of uncorrupt and corrupt. The  practice of entertaining guests and sending presents, which is  now in vogue in society, is generally acknowledged as a  necessary "emotional investment." Sending presents as bribes is  clearly corrupt behavior, but everybody thinks that if one does  not pocket the bribe then one is not corrupt; wining and dining  on a large scale is clearly corrupt behavior, but it is said "if  one only eats but does not bring, then politics takes command";  and receiving sales commissions is clearly corrupt behavior, but  now it is widely accepted by the common people. If a sales  commission is for public use, the person receiving it will be  commended. Therefore, the image of bing completely uncorrupt has  already changed to that of being inflexible, rigid, and  conservative; and much corrupt behavior has become examples of  daring to charge ahead, daring to take risks, and daring to open  up.    Misplacement of righteousness and wickedness. In  recent years the news media have repeatedly carried reports of  evildoers committing in broad daylight physical assault, murder,  rape, and robbery. In addition, in places where there are more  people, there is more news about evildoers, and the more people  there are who are armed the more the victims are isolated and  cut off from help. There are also instances in which a person  falls into a body of water and a crowd on the bank looks on  while he drowns without anyone rescuing him. There are other  instances in which someone who upholds righteousness gets burned  while pulling someone else out of a fire, and the result is that  even the one who was rescued washes his hands of the matter. It  is bitterly disappointing to hear of such instances! Someone who  sees an injustice and intervenes to help the victim has become  "stupid," while someone who sees an injustice and runs away has  become "smart"--what a preposterous misplacement. Now, in many  places in succession there have been set up award funds for  taking up the cudgel in a just cause, the purpose of which is to  bring back the people's sense of righteousness.    Misplacement of talent and wealth. "The superior  man uses his wealth to seek the right path"--this should be a  reasonable proposition, but now no one pays attention to whether  one is on the right path or not, and only wealth is sought. One  cannot see much stress being put on "talent," and "the head  hanging upside down" has become old news. In economically  developed regions, children are unwilling to attend school,  which they leave as soon as possible in order to make money; in  economically undeveloped regions, children also do not attend  school and there is a serious problem of educational  deprivation. An educational "fault line" between the generations  is silently growing, and the concept of providing education for  all without discrimination is regarded as outworn. It is  unimportant whether one has talent or not; if one has wealth one  has everything, including the ability to buy diplomas signifying  talent and education. For many years we called loudly for  respect for talented persons, with little effect, the main  reason being that we did not have financial backing.    Misplacement of self-esteem and self-belittling.  When a star appears there is no need to use sunlight to see it.  There are people who feign righteousness for fame, and they go  to disaster areas to take the victims' money. This is clearly  behavior that is self-belittling and that forgets one's  integrity under the temptation of personal gain, but the party  concerned is inclined to view it as behavior that shows  self-respect. From ancient times begging has been shameful, but  now some people see it as a good profession to become rich fast.  [South] Koreans consider riding in foreign sedans as shameful;  Chinese consider riding in foreign cars that have been smuggled  into China as honorable.    In the abovementioned phenomena, it is hard to avoid biased  terms and the suspicion of exaggerating things just to scare  people. But in flourishing times there is no fear of  exaggeration. Exaggerating in flourishing times can sober up  people and make the flourishing times more flourishing.    Editor: He Yulin [0149 3768 7792]</p>

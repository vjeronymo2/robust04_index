			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; part three of series entitled </F> "Bureaucrats and the Coalition": "Lack of Progress in  `Deregulation' and 'Decentralization'"]    [Text] On 13 May, the following conversation took place  between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Daiei's Chairman and  President Isao Nakauchi when he visited the prime minister's  official residence bearing a Keidanren [Federation of Economic  Organizations] petition for relaxation of government regulations.    [Prime Minister] "I need you to do what you can to eliminate  the discrepancies between domestic and foreign prices."    [Nakauchi] "But the Finance Ministry is keeping an eye on us  on beer [prices]."  <H5>  Dissatisfaction With Lower Beer Prices </H5>   On 14 April, Daiei reduced domestic beer prices by 7  percent.  Daiei has maintained its lowered retail prices despite the 1 May  rise in the liquor tax, in what was a strong competitive blow to  smaller and mid-sized liquor retail outlets. According to  Nakauchi, the action even had reverberations within the Ministry  of Finance's National Tax Administration Agency, which oversees  the industry.    Officials of the National Tax Administration Agency's  Alcoholic Beverage Tax Division maintain, "Beer is priced by  open market forces. We cannot interfere." However, keeping  prices low in the face of the division's instruction that the  impact of increased taxes be passed on to the consumer certainly  had to annoy the bureaucrats. Even though Nakauchi is  championing the cause of lower prices as Keidanren's vice  president in charge of administrative reforms, there are  whispers in Kasumigaseki that "He is just trying to expand sales  for his own retail operation."    "Last summer, large retail outlets of over 10,000 square  meters in size were granted licenses through a special exemption  clause. A further easing of regulations is uncalled for." On  12 May, the day before Nakauchi met with the prime minister, the  National Tax Administration Agency rejected seven separate  petitions for deregulation on liquor sales at a session of the  "Import Expansion, Improving Market Access and Distribution"  working subcommittee of the Promotion Headquarters for  Administrative Reform held at the prime minister's official  residence.    At the working subcommittee session, eight government  ministries and agencies concerned agreed to "take positive  steps" on only two of the 71 proposals on the distribution  sector made by a private sector hoping for deregulation. It was  evident that in all areas, there is a deeply rooted resistance  to any actual loosening of control.  <H5>  Recommendations Outside Jurisdiction </H5>   The passive attitude of the various government agencies  toward deregulation has become more pronounced with the advent  of the Hata administration. "To facilitate any easing of  regulations, some guarantee of the political authorities'  determination to immplement such measures is necessary, but that  is improbable in the current situation where the budget is not  even passed, " (a senior Ministry of Construction official)  voiced cynical insight into the dubious footing of the minority  coalition government.    In the midst of this, the machinations of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry are elaborately orchestrated.  In 16 areas where it has no jurisdiction, such as in rice and  liquor sales, the ministry presented a mid-May report  recommending a sweeping easing of regulations. The senior  officials of the ministry have even personally approached the  working subcommittee's experts from academia and the business  sector.    In lieu of offering a menu of choices to the experts and the  prime minister, who are looking for impressive deregulation  measures, the ministry has adopted a strategy to win acceptance  of its own plan to "gradually ease regulations" under its  jurisdiction, such as those embodied in the Large Retail Store  Law.    However, inasmuch as deregulation is part of international  commitments, the pressure for them nonetheless persists. In the  final stage, the bureaucrats are inwardly prepared to table at  least some minor deregulation measures as they stage a game of  "awaiting the prime minister's political decision."    What the central government ministries and agencies  vehemently oppose is the decentralization of government powers.  <H5>  Finally Eviscerating the Legal Provisions </H5>   "In the end, we had no choice but to compromise." So say  Ministry of Home Affairs senior officials looking back on their  struggle since January to liaise with other ministries and  government bureaus in seeking to establish "regional  amalgamation."    Regional amalgamation will be established by the amendment  of  the Local Government Act, enabling various prefectural-level  governments or municipalities to work together on issues such as  refuse disposal. The pillar of regional amalgamation was its  ability to demand that the central government delegate authority.    However, the overwhelming resistance from the other  ministries has resulted in the appendage of numerous provisions  enhancing central government involvement to the proposed bill.  In the final draft, requests to delegate authority can only be  granted for "powers closely related to regional amalgamation."    The negotiations between the various ministries and agencies  overlapped the final days of the Hosokawa administration and the  birth of the Hata administration. Evidence of active leadership  by the Prime Minister's Office was barely visible.    The issue of information disclosure is as prominent as the  issue of decentralization. Koshiro lshida, director general of  the Management and Coordination Agency, has recently started to  emphasize that the proposed reforms will be "the most sweeping  reforms in half a century." Nobuyoshi Namikawa, secretary  general of the People's Conference on Administrative Reform, is  worried: "That is what bureaucrats say when they mean, `We are  not going to make this easy'."</p>

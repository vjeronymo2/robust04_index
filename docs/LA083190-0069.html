			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE CLAIMS ANOTHER YOUNG LIFE IN RAMPART DIVISION  </P> <P> "Pebbles" was a 15-year-old Westlake girl who was shot to death early Thursday  by a gunman who demanded money from her.  </P> <P> The gunman had chosen Pebbles not for her money, witnesses said, but for  revenge.  </P> <P> Pebbles was her gang moniker, friends said. Her true name was withheld by  authorities until her family could be notified.  </P> <P> She had been talking with her boyfriend in front of the Stuart Hotel in the 700  block of Union Avenue at 3:20 a.m. when a car that had often been seen in the  neighborhood passed by, turned around and dropped off a young passenger,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> According to police and witness reports, the young man went up to Pebbles and  asked, "Where's the 20?" Before she could respond, he pulled out a handgun and  started shooting, striking her several times in the head and upper body.  Pebbles was taken to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, where she died, said  Rampart Division Police Lt. Doc Warkentin. She is the third youth in the  division to die violently this month, he said.  </P> <P> According to detectives, the killing may have been related to drugs -- although  Pebbles was carrying none when she was shot. Friends and residents living in  the long-term, tenant hotels that line Union Avenue said Pebbles was a gang  member, and like others before her, was killed as retaliation by a rival gang  member.  </P> <P> "She died for the silliest reason in the world," said a 30-year-old man, who  identified himself as the boyfriend standing with Pebbles when she was shot. He  declined to give his name. The gunman wasn't after money, he said; "She died  for some (thing) that her homeboys did." The boyfriend also declined to say  what precipitated the killing, only that "she had nothing to do with it."  </P> <P> Mandy Birseno, 11, who has lived in the neighborhood for two months, said she  often saw the 4-foot-6, 105-pound Pebbles, who was known as a giggly teen-ager  with curly brown hair and a pigeon-toed gait.  </P> <P> Birseno said she did not know where the slain girl lived. "I think she stayed  with different friends," Birseno said. By late Thursday, detectives had yet to  find anyone in Pebbles' family.  </P> <P> The boyfriend, too, said Pebbles did not live with her family. But he was  speaking of the gang that people said she belonged to when he added, "She was  an Orphan."  </P></p>

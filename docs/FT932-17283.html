			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bridport-Gundry Bridport-Gundry, a manufacturer of netting and twisted woven products, swung from profits of Pounds 172,000 to losses of Pounds 439,000 pre-tax for the half year to January 31. Directors said the results were in line with forecast and were affected by the restructuring of netting and the growing seasonality of the business. Turnover was static at Pounds 12.9m. However, exports increased by some 50 per cent and now account for 73 per cent (46 per cent) of sales. Losses per share emerged at 4.63p (earnings 1.66p). The interim dividend is held at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (7): The competitive edge - Stock exchanges are locked in battle A LONDON-based representative of one of the biggest US stock exchanges says that many of the UK and continental companies he visits are amazed to learn that there are competing stock exchanges in the US. Most countries in Europe and south-east Asia have just one stock exchange, perhaps backed up by a few regional exchanges that service local business communities. In the US, however, competition among exchanges has never been more intense than today. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (ASE), headquartered in downtown Manhattan, are the oldest forums for trading equities in the US. Over the decades, they have been supplemented by regional exchanges, such as the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco. In the last two decades, however, the floor-based exchanges have seen their position undermined. The NYSE has lost large chunks of its market share in the past decade. In 1981 more than 75 per cent of the trading in all US stocks was handled by the NYSE. By last year, that share had dropped to not much more than half, with overseas markets (mostly London), the regional exchanges, the Nasdaq electronic market run by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and various off-exchange trading systems stealing the rest. The NYSE's share has been eroded because the nature of securities trading in the US is changing as technological development and increasing emphasis on cutting transaction costs refocuses attitudes to stock markets. The NYSE's main rival is Nasdaq. Unlike the NYSE, which relies on customer order flow to establish prices, Nasdaq is a dealer-driven market where market-makers list prices on computer screens at which they are willing to buy and sell stocks. Because dealers can trade NYSE-listed stocks on Nasdaq, the NYSE has lost business to the electronic market. Investors (or their brokers) have a choice between trading NYSE stocks on the Big Board with its order-driven pricing mechanism and floor-based trading system, or doing business via marketmakers on Nasdaq, which claims to execute trades faster and at a lower cost. Over the years, a growing number has chosen the Nasdaq route. In 1981, less than 1 per cent of all trades in NYSE stocks was conducted on Nasdaq. Last year, that figure had jumped to almost 10 per cent. Nasdaq is not alone in fighting for NYSE business. Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, a New York-based Nasdaq dealing firm, has used computer technology and trading know-how to build a profitable business persuading broking firms to route their customers' buy and sell orders through its automated trading system. Madoff offers a form of refund to broking firms that direct business its way. In effect, the company pays brokers for any business they bring in. This way of attracting order flow is used by the regional US exchanges, which also compete for NYSE business. The Pacific and the Midwest Stock Exchange have also moved from eliminating commissions on order execution to pay brokers to bypass the Big Board. While over-the-counter systems like Nasdaq and Madoff represent what is known as the 'third market' (the NYSE and the ASE are the 'first market', and the regional exchanges the 'second market'), the development of computerised off-exchange trading systems over the past decade has created extra competition - a 'fourth market'. The fourth market systems dispense with dealer intermediaries altogether, providing institutions with an electronic forum where they can deal directly with each other. The best known of these crossing networks are Instinet, run by Reuters, POSIT, which is owned by West Coast broking house Jeffries, and Spaworks, a trading system set up by a former Kidder Peabody trader, that now operates under the name of the Arizona Stock Exchange. All three allow institutional users to post buy and sell orders on screen, with orders matched and executed electronically by the system's computers at the end of specified trading sessions. The fourth market systems are popular with investors. They are cheaper for big institutions than trading through an NYSE specialist and offer a greater degree of anonymity. Both third and fourth markets have their flaws, however. They lack liquidity, especially at times of crisis. Complaints were made after the 1987 October crash that some marketmakers on Nasdaq's computer system did not answer telephone calls because they were reluctant to trade in the middle of a chaotic market. (The NASD now says a marketmaker will always be available to trade a stock, no matter what the market condition.) As a result, the spreads between buy and sell prices on third market networks or fourth market systems are likely to be wider, which means investors get a worse deal than on floor-based exchanges. The crossing networks, meanwhile, have been criticised for their lack of speed in trade execution. Because of the way the systems are set up, investors' orders are filled only if there are similar-sized and priced orders on the other side of the transaction, and only then at one of the various crossing sessions. If investors want to react quickly to news, they have to go back to the OTC markets or big exchanges. There is a final element of competition - the fight for listings between the NYSE, the ASE and Nasdaq. Generally, Nasdaq is known as the market for small, fast-growth companies seeking their first quotation. The ASE specialises in mid-capitalisation, solid-growth stocks, while the NYSE is seen as the market most companies aspire to be listed on when they grow big enough. That hierarchy, however, is being challenged. Nasdaq has persuaded some well-known big companies not to upgrade to the NYSE. Thus, Apple and Microsoft stick to Nasdaq because of its long association with hi-tech companies. The ASE is fighting for Nasdaq's turf by offering a listing for very small companies, an incubator market known as the Emerging Companies Market. The NYSE, which still attracts the bulk of the big new listings, has focused its attention on attracting foreign companies. But its ambitions to be the first true global exchange are blocked by strict US reporting regulations which dissuade many big foreign corporations from seeking a US listing.</p>

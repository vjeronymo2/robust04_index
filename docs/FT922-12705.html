			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Changing patterns of recruitment repay study THE RAF can be as lethal in print as it is in the air. A recent recruitment advertisement shows a black-and-white photo of a small boy in long shorts running across a playground, his arms extended like aeroplane wings. The caption reads: 'Can you honestly remember anyone playing chartered accountants?' As graduate recruitment staff in the accountancy firms take breath to reflect on their intakes this year, the legacy of the Monty Python comedy series jibe lives on. However, the message from recruiters planning for the future is no laughing matter for the graduates of the 1990s. More than a decade after John Cleese ridiculed the profession as 'irrepressibly boring and dull' - and moved on to make lucrative management training videos - the tarnished image lingers. An advert in a recently-published student careers guide from BDO Binder Hamlyn shows a fake brass plaque. On it is etched: 'Dull, Grey &amp; Ditchwater, Chartered Accountants.' The caption reads: 'If you want to be a boring accountant, go and work for someone else.' Such defensiveness may seem surprising so long after the slur surfaced. It should be doubly perplexing given the high level of recruits currently circulating on the job market. It does, however, reflect something of the changing nature of graduates that the accountancy firms are now seeking. The supply of graduates seeking accountancy jobs has probably never been higher. Price Waterhouse says that last year it had nearly 14,000 applicants. KPMG Peat Marwick estimates that in London alone there have been about 4,000 applications for about 200 openings this year, while nationwide it has nearly 10,000 students applying for some 700 places. The demand from the firms has been dropping sharply. Ernst &amp; Young hired 650 graduates in 1989. This year the figure is likely to be about 500. At Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the number has fallen from about 1,000 in 1990 to 800 this year. Mr Alan Fawcitt, a careers adviser at Cambridge University, estimates the larger firms have cut back by an average of 25 per cent in 1991 and 1992. 'Accountancy is no longer a fall-back,' he says. 'The firms are being much more selective. They have fewer vacancies, are finishing recruitment earlier, and picking and choosing quality candidates.' That has been good news for the firms, which have been able to attract better applicants than in previous years - although they concede that the best remain highly employable and are still difficult to entice. Mr Dick Shervington, national recruitment partner at Price Waterhouse, says: 'We have been a great deal more selective this year. We had a lot of applications in the autumn, some from people who have not entirely thought through their choice.' The firm has set deliberately high standards. 'We've been pretty harsh. We have not asked people to walk on water but at least to take a few steps across the Thames.' Even so, he has been surprised by the nervousness of recruits eager to seize guarantees. Price Waterhouse normally assumes a 50 per cent acceptance rate from those offered jobs, and was planning on a two-thirds rate last year given the economic conditions. In fact, nearly 70 per cent accepted nationwide. Mr Fawcitt agrees that competition between graduates for accountancy jobs has increased. 'Quite a number of students have had a shock when they have found they have been turned down,' he says. 'That has not really happened before in living graduate recruitment memory.' The decline in numbers being recruited reflects the the recession. On one hand, the slowdown of the economy has reduced demand for accountancy firms' services, reducing the expansion curve of the past decade. On the other, newly-qualified staff - and others at all levels within the firms - have refused to move to other employment as part of the normal process of wastage. This has been driven by a contraction in the availability of other financial service sector jobs, and because employees are less willing to take a risk on an outside job when they know that there is less chance of being re-employed by their firm. It has resulted in widespread redundancies, and a scaling back in the quantity of graduates being taken on in the first place. The drop in numbers recruited also represents a resumption of a more sustainable level of recruitment, down from an abnormal peak caused by the mergers between large firms in the late 1980s. The firms have slimmed down from an initial period of over-staffing, while the number of students seeking accountancy employment has remained relatively stable. That leaves a more worrying underlying trend. There seems to be little prospect of renewed job growth, even when the economy picks up. Most firms stress that their current recruitment plans stretch well beyond the recession. 'You have got to look ahead three to five years,' says Ms Chris Lynch, national recruitment manager at Ernst &amp; Young. 'We are recruiting for the future.' Mr Ian du Pre, national recruitment partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, expects numbers to fall further in the future. He says clients are taking a firmer hold upon the work offered by the firms. They are increasingly vocal about high fees, and expect more focused work from more highly-qualified, experienced staff. Growing use of technology and more strategic approaches to audit work are reducing the need for armies of junior staff. The traditional pyramid employment structure of the firms - with far more trainees at the bottom than partners at the top - is likely to squash itself more into a rectangle. 'Gone are the Herculean days when we recruited one thousand graduates a year,' says Mr David Clifford, national student recruitment partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Everyone recognises that the explosive growth of the 1980s can't happen again. There is a degree of caution now.' What remains is becoming more fragmented. The last few years have seen a sharp growth in trainees recruited straight to the tax department. At Coopers, about 10 per cent of graduate recruits study for qualifications other than chartered accountancy, including exams in management accounting, public finance and actuarial science. One of the more radical schemes has been developed at Grant Thornton, which launched a business adviser trainee scheme for 60 graduates last summer. Those accepted are being offered a fast-track route with the prospect of becoming partners within seven years. Accounting trainees, by contrast, will become back-up staff to this elite, and increasingly shift from graduates to non-graduates. Those involved in the job market would do well to pay attention to these trends. If the current pattern of accountancy firm recruitment continues, it will place severe demands on those drafting the syllabi of the different professional qualifications to keep them relevant. It raises the question of who else will employ the enormous number of graduates previously hired by the firms - which only a few years ago represented about 10 per cent of all students entering paid employment. It also suggests that companies may have to start increasing their own training budgets or finding new sources of skilled staff as the smaller number of recruits offered qualifications through the firms remain loyal to their original employer.</p>

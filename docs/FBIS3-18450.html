Solana  stated that both countries' troops will cooperate closely in the  attempt to open the humanitarian aid route to Sarajevo and to  achieve a permanent cease-fire in Mostar.    Another of the aspects broached was the rapprochement of  stances between Spain and the United Kingdom for the approval of  a UN Security Council resolution on the situation in Sarajevo  which would also include Tuzla and Mostar, and the appointment  of a coordinator for the first-mentioned of those cities. There  is also agreement on the enlargement of the European Union.  [passage omitted]</p>

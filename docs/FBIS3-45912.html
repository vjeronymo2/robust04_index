			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Year-End Roundup" by reporter Luo Zhaoming (5012 3564 </F> 2494): "Macao Embarks on Stable Development of the Late  Transitional Period"]    [Text] Macao, 22 Dec (XINHUA) -- The first year in which  Macao enters the late transitional period was 1993. Due to the  friendly cooperation between China and Portugal, Macao has  enjoyed social stability, work in all areas has continued to  develop, and new progress has been made in the work of the  transitional period.    With the extensive participation and active support by  people  of all circles of Macao, drafting of the Macao Special  Administrative Zone's Basic Law has been completed as scheduled,  and the law was formally promulgated after it was examined and  approved in March by the First Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress. The Basic Law establishes the principle and  policy of "one country, two systems" in the form of law,  providing an accurate and clear picture of Macao's future  development and providing a fundamental assurance for Macao's  stable transition and its long-term stable development; the  Basic Law has been welcomed by people of all strata of Macao.  Currently, the Macao Basic Law Promotion Society -- a civic  organization formed by the former Macao Basic Law Drafting  Committee and the former Macao Basic Law Counselling Committee  -- is working actively to further publicize and promote the  basic law in an effort to further deepen Macao residents'  understanding of the Basic Law and to enable work of the  transitional period to be in line with the Basic Law.    In the late transitional period, the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Liaison Group's work and tasks have become heavier. In the  spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, the two  sides have strengthened communications, enhanced mutual  understanding, and strived to quicken the pace of work. Since  the beginning of this year, the Joint Liaison Group, in addition  to continuing consultations on the three major issues of the  transitional period and the issue of Macao's participation in  international organizations, has separately formed a work group  on currency issues, a work group on aviation agreements, and a  work group on government employees' pensions, to study and  discuss the respective issues. Through friendly consultations,  the two sides also have reached an agreement on issues  concerning the Macao International Airport, signed documents on  air transportation agreement, and begun to examine Macao's first  aviation agreement with other localities, thereby ensuring the  smooth proceeding of the construction of the Macao International  Airport and of other airport-related work. However, relatively  slow progress has been made in establishing the Chinese  language's official status and in making government employees  and Macao law more locally-oriented. However, the slight  progress in the work in these areas attained so far has laid a  foundation for quickening the pace of resolving these issues.    Economically, Macao has always benefited from the mainland's  reform and opening up. Promotion of the socialist market  economy on the mainland has provided Macao with new  opportunities and development space. Macao has enjoyed social  stability and its industrial and commercial development has been  steady. From 1987 to 1992, Macao's total output value increased  42 percent -- resulting in an average annual growth rate of 7  percent -- and the government's financial revenues increased 337  percent. Since the beginning of this year, affected by the  economic recessions in Europe and the United States, Macao's  total export value in the first 8 months decreased 2.1 percent  from the same period of last year, and its imports increased 1.7  percent. However, Macao's tourist industry, financial industry,  commercial activities, and other tertiary industries have  performed very well. A total of 5.32 million tourists visited  Macao in the first eight months of this year, an increase of 3.8  percent from the same period last year. As of the end of June,  savings deposits by all Macao residents (excluding off- coast  deposits) totaled 52.39 billion and local loans totaled 31.56  billion Macao dollars, up 5.1 and 21.9 percent, respectively,  over the same period last year. Commercial investments have  been brisk, with the number of companies inaugurated in the  first six months and registered capital showing a fairly big  increase over last year's corresponding period.    Meanwhile, considerable progress has been made in improving  infrastructure, and construction of a number of large  engineering projects has proceeded smoothly. Of these projects,  the new Hong Kong-Macao Passengers Pier, the Jiulong-Macao  Deep-Water Harbor, a garbage incendiary, and the Songshan Tunnel  have been completed and put into operation; the new Macao-Taipa  bridge will be completed and opened to traffic early next year;  and the construction of an international airport has proceeded  smoothly, with two thirds of the artificial islands in the  runway area being completed. Recently Macao and Guangdong have  reached an agreement on extension of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai  Railway and Expressway to Macao. The completion of these  infrastructural facilities will make Macao more accessible to  the outside world and will promote its economic growth.    With the year 1999 drawing near, Macao has increased its  contacts with the hinterland and witnessed record two-way  investments as well as economic and trade activities; the  footsteps of Macao businessmen have extended from the Zhujiang  Delta to the central, eastern, and northeastern China. Exchange  and cooperation in the areas of economics, science and  technology, media, culture, education, sports, and health have  brought about better understanding and greater trust, thus  enhancing the confidence of people in various circles in Macao's  future development.    Authoritative sources here pointed out: Since the beginning  of the transitional period, Macao has been able to effect smooth  transition and promote social stability and prosperity primarily  because China and Portugal have carried out friendly cooperation  based on the Joint Statement to solve many problems facing the  transition through consultations; it is also because of the  active participation and concerted effort of the people in  various circles in Macao. So long as the two sides continue to  work concertedly in line with the spirit of the Sino-Portuguese  Joint Statement, Macao will surely be able to smoothly carry out  the work of various fields during the transition and create a  favorable environment for the smooth handover of political power  in the year 1999.</p>

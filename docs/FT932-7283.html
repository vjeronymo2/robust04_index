			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Cinema audiences increase THE CINEMA is making a strong comeback in the UK with audiences higher last year than in any year since 1980, the latest Cultural Trends report shows. More than 60 per cent of the population aged 7 and older goes to the cinema and more than 30 per cent of the 15-24 age group does so once a month or more. The estimated total audience last year was 101m. Cinema box-office takings, at under Pounds 300m, account for little more than a fifth of the Pounds 1.4bn total consumer expenditure on films. The balance comes from expenditure such as video hire and subscriptions to television film channels. Radio is the other expanding media sector highlighted in the report compiled from available statistics and published today by the Policy Studies Institute, an independent research organisation. Helped by the launch of Classic FM, radio attracted 41.6m listeners a week - 89 per cent of the population - during the last quarter of 1992. BBC Radio, which had a record budget of Pounds 338.2m in 1991-92, is gradually losing audience share to its commercial rivals, but still has more than 58 per cent of the market. Mr Jeremy Eckstein, editor of Cultural Trends, believes the picture in the television market is one of remarkable stability. 'The whole thing is operating within a fully saturated market,' he said. 'There have been enormous changes in production, but so far as viewers are concerned there is no change at all.' Overall the impact of cable and satellite television was still very modest, accounting for around 5 per cent of total viewing and 30 per cent in cable and satellite homes. The recession is blamed for slowing cable and satellite growth. Cultural Trends 17. Policy Studies Institute Pounds 15.50. From bookshops or from BEBC, PO Box 1496, Poole, Dorset BH12 3YD.</p>

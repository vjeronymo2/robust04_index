			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Bhutto on course for clash over march THERE was little hope in Pakistan last night that the government of Prime Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif and opposition parties led by former prime minister Ms Benazir Bhutto could avoid their most bitter confrontation tomorrow. Opposition activists will try to march into the capital, Islamabad despite a ban on protesters entering the city. Ms Bhutto has planned the march in the hope of a comeback on a populist tide. She claims thousands of her supporters have been arrested since the weekend . The march could pose a serious test for the ruling alliance but political observers do not foresee an immediate change of government. A large turnout would intensify political pressure on Mr Sharif, who came to power in elections two years ago after Ms Bhutto's government was dismissed on charges of corruption. Mr Sharif appears to have become vulnerable since a split earlier this year within the ruling Islamic Democratic Alliance led to a break with the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), the powerful regional party in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and heart of the country's corporate and financial sectors. Though he still claims to have a simple majority in Parliament, he has lost the two-thirds majority which gave him the opportunity to bring about constitutional changes. There are also new concerns about the economy, with the government estimating recent flood damage at between Rs40bn and Rs50bn (Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 1.28bn). Opposition activists, who have repeatedly accused the government of corruption and failure to resolve important national issues, are demanding an interim 'national consensus government' representing a broad spectrum of political parties as a prelude to'free and fair elections.' Ms Bhutto said: 'The present government neither has the legitimacy nor is able to govern in accordance with the constitution. Law and order and the government machinery has broken down.' Mr Sharif said the march would be a failure which the 'masses would not be so foolish to join'. Everybody will see that people support 'our policies for progress and development.' In Pakistan's troubled political history since independence 45 years ago, there are few examples of populist pressure bearing upon the rulers, and, today, there are few visible signs of public unrest.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / St Johns Hospital bought for Pounds 3m ST JOHNS Hospital, near Leicester Square in central London, has been sold for redevelopment to a Chinese buyer for almost Pounds 3m, Vanessa Houlder writes. The sale, by South East Thames Regional Health Authority, reflects the health service's efforts to rationalise its estate. The buyer is considering asking for planning permission for restaurants, a community centre, housing and a private hospital. Existing planning permission for offices is unlikely to be acted on. The facade is listed and will be kept. Allsop, the agent which conducted the sale, said the building had attracted strong interest, particularly from Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (2): EC membership lifts prosperity - Agriculture: about a third of Greek output now comes from the north FARMING IN northern Greece is now a business rather than a way of life. Holdings are larger, crops more varied and mechanisation more extensive than in the south of the country. Farmers' incomes are high, in some places rivalling those of Cretan vegetable-growers, the wealthiest Greek producers. Almost 12 years of European Community membership has brought a dramatic rise in Greek farmers' standard of living. About two-thirds of EC transfers, amounting to over Dollars 17bn since Greek accession, have gone to support prices for agricultural products. For most crops, even the withdrawal prices provide farmers with a comfortable living. About one-third of Greek agricultural output now comes from northern Greece, with production concentrated in the plains of Macedonia. Northern farmers grow 62 per cent of cereals, 50 per cent of maize and 80 per cent of sugar beet produced in Greece. In addition, about 55 per cent of the tobacco crop comes from the north. Irrigation is well-advanced: the region also specialises in growing cotton, to supply the local yarn and textile industry, and is one of the few rice-producing areas in the EC. Over the past decade, fruit-growing on the hillsides above the Macedonian plains has developed into a major commercial activity. Apples and pears are grown for domestic consumption, while peaches, pears and cherries have become high-earning exports. 'Farmers in this region are professional in their outlook, despite the relatively small size of their holdings. They're willing to change crops, and they're susceptible to new ideas about machinery, because they work the land themselves,' says Mr Nikos Efthymiades, of K&amp;N Efthymiades, Greece's leading agrochemicals manufacturer. Agriculture has not always flourished in this part of Greece. Farming remained a subsistence occupation, even after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922 had brought thousands of skilled farmers to the region from Asia Minor. The newcomers were granted what were fairly large landholdings by Greek standards, averaging about 10 acres, as former Turkish-owned properties were handed over and big estates were broken up. But it was only after the completion of large-scale anti-flood and drainage programmes, carried out with government funding and US expertise, that output started to increase significantly. Another 300,000 acres of cultivable land became available, mainly in fertile river valleys in Macedonia and Thrace. Tobacco is still the traditional crop in Thrace, although the oriental varieties, suited to the district's poorer soil, face a steady decline in demand. Macedonian farmers are taking over, growing more Virginia tobacco, which commands much better prices. Younger farmers in Thrace are starting to give up tobacco, switching to cotton and wheat instead. The picture is rather different in Epirus, a much more mountainous region. In the valleys and coastal plains, olive and citrus cultivation remain the main agricultural activities. In the mountains, sheep-raising is still important, and considerable amounts of cheese are produced by traditional methods. However, the main growth area in all the northern Greek provinces is dairy production. Output has grown rapidly since the early 1980s in response to sharply rising consumer demand. As a result, large Greek milk and yoghurt producers compete in providing incentives for farmers to keep small herds of dairy cows. These include extending loans to farmers to buy Dutch and French cows, providing veterinary back-up, and help in getting EC subsidies to build cowsheds. Some companies take Greek dairy farmers to Holland for seminars in animal husbandry. Demand for sheep and goat's milk is also high, with the shepherds of Epirus able to claim payment three or four months in advance for their winter and spring milk production. Milk output in Greece now totals 1.78m tonnes yearly, of which 694,000 tonnes is produced by cows, 640,000 tonnes by sheep and 462,000 tonnes by goats. Most sheep and goat milk is used for cheese-making, with only a small percentage used for yoghurt. 'Demand for cow's milk is still increasing at the rate of about 5 per cent yearly, and there is probably some way to go, since canned evaporated milk still covers about 40 per cent of the market. Per capita consumption of fresh milk in Greece is still less than half the the EC average,' says Mr Thanassis Kravas, marketing director of Mevgal, a milk and yoghurt producer near Thessaloniki. Although small family-run dairies continue to make sheep's yoghurt, about three-quarters of Greek yoghurt output, amounting to around 77,000 tonnes annually, is now factory- produced. Exports have risen from 2,000 tonnes in 1987 to 7,500 tonnes last year, with sales concentrated in Britain France and Italy. However, surpluses of other farm products are showing an increase. This year, more than half of a record peach crop, reaching over 920,000 tonnes, was dumped. Greece is one of the world's largest producers of canned peaches, with 90 per cent of industrial peaches grown in western Macedonia. But canning capacity, at only 250,000 tonnes, has failed to keep pace with the growth in production. Citrus output is also heavily in surplus, partly because Greek oranges are mainly old-fashioned varieties which cannot compete in EC markets with Spanish or Israeli produce. At the same time, demand from eastern European countries, which used to buy large quantities of Greek citrus under bilateral government-to-government trade agreements, has shrunk in the past two years. One reason for the rising surpluses is that Greek farmers receive comparatively little support or advice from the state agricultural extension service. Until recently, seed production and sales were a state monopoly, with the result that research and development of new seed varieties has lagged behind the rest of Europe. At the other end of the production cycle, marketing and exporting of Greek produce is in need of better co-ordination. From next year, farmers face a sizeable drop in product prices under the revised EC agricultural policy. Support rates for both marketed produce and withdrawals will start declining at a time when costs are increasing. Fertiliser prices have soared since the government lifted all remaining price controls earlier this year. Mr Alkis Giziades, who farms 20 acres of his own land outside Thessaloniki and another 15 acres of rented property, sums up the farmer's dilemma: 'Fertiliser prices have tripled in less than a year, and diesel is up by 30 per cent. Wheat and cotton prices will be down by 10 per cent at least. That makes you wonder whether you should plant less and switch to milk - even though feed's gone up and cows are hard work to look after.'</p>

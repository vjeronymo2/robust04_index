			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with </F> unidentified reporters and Honduran citizens at the Telesistema  Hondureno television studios in Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Excerpts] [Reina, in progress] ... I feel like someone who  has returned to his alma mater after graduation to see the  friendly faces and hear the voices that helped him through every  step of the struggle. I am very honored. I am a friend who has  come to speak with the Honduran people.    [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. Friends, you  can now ask your questions and viewers can participate by  calling us at 32-6074 and 32-5514. Mr. President, it is obvious  that the topic of the moment, the issue that is being discussed  by all Hondurans and even internationally, because it  constitutes a big step for Honduras, is the change from  obligatory military service to a voluntary and educational  military service. We discussed it on this program last night  with great satisfaction. What does this mean to you? At first  glance it looks like the beginning of the fulfillment of  campaign promises.    [Reina] I am truly very pleased to have accomplished what I  proposed during the campaign through a concerted effort and in a  very serious, united way. We have not had any conflicts. There  are, of course, some considerations that must be taken into  account, although certain sectors refuse to do so. For example,  what would happen if the voluntary military service fails to  provide the number of Armed Forces troops required at any given  time? I believe that issue has been properly addressed.  Citizens have certain duties, and the state, during times of  war and in accordance with the law, can find ways to draft those  citizens whose duty it is to serve. But we cannot do it the way  we used to recruit people. We all agreed on that point. No  one agreed with our previous recruitment system because it had  two defects: first, it was very rigid; and second, only the poor  were drafted while the sons of the wealthy evaded the draft.  That could not be viewed as justice anywhere in the world.  That is why this step has been received with great  satisfaction, and, of course, I am very proud.    I congratulate the Armed Forces, the Honduran people, and  the  young people whose wishes I have fulfilled with this decision  that began as a campaign promise and is today a reality in the  National Congress.    [Reporter] Why use adjectives such as social and humanism,  Mr. President?    [Reina] To be absolutely frank, those adjectives were  suggested by distinguished officers as a means of complementing  and enriching the document. The word social is used because the  trend is to help the majority; and the word humanism is used  because humanism is the prevalent doctrine at the end of this  century. For instance, when we talk about fighting drugs and  corruption and of making our measures humane, that constitutes  humanism and meshes perfectly with the idea that our men,  respecting our dignity, will defend their fatherland without the  harshness that once marked recruitment. This position is  humanistic, social, and educational because it will enable each  recruit to improve his cultural heritage and because it is  voluntary.    [Reporter] What do you mean, Mr. President, when you say  that military service will also be democratic?    [Reina] I mean that democracy is not simply a matter of  going  to the polls. It is not a formality. It is a philosophy to  live by. Every decision must be made with the objective of  shaping a democratic man. A democratic man does not take  advantage of anyone; he does not offend or violate rights. A  democratic man accepts opposing decisions by those involved in a  dialogue. He would never take arbitrary actions. Democracy as  a way of life is perhaps the most important meaning of this work.    [Reporter] Mr. President, today we heard different reactions  to your decision from various, obviously important sectors.  The most important reaction probably came from Defense  Minister General Andino Flores. He virtually said that the  Armed Forces had accepted the decision of their commander in  chief, who is the president of the Republic. He implied very  clearly, however, that the Armed Forces high command had not  fully accepted the decision. He said that they acknowledge that  the commander in chief, who is the president of the Republic,  has the final world, but that they disagreed with the decision  nevertheless.    [Reina] I believe his terminology is causing some confusion.  The Armed Forces said: We will accept the decision. We are  nondeliberative. We are obedient, and this is the final  decision. The defense minister himself will present the draft  and explain the reasons for it. Gen. Andino Flores tried to  explain -- this is my interpretation -- that the high command  does not exactly share my views on voluntary service because  obligatory service allowed the Army to have the number of troops  the country would need at any given time. I wanted to stay  between these two extremes. The Armed Forces say: We disagree  but we obey. I do not see any contradiction. This confirms  that the idea of a voluntary military service comes not from  them but from the president of the Republic.    [Reporter] Mr. President, can you tell the Honduran people  that an agreement on this issue has been reached with the Armed  Forces High Command?    [Reina] Discussions were very open, very cordial. There were  positions that from the beginning did not agree, but in the  final draft we began to find this point of consensus. I believe  this has been one of the quickest moves toward consensus. It is  a truly historic act -- really momentous. It is a change, and  changes of course deserve to be discussed. The parties should  accept the resolution made by consensus.    [Reporter] It was indeed an historic event. As you said  tonight, there was a consensus. Today there was a meeting  between a ranking officer and the National Party. What was the  meaning of that meeting? Do you think it was necessary?    [Reina] I think it was a political act. The issue is now at  the National Assembly, the political forum par excellence where  every option will be discussed. Some will insist that the draft  must be obligatory. I have heard someone say that this  contradicts citizens' rights. Nevertheless, I think the most  important thing is to please the majority, which will be very  satisfied with this great step forward. No more will we see  young men virtually lassoed and forcefully drafted. I have  always insisted on this. A heroic figure showed us how to win  battles. Battles are won only by men who voluntarily defend  their rights.    [Reporter] Very interesting, Mr. President. You speak of  winning battles. Let us talk about the country's economic  situation. You spoke of giving the economy a human face, but  the prices of many basic basket products have been raised. That  is what the people resent most, particularly considering that  you have been in office less than 100 days. What do you think  about this?    [Reina] Those price increases do not depend on the  government. There is a mistake regarding the human face  reference. At the Jose Cecilio del Valle building today we  explained the nature of the Honduran Social Investment Fund  [FHIS], which will reach every corner of the country, not as a  social compensation, as it has been described, but as projects  for a majority of the people. The idea is not to give things  away to people but to help them intelligently and spontaneously  develop their own communities. Now we will talk about boards of  trustees, which have never really worked very well. The  community and the government should participate in projects to  benefit the people. Through a broad plan, FHIS will provide the  human face we want for the government measures. We intend to  reach all communities. If someone protests because beets or  carrots are more expensive, he should remember that these prices  do not depend on the government. The government could freeze  prices, but that would be a risky move because there could be  negative effects. The Honduran economy will improve when we  produce more. We are laying the groundwork for higher  production and for the people's health through food so basic  grains are not absent from Hondurans' tables next year.    [Reporter] Mr. President, your remarks about production are  for the intermediate and long term. What about a short-term  solution for the basic product price raises?    [Reina] We could even freeze prices. I have selected an  economic cabinet made up of the most capable Hondurans. We have  no commitments to anyone. There are several important projects  such as the Trujillo Bay and the cold storages, but we have no  obligations. We are approaching these projects with free hands.  A decision will be made about what is best for the nation.  Prices remain as they are because we are in a very difficult  situation.    [Reina] The economic situation I inherited, as well as the  nation's overall situation, has been truly dramatic. We will  not be looking to the past. We want to look toward the future.  When there is talk that we have not yet taken off, I want to say  that the government has implemented a number of measures,  including the historic measure on volunteer military service.  Nevertheless, what we have not been able to do away with is the  corruption that prevails in this country. We are committed to  doing this. We will eliminate and overcome corruption.    [Reporter] Peasant organizations that want to become  productive are concerned about the fact that there has been an  announcement saying credits are now available, but so far, these  credits have not been issued to enable the peasants to work  their fields. We also have reported that 10-15 days a [words  indistinct] to the president of the Republic and the government  for those credits to be released under very favorable conditions.    [Reina] We are committed to this, and we believe we will  fulfill this promise. I met with the peasant associations.  They requested that land titles be granted in a more  expeditious manner. We have issued pertinent orders for land  titles to be delivered as quickly as possible. A large number  of peasants will be issued documents that will given them full  protection of their property. This is one of my campaign  promises -- namely, legal security for all Hondurans. [passage  omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. President, on the issue of corruption, we  have  heard of corruption charges against high-ranking members of your  government -- for example, in the transportation administration,  the transportation ministry -- that is, SECOPT [Secretariat of  Communications, Public Works, and Transportation] -- as well as  in INJUPEM [Teachers Retirement and Pension Institute] and PANI  [National Children's Board]. It appears that these accusations  have enough credence to at least look for people who are  responsible. Do you believe such people should be brought to  trial?    [Reina] If they are not put on trial, we will have achieved  nothing. The judicial branch was created to prosecute all  criminal activities and to punish the guilty. On 10 May, I will  hold a general meeting to analyze the way in which we have been  advancing and uncovering illicit actions. The Commission to  Prevent and Fight Corruption [Commission de Prevencion y Combate  a la Corrupcion] will announce the specific cases -- of which  there are many. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Humberto Garcia asks if one of the attractions  of voluntary educational service is that a person will receive  the minimum wage when he enters military service?    [Reina] This has been one of the arguments used by men in  uniform that has some validity; however, I have spoken to  businessmen, economists, and labor experts, and this need not be  the exact case. A minimum-wage increase would not solve the  problem. The country will go bankrupt if we give a soldier who  now earns 50 lempiras the minimum wage.    We are going to try to improve conditions so that the  people's cultural level can start to improve through education.  The country will benefit from this improvement and the  professionalism that it will bring to the Armed Forces. There  is something very interesting. The Air Force and Navy do not  have compulsory recruitment. The young people even wait in line  to enter those services. Thus, we have taken measures to make  the other services attractive too.    [Reporter] You mentioned wages and improving the situation,  Mr. President. Does this mean the Armed Forces budget will be  increased?    [Reina] It could come to that. However, what has been  ordered for the time being is a reduction in the size of the  government. The Armed Forces accepted this with great dignity,  and it promptly cut 10 percent from its budget.    [Reporter] What changes will this important event, which  requires a constitutional reform and also concerns the Armed  Forces, demand in the relations between the Armed Forces and  civilian society?    [Reina] It demands the total unification of Hondurans. It  requires that everyone, civilians, religious people, laymen,  atheists, and military personnel unite. It requires that  everyone who lives in this country feel that, at the end of this  century, the country has established a climate of security,  peace, development, and harmony. We have to unify the Honduran  nation. The Cold War -- we talked about the Cold War during our  campaign -- divided and harmed us a great deal. I hope we will  never return to such a situation.    [Reporter] On the issue of corruption, Mr. President. Based  on the charges made by the current government and the U.S.  Senate pronouncements on corruption in Honduras, what is your  opinion of the government organizations that are in charge of  controlling this problem?    [Reina] They have to be assessed. We will now have a  prosecutor general who is going to be the nerve center of the  entire, let us call it, government probity system. This,  together with the general state modernization concept, is part  of the new term. The modernization of the state will allow us  to make a thorough assessment of the kind of government we have  had. I said to you during my campaign: We want a state as  close to normal as possible. The three elements of the state  are territory, population, and government. Our territory has  not been defined. We still have to define its coastal area.  The population did not identify with the country, and the  governments were not elected. Thus, we were a state that was far  from being perfect. Today, we are starting to improve the  government. We are going to evaluate all the electoral issues.  We are going to review the way people are registered. We have  advanced in this respect because now we all feel we need to  improve the government's mechanisms.    [Reporter] The Honduran people are plagued by high  electricity rates and an energy crisis. When will Hondurans  stop seeing their bills grow by the month? When will they see  an end to electricity cuts?    [Reina] The crisis involves more than just the rates because  if we continue to have blackouts, the country could go  completely bankrupt. That is the problem we are trying to solve  first. Yesterday I received a very attentive, fraternal, and  timely call from the Mexican president. He will give  us....[pauses] He said this because on Sunday, engineers will  leave Honduras to check the units he will give us. Each one has  a 30-megawatt capacity. Those 60 megawatts will ease the  situation considerably. This, along with an electricity  interconnection with Panama and a possible interconnection with  Costa Rica and Nicaragua, will help us overcome the crisis.    The truth is that there are many shortcomings. First, all  those who have robbed the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric  Power] [words indistinct] robbing water or energy. Second,  rates have not been at the level the enterprise should have set.  To give you an example, it is not right that someone who owns a  hut in a shantytown pays the same rate as someone who lives in a  luxury residential area.    Part of the solution could lie in that difference in the  possibility to contribute energy for everyone. [sentence as  heard] I think we will work toward ensuring that the ENEE  overcomes its crisis once and for all. Surprisingly, 190  million lempiras is owed to the ENEE.    [Reporter] We have a list of many companies, including  multinationals, that owe the ENEE. We do not understand why  this was allowed to happen. We learned, through complaints made  through the media, that people protest when electricity is cut  when they owe 70 or 90 lempiras.    [Reina] That is one of the irregularities. Callejas told me  once: The situation at ENEE needs to be reviewed because it is  the most poorly managed company in this country. I think there  have been all sorts of problems there. There are people who act  dishonestly by stealing energy but they are actually stealing  from the people. We must stop this. This type of corruption  must be eliminated not partially but at the very root.    [Reporter] Mr. President, what responsibility do the  engineers, boards of directors, and ENEE management during the  previous administration bear for this new rationing?    [Reina] That is where the commissions that were appointed to  uncover corruption, tax evasion, embezzlement, and inefficiency  come in.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Reina] They could be held responsible if the negligence was  very serious and punishable.    [Reporter] What will your government do to collect the huge  debt that companies and private citizens owe the ENEE?    [Reina] As I told you during my campaign: Enforce the law.  The law is not enforced here.    [Reporter] When will you begin to enforce the [words  indistinct]?    [Reina] I think that it is already being enforced and there  are already (?fugitives). Efforts are already under way to  obtain pardons for these poor people. They say that the people  should only be made to pay their debts. The issue here is not  whether the person should pay, because anyone who commits a  crime must pay for it. That is what people will find the most  exciting and what will convince them of the new style of  government that I have spoken about.    [Reporter] Will you tell us about that in your next message?    [Reina] My next message will be full of information.    [Reporter] Mr. President, more specifically, will  electricity  rates be raised?    [Reina] The decision belongs to the commission. We declared  the emergency. We found the most capable people to handle the  problem. It is up to them.    [Reporter] International credit organizations have suggested  that your government raise tolls and eliminate transportation  subsidies.    [Reina] [Words indistinct] I have always believed that tolls  on alternate routes are a burdensome tax. Every driver has two  alternatives: use a paved street or a gravel one. Either way,  your vehicle is subject to a toll. That is how it is  everywhere. Curiously, Hondurans will gladly pay tolls  everywhere else and consider it normal, but they resist paying  the tax at home. There are some exceptions, such as the  distinguished city of San Pedro Sula, where everyone pays tolls  willingly. I think that is why we should implement the measure  gradually in the rest of the country.    The problem is how to balance our budget and correct the  deficit, how to overcome our concerns. Everyone trembles when  representatives of international banks come to the country to  collect, and we have a knife at our throats. One possible  solution would be to privatize Hondutel [Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise]. Such transactions, if they are  not handled carefully, could turn out to be just another tragedy  for the country. I will discuss all of these subjects later,  such as the plans for an oil refinery in Puerto Castilla and a  cold-storage enterprise. All of these plans, considered by an  impartial arbiter such as the government, can give the country  incentive and improve its image. We have received assistance  from Mexico and Costa Rica because they have seen our country's  democratic process and the strengthening of our institutions.    [Reporter] Who authorized the refinery planned for Puerto  Castilla?    [Reina] It has not been authorized.    [Reporter] No, it hasn't. Who made the deal?    [Reina] The previous government.    [Reporter] What is being done?    [Reina] A commission has been appointed to check everything  and to consult ecologists and businessmen so the best possible  decision will be made for the Honduran people. Just like that.  Great things are simple. Hidden things are a cancer, as I have  mentioned several times.    [Reporter] Who will decide which firm will conduct the  environmental study and determine the pro's and con's of  installing a refinery in Puerto Castilla?    [Reina] We have to find the most capable firm.    [Reporter] Who will make the decision?    [Reina] The government. We have a very radical environment  minister, and we have those with interests in the refinery who  keep extolling its virtues. Both positions must be considered  and a decision made.    [Reporter] Personally speaking, do you have reservations  about the refinery?    [Reina] I think the ecologists might be right. If so, we  would have to look for another location for the refinery. I am  not sure about this because I am no expert. Many good things  are mentioned in connection with this refinery, but no one would  dare propose to make a deal with me for these things. I do not  think anyone would dare make such a proposal during my term.    [Reporter] What you say is very important.    [Reina] Very important.    [Reporter] Are you planning to privatize Hondutel?    [Reina] We will open the debate. We will privatize it if  necessary; otherwise, things will remain as they are. [passage  omitted]    [Reporter] What about your invitation from the U.S.  President to attend the summit meeting in Miami in December?    [Reina] It is a dignified invitation from the President of  the United States.    There are two big events coming up: one in Cartagena among  the Latin American [as heard] heads of state, and the other in  early December in Miami. We have been invited to the latter by  President Clinton.    I think these two events must become complementary. [Words  indistinct] with President Gaviria and with President Figueres  to begin establishing agendas for the two summits. Otherwise  they could be repetitious. The two agendas could be topical.  One could focus on the inter-American system, human rights, and  drug trafficking, while the other could emphasize social  development, national identity, and all forms of corruption that  impede the development of democracy. That way we would make  these two big summits complementary. They are important because  they will be held at a time when the world is very much in favor  of everything that contributes to unity.    [Reporter] I wonder how this attitude can help Honduras? How  could [words indistinct] benefit Honduras?    [Reina] In the first place, the country that isolates itself  is a country that fails and gets trapped in its own problems.  Honduras has been one of the most isolated countries in the  region. Hondurans have not been good negotiators. We have to  change this attitude. I am surprised that within such a short  period -- I only have three months in government, for example --  relations with Costa Rica are excellent. Costa Rica is not very  inclined to integrate with Central America and has instead tried  to join South America and even Europe. Now, with President  Figueres we have very similar positions. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Why haven't subsidies been taken away from the  transportation sector and given to farmers to produce more food?    [Reina] If subsidies are taken away from bus owners, they  will increase fares, and we will see buses being set on fire in  the streets. It is not so easy to govern. Regarding food, the  natural resources minister has drafted a plan that I hope will  work. There will be enough basic grains for this year.    [Reporter] What do you think about the warnings that some  assembly companies are thinking about leaving the country  because of problems with electricity rationing and the creation  of labor unions?    [Reina] Those companies could resolve the energy problem by  [words indistinct]. I am sure their business can afford this  and still profit.    Regarding the labor union problem, these laws cannot be  modified by any particular person. Laws cannot be superseded by  contracts or agreements. Laws represent the interest of the  state and are not negotiable on orders from anyone.    If assembly companies want to take advantage of our low-wage  labor force and our geopolitical location close to the great  U.S. market -- because they know that it is profitable -- they  must also help us improve the kind of assembly being done here  by transferring technology through industrial contracts. I  think this will come. It is just a matter of being patient.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What about commercial and diplomatic relations  with Cuba?    [Reina] I think this is one of the delicate issues that must  be discussed at the summit meetings: the Cartagena one, in which  Spain and Portugal will participate since it is the  Ibero-American Summit; and the Miami meeting, which President  Clinton has convoked.    I think the system must find a democratic way out. An  abnormal situation must not continue indefinitely. I do believe  that whoever replaces President Fidel Castro must live in Cuba  and be a charismatic leader inside Cuba. We must seek a  democratic and peaceful transition.    [Reporter] You would not establish formal relations with  Cuba  under Fidel Castro?    [Reina] I will abide by whatever the inter-American system  decides on this. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(6) of &sect;1910.146 requires at least one attendant outside a permit space while entry operations are underway. This attendant monitors entrants and conditions inside and outside the space, prevents the entry of unauthorized persons, and summons rescue services in an emergency. The notice reopening the record requested comments on whether attendants should be required for ``permit-required'' confined spaces covered by Subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nearly every commenter stated that attendants were unnecessary for the safety of employees performing work in dangerous atmospheres or in confined or enclosed spaces in shipyards (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;36, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;38, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;40, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;42, 11&hyph;43, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;46, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). They argued that the procedures required by Subpart B would make spaces safe for workers and that, as a result, there would be no need for an attendant. Many of these commenters also contended that the cost of providing attendants for every entry, if such would be necessary, would be prohibitive (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;43, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supported a requirement for an attendant to monitor any confined space that was designated as a permit space (Ex. 11&hyph;28). Other commenters, who opposed a general requirement for attendants, acknowledged that there is a need for an attendant to monitor spaces posing unusual hazards, such as entry into IDLH atmospheres, entry by an employee working alone, and non-routine entry (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;51). The statement of the NFPA (Ex. 11&hyph;19) typified these comments, as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NFPA believes that the permit described in proposed 1910.146(b)(9) contains information that is not needed by entrants into confined spaces and could be confusing. NFPA believes that such a permit would not be feasible for confined spaces in the vessel construction and repair industry, for either vessel or shore-side activities. The proposed 1910.146 permit systems, described in 1910.146(d) establishes specifications for a permit system designed to satisfy several problems with one form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accident statistics indicate that workers do not recognize the dangers of confined spaces. Statistics also point out that workers involved in accidents have commonly been authorized to enter the space (source (NIOSH FACE study). Additionally, a high percentage of fatalities in confined space incidents are personnel attempting to effect worker rescue. OSHA, with this permit system, has attempted to alert the worker (entrant), establish a control point (person authorizing entry), and ensure safe rescue attempts are performed by specifying relevant information on one form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the industry, shipyards have adapted entry permit systems to make the system simple. Frequently, shipyards have incorporated a color-coded tag and sign system. The foundation for the various shipyard systems is linked to the Marine Chemist Certificate and Shipyard Competent Person Inspection Form (OSHA 74 Log of Inspections and Tests). This allows individual shipyards to tailor their system to the type of confined spaces and work performed at their yard. In the larger shipyards, the permit and sign system has been incorporated throughout the yard, including both vessel and shore-side work sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFPA believes that a specification requiring a permit system as described in 1910.146 would be excessive for many shipyards since the nature of the spaces and hazards is so variable. NFPA also believes that such a requirement would not provide any increase in the level of safety. The key to the effectiveness of any permit system will be its simplicity and the training of workers on its implementation. The 1910.146 proposed system introduces increased confusion for many of the shipyard applications and will not necessarily result in increased safety. OSHA needs to recognize that the shipyard industry currently uses a dual permit system for documenting initial and follow-up conditions for its vessel confined space activities. The advantage of this system has been the lack of specification, thus enabling individual shipyards to adapt their systems with the performance requirements of current proposed Subpart B. This approach would work in land-side confined spaces within the shipyard, as well. Use of one system throughout the shipyard facilitates the training of all workers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final revised Subpart B does not require the presence of an attendant for confined and enclosed spaces or for work in dangerous atmospheres. OSHA notes that the purpose of Subpart B is to ensure that a space is completely safe to enter and work in. In this regard, &sect;1910.146(c)(5) of the general industry generic confined space standard sets detailed requirements for atmospheric testing and ventilation for some spaces, and also, recognizes that there are some permit spaces which can be made safe for entry without the need for written permits or attendants. Final revised Subpart B provides equivalent requirements for confined and enclosed spaces and for work in dangerous atmospheres in shipyards. If the testing requirements contained in Subpart B do not indicate a safe atmosphere, then entry is restricted to emergencies and periods of short duration to accomplish ventilation and additional precautions are required (such as posting the space as Not Safe for Workers, continuous monitoring, and the absence of ignition sources), by &sect;1915.152 (such as air line respirators, attendants and life lines) and by &sect;1915.94 (frequent checks of employees working in a confined or enclosed space or alone in an isolated location). Once the hazard is removed and the space is safe for entry, the employer is required to test frequently to monitor and maintain the space as safe for workers. As a result, OSHA does not believe it is necessary to require attendants in Subpart B as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

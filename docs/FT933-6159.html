			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Macedonia reluctant to plug gaps: As peace talks falter attention again focuses on sanctions against Serbia THE trucks cluster each evening in lay-bys close to Macedonia's border with Serbia, waiting for UN sanctions monitors to go off duty. But even if the monitors stay up late, the drivers, keeping in touch through walkie-talkies, can choose from dozens of unwatched tracks to cross the frontier. As measures to enforce sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro have tightened along the Danube and Serbia's border with Bulgaria, Macedonia has become the main supply route for the rump Yugoslavia. According to the UN protection force, which also monitors the border, about 4,000 trucks make the crossing in both directions every week. Vehicles carrying oil products, construction materials and spare parts for heavy machinery have been spotted, but not stopped. The 38-member sanctions assistance mission, made up of customs officers from several countries, encourage the Macedonian customs service to inspect loads crossing the border. But it has no authority to enforce the sanctions. 'Once in a while the customs will follow our suggestions, but whole days go by when no trucks get inspected,' said Mr Gordon Evers, a Canadian customs official leading the SAM team. The rail link between Athens and Belgrade is still in operation. Two or three freight trains leave Skopje every night and tanker trains carrying oil head north several times a week. Macedonia, which was admitted to the UN earlier this year, has formally backed the embargo against Serbia, its main trading partner. The government claims that the sanctions cost the Macedonian economy more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 810m) last year. However, government officials argue that the economy is so battered by the loss of trade with Serbia, together with the effects of more than a year of diplomatic isolation, that it cannot be expected to apply sanctions fully unless compensation is guaranteed. 'We ask the UN about compensation and they refer us to the European Community. There's no money in sight, but we have to cope with another 15 per cent fall in industrial output this year and an unemployment rate of more than 30 per cent,' says a government economic adviser. Macedonian officials admit, too, that their enthusiasm for complying with sanctions has been diluted by delays in the arrival of Ecu100m (Pounds 76.4m) in EC aid, promised last December. Half of that amount is being contributed by member states on a bilateral basis, with the rest provided by the European Commission. The government also claims it is being blackmailed into shipping oil to Serbia by Greece, which is Macedonia's main source for oil supplies. According to a senior Macedonian official, Greece last month threatened to cut off all oil shipments to Macedonia unless half the supply from the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, amounting to more than 80,000 tonnes monthly, was sent on to Serbia.</p>

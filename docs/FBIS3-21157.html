			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A solar power generation system (see photo  [omitted]) that the New Energy and Industrial Technology  Development Organization (NEDO) was building with the Ministry  of Energy, Posts and Telecommunications of Malaysia in Sabah  State in the northern part of Kalimantan Island has been  completed and experiments will begin this month. The efficiency  of conversion from light energy to electric energy by solar  cells drops when temperature rises, so experiments will be  carried out to search for an effective way to cool solar cells  in Malaysia, where high temperatures prevail.    The system is composed of monocrystalline solar cells with  10  kilowatt (kw) output, 136 kw hour (kwh) storage batteries, and  data collection equipment. Experiments will be conducted with  several types of natural cooling and forced cooling methods.    In experiments with natural cooling, modules of multiple  solar cells mounted on a single board will be placed on water or  separated from the ground surface; and various angles of  inclination will be tried. In experiments with forced cooling,  the surface of the modules will be sprayed with water or air  will be blown from the back of the modules.    A 100 kw output system will be built in FY95 in order to  switch to large-scale research. NEDO's share of the cost is  about &yen;600 million.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sulzer sees recovery in profits as orders grow SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, reported a 2 per cent improvement in orders to SFr3.3bn (Dollars 2.5bn) for the first half and forecast a recovery of profits for the full year to the level achieved in 1990. Order intake at Sulzer Ruti, the textile machinery subsidiary whose severe losses dragged down group profits last year, has grown 25 per cent mainly due to demand from the Middle East and China. Sulzer Infra, the plant and building services subsidiary, reported a 9 per cent rise in orders, two thirds of which were due to acquisitions. Demand for Sulzermedica orthopaedic and cardiovascular implants grew by 16 per cent. The Escher Wyss business had a 6 per cent rise in orders as bookings for hydroelectric plant, pumps and thermal turbo-machinery more than offset declining demand for papermaking machinery. The 28 per cent decline in orders at the Wintherthur group came after record orders last year for locomotives. Sulzer said it expected the overall positive order trend to continue in the second half. It was confident the reduction of losses at Ruti and the progress at other divisions would enable the group to regain the profit level achieved in 1990. Last year's net consolidated income fell 23 per cent to SFr119m from SFr155m in 1990.</p>

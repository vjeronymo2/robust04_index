			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A police officer shot and wounded an armed theft suspect after officers  confronted a group of prowling inside a tow yard, police reported Sunday.  </P> <P> The victim, Coy Donald Thomas, a 25-year-old construction worker, was listed in  fair condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center, where a nursing  supervisor said he was being treated for gunshot wounds to the abdomen and  thigh.  </P> <P> Police said Thomas, whose address was unknown, was one of three men found in  and around the grounds of the South Bay Towing yard in the 600 block of K  Street.  </P> <P> Lt. Dean Girdner gave this account of the shooting, which occurred shortly  after 11:30 p.m. Saturday:  </P> <P> Officers were dispatched to the tow yard by witnesses who reported that two men  were "going through vehicles." David Eugene Higgins, 20, address unknown, was  arrested without incident inside the yard.  </P> <P> Thomas, however, jumped a fence and ran, with Officer Martin Brady giving chase  on foot. Repeated shouts to stop went unanswered for several blocks, and the  two eventually came to the side of a residence in the 700 block of Jefferson  Avenue.  </P> <P> The officer confronted him from 15 to 20 feet and ordered him to freeze and  stop. Thomas turned and faced the officer in a dark, narrow area on the north  side of the garage and put his hands in the front waistband of his pants.  Thomas then raised his right hand and appeared to throw a knife at Brady.  </P> <P> Brady fired several rounds at Thomas, who fell to the ground. When officers  attempted to check his condition, Thomas struggled to his feet, climbed over  another fence and ran another block. He was arrested there, where a knife was  found in his hand.  </P> <P> Police said Thomas was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon,  possession of an illegal knife and theft. Higgins was booked on suspicion of  theft.  </P> <P> Carl R. Smith, 19, was detained by police after he was found sleeping in a  vehicle near the scene, but was not charged.  </P> <P> Brady, 27, has been a Chula Vista police officer for four years.  </P></p>

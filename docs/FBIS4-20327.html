			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tian Yuan (3944 3293): "Bright Outlook for </F> China's Futures Business"]    [Text] In the last decade of the 20th Century, one  important achievement of the policy of opening and reform in  China is that it has bred a brand new specialty--the futures  business. This brand new specialty's emergence has promoted the  development of China's market economy and is supplying a new  channel for promoting the Chinese economy's merging and  connecting with the world. For this reason, Dr. Tian Yuan,  Chairman of the Board of the China International Futures Brokers  Corporation Ltd., was fully confident of making the following  suggestions:  <H5>  As an investment instrument, futures must develop into a </H5> higher form    Since its establishment, the futures market has played  several roles. On the one hand, it supplies the means for  assuring value, while on the other hand, it is an available  investment instrument. In Western financial markets, futures are  as widely acknowledged and accepted as stocks. In comparison,  futures operations are characterized by "gambling for big stakes  with a small investment" making it a high risk investment  instrument. As a high risk financial product, its possibly high  return attracts a large group of investors, so in the futures  market, besides the value assurors, there are quite a few  investors who seek profits by engaging in "buy low, sell high"  trading.    Someone analyzed the behavior of market participants by  using  statistics from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission,  and concluded that there are three types of investors in  markets, i.e., big value assurors, big speculators, and small  speculators. If one is speaking just of the futures market's  performance, there are several different situations besides the  spot market. One specialist's comprehensive statistics proved  that big value assurors suffer losses (they might make a profit  in the spot market), big speculators gain profits, and small  speculators usually lose money. Another specialist had a  different conclusion, that is, that big value assurors make  profits, big speculators neither make profits nor lose money,  and small speculators lose money. From this we can see that no  matter what the situation, small speculators are ultimately  always in an unfavorable position. Precisely for this reason,  the operating style of futures trading is undergoing an  important change: to collect social investment capital by means  of funds and managing accounts, etc., with the futures run by  professional futures specialists; this is called "managing  futures." Twenty years ago, the first U.S. share of managed  futures sold for less than $10,000. This has so far developed to  $26 billion, becoming an important force in the futures markets  which cannot be ignored. Looking at the situation in China,  documents from all over show that while it is not the best  investment means for entering the futures market by individual  or single accounts, there should be encouragement for developing  various types of futures funds and managed accounts, and gradual  development of professional futures trading consultants. This  would push futures investment trading from its current low level  mode of operation to a more advanced one, and further promote  the maturity of the futures industry.  <H5>  Work to become the world futures trading center </H5>   The futures industry is a major industry in the world  economy, and the futures market has major and long term impact  on the international trading, international financial activity,  and international information. Several years ago, China didn't  play a role in the world futures markets community, which was  inappropriate to the status of so large a country. China has  one-fourth of the world's population, ranks number one in the  world in grain output, number one in cotton output, number four  in steel output, has all varieties of nonferrous metals and  ranks number five in world output, has more than $100 billion in  imports and exports, and over $40 billion in foreign currency  reserves. Such a huge quantity of commodities, trade, and  foreign currency demonstrates that the domestic futures markets  have a great capacity in China, and internationalizing China's  futures markets is an absolute possibility. In the last decade  and more, since China has firmly implemented its policy of  opening and reform, the scale of international trade has spread  rapidly, and is an important media and bridge for bringing about  the internationalization of China's futures markets. For China's  corporations, a high volume of international trade activities  can not only assure value in China's futures markets but also  assure value in futures markets overseas. By getting foreign  capital involved, it can export price "risks," just as the  Chinese Insurance Corporation exports the risks of satellite  launching, sharing the insurance with those overseas. If we look  at the characteristics of changing the mix in an era of world  economic competition, seizing the opportunity to rise in  importance in the Asian-Pacific region, China's economic forces  and huge domestic market potential provide abundant reasons to  aim for the goal of developing futures markets. This goal should  be: after vigorous development in the nineties, become the  biggest commodity futures markets center in the Asian-Pacific  region. With financial futures developed to a certain degree, it  should form a tripartite balance of forces with Europe and  America; the second step is aiming to become the world commodity  futures trading center in the early 21st Century, and become the  financial futures market center for the Asian-Pacific region.    If the above goals for China's futures markets are  accomplished, it will have an important and deep influence on  Chinese economic development. Looking at the domestic market,  the entire spot markets and its pricing system will be remolded  due to wild and active futures trading, forming a unified market  price system. Futures markets will become an internal stabilizer  for China's economy, especially for its agricultural economy. It  will play a major role in protecting agricultural development,  the growth in farmers' income, grain circulation and processing,  etc. The great deal of information and long term pricing signals  supplied by the futures markets will effectively improve the  government's ability to readjust macroeconomically, and  significantly increase initiative in economic work. Looking at  the situation worldwide, the experience of Chicago's futures  market indicates that after China is established in a central  position in world futures trading, a great deal of important  information about the world economy and politics will be  continuously, directly transmitted to China's economic system.  China's futures trading will play an important role in the world  economy as a kind of "magnetic pole"; this will help improve our  international economic cooperation, international financial  market, and our status and influence in international commodity  trade, and will promote multiple facets of China's economic  development.    Looking at the development practices and historical  experience of the international futures industry, futures  trading centers are not immutable. Historically, the futures  industry originated in Europe, and blossomed in America. After  World War II, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan in the  Asian-Pacific region became new regional futures trading  centers. The roots of this "phenomenon of changing centers" lies  in the changing of economic powers. New arrivals in regional  futures trading centers can not only develop their status as  futures trading centers depending on the growth of their  economic power, they can also take advantage of the "superiority  of the up-and-coming." In Asia, the correct application of  official power to prop up futures trading is also very  important. For example, it took the United States about 70 years  to develop and perfect its futures markets, but it took only two  to three years to establish futures markets in both Hong Kong  and Singapore. This was because the futures market model had  developed to maturity, so much could be implanted, making it  absolutely unnecessary to start out from scratch. We must  understand and absorb these countries' and regions' experiences,  encouraging bold innovation and exploration to meet the  opportunities and challenges of China's futures industry.</p>

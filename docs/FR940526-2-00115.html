For groups of items held constant, the model assumed a price ratio between the allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area equal to 100.00%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer defined personal insurance and pensions as the portion of a family's budget that was targeted for long-term financial security. This is consistent with the definitions used by the CES, the results of which are used as weights in the COLA model. In the CES, money stored in a savings account or investment vehicle for future expenditures (of goods and services, housing, or transportation) is accounted for in the other component weightings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 6.1, we noted that expenses related to personal insurance were held constant for all locations. This was based on information received from life insurance companies and OPM officials. The life insurance companies contacted indicated that policies written (and premiums charged) to persons within the United States and its territories did not vary due to location. Runzheimer's research and discussions with OPM officials also indicated that, in general, federal employees in all areas received similar or identical benefits packages_variations are generally due to personal preference. Therefore, Runzheimer believed, and OPM concurred, that holding these types of expenses constant was appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

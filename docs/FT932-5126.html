			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Hunter who goes for the jugular: Martin Dickson and Patrick Harverson examine the successes and setbacks of the financial empire of George Soros Mr George Soros has become that rarest of investment gurus - an individual with such mystique that his actions can trigger large jumps in financial markets around the world. Where Mr Soros goes, a motley army of fans stampedes behind. This remarkable power was demonstrated in Britain this week when the New York-based fund manager announced plans to invest Pounds 284m in the stricken British property market through a Pounds 500m partnership with British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat. UK property stocks immediately rose 6 per cent and observers rushed to pronounce the deal as definitive evidence that the market had turned for the better. Six weeks ago Mr Soros had a similar impact on the world gold market. News that funds under Soros management had bought a 10 per cent stake in the US company Newmont Mining helped spark a strong rally in the price of gold. Mr Soros has been regarded for the past 20 years as one of the canniest investors on Wall Street, but his current superstar status is something new. It dates from last November, when he let it be known that his funds had made about Dollars 1bn on 'Black Wednesday' last September by taking a huge, correct, bet that the British government would be forced to devalue sterling. Mr Soros was hardly alone. Many foreign exchange traders had made the same calculation, but the sheer size of the Soros speculation - on his reckoning, his Quantum Group of 'hedge' funds had some Dollars 10bn committed to the bet - gave him a reputation as the 'man who broke the Bank of England' and an aura of unerring investment expertise. Like most 'Midas-touch' reputations, his has become somewhat overstated. As he is the first to acknowledge, he has made his share of mistakes down the years. And since 1988 many important elements of his investment strategy have been devolved onto his publicity-shy American lieutenant, the 39-year-old Mr Stanley Druckenmiller, who oversees day-to-day investment activities. Nevertheless, the duo are greatly admired on Wall Street. Mr Julian Robertson, who runs Tiger Management, one of the biggest hedge funds, says of Mr Soros: 'He's a brilliant man and has a fabulous lieutenant in Stanley Druckenmiller.' So just how good is Mr Soros's track record? How do his funds operate? And what can other investors learn from his methods? From a 33rd-floor office with a magnificent view of Manhattan's Central Park, the 62-year-old Hungarian-American runs Soros Fund Management, which sets the investment strategy for the unquoted Quantum Group, which has assets of about Dollars 8bn. Hedge funds, which invest in a wide range of liquid assets, such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, have been a feature of US financial markets since the 1960s. But neither they, nor their investment technique, are suitable for the small investor. Managing them requires access to large amounts of capital, very strong nerves, fast reflexes and a willingness to take huge risks. Unlike most traditional mutual and pension funds, which are restricted to certain investment strategies by industry regulators or internal policy, hedge funds are free to use complex, speculative trading methods to maximise investors' returns, including using leveraged funds (money borrowed against the value of assets), and hedging techniques. The most common form of hedging is short-selling, which is when a trader or investor sells a security he does not own in the hope that later, when it has to be delivered to the buyer, the security can be acquired at a lower price. It was this technique which Mr Soros used before Black Wednesday, when he 'shorted' sterling. Hedge funds are only for the very rich, or for financial institutions. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the US financial markets, requires that individual investors in such funds have a net worth totalling at least Dollars 1m, or annual income of at least Dollars 200,000 for two consecutive years. Most fund managers require their investors to be even wealthier. And in the case of the Quantum Group, investors cannot be American citizens or residents. This is because the funds, domiciled in the Netherlands Antilles or the British Virgin Islands, are not registered with the SEC, since this allows them more operating flexibility and freedom from US disclosure rules. Most of Quantum's investors are thought to be European, and Mr Soros himself is rumoured to own between 25 and 30 per cent of the funds. Born in Hungary in 1930, Mr Soros suffered early hardship when he and his Jewish family spent much of the second world war in hiding from occupying Nazi forces. After the war, aged 17, he moved to Britain, attended the London School of Economics and worked for the securities firm of Singer &amp; Friedlander before moving to the US in 1956. In 1969, after working for several Wall Street houses as a trader and analyst, his investment career took off when he was assigned the management of an offshore vehicle which grew into Quantum Fund, the largest fund in the group. Mr Soros and his then partner, Mr Jim Rogers, gained a reputation in the early 1970s for shorting some favourite fund managers' stocks, such as Disney and Polaroid. In 1985 he made what he called 'the killing of a lifetime' by speculating in the yen at the time when the Plaza Accord was sending the value of the Japanese currency soaring. But there have also been many big losses. On his own account, he lost money trading currencies in the four years before the Plaza Accord. Most famously, Quantum Fund is estimated to have lost up to Dollars 800m in the 1987 Wall Street crash, though it still managed to boost investment returns by 14 per cent during that year. Mr Soros, who had been warning that the Japanese market was wildly overpriced, had been expecting a crash, but not one beginning in the US. Still, by any reckoning the Quantum Fund has one of the best and most consistent records of any large fund over such a long period. It claims a compound annual rate of growth since 1969 of 35 per cent, after fees and expenses, and has had only one year, 1981, in which the value of investments fell. Micropal, a London company that tracks international investment funds, says that Quantum Fund is the top performer over both the past three and five years among the 57 large derivative, leveraged and geared funds that it follows, with returns of 296 and 503 per cent respectively. Over the past year, Quantum ranked third, earning a return of 67 per cent. Beginning with only Dollars 4m under management, Quantum Fund now has about Dollars 4.1bn - and that after distributions to investors of Dollars 3.4bn to keep its size manageable. For the same reason, Mr Soros has spun off four other funds from Quantum since 1991 - Quasar International, Quota, Quantum Emerging Growth and Quantum Realty Trust. Mr Soros himself has increasingly drawn back from day-to-day involvement in the funds, which are run by a team of about a dozen managers, led by Mr Druckenmiller. Mr Soros, while still coach and strategist to the team, spends a substantial part of his time involved in philanthropic work in eastern Europe. Starting in 1979, he has set up several foundations to encourage freedom of expression in the former Soviet bloc and is estimated to have given away some Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m to this and related causes. In a rare interview with Mr Jack Schwager, author of the book New Market Wizards, Mr Druckenmiller admitted that his first six months with Mr Soros were fairly rocky, as the two men had different strategies. But then came the collapse of the Soviet Empire and 'with George in eastern Europe, he couldn't meddle even if he wanted to'. Mr Druckenmiller has a strong investment reputation. Appointed head of equity research at Pittsburgh National Bank at the young age of 25, he set up his own money management firm, Duquesne Capital Management, three years later. He still handles this very successful fund, alongside his Quantum responsibilities. Whatever the early friction, the two men clearly have a very similar approach to investing. Mr Soros, a man given to philosophical musings - he described himself as a 'financial and philosophical speculator' when receiving an honorary Oxford degree - tried to sum his ideas up in a complex book called the Alchemy of Finance. His theory of 'reflexivity' holds that markets are moved partly by irrational pyschology, rather than any scientific rules, with perceptions changing events, and events in turn changing perceptions. In simpler language, markets tend to go to extremes, opening up great opportunities for profit. But for all the philosophy, other Wall Street investors say Mr Soros's greatest traits - as with every successful trader - include the willingness to reverse his position in an instant, when he recognises he has made a mistake. In his book interview, Mr Druckenmiller says that probably the most important thing he has learnt from Mr Soros is that 'it's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong. The few times that Soros has ever criticised me was when I was really right on a market and didn't maximise the opportunity . . . Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the jugular.' For all its success, Quantum Fund is not trouble-free. The group was was one of three big New York funds accused of involvement in 1991's Salomon Brothers bond auction scandal. While all were given a clean bill of health by goverment investigations, the three are being sued in the New York courts by investors for allegedly conspiring with a Salomon trader to corner the market in certain government securities. Quantum denies the charges. More fundamentally, as the group gets bigger, it becomes harder for the funds to keep up their historic growth rates, and the number of investment areas in which they can make a killing diminishes. The currency markets, which dwarf all others, are probably Quantum's best hunting grounds. 'We're like a super-tanker in a way,' Mr Soros acknowledged in a recent interview. 'Very efficient, but we can only put into two or three ports.' So far, it has been a very lucrative voyage.</p>

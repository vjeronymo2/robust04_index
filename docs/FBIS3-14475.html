It also urged the U.S. Administration to change the Israeli  position in the peace negotiations. Syrian sources said that  Ross' renewal of the Washington administration's commitment to  achieving progress in the peace process is "positive,  encouraging, reinforces the credibility of the U.S. role, and  reflects Washington's wish to shoulder its moral and political  responsibilities and to fulfill the promises and pledges it has  made in the past to establish a just and comprehensive peace in  the Middle East."    The Syrian sources, which reflect an official view, added  that "logic says that compelling Israel to adhere to the  foundations of the peace process is the only way to guarantee  the achievement of the desired progress and to help to secure  factors ensuring success for the peace process and to avert  failure."    The sources pointed out that Syria will respond to  Washington's new obligations to establish a "lasting" peace. If  this peace does not come, the situation will be like a temporary  truce that could collapse at any moment and with the first shock.    The sources stressed that Syria's eagerness to respond to  the  U.S. Administration's commitment to making the peace process in  the region a success "stems from eagerness to recover the Arab  land and rights in full.... Just as Syria is committed to these  principles, it is also committed to the peace process as a  historic opportunity that is supposed to eventually lead to the  establishment of a real and strong peace based on the principles  of right and justice." The sources pointed out that anyone who  wants to advance the peace process "is urged to persuade the  rulers of Tel Aviv...to recognize the principle of complete  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories."

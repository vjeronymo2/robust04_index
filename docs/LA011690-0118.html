			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATH CLEARED FOR CAL. EXECUTION;  </P> <P> HIGH COURT PUTS SAN DIEGO KILLER NEARER GAS CHAMBER  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court moved San Diego murderer Robert Alton Harris a giant  step closer to the gas chamber today by flatly rejecting a broad legal  challenge to his death sentence. He would be the first person to die in  California's gas chamber since 1967.  </P> <P> "Harris will likely be executed sometime toward the end of March or early  April," Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp said at a morning press conference in San  Diego.  </P> <P> "In this one, the end is in sight. This is a somber moment. There can be no joy  in taking a human life. Nor can there be any justice in prolonging this case  any longer," Van de Kamp said.  </P> <P> The justices rejected Harris' appeal by a 7-2 vote.  </P> <P> The 37-year-old convicted murderer of two San Diego teen-agers still has legal  avenues open to him, including a recently filed appeal in the state Supreme  Court. But his case has progressed much farther through the court system than  any of the other 272 prisoners on California's Death Row.  </P> <P> If Harris is executed, California will join 13 other states which have carried  out a death sentence since 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated capital  punishment. Thirty-six states have death penalty laws, and nationwide more than  2,200 prisoners are on Death Rows. Only 120 persons have been put to death  since 1976, and most of them have died in four Southern states: Texas, Florida,  Louisiana and Georgia. The only states outside the South that have carried out  executions since 1976 are Nevada (4), Utah (3) and Indiana (2).  </P> <P> Nine years after the state Supreme Court upheld his sentence, Harris' chance of  obtaining any more lengthy delays is getting slimmer.  </P> <P> His attorneys, Michael McCabe and Charles Sevilla of San Diego, issued a brief  statement saying they are "disappointed by the ruling" and vowing to press the  new appeal in the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, our petition for writ of habeas corpus now before the California  Supreme Court, which addresses other issues relating to the legality of the  death penalty in this case, will succeed," the statement said.  </P> <P> Sevilla told The Times that he had not spoken to Harris this morning, but  noted: "We know the obvious. The guy is not feeling very good about it."  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody can imagine what it is like to live with a death  sentence over your head for 11 years while living in the abominable conditions  of San Quentin," Sevilla said.  </P> <P> Harris is on Death Row for the July 5, 1978, murders of John Mayeski and  Michael Baker. The boys had been sitting in Mayeski's car in a north San Diego  parking lot, eating a Jack-In-The-Box lunch. Brandishing a gun, Harris forced  the boys to drive to a fire road at Miramar Reservoir, where he shot them and  stole their car for use in a bank robbery.  </P> <P> Later that day, Harris and his brother Daniel robbed a bank of $3,009, then  returned to the house where they were staying. Police quickly arrived and  arrested them. San Diego police officer Steve Baker was among the arresting  officers. Only later did he learn that his son had been one of Harris' victims.  </P> <P> Harris was convicted and sentenced to death in 1979. In 1981, the state court  upheld his death sentence on a 4-2 vote. For most of the years since then, his  case has been in the federal courts. Counting the appeal rejected today,  Harris' case has been before the U.S. Supreme Court four times.  </P> <P> Families of the victims welcomed today's Supreme Court decision, but are  skeptical an execution will take place this spring. "After 11 years, I'm not  bringing out the champagne yet," said Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, 68, John  Mayeski's mother.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court action today upheld the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals ruling that rejected an array of contentions. The action came without  comment, although Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall  dissented, as they do in all death penalty affirmances. Harris' attorneys had  claimed in the latest appeal Court that he suffered from a "mental disorder,"  that he was treated more harshly by the trial jury because his victims were  white, and that his trial was tainted by inflammatory pretrial publicity.  </P> <P> A psychiatrist had told the sentencing jury that Harris had a "sociopathic  personality." This mental condition, his lawyers argued, demands a less severe  punishment for Harris.  </P> <P> "It is unconstitutional to allow a medically recognized mental disorder to  serve as a reason to put someone to death," Sevilla told the high court in his  appeal for Harris.  </P></p>

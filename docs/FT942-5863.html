			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant used car sales behind rise at Lookers Lookers, one of the top 10 UK motor dealer groups, more than doubled interim pre-tax profits thanks largely to buoyant used car sales, writes Caroline Southey. Pre-tax rose from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 3.09m in the six months to end-March on turnover ahead by 14.2 per cent to Pounds 187m (Pounds 164m). The group raised its interim dividend by 20 per cent from 2p to 2.4p. The pay-out is covered more than three times by earnings of 7.8p (2.6p) per share. Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said that profits had increased chiefly as a result of a 19 per cent increase in used car sales coupled with improved margins. Sales of new cars to the fleet sector fell slightly, he said, but sales to retail customers had risen by 13.5 per cent. 'We felt that margins at the top end of the fleet market were not worth getting into and we did not get into deep discounting. But with constant hard work I am confident we will be able to hold our improved margins,' Mr Martindale said. Increased personal taxation from April had interrupted the rising sales trend, but Mr Martindale predicted a steady increase through to the end of the year. He said the company would be looking at expansion opportunities next year in the light of a further reduction in its gearing, which had fallen to 36 per cent at the end of March from 53 per cent a year ago.</p>

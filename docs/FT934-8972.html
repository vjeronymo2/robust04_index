			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ruberoid flotation price fixed at 150p A PRICE of 150p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Ruberoid, valuing the roofing subsidiary Tarmac is spinning off to the market at about Pounds 72m. Roughly 60 per cent of Ruberoid's turnover is in commercial contracting, of which about 70 per cent is refurbishment. The balance of its sales come from manufacturing and distributing a range of bituminous waterproofing systems. The issue will raise Pounds 68.8m for existing shareholders, principally subsidiaries of Tarmac, and Pounds 2m for the company. More than 30m shares, 65 per cent of the issue, are being placed firm with institutions. The balance, 16.5m shares, is being placed subject to clawback under the public offer for sale. On forecast pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m for the year to end-December, the issue price gives a pro forma p/e of 14.3 times. The total dividend of 5.4p the directors would have recommended for the year to December 1993 if the company had been independent would have given a gross yield of 4.5 per cent. The offer closes on November 18 and dealings are expected to start on November 25. COMMENT Contracting is a low margin business carrying some risks. In the UK Ruberoid's main market, new construction, is limited by the glut of commercial property. The company's reliance on refurbishment is therefore a comfort. Also, Ruberoid has already taken full provisions against contracting losses and enjoys good shares in its markets. The risks and low growth profile are reflected in the company's cheap 14.3 times rating which compares with others in the mid-20s in the building materials sector. Coupled with its dividend yield the stock Tarmac failed to sell to a trade buyer should reach a reasonable premium in a high market.</p>

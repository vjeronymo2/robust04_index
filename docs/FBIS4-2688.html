			<p>BFN     [Text] This is the second day of Prime Minister Cavaco  Silva's visit to China. He broached the question of Timor  today. He asked the Chinese Government to contribute to a just  solution to the problem of East Timor. He stressed that the  Chinese contribution should come within the UN framework.    [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We believe that there are two  issues in Timor: the question of respect for human rights, which  we will continue to advocate here and anywhere else in the  world, and there is the question of the occupation by a foreign  power of a territory that, according to international law, is  still under Portuguese administration. Therefore, we are asking  the Chinese Government for support, so that within the UN's  framework, under the auspices of the UN secretary general, a  just and internationally accepted solution can be found for the  problem of Timor. [end recording]    As for the nationality of the Macanese, Cavaco Silva said  that he had been informed that the Chinese authorities did not  intend to impose Chinese nationality on the residents of Macao  who are of Portuguese descent and culture.</p>

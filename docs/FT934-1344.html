			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Debts slow poor nations' recovery Heavy debt repayments to the IMF and World Bank by the world's poorest countries are holding up their recovery and the loans should be rescheduled or written off, says a report published today. The report, by the British charity Oxfam, calculates that debt repayments to multilateral creditors by 19 'severely indebted, low-income countries' now account for 30 per cent of their debt service payments, 'more than double the level a decade ago'. Most of the countries are in Africa. Payments to the IMF represent a 'special problem', according to the Oxfam analysis, 'since they have outstripped the provision of new finance by some Dollars 2bn since the mid-1980s'. The report proposes a new issue of Special Drawing Rights by the Fund geared specifically to debt reduction, and the sale of 10 per cent of the IMF's gold stocks to finance a debt write-off for the world's poorest countries. The paper takes Uganda as an example of the group's predicament. Scheduled repayments on the country's debt for 1992-93 came to Dollars 173m (Pounds 116m), more than 80 per cent of export earnings. Actual repayments amounted to less than half. Of these, about 50 per cent went to multilateral creditors, mainly the IMF and the Bank. By 1997, when repayments on a IMF structural adjustment loan fall due, almost a third of Uganda's debt service commitments will be to the Fund. The Oxfam paper also warns that Africa's overall debt crisis is deepening, with the debt stock tripling over the past decade. The charity calls for the immediate adoption of the Trinidad Terms, which allow for between 66 and 80 per cent write-off of Paris Club debt owed to official, bilateral creditors. It blames 'resistance' by the Japanese government and general 'indifference' among creditors for the delay in adopting the terms. *Uganda: Debt as an obstacle of recovery, Oxfam, 274 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DZ.

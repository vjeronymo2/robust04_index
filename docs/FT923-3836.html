			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / BCCI liquidators win order TOUCHE ROSS, liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday won a High Court order for the Serious Fraud Office to disclose documents seized from three former senior executives with the bank, John Mason writes. The documents were obtained by police from the London homes of Mr Agha Abedi, BCCI's founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, a former BCCI chief executive, and from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, a former BCCI deputy chief executive. Many of the documents are thought to relate to work done by Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, for an investigation set up by the Abu Dhabi government. The flight log of the BCCI jet will also be handed over to the liquidators. The order, which was unopposed by the SFO, follows unsuccessful attempts by Touche Ross to obtain documents from the three men themselves. Large creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong Ltd (in liquidation) have endorsed a repayment scheme.</p>

Esteemed brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the  Armed Forces: Greetings of the revolution and unity. While we  do not want to remind you of the stands, sacrifices, and heroic  deeds, that the sons of the Abyan Governorate have registered at  various stages and of their national militant role in achieving  unity and democracy, we would like to stress that the situation  in Abyan Governorate has become grave as a result of the  barbaric provocations and killings to which the governorate's  honorable and innocent sons are being exposed. We urge you to  face up to your responsibilities and your historic mission,  which you pledged to God to carry out for your people and your  homeland.    While we take pride in the fact that Abyan has been destined  to be the cradle of the revolution and the revolutionaries, we  are displeased by the negligence displayed toward the  governorate and its achievements. In addition to losing its  best and noblest men, as well as being deprived of most of its  rights and needs, Abyan Governorate is being exposed to killings  and torture. (?Most parts) of the governorate are still to this  moment besieged by the most lethal machines of destruction and  death, which were brought by the advocates of division to settle  purely divisionist scores.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members:  While we are addressing you, our hearts are bleeding because of  what is happening to our sons, daughters, mothers, brothers, and  sisters. While we reiterate our readiness to continue to offer  more sacrifices for the sake of unity, we do not want our  governorate, Abyan, to be the hotbed of the conflict, which  would not serve the homeland or the people's interest.  Therefore, we urge the withdrawal of all the military units  from the governorate, as well as the implementation of the  contents of the accord document, as the only solution to the  crisis.    While we urge you to abide by this, we call on the parties  in  the coalition; all the political forces, represented by the  Dialogue Committee; all the political organizations; and the  vocational and creative popular organizations to close ranks in  the face of threats to our unity and the implementation of the  Amman accord.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members: The  state of loss being experienced by the sons of the Abyan  Governorate, throughout the republic, and abroad as a result of  statements transmitted by print and electronic media organs,  prompts us to urge, through this message, a halt to this media  propaganda that only harms our governorate. At the same time,  we call for the facts to be clarified to our people through the  military committee and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee  so that we, as well as our people's masses, can unveil those  behind the bloody conflict from which the sons of Abyan -- who  are faithful to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity --  are suffering. May God grant you success in maintaining the  interest of the homeland and people. Peace and God's mercy and  blesses be upon you.    [Signed] The sons of Abyan Governorate</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Selection Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The selection criteria set forth below supersede the criteria presented in the previous operational test notices dated May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19959), July 20, 1992 (57 FR 32047), and September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47310).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Relationship to National Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Operational Test offer of participation shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Directly support the national goals and milestones of the user service areas described in this solicitation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Advance the development and eventual implementation of the proposed technology or system. Demonstrate that there is an acceptable basis for believing that the technologies being tested will ultimately be successfully deployed or implemented;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Have meaningful, distinguishable features involving technical, institutional, market, or other important characteristics which have not been addressed in operational tests to date. Operational tests should not replicate past or current tests unless such replication provides a significant contribution to advancing the ITS program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Fit within a logical evolution of the ITS program and supporting technology; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Provide an approach that is technically feasible and responsive to the requirements of the user service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In concert with the evaluation guidelines stated earlier, the Operational Test offer of participation shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Identify initial evaluation goals and objectives at the national and local level. These goals and objectives should reflect those activities required to move toward the national goals and milestones outlined in the ``Department of Transportation's IVHS Strategic Plan''. The evaluation goals and objectives should address, as a minimum, institutional issues, user acceptance, system benefits, costs, performance of the system, and impacts on the transportation system, including air quality;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Provide a general evaluation work plan that outlines the scope and method of evaluation of each goal and objective and an assessment of the opportunity to collect the necessary data that can answer questions of both local and national significance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Provide for selection of an independent evaluator to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the operational test. The evaluator's responsibilities should be identified in the offer; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Provide estimated overall costs for conducting the evaluation. The costs of data collection and evaluation should be identified as separate items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Project Management and Proposed Partnership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Operational Test offer of participation shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Provide an overall level of confidence that the test will be successfully completed by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Demonstrating an acceptable level of commitment, management capability, and business reliability of the partners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Demonstrating that there is a commitment by all partners to a national technology sharing effort and a willingness to dedicate the time and effort required to share the technical and institutional results of the test with others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of the principal partners and staff and demonstrating that they have the ability to perform their assigned responsibilities. For large or complex tests, an experienced systems manager to support the project is desirable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Provide sufficient background to validate the accuracy of the cost and schedule estimates for the operational test;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Minimize any potential negative effects of the test and demonstrate an awareness of and approach for dealing with complicating technical or institutional factors which might adversely affect the test. Innovative or technically challenging ways for dealing with these factors will be of particular interest;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Identify the proposed agreements for sharing of technology developed under this operational test; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

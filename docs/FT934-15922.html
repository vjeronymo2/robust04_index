			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (7): An eye on world aircraft markets - Aerospace Industry TAIWAN'S aerospace industry has reached a watershed in its development. Within two or three years, it should become clear whether or not it will be able to extend its engineering expertise into world markets for passenger aircraft. Taiwan is an established components supplier to big western civil aircraft manufacturers. It is also able to produce its own military jet fighters. Now the government is seeking to marry the two and create an industry that manufactures whole aircraft for domestic and foreign civilian markets. The most important talks now under way are with the UK's British Aerospace and Dassault of France. BAe wants to improve its profitability: the RJ series of regional jet passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, lose money for the company. Unfortunately, talks with Taiwan have encountered difficulties since a contract to establish a joint venture was signed in London in January. Doubts have been raised by Taiwanese banks lending money to finance the joint venture, called Avro. They are concerned that the aircraft could lose money as easily in Taiwanese hands as British. The main hurdle, the financing of the deal, was cleared in August. But the apparently less important details of the amount of technological expertise that would be transferred to Taiwan have proved to be almost as difficult to overcome. If, and when, these matters are settled, manufacturing could begin as early as next spring. Talks are at an earlier stage with French aircraft builder Dassault. Taiwan is buying Dassault military jet aircraft and missiles and wants some aerospace manufacturing skills transferred to Taiwan. Dassault is keen to keep such transfers confined to civil sector skills associated with its Falcon series of executive jets. But Taiwan may insist on some of the Mirage work moving to the island. Taiwan is in a strong position to demand such concessions. In Dassault's case, the deal was its first export order for four years, while BAe is still struggling to improve its profitability after a period of heavy losses. Taiwan has two further inducements, beyond its experience in the components business, with which to persuade foreign companies to share their know-how. It has huge reserves of capital, thanks to its successes in exports of manufactured goods. And it offers proximity to the world's fastest-growing air transport markets in south-east Asia and China. Taiwan also wants a foreign partner as it struggles to emerge from decades of relative economic isolation thanks to China's claim over the island. That isolation prevented the government from importing military aircraft. Instead, it went ahead with production of its own designs. Taiwan initially moved to piston-engined training aircraft and then jet trainers. Now it has advanced far enough to oversee production of its own supersonic jet fighter, the IDF (Indigenous Defence Fighter). Yet as production of the IDF got under way last year, France and the US decided to risk Beijing's wrath by allowing the sale of General Dynamics F-16 and Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Taiwan. Taiwan's air force promptly halved its order for the IDF to 150 aircraft, leaving 200 or more local aerospace manufacturers and the design and manufacturing arm of the defence ministry with spare capacity. This spare capacity has added impetus to the drive to find foreign partners for aerospace manufacturing. To that end, the government this summer announced the progressive privatisation of the country's military aircraft manufacturing operations, which builds the IDF, at Taichung on the island's west coast. The first stage, scheduled for next summer, is the creation of an autonomous but state-owned company. It could lead to complete privatisation within five years, say government officials. The move to privatise the Taichung operations follow the establishment by the government of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) in October 1991. This company, with a minority state shareholding, has the aim of becoming 'a major Asian aerospace company by the year 2000'. It intends to accomplish this through partnerships, and it was TAC that led the Taiwan side in plans to establish the Avro joint venture with BAe. Yet two years after its birth, TAC is still finding the aerospace industry a tough one to enter. Although it has plenty of cash and some engineering expertise, Taiwan still lacks several essential skills specific to the civil aircraft business: integrating components, designing interiors, marketing and leasing. And the providers of the cash, Taiwanese investors, are discovering that aircraft manufacture is a high-risk business in which they may not see a return on an investment for a decade or more. Taiwan's banking community has been among the most wary of TAC's backers in assessing whether prospective deals should go ahead. They were partly behind the failure last year to launch a Dollars 2bn joint venture with McDonnell Douglas to design and build a new large passenger jet. Government officials blame that failure on the country's inexperience in aerospace: TAC was only a few months old and its financial backers were daunted by the prospect of investing huge sums in an aircraft whose design did not yet exist. McDonnell-Douglas may yet come back to Taiwan for another deal. Unofficial reports from Taiwan suggest that the government is having talks with the company over the possibility of establishing a joint venture to develop helicopter technologies. And the fear of being seen as a country that cannot do joint venture deals with foreign partners is certainly contributing to the survival of the BAe talks. So it is a measure of Taiwan's determinations to establish itself in aerospace that it is prepared to enter into talks simultaneously with several large foreign companies in the field. If the drive fails to spark rapid growth in aerospace as a consequence, it will not be for lack of trying.</p>

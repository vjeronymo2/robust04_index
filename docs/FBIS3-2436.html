			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman  for China's top legislature, answered questions about the NPC's  [National People's Congress] legislative work, the Hong Kong  issue and the law on protection of Taiwan investors at a press  conference held in the Great Hall of the People this morning.    Asked about the law on the protection of investment by  Taiwan  compatriots which was promulgated by the National People's  Congress (NPC) Standing Committee recently, Zhou, spokesman for  the current session of the Eighth NPC, said that the law was  designed to suit the current situation. He said that economic  exchanges across the Taiwan straits and Taiwan investment in the  Mainland have been increasing substantially. But there are  still no direct transport and commercial links between the two  sides of the straits.    Zhou said that the new law is formulated to ensure the  personal safety and economic interests and rights of Taiwan  investors to the Mainland and keep their enterprises on the  Mainland from being requisitioned. This has fully demonstrated  the Mainland's respect for the interests and rights of Taiwan  investors and its sincerity in developing trade relations across  the straits, he said.    Asked about possibility of an agreement on protection of  investment by the two sides, Zhou said that Taiwan is an  inseparable part of China and the relations between the Chinese  Central Government and Taiwan are the relations between a  central government and a locality.    "It is out of the question that the two sides may sign any  agreement," he said.    In response to a question about whether Hong Kong's  three-tier political structure will be terminated when China  resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the spokesman blamed  the uncooperative attitude of the British side for the breakdown  of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue.    Zhou pointed out that the three-tier political structure of  Hong Kong will be terminated by June 30, 1997, the date set in  the Sino- British joint declaration.    Asked about NPC accelerating the pace of legislation and  strengthening legislative supervision, he said that the NPC and  its standing committee has accelerated legislation, especially  in the economic field, in the past year. It passed 22 laws in  1993, including 12 economic laws, setting a record in NPC  history.    He said that last year the NPC Standing Committee sent ten  inspection teams to 15 provinces and autonomous regions to  oversee the implementation of the laws, and learned opinions of  relevant departments on key tasks of the government and the  issues that people are concerned about.    The spokesman said that the Eighth NPC will strive to  promulgate 152 laws during its term of service, which will end  in 1998. The laws will form the framework of the legal system  of the socialist market economy and perfect legislation in other  areas.    At the press conference attended by several hundred  correspondents from China and abroad, Zhou also answered  questions about Sino-U.S. relations, reform of large- and  medium-sized state- owned enterprises and the securities law.</p>

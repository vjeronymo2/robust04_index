			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Nuts reprieved TORTILLA CHIPS, pistachio nuts in their shells, packets of poppadums and other savoury snacks have been granted a reprieve from value added tax, Customs and Excise ruled yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Following consultation with snack manufacturers and other trade bodies Customs has rejected suggestions that 17.5 per cent VAT should be imposed on a wider range of snacks. The decision follows a Customs consultation document in March last year which suggested the possibility of widening the definition of snacks that would not be classified as food. The clause - originally drafted for purchase tax introduced in 1969 and incorporated into VAT legislation in 1974 - said there would be no zero-rating for potato-based products, for those made from the swelling of cereal products or for salted or roasted nuts, except for those in their shells. That has left a growing number of anomalies, as more exotic snacks have been introduced in the past two decades. Snacks which are currently zero-rated include sugar-coated biscuits, Twiglets and gingerbread women dipped in caramel - though not in chocolate. Customs now accepts that VAT can be recovered by builders of new houses for the purchase of materials for fitted furniture, it said yesterday. The action follows a ruling in the High Court following an assessment relating to McLeans Homes (Midland) Ltd.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Challengers emerge for UK telecoms market TWO NEW companies are poised to enter the newly-deregulated UK telecommunications market - representing a potentially serious challenge to British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the existing long-distance operators. British Waterways, the public utility which runs the UK canal system, has linked up with privately-owned US Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telecoms carrier, with a view to providing an alternative long-distance network in the UK. The newly privatised electricity supply industry is also considering entering both the long-distance and local telecoms markets. Last week chairmen of the twelve regional electricity companies and the National Grid Company discussed forming a joint-venture to apply for licences. Both moves were prompted by the government white paper last month which opened the Pounds 10bn-a-year telecommunications market to competition and paved the way for any company to apply for licences to supply telecommunications services. British Rail has already announced plans to enter the telecoms market by laying cables alongside its tracks. The two new challengers believe their existing networks offer them a cheap way of entering this potentially lucrative market. British Waterways would lay fibre optic cables along the bottom of its canals, while the electricity supply industry would hang the cables between its pylons. British Waterways and Sprint plan to invest between Pounds 50m and Pounds 75m to build a trunk network to within 5 miles of half the UK's population. Mr David Ingman, British Waterways' chairman, said the aim would be to act as a carrier's carrier, supplying high quality capacity to other operators, such as personal communications networks, and large business customers. Under government regulations British Waterways will not be allowed to invest any of its own money in the project and most of the shares will have to be owned by the private sector. The partners intend that GPT, Britain's largest telecommunications equipment supplier, would provide the submarine cables. A final decision to proceed with the project will be taken in the next couple of months after further assessment of the market. The electricity industry's plans are potentially more ambitious, with one executive saying a total of Pounds 400m may be invested. The companies are considering carrying not only telephone, but also television and data services. Some regional electricity companies have not yet committed themselves to the project out of fear that the City would take a dim view of such early diversification. Others - notably Northern Electric, Norweb, and Yorkshire, together with the National Grid Company - are enthusiastic because there are not many other significant opportunities to expand outside their core business. Norweb and Yorkshire have also considered developing independent regional telecommunications networks. The final decision on whether to apply for a licence will be taken in May, said Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, who is leading research into the project for the thirteen companies. 'We have reached a milestone in the study process,' he said. 'But further work must be done to appraise the project in financial terms.'</p>

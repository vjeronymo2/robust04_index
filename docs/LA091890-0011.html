			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOSQUE NO ONE WANTED  </P> <P> It would be hard to find a more cooperative group than the folks representing  the Islamic Center of Northridge.  </P> <P> For starters, they complied with a city requirement that called for their  proposed mosque to "blend in" with a Granada Hills neighborhood. That meant a  Spanish-style mosque without the traditional domes or minarets.  </P> <P> But even after that concession, the city still slapped the mosque with 44  conditions for approval -- the highest number of restrictions ever placed on a  house of worship in Los Angeles. Taken all together, these actions raise  disturbing questions about government infringement on religious freedom. In an  increasingly diverse Los Angeles, the restrictions also raise disturbing  questions about why there was so much opposition to the construction of the  mosque. Was it just a matter of too many people -- or what kind of people?  </P> <P> Quite rightly, Mayor Tom Bradley now asks the city to consider whether there  should be any design restrictions for religious buildings.  </P> <P> Originally, the Islamic Center wanted to build a new house of worship and a  social hall for 550 people. A "conditional use permit" to allow construction in  a residential area was granted, but appealed. The mosque was inappropriate for  that location, opponents said, and would bring in too much traffic.  </P> <P> The council granted the permit. But with it came a list of requirements,  including a notice advising worshipers not to park in the neighborhood plus a  limit on membership. The mosque cannot have more than 250 members in the first  year. The number could be increased to 400 later -- subject to city review.  </P> <P> Project opponents said their objections were strictly environmental. Yet when a  church, about a block away, recently wanted to add a floor to its school to  make room for another 150 children, approval came without controversy.  </P> <P> There could well be legitimate reasons for the two different community  responses; in any case, the Islamic Center says it plans no appeals. Now, a  spokesman said, they just want to move forward, with all the restrictions, and  show the city that they can be good neighbors. But it's a shame they now feel  they have to prove that.  </P></p>

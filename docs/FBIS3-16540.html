			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report under the "News From the Very Top" </F> rubric: "New Group Created in State Duma"]    [Text] Valeriy Borshchev, chairman of the Russian  Christian Democratic Union [RCDU], announced yesterday the  creation in the State Duma of a new deputy group.    Joining the RCDU group today are six people, mainly from the  Yabloko faction. It also has members of Russia's Choice,  however, in particular Gleb Yakunin and Vitaliy Savitskiy.  According to Borshchev, the RCDU group is not trying in any  manner to effect a split in the democratic forces of the Duma.  On the contrary, it will be trying to bring closer together the  positions of Yabloko, Russia's Choice, and the Union of 12  December in a bid to create a single reformist bloc. A platform  for such an association, Borshchev thinks, could be the results  of voting on the political amnesty issue. KURANTY has already  reported that the amnesty was not supported by all three  factions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Chemodurov report under the "Furors" rubric: "Where </F> There Is a Bribe There Will Be a Song"]    [Text] Passions are seething in Orlikov Lane, the site of  Minselkhozprod [Ministry of Agriculture and Food], following the  arrest of Ivan Romakh, chief of the Main Administration for  Financial Regulation. Staff at the headquarters of the  department that provides the country with its grub are playing a  guessing game: Who will be next to go?    A conversation with one Minselkhozprod staffer on the topic  of current morals at the ministry yielded information which  sheds light on a number of things.    According to this specialist (he asked us not to reveal his  name), Ivan Romakh merely "allocated" concessionary credits from  the state budget on self-interested terms; the credits were  actually released, that is to say approved, by Deputy Minister  N. Averyanov, who handles finances. It might be a coincidence,  but a fact remains a fact: Following Romakh's arrest, Deputy  Minister Averyanov was urgently admitted to hospital.    In light of this, the interest displayed by I. Gridasov,  chief of the Agriculture Main Administration, in the affairs of  the "Rostok" private firm is becoming increasingly apparent. He  knows, of course, that in the spring of 1992 R. Kozhenkova, the  firm's general director, signed a contract with Finland's state  grain storage organization to supply her firm (which at that  time was called "Russian-Serbian Seeds") with 20,000 tonnes of  Finnish selected oat and barley seed worth $5 million. The firm  received the seeds from the Finns but has still not paid for  them.    Even with this knowledge, Gridasov still respects the  "Rostok" firm. Last summer, as a member of a delegation from  this firm, he even visited the former Yugoslavia. And then,  needless to say, he sowed Yugoslav seeds on Russian fields,  having secured a state subsidy to do so.    "Rostok's" interests are also championed by Ye. Zozimovich,  chief of the Seed Production Administration. In addition to the  interests of another firm -- the "Roskukuruza" firm. Meanwhile  we have reliably been informed that there are documents at  Petrovka Militia Station which prove that A. Taratushka,  "Roskukuruza's" deputy director, took cash bribes worth  thousands of dollars from a specialist in the Kalmyk Ministry of  Agriculture in order to "encourage" Ministry of Agriculture  staff.    "Roskukuruza," incidentally, has obtained Ministry of  Agriculture apartments in Dayev Lane, and now the firm's  directors spend whole days in Gridasov's or Zosimovich's office.    The source of our information is convinced that  Minselkhozprod staff are feeding state loans to private firms,  only the scale of the corruption is more extensive that appears  at first glance.</p>

He  said there were discussions about turning ASEAN into a center  for cooperation with organizations in other regions. A meeting  on this will be held in Bangkok from 3 to 4 February. According  to Surin, Malaysia concurred that ASEAN should take the lead in  developing capital for the gas and oil sector and spread this  capital to other regions, particularly to Indian ocean countries.    Surin said there has been considerable progress in  Thai-Malaysian relations, including in the economic triangle  project. Regarding the private sector's proposal to open the  Thai-Malaysian border around the clock, Surin said Malaysia is  interested in the proposal and is considering it. The question  is whether the Thai side, particularly the Thai Government  sector, is ready and whether there are enough goods to pass the  border to justify a 24-hour opening.    Surin said APEC was also discussed with Malaysian officials.  An APEC meeting will be held in Jakarta in May.</p>

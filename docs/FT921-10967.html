			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / S African whites take to barricades IT IS white South Africa's worst nightmare come true: thousands of black squatters are to be settled in the verdant Johannesburg suburb of Randburg, and the local white residents have taken to the barricades to keep them out. Ironically, residents have turned to the black liberation movements for their strategy in opposing a plan to move 10,000 to 20,000 squatters to an area bordering one of Johannesburg's smarter suburbs. Reminiscent of street scenes in the black townships of the 1980s, Randburg residents have erected barricades out of barbed wire, tin drums and wood and decked them with banners reading 'No squatters, not now, not ever'. Borrowing the language of the African National Congress, the members of the local resident's action committee proclaim their belief in 'people power' to keep the squatters out. They say they will boycott taxes and rates, mimicking the successful strategy adopted by the anti-apartheid movement to defeat local councils in black townships. They plan mass street protests to keep their suburb squatter-free. Residents insist they are not racist: wealthy blacks are welcome to purchase homes in the area, which includes middle-class homes of R130,000 (Pounds 26,000) to R180,000 and an area of expensive properties ranging from R500,000 to R1m. Instead, the plan is to develop a vacant area of 44 hectares for low-cost housing - which in practice means providing serviced sites on which squatters will build makeshift shacks from corrugated iron, cardboard, wood and other scrap materials. The dispute, which is now in the courts, highlights the tensions provoked by the abolition by President FW de Klerk a year ago of legal segregation of residential areas. Under apartheid, South Africa's cities were designed for whites; blacks were viewed as temporary sojourners, accommodated in what amounted to labour camps far from the city centre. Soweto, for example, is at least 25km from Johannesburg. Now, with statutory apartheid gone, ways must be found to house blacks closer to potential jobs. So the Transvaal Provincial Administration has agreed to purchase vacant land in Randburg - near an industrial estate and a local commercial centre - and develop it for the resettlement of squatters currently illegally occupying a nearby farm, Zevenfontein. The provincial authorities now say they are reconsidering the plan, in light of the Randburg residents' outrage. But with an estimated 2.5m people living in shacks or informal housing in the Johannesburg area alone, more conflicts of this kind can be expected. Whites hope that high purchase prices for housing will maintain de-facto residential segregation now that legal apartheid is gone; but the numbers are against them.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Feudal title holder claims Pounds 1bn slice of Jersey A private Jersey-based development company is using a feudal title to lay claim to the industrial foreshore of St Helier, the island's capital, estimated to be worth at least Pounds 1bn. Les Pas Holdings claims it owns the most developed section of the foreshore, including most of the island's busy harbour, the main power station, the fuel farm, a new underpass and most of a big area of reclaimed land. The claim is being vigorously contested by crown officers in Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands. The figure at the centre of the bizarre wrangle is Advocate Richard Falle, one of the island's leading lawyers and a director of Les Pas. Eight years ago he and a group of businessmen submitted plans for a commercial marina which they said would help alleviate the island's housing problem and boost tourism. The plan has been strongly opposed by conservationists, and a protest group called Save Our Shoreline has mounted a sustained campaign to stop the building of the marina. At about the same time Les Pas also acquired the seigneur's feudal rights, known as Le Fief de la Fosse. This includes rights over the foreshore that traditionally extended as far as the seigneur could ride his horse into the sea at low tide. Mr Falle said he has become so frustrated by delays over the marina plan that he is invoking the ancient title. 'I am bitterly disappointed with what I believe to be politicking at every level,' he said. 'I still believe this scheme is the best and most constructive idea for the development of Jersey's economy this century.' The company claims its feudal rights over the foreshore include ownership. Fiefdoms date back to Norman law and many landowners have fought similar, if smaller cases in the UK. Both Les Pas and the crown officers have commissioned leading QCs to ascertain the validity of the feudal title claim, and Les Pas has registered its claim with Jersey's Royal Court. According to confidential committee documents, Mr Terry Sowden, a former Jersey solicitor-general, advised the States, the island's parliament, that Les Pas's claim had no foundation in law. Miss Stephanie Nicolle, the present solicitor-general, has confirmed that if Les Pas were to win, it would own everything built on the disputed territory in perpetuity. In a letter to a senior civil servant, she warned: 'The consequences of failure (by the authorities to win) do not bear contemplation.' Mr Falle said he is prepared to fight all the way to the European Court to secure what he believes is Les Pas's rightful title. Senator Reg Jeune, president of the States' policy and resources committee, Jersey's cabinet, declined to comment. In February the States approved a new Pounds 25m reclamation scheme on the foreshore aimed at solving the island's waste-disposal problems, in spite of the threat of possible court action against it over ownership.</p>

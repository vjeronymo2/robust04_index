			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>   [Summary] Moscow, 14 May -- Russia's Chief Military  Procuracy [CMP] intends to ask the presidential administration  to speed up the creation of a military police in Russia's Armed  Forces. The necessary documents have already been submitted.    It was noted at a recent working conference of the CMP that  crime has risen sharply in the forces -- 2,572 people were  killed and 1,002 received injuries in the armed forces in 1993;  while 2,868 weapons were stolen in the same period. The  existing preliminary investigation bodies, consisting of unit  commanders and locally appointed officers, are considered  inadequate. Last year the number of crimes concealed for  various reasons by these non-professional bodies rose by a  factor of 2.2 compared to 1992.</p>

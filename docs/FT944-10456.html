			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Carlisle funds property expansion Carlisle Group yesterday completed its transformation from a financial services company to a property group with the announcement of a Pounds 14.4m placing and open offer to help fund Pounds 29m of property purchases. The transaction will almost double the size of Carlisle, whose primary operating business is the Pepper Angliss &amp; Yarwood property agency. Mr Nigel Wray, chairman and largest shareholder, said: 'The deal gives us the balance sheet that will enable us to take the next step. We'd like to trade out a lot of this portfolio and get more heavily involved in the Mayfair area.' The company is offering 75.6m new shares at 20 1/4 p on a 10-for-11 basis. Carlisle will pay Pounds 4.5m for Strathinver, the investment holding company which owns the portfolio. It has agreed to repay Pounds 4.3m of Strathinver's Pounds 24.5m debt immediately, and will repay a further Pounds 6.95m by the end of the year. Strathinver is 60 per cent owned by Coats Viyella. The family of Mr Jonathan Harris, Carlisle's chief executive, holds 26 per cent. It reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 470,000 for the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 2.69m. The company owns 16 commercial and industrial properties spread throughout England, with current net rental income of Pounds 2.68m. This represents a yield of more than 9 per cent. The deal, effectively a reverse takeover, provides Carlisle with the financial muscle to develop as a property investment group. Net assets will increase from Pounds 9.24m to Pounds 24m. Trading in the shares was suspended and will not resume until December 8, when dealings in the new shares are due to commence.</p>

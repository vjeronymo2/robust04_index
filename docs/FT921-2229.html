			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cancer drug gains approval AS BIOTECHNOLOGY has provided the means to prepare commercial quantities of the proteins which regulate the human immune system, medical attention has been focused on these 'biological response modifiers' (BRMs) and their potential role in the treatment of cancer. One particularly promising BRM was called the T-cell Growth Factor when it was discovered in 1976 and subsequently renamed Interleukin-2. In Europe, EuroCetus has used recombinant DNA technology to produce large quantities of Interleukin-2 in the form of its first commercial product  - Proleukin. Now, after completing medical trials, EuroCetus has won marketing approval in the UK for Proleukin which has proved effective in the treatment of renal cell carcinomas, the most common cancer of the kidney. It is notoriously difficult to treat and is relatively insensitive to current forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Proleukin appears to work indirectly by stimulating the immune system rather than by direct attack on cancer cells, and researchers hope that it may also prove effective in treating other cancers.

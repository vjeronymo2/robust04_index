			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Mexican centre-right in poll choice Mexico's centre-right opposition National Action Party has chosen Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the party's leader in the House of Deputies, as its candidate in next year's presidential election, writes Damian Fraser from Mexico City. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is from the faction of PAN which supports co-operation with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. He negotiated with the PRI the recently approved democratic reforms, criticised by many in PAN and on the left. The candidate was elected with 65 per cent of the vote of party members. The PRI has been in power for 64 continuous years, and is overwhelming favourite to win next August's election. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is little known outside Mexico City, and his aloof manner may put off many voters. His candidacy has been widely interpreted as a help to Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential aspirant from the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Antitrust and global markets Whatever the impact on the computer industry of this weekend's settlement of monopoly proceedings against Microsoft, the world's largest software company, it marks a milestone in antitrust law. The unprecedented co-operation between authorities in Washington and Brussels which it occasioned seems bound to add to the growing debate about how competition policy should be adapted to the realities of global markets. Admittedly, it is still uncertain how far the case will set a pattern for the future. The international co-ordination involved was possible only because Microsoft authorised the two authorities to exchange information - an arrangement which their own rules would normally preclude. Yet the fact that such co-ordination was deemed desirable underlines the growing propensity of competition issues to spill across frontiers. Concern about how to respond to this trend has taken a variety of forms since the 1970s, when many developing countries clamoured for tighter international controls on multinational companies. In the 1980s, the focus switched to averting conflict due to the extra-territorial application of US and European competition policies - a problem which led to the conclusion of a bilateral treaty. In the 1990s, two more issues have emerged. One is the worldwide spread of national competition laws, introduced as part of market-based economic reforms. This proliferation of different rules and procedures threatens to impose a heavy compliance burden on companies which operate internationally, and to create a regulatory minefield. The second issue is the growing inter-play - and potential conflict - between antitrust and trade policies, as economies become more exposed to global competition. That has prompted demands that the matter be placed on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Some experts believe these pressures will ultimately lead to the creation of a global cartel office. But the surrender of sovereignty which that would require makes it improbable in the foreseeable future. A more realistic way forward is through closer co-ordination of national policies, bilaterally and within regional economic blocs. That should reduce the risk of regulatory and procedural disparities between countries. However, closer co-ordination is unlikely to solve all the problems arising from the complex linkages between competition and trade policy. Indeed, it could exacerbate them if, for example, it encouraged the US and the EU to try jointly to impose their competition policy precepts on other countries in an attempt to prise open their markets. Such tactics have already been invoked by the US in its trade dispute with Japan. They represent an unacceptable intrusion by one government into another's domestic affairs, which threatens severe international friction. That is the strongest argument for placing competition and trade policy on the WTO agenda, so as to ensure that the debate is anchored in a multilateral framework. The first priority should be to identify precisely how the two policies inter-act. Among the issues to be resolved are the links between competition policy and anti-dumping measures, and how far alleged market barriers are due to deficient competition laws, as opposed to cultural and consumer preferences. The US and the EU should build on the mutual understanding evident in the Microsoft case to further these objectives.</p>

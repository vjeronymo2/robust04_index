			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Asda sells sites and store to competitors for Pounds 57m ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery retailer, has sold two development sites and one store to its competitors as part of an effort to reduce its Pounds 600m debt mountain. Safeway paid Pounds 35m plus a development site in Huddersfield for two sites in north London and Edinburgh, while Sainsbury has acquired Asda's store in Mere Green, Birmingham for Pounds 22m. The disposals appear to be a reversal of the company's previously-stated policy. When Mr Patrick Gillam took over as chairman last year he stressed that he would not sell the company's 'seedcorn' sites to its rivals, in spite of its desperate need for cash. Yesterday Asda emphasised that the deal was a one-off and said it had neither the 'need nor the intention to sell other successful stores'. It added: 'We were offered a very full price and it was clearly in shareholders' interests to sell them.' Although Asda has traded poorly in recent years there are indications that it is beginning to recover lost ground. The company delivered an upbeat statement about current trading at its recent annual meeting and the company's share price has begun to pick up as analysts scent a recovery story. 'Their like-for-like sales are currently outperforming the industry average and are far better than expected,' said Mr Philip Dorgan, food retailing analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. This week the company opened its second Dales discount store at Tipton in the West Midlands and has also recently opened the first of a revised format Asda store concentrating on fresh foods at Stoke. 'We are modestly encouraged by the progress we have made so far as part of our three year recovery strategy,' Asda said yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ISABELLE ADJANI FIGHTS 'NASTIEST IMAGINATIONS'  </P> <P> "OBVIOUSLY BURNING a movie star in effigy is an act that works for people  psychologically. . . . My reaction (to the rumor that she has AIDS) was to try  and investigate it, to try and understand how such a thing that made no sense  at all could come into existence. And a very effective existence. It was  printed in the newspapers and confirmed in medical circles. . . . I was at the  mercy of the nastiest imaginations. It taught me one thing: that the saying  'there's no smoke without fire' is false. . . . I was relieved to be reported  dead; it's true. . . . "  </P> <P> This is the French actress Isabelle Adjani, talking to reporter Marilyn Goldin  in the new issue of Interview. Let's add for the record that Adjani does NOT  have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and is very much alive and kicking.  </P> <P> I THOUGHT of her remarks the other morning when speaking with Carroll O'Connor,  who was in his "In the Heat of the Night" production offices in Georgia.  Carroll is one of the great men of television; his "All in the Family" has made  him practically immortal. And his present TV series, about a white Mississippi  sheriff who works hand-in-glove with a black detective, is a big hit. It boasts  wonderful writing and acting.  </P> <P> Carroll spoke in his usual cultured, measured and dispassionate manner. (He  doesn't sound a bit like Archie Bunker.) We spoke of the National Enquirer  story that said Carroll's co-star, Howard Rollins, had been fired from the show  by Carroll and that Rollins is suicidal.  </P> <P> O'Connor: "These papers are typical. They are so vile. They never bother to  verify anything with us because if they called, that would kill the story  they've made up. This is a pathogenic piece of journalism. It should be  sickening to the American people to have to read this thing.  </P> <P> "Howard has been sick. But we never felt he'd have to leave the show. We still  don't think so. We had the screen tests of the five other actors who tested  with Howard before the series began. We knew we could fall back on some of  them. And we'd reached the conclusion that if Howard was too ill to go on now,  we'd get someone on an option basis and he'd step out whenever Howard came  back.  </P> <P> "Now I may be the executive producer of this show, but I don't have the RIGHT  to fire anybody. And I never fired Howard, or asked that he be fired. He is  still under contract. Only the studio could let him go. So the paper lied when  they say he was fired . . . they lied when they say I fired him . . . they lied  when they quoted me as calling Howard 'a bad apple.' My wife and I love Howard;  we have been with him all the way in his recovery from drugs.  </P> <P> "We did five episodes of the show without Howard; writing him out to say he was  away on business. Anne Murray Johnson, who plays his wife, has been in these  episodes. I expect Howard to be back at work on Jan. 2. You know, at first I  thought I might sue the Enquirer for $20 million. Now I think we're going to  sue for $100 million!"  </P> <P> ROLLINS' AGENT, Michael Thomas of New York, says his client is going to  Baltimore to spend Christmas with his mother. He already sent her a honey-baked  ham from the South. "Howard sounds wonderful on the phone, and these reports  that he is 'suicidal' are just not true. He will report for work on Jan. 2. I'm  not a doctor, but I don't believe that Howard has tested HIV-positive for AIDS;  those tales are not true either."  </P></p>

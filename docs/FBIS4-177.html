			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Full Security Force Deployment Needed for Elections --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 29 March points out in a  page-8 editorial that "the chaos and bloodshed in the center of  Johannesburg is the last straw." "Regardless of who is  responsible for the tragedy, such lawlessness cannot be  tolerated. The decision by obscure so-called traditional Zulu  leaders to call a protest meeting in the city center at short  notice and without proper liaison with the police and other  interested parties was stupid and irresponsible...but that does  not give ANC members or whoever it was who fired on the marchers  from surrounding buildings the right to act in this manner."  "In the future, the government, together with the Transitional  Executive Council, must take firm action to prevent a repetition  of such events. A great responsibility also lies with political  leaders to discipline their supporters and stop unnecessary  shows of strength." "Peace-loving and law-abiding South  Africans -- and they are by far in the majority -- demand that  in the remaining weeks before the election the security forces  be deployed in their entirety in order to protect the democratic  process."    Threats by Nuclear Experts `Unforgivable Blackmail' --  "Certain experts who were involved in South Africa's nuclear  weapons program are now threatening to expose secret information  if they are not given good retrenchment packages. That is  unforgivable blackmail, and destroys any sympathy which they  could have received for losing their jobs," states a second  editorial on page 8 of BEELD. "South Africa's nuclear weapons  program was conducted mainly during the time when the country  was an outcast from the international community." "In normal  circumstances and with the wisdom of hindsight a different  course could have been followed, but that is now of purely  academic interest because the country wisely chose not to  proceed with the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Those who now  seek to strike gold through blackmail ought to be prosecuted."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Singling Out KwaZulu-Natal Questioned -- The Johannesburg  RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April comments in a page-20 editorial  on the state of emergency that was declared in kwaZulu-Natal,  saying that "serious questions remain unanswered. For example,  whether a `free and fair election' will be at all possible."  "But one of the most important questions remaining is why only  kwaZulu-Natal was singled out for such drastic action. This  week, the Johannesburg city center was the scene of events the  likes of which one sees regularly in the media reportage on  Sarajevo...but no state of emergency was declared." "Why have  other dangerous target areas been excluded?" "Is kwaZulu-Natal  more dangerous than Transkei, where it has long been suspected  that hit squads launch their attacks from? And where the  Transkei leader recently informed the National Party that they  can conduct their election campaign but only from inside armored  vehicles? This selectivity makes people wonder."    Election Approaching Amid Crises -- In her column on page 21  of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "`It is not easy to rule  a country in a transitional period like this.' True words,  spoken by the man who ought to know, President F. W. de Klerk,  in reply to a question about whether he is still in control."  "But that is putting it mildly. Since the start of the year  the government has had to deal with one crisis after another.  Just look at the Zulu march through central Johannesburg  earlier this week in the wake of the previous week; the crisis  involving the police generals and the Goldstone report; events  in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei; the prison uprising over the right  of prisoners to vote...." Aggravating the situation is the  question of where power lies -- with the Transitional Executive  Council or the government. The ANC "is so convinced of a  massive election victory that it behaves with limitless  self-confidence," which has created the "feeling among many that  a kind of vacuum has developed, with the old almost past but the  new not quite in place yet. It is as though everyone wants to  find a gap, challenge authority, strike, demand, march. Perhaps  that is why even the police generals last week used the  opportunity to growl back at the state president." "Should the  transition have been handled differently? No one can really  speak out on the matter one way or the other." Now "it is a  matter of pinching one's eyes shut and hoping it passes quickly.  There is no turning back."</p>

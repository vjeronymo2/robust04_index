			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rocio Galvan] </F>   [Text] Tijuana, B.C., 6 March--Today, the Office of the  Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] issued arrest warrants  against 16 persons, including the state's deputy prosecutor of  justice, an agent from the Public Prosecutor's Office, four of  the force's group chiefs, and a Municipal Public Safety  commander. They are implicated in the shooting on 3 March in  which Federal Judicial Police Commander Alejandro Castaneda  Andrade was killed.    At a press conference (postponed four times), the deputy  prosecutor for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera  Morales, was accompanied by the PGR's director of preliminary  investigations, Juan Alberto Carbajal. They announced that the  officials and State Judicial Police agents implicated had  protected the escape of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias "El  Mayel," who has taken control of the Arellano Felix brothers'  ring.    Based on the reconstruction of the incidents, the federal  agents were attacked to prevent them from discovering the  identity of an individual who was being watched, and to prevent  his capture.    The official added that 11 persons have already been  remanded, including the state's deputy prosecutor of justice,  Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the agent of the Public Prosecutor's  Office for the common jurisdiction, Juan Carlos Guerrero.    The others under arrest are Javier Arce Garcia, Pedro Muniz  Resendiz Flores, Gustavo Aguilar Villasenor, Humberto Iribe  Obeso, Jose Gallegos Astorga, and Juan Carlos Aguilar Renteria.  All are civilians, and assistants of members of the State  Judicial Police, who are accused of homicide, aggravated  injuries, breach of trust, gangsterism against authorized  agents, carrying firearms exclusively for Army use, and  usurpation of functions.    In the same legal circumstances but not yet under arrest are  Julio Cesar Guzman Castillo and Gilberto Vega Hernandez, drivers  of municipal patrol car 497, accused of injuries; Juan Jesus  Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police member; and the La  Mesa group chiefs, Mauricio Sanchez Zavala, Esteban Cebreros  Zavala, Jaime Valderrabano, and Julio Cesar J. Guzman; as well  as Municipal Public Safety Commander Antonio Cano.    They were remanded for abuse of authority, escape of  prisoners in a gang, and acts against the administration of  justice.    The state's attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, who was  cleared of all liability, remarked: "Just because there are bad  members of the force, there is no need to discredit everyone."    In the case of Juan Carlos Guerrero, it was specified that  he  had permitted inmates to escape when they were introduced to  him. However, it is not yet known who they were. As for Ortiz  Lara, he appeared with an armed group and argued with one of the  captives. He was taken away, and his whereabouts are as yet  unknown.    Ortiz Lara appeared before the authorities with amparo, 28  hours after having been summoned for the first time, and after  having received four additional summonses. As a result, he has  not been apprehended either.</p>

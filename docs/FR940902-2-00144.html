See Letter from Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated April 26, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In Amendment No. 2, the Phlx proposed to add Rule 1014(g)(i)(3) to codify that specialists are not eligible for the enhanced parity treatment proposed herein until they are no longer eligible for the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialist units pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. See Letter from William Uchimoto, First Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, dated August 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity, and as such shall be shared equally. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all currently listed ones are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange proposes to adopt, on a one year pilot basis, a proposed rule change providing that in certain circumstances and for certain options classes, a specialist will be eligible to receive an enhanced participation on parity equity options trades by being counted as two crowd participants (``Enhanced Parity Split''). The Enhanced Parity Split will only apply to transactions where the contra side order is for more than five contracts, and where the Enhanced Parity Split does not disadvantage a customer order that is also on parity. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange represents that one way to ensure that public customers are not disadvantaged is for a specialist to forego part or all of his second share of a trade. See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Enhanced Parity Split will apply to all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for 50% of each specialist unit's listed issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's registered issues will be divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The specialist will be able to choose half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen does not exceed 50% of the total number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this list to the Allocation, Evaluation and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This list, once submitted to and approved by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance with respect to the Enhanced Parity Split. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the ``Quality of Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance on a quarterly basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of the Enhanced Parity Split in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market maker in the trading crowd as measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') in that issue over the review period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

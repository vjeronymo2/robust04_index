			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA TRENDS: SACRAMENTO / BRADLEY INMAN;  </P> <P> PETE WILSON, HOUSING ISSUES GO WAY BACK  </P> <P> Pete Wilson isn't new to the housing issue.  </P> <P> In 1970, as a member of the California Assembly, Wilson was called into Gov.  Ronald Reagan's office and dressed down for his sponsorship of a major housing  finance bill.  </P> <P> Despite being asked to scrap his housing measure, Wilson shunned Reagan's  advice and pushedforward with the bill, which was later defeated under pressure  from the savings and loan lobby.  </P> <P> Wilson has had varied experiences with the housing subject, which offers  insight into what to expect from him if he is elected.  </P> <P> "His understanding really goes deep," said private consultant and Wilson  housing adviser Ward Connerly. He recalled a meeting Wilson hosted with several  housing experts in which the San Diego Republican "was briefing us on what was  going on in the housing market."  </P> <P> He knows the issue from several different angles and sometimes conflicting  perspectives.  </P> <P> As a state legislator, he was a controversial champion of the housing cause. As  mayor of San Diego, he pioneered growth management and was chastised as  "anti-housing" by the building industry.  </P> <P> In Sacramento as a lone housing voice in the Republican party, Wilson served as  chairman of the Assembly's Urban Affairs and Housing Committee and pushed for  more action at the state and local level on housing issues.  </P> <P> He wrote a bill that requires all municipalities to prepare local housing  plans. Wilson also pushed through legislation that said communities must  establish public housing authorities and another measure that required the  state to prepare statewide housing goals.  </P> <P> Upon returning to San Diego as mayor in 1972, Wilson got involved with housing  again -- not as its champion, however. He spearheaded one of the nation's first  growth management schemes, and he was dubbed an enemy of housing by the  building industry.  </P> <P> In his state-of-the-city address in 1972, Wilson said, "the city, rather than  the developer, will determine the timing and location of new development."  </P> <P> At the time, Wilson was careful to defend his growth management proposal as  sound fiscal policy. The city could not afford to extend city services to  far-flung areas where development was being proposed, according to the Wilson  growth management doctrine.  </P> <P> In turn, Wilson pushed for more intensive development in the city's downtown  core, where the infrastructure was already in place.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the housing industry had a fit. When Wilson pushed for a building  moratorium in an area of San Diego called Mira Mesa, a crowd of construction  workers picketed the San Diego City Council chambers.  </P> <P> "Let's not forget that San Diego had a huge moratorium on building under Wilson  and had the highest fees on housing in the state," said Barry Scherman, vice  president of the Hofmann Co,. a San Francsico Bay-area homebuilder and whose  senior officers have been supporting Feinstein.  </P> <P> It wasn't until 1980 that a watered-down version of the Wilson growth  management scheme was finally enacted.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the plan did not forestall development in San Diego. The  scheme called for an annual city growth rate of 9%, but the actual growth rate  was 11% by the time Wilson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1982.  </P> <P> Growth control activists were so displeased with the boom in development that  followed in later years that several ballot measures were proposed or approved  that attempted to slow the pace of growth further in the San Diego area.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the growth management history in San Diego is a fundamental part  of the Wilson legacy, as is his support for the California Coastal Protection  Act, his opposition to Proposition 13 and his legislation that created the  Governor's Office of Planning and Research, which established state guidelines  for growth.  </P> <P> But will growth and housing continue to be leading priorities if Wilson is  elected governor?  </P> <P> The Feinstein camp faults Wilson for not putting forth a detailed platform on  housing and growth, which some say may indicate that Wilson won't make either  issue a priority.  </P> <P> The candidate promises that one of his top three issues will be "quality of  life," which, according to Wilson's research director, Loren Kaye, embraces  both housing affordability problems and growth management.  </P> <P> "He understands the housing and growth issue and he's says that they are  priorities," Connerly said. "So I expect him to be an activist governor working  on these problems."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG) -- The chairman of the  Party of Serb Unity (SSJ), Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan, and the  deputy chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  Aleksey Ivanovich Videnkin, at a news conference today made  public an agreement on cooperation the two sides signed on 2  February. According to the agreement, the SSJ and the LDP will  establish economic, cultural, sports and, it was stressed,  military cooperation "in the event of the endangering of the  Serbian, Russian, or other Orthodox nations."    Raznjatovic stressed that cooperation between the two  parties  began when there were seven LDP members -- who are now in  prominent posts in this party -- with his volunteers in Krajina.    Videnkin told journalists that the LDP had given Arkan "a  secret electronic weapon" which is activated by "the fusion  [spajanje] of protons and neutrons at high temperature." He  pointed out that this weapon would be used if towns in Bosnia  and Serbia were bombed and added that "the world does not yet  know what force this weapon has." The LDP deputy chairman  specified that this weapon acts in such a way that "in a few  hours it can kill a person, without him knowing why he is  dying." According to him, this same lethal weapon could be  "used in small quantities and have a beneficial effect on  people." He explained that "the secret weapon" had not reached  the Serbian side through state channels, because neither the LDP  nor the SSJ are ruling parties.    A laboratory where experiments are carried out and the  professor who created the weapon, which, Videnkin said, was  tried out successfully near Brcko recently, were also made  available to Arkan. Asked where this weapon was, Raznjatovic  stressed that "neither the weapon, which arrived in the form of  a model, nor the laboratory, nor the professor, are on the  territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" and that the  Yugoslav authorities know nothing of this. Arkan stated that  this was a matter of a "weapon of peace," because it repels  attacks and that next time it would probably be tested in Cyprus.</p>

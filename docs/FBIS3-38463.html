			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F> Fini by Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "Bossi Does Not  Want Us Because He Is Scared" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- So how did your meeting with Berlusconi go?  Gianfranco Fini feigned surprise: "What meeting? There was no  meeting." There are strong rumors that the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] secretary and National Alliance coordinator took  advantage of Berlusconi's presence in Rome to meet with the  Forza Italia leader. "That is untrue. When we do have a  meeting with him, it will be official."    [Ventura] Very well. What is certain, however, is that  [Northern League Secretary] Bossi said: "Either with us or with  the fascists."    [Fini] That shows he is scared. He is very well aware that  his leadership will collapse if he reaches agreements with other  forces. I believe he is terrified of Berlusconi's involvement,  and he has sent him an ultimatum with the attitude of someone  who wants not to form an alliance but to carry out an annexation.    [Ventura] There is a preclusion against you.    [Fini] We asked Bossi to explain to us whether or not he  considers national unity a good thing. Not only has he not  replied, but he has not progressed beyond his anti-fascist  anathema; that is, a stance that not even the left identifies  with now.    [Ventura] There is less and less time in which to reach an  agreement.    [Fini] Bossi will realize this on 27 March. We will  certainly not remain passive. We will have our own candidates  in the north, and Bossi will realize that he does not enjoy  hegemony in the north at all. Obviously, he will not receive a  single vote in the center and south, which will inevitably  confine him to the role of a regional leader. For the present!  Because in a while he may not even be a leader in the north.    [Ventura] The compactness of the anti-left alliance is at  stake.    [Fini] Bossi is shouldering a huge responsibility, and is  doing so because he either cannot or will not resolve the real  issue. Which is not fascist ideology but national unity. I do  not believe that Berlusconi and the centrists are willing to be  treated like underlings in the north or to submit to vetoes in  the south.    [Ventura] What will you do, unless a miracle occurs?    [Fini] We will field candidates in all the single-candidate  constituencies throughout Italy. I will not form pacts, at  least not within a national political context; otherwise, I  would be lending strength to the League's theory of the two or  three Italy's.    [Ventura] Is it possible to imagine a pact with Berlusconi  but not with the League?    [Fini] Maybe, yes, if there is an agreement on programs. It  remains to be seen how Berlusconi will respond to the ultimatum.  Bossi is trying to play Russian roulette.    [Ventura] What about the agreement between Berlusconi and  the  neocentrists?    [Fini] I read the communique, and I consider the reference  to  the absence of preclusions a good thing: They have the feeling  that Bossi wants them to serve his interests in the north and to  consign them to defeat in the south.    [Ventura] Is it possible to resolve the split over whom to  put forward for the premiership?    [Fini] Bossi cannot say who it should be. If he accepts an  alliance, he is automatically placing himself in a subordinate  position with respect to whomever he may put forward. That  would be the beginning of his downfall. If he stops shouting  and starts reasoning, he will lose his support. For my part, I  am standing aside. I am not a candidate or even a potential  candidate. The only person capable of commanding support in the  north, and in the south, is Berlusconi. Not Bossi -- and not  only because of his language and behavior, but also because, as  I have said, he is a regional leader.    [Ventura] Could you name some of your candidates?    [Fini] I do not like this candidate game. It is much more  important to field candidates who are well established in their  own areas -- perhaps supported by trade, business, and  agricultural organizations -- than to field 20 outgoing deputies  of parties that no longer exist, or famous names that served as  enticements under the proportional system. I am not seeking  names for their own sake.    [Ventura] Has [world diving record holder] Enzo Majorca said  yes?    [Fini] I heard about Majorca through IL GIORNALE, I made  inquiries, and I was told that talks are going on.    [Ventura] Would you give us an election forecast    [Fini] I am very confident. Our success in Catania shows  that I am not deluding myself. If we project that result to the  level of the contest in the single-candidate constituencies, the  figures would secure victory for us in every constituency.  Catania is not Italy, but nevertheless....</p>

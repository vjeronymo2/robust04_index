			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Commercial Union issue declined by many firms COMMERCIAL Union, the UK insurance company, yesterday stirred controversy in the international bond market, launching a Pounds 100m issue in which leading sterling underwriting firms declined to participate. The deal was lead managed by Kleinwort Benson. It was the firm's first lead-management role in the mainstream of the Eurosterling bond market since August 1989. The 10 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 110 basis points more than UK government bonds of a comparable maturity, seen by many underwriting firms as insufficient to attract investors. Syndicate officials at rival firms said that a yield spread of 120 to 125 basis points was necessary to sell the bonds. In addition, the government bond market continued to trade lower yesterday following a full-point drop in prices on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed the day on a yield of 9.52 per cent, from 9.37 per cent Wednesday morning. As a result of these factors, many established sterling bond houses declined to participate in the deal. Cazenove, the stockbroker which also acts as broker for Commercial Union, agreed to be co-lead manager to the deal. Other participants were Commerzbank, DG Bank, Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley. The lead manager, which underwrote around 75 per cent of the issue, said that it found demand from a number of UK institutional investors. Although Commercial Union has not been hit by the property-related insurance claims which have damaged many of its rivals, all UK insurers are under financial pressure. This has discouraged overseas investors from buying insurance company bonds. At the close of trading, the lead manager said that the bonds were trading at 98 5/8 bid, having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.236. At this level the yield spread was 115 basis points more than UK government bonds. Elsewhere, activity was muted with no borrowers willing to launch large new issues ahead of US employment data released today. British Gas launched a Ecu200m two-year deal, lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation and targetted at retail investors. Banco Rio de la Plata, one of Argentina's top banks, launched its anticipated Dollars 100m three-year issue, lead managed by Merrill Lynch. Participants reported firm demand for the 9 1/8 per cent bonds, which were priced to yield 350 basis points more than US Treasury paper.</p>

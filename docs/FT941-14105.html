			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sphinx to acquire Swedish group Sphinx, the Netherlands-based producer of sanitary fittings and bathroom furniture, has agreed to acquire Gustavsberg, a Swedish manufacturer of showers and baths, in a move that will double the Dutch company's size and increase its product range. After the acquisition, which Sphinx described yesterday as a merger because the two companies plan to act as partners, the new group will have turnover of around Fl 800m (Dollars 410m), nearly twice as much as the Fl 425m in sales generated by Sphinx. Gustavsberg is being sold by Nordico, part of Sweden's KF supermarket group, for an undisclosed price. Sphinx, which said it might make a small share issue to raise money for the deal, also declined to give the purchase price but said the acquisition would contribute immediately to profit per share. Initial financing will come from a credit line from ABN-Amro Bank of the Netherlands and from Sphinx's internal cash flow. The two companies are largely complementary, with Gustavsberg particularly strong in showers and shower systems. These are products which Sphinx has, until now, had to buy in from outside suppliers. The new company, which is likely to be called Sphinx-Gustavsberg, will generate nearly one-third of its sales in the Benelux countries and another third in Germany. It will be based in Sphinx's home town of Maastricht.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 6 Apr--According to Waldemar Pawlak, in a  few years' time, Poland will be free to shape its future. It is  important, however, to "have the courage to fight for Poland's  position in Europe," the prime minister emphasized during a  meeting with trade counselors held in Rynia near Warsaw.    Polish trade counsellors from 28 European countries as well  as the United States and China are taking part in the meeting.    Cooperation within the "Partnership for Development" program  gives us a chance to develop economic cooperation abroad. We  should make efforts to achieve cooperation that is well balanced  within the region and open in all directions. He added that, in  the near future, information will be a strategic commodity in  trade and in economic activity.    Trade counselors' offices play a decisive role in the flow  of  information between Polish enterprises and their foreign  partners. Unfortunately, according to the prime minister, there  is no cohesive computer network to facilitate the flow of  information.</p>

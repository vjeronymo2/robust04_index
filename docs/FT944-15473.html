			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: New York puts new light on nationalisation - Richard Tomkins examines the arguments for the state's planned Dollars 2.5bn takeover of Lilco America, the land of free enterprise, is surely the last place anyone would expect to find the public sector proposing to nationalise a stock-market quoted company. That, however, is precisely what the State of New York intends to do with its planned Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of the Long Island Lighting Company, a private sector electricity company known to its customers as Lilco. Thumbing its nose at the world-wide trend towards privatisation, New York state has asked the company to enter immediate negotiations on its proposed cash offer of Dollars 21.50 a share. Lilco's board says it is 'seriously evaluating' the offer: but it seems quite possible the company and its shareholders will accept. Why do it? Lilco, which generates and distributes power in the counties of Nassau, Suffolk and a portion of Queens, is not in imminent danger of collapse. But it is extremely unpopular with its customers because it charges the highest electricity prices in the US - 16.1 cents per kWh for residential customers, almost double the national average of 8.7 cents. Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says that taking Lilco into public ownership would cut electricity bills by an immediate 10 per cent because the company would no longer have to pay tax or shareholders' dividends. The result would be a lot of happy voters when Mr Cuomo is fighting a tough re-election battle. Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, believes the financial case stacks up. The arithmetic goes like this. At present, US electricity companies need to deliver an annual rate of return of 11 per cent on equity to attract investors. For Lilco, the cost in shareholder dividends works at about Dollars 250m after tax. That means it has to earn Dollars 400m before tax to deliver a satisfactory rate of remuneration. Now contrast the case if the company were taken into public ownership. The takeover would be financed through a Dollars 2.5bn issue of tax-exempt revenue bonds. Holders of these would require an interest rate only 7 per cent because they would not have to pay tax on the income, so the after-tax cost of servicing the debt would be only Dollars 175m. And because a government-owned Lilco would not be liable for taxation, the figure would be Dollars 175m before tax, too. The saving to Lilco would therefore be the difference between Dollars 400m and Dollars 175m: that is, Dollars 225m. Based on Lilco's present annual revenues of Dollars 2.35bn, that would allow for an immediate cut in electricity prices of just under 10 per cent. The logic is seductive. But if valid, could not the same case be made for nationalising every other private sector utility in the US? Mr Irwin Stelzer, director of regulatory policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market think-tank, points out there are flaws in the argument. One is that a public sector company is unlikely to be better managed than a private sector one. Another is that Lilco's tax-exempt status will simply transfer costs from its customers to federal taxpayers. A third is that the bond issue will further extend New York state's indebtedness, leaving it less room to borrow for other purposes. A better way of reducing electricity bills, according to Mr Stelzer, would be to allow other power companies to supply cheap electricity to Lilco's customers through Lilco's wires. 'The solution to high-cost power is competition, not state monopolies,' Mr Stelzer says. In fact, some of Lilco's most pressing problems relate to the threat of competition. Between 1973 and 1984, the company spent Dollars 5.5bn on constructing a nuclear power station which was never used. Now it has to charge high prices to service the debt it incurred - but it can only do so because it enjoys a monopoly. That could change. The regulatory environment for electricity companies is shifting, and Lilco is under increasing pressure to let its customers shop around for power. Once that starts to happen, Lilco will need to charge even higher prices to maintain revenues from a smaller customer base, leading to a spiral of decline. Such fears have done little for Lilco's share price: it has generally been heading downwards for more than a year. From that point of view, a takeover by New York state might come as a relief. But the market yesterday looked reluctant to gamble that Mr Cuomo would be re-elected to pursue it. Lilco's shares closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 3/8, well below the Dollars 21.50 offer price.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Pretoria and ANC edge closer over interim rule THE South African government and the African National Congress have moved closer to setting up an interim government for the transition to post-apartheid democracy, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. The ANC yesterday released proposals on the interim administration, which showed growing convergence with those of the Pretoria government, although officials warned there were still many stumbling blocks to early agreement. The ANC wants an all-party Interim Government Council to oversee multi-racial elections and to supervise the security forces, the public media and the budget. This body, which would be appointed by the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - the multi-party conference which is currently discussing constitutional issues - could also take on additional powers 'considered necessary for proper government'. The ANC also proposed that what it calls a 'constituent assembly' should both draw up a post-apartheid constitution and act as a legislature in the interim period. This proposal parallels that of the government, which proposes that an elected interim parliament draw up a constitution. Where they differ is on the way such a body would be constituted. The ANC insists that it be elected on the basis of one-man, one-vote, while the government says this would provide insufficient protection for minorities.</p>

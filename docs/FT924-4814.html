			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Greek budget aims to narrow gap with Community partners Mr Stefanos Manos, the Greek economy minister, yesterday proposed an austerity budget for 1993, aimed at narrowing the economic gap with the rest of the European Community, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The budget projects a primary surplus of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product but calls for heavily increased spending on interest payments to service the public debt. As a result the central government borrowing requirement will remain at around 7.9 per cent of GDP for another year. Growth in 1993 is forecast at 2 per cent, while year-on-year inflation should come down from 15.5 to 12.3 per cent, making it possible for Greece to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism early in 1994. No new taxes were announced but fiscal revenues are expected to rise by 25.3 per cent after a crackdown on tax evasion based on IMF recommendations. Income of Dr330bn (Pounds 1.04bn) is forecast from privatisation, including the planned sale of 49 per cent of the state telecoms company early next year.</p>

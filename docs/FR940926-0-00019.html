			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule changes paragraph 220.8(c) by replacing the current twelve billing categories with a billing method based on diagnostic related groups (DRGs), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3). The DRG-based method for determining reasonable costs of inpatient care will produce more accurate and equitable billings. Billings will more accurately reflect the costs associated with the actual services provided. This rule models the DRG-based cost methodology, the basis for the DRG-based payment system for hospital care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). However, in some respects, this rule simplifies CHAMPUS methods, with authority to introduce the additional refinements at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, initially this rule uses a single national standardized amount, rather than the three standardized amounts (large urban, other urban, and rural) used by CHAMPUS. The three amounts do not differ significantly and are probably not as relevant in connection with a unified federal hospital system, such as DoD's. However, the rule allows us to adopt the multiple standardized amounts at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standardized amount is the result of dividing total system-wide costs of inpatient care by the total number of discharges system-wide. With respect to DRG relative weights, this rule uses the same weights as are used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method. The CHAMPUS weights were calculated from a data base of actual CHAMPUS claims filed by civilian hospitals. Because the patient population under military treatment facilities and CHAMPUS are quite similar, we believe it is appropriate to use the same weights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method uses a number of adjustments to the product of standardized amount multiplied by the relative weight of the appropriate DRG. The adjustments relate to outlier cases, area wage differences and indirect medical education. Initially, this rule does not use these adjustments, but allows all related costs to be reflected in the standardized amount. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and predictability for payers. However, the final rule allows these adjustments to be introduced at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with current practice, the standard DRG-based rate is divided into two categories: Hospital charges, which includes ancillary charges, and Professional charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date for implementation of a multiple rate schedule will be the effective date of this rule, barring unforeseen difficulties in automation support. The specific rates will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Outpatient Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with the inpatient rates, the outpatient rates are based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). MEPRS is the standard expense reporting system for all fixed medical treatment facilities (MTFs) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and is the accepted source of healthcare information for Congress and offices and agencies of the Executive Branch. The reimbursement categories are selected based on board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rates are established but need not be limited to each of the following clinical reimbursement categories: Internal Medicine, Allergy, Cardiology, Diabetic, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Hypertension, Nephrology, Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Pulmonary Disease, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Infectious Disease, Physical Medicine, General Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Organ Transplant, Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Proctology, Urology, Pediatric Surgery, Family Planning, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Adolescent Pediatrics, Well Baby, Orthopaedics, Cast, Orthotic Laboratory, Hand Surgery, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Child Guidance, Mental Health, Social Work, Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Family Practice, and Occupational and Physical Therapy. This rule does not necessarily establish a separate rate for each of these clinical reimbursement categories. Similar categories may be combined for purposes of billing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another revision to section 220.8 involves the expansion of a single outpatient rate to multiple reimbursement category rates similar to that for inpatient care. The Department of Defense adopts a methodology for computing rates for outpatient care similar to that used for computing multiple rates for inpatient care. Thus, collections for most outpatient services will be based on a standard per visit fee to a specialty/subspecialty which is representative of the average cost in facilities of the Uniformed Services of an outpatient visit to that specialty clinic. Multiple outpatient visits on the same day to different clinics will result in one charge for each clinic visit. Multiple visits on the same day to the same clinic will result in only one charge. As a general rule, each standard per visit amount to the specialty/subspecialty clinic will be all-inclusive. No additional charge will be made for routine laboratory, radiology, pharmacy or other ancillary or overhead services provided in conjunction with an outpatient visit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although most outpatient services will be billed based on the standard per visit fee for a specialty/subspecialty, there are several special rules for particular types of care. One special rule is that a separate charge for same day/ambulatory surgery will be published annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date of the expanded number of billing categories is targeted for October 1, 1994. The specific rates will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Miscellaneous Healthcare Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Initial implementation of the Third Party Collection Program was somewhat limited in scope and concentrated on inpatient and ambulatory care areas. This final rule expands the program to include outpatient services which may not traditionally be provided in hospitals or which are not traditional clinical specialties or subspecialties. This includes, but is not limited to, ambulance service, hyperbaric treatments, dental care services and immunizations. We intend to recover the cost of these services to the extent they are generally applicable coverage provisions of a third party payer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We intend to recover the cost of ambulance service which includes the cost of providing emergency aid and then transportation of beneficiaries to a medical treatment facility. It would also include the transport of patients to other medical facilities or to specialized clinics for diagnostic or therapeutic services which is frequently necessary. We intend to recover costs on the basis of the length of time the ambulance is in service with one hour to be the minimum amount billed. The reimbursement rates for ambulance care will only cover the costs of operating the vehicle, including labor costs (driver and attendant), supplies, fuel, and overhead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Recession claims record failures Japanese corporate failures fell in number last year, but collapses specifically linked to the recession hit a record high, said a leading credit research agency. Corporate failures provoked by falling sales, heavy debts or bad loans, rose to a record 8,543 cases in 1993 or nearly 61 per cent of the year's total of 14,041 bankruptcies, according to Teikoku Databank. The overall total showed a 0.9 per cent decline on 1992, the first drop for three years, an indication that Japan might be near the bottom of its recession. Among last year's most prominent collapses were Muramoto Construction, which became the country's largest post-war corporate failure with debts of Y590bn (Pounds 3.5bn); Nikkatsu, a film producer; and KYC Machine Industry, a maker of construction equipment. Despite these high-profile collapses, the number of failures with liabilities of more than Y100bn fell from 10 in 1992 to six last year. Construction was worst hit sector with 2,868 failures, followed by manufacturing industry with 2,591. Another sign that the worst might be nearly over came with a 23 per cent year-on-year rise in private sector orders of machinery in November, reported by the government's Economic Planning Agency. Machinery orders are a bell-weather of corporate capital spending in the six to nine months ahead, but the November rise is only a partial recovery from the record 31.1 per cent drop in the previous month. Further recovery in December might indicate a real improvement, said the EPA. However, industrial production continued to be sluggish this month, the EPA warned in its latest survey yesterday.</p>

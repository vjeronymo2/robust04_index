			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Gilles Campion] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--China and France marked the  30th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties Thursday with an  acknowledgement of recent difficulties in the relationship and a  promise to improve it.    A simple ceremony at the French embassy here recalled the  January 27, 1964 decision of president Charles de Gaulle to  exchange ambassadors with Mao Zedong's government, making France  the first major Western power to establish full diplomatic  relations with communist China.    A French delegation consisting of various dignitaries  including de Gaulle's son, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, was on  hand.    The ceremony came ahead of an official visit here by French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur expected within the next few  months.    The visit is planned to give impetus to the reconciliation  between the two countries agreed to in a January 12 communique  which ended a year-long freeze in the relationship.    At the embassy, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei  admitted to "vicissitudes" in Franco-Sino ties, a reference to  Beijing's closing of the French consulate in Guangzhou after  France's late 1992 sale of 60 jet fighters to Taiwan.    The normalisation of ties -- making French firms eligible to  compete again for major contracts in China's booming econmy --  required Paris to agree in the communique to make no further  arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade  province of the mainland.    With the communique, Tian said, France and China had decided  to "open a new page and a new phase of development" in their  relationship.    Tian said he was "convinced that relations between the two  countries were going to develop even more in all domains."    The head of the French delegation, MP Alain Peyrefitte, said  "the clouds that had accumulated in recent years have now  dissipated.    Peyrefitte, who was a Gaullist minister 30 years ago, agreed  with Tian that the decision taken by de Gaulle and Mao had been  "historic," and unveiled a plaque to commemorate it.    Later Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's official  spokesman echoed the hope that China and France would enjoy a  closer relationship in future, while subtly putting Paris on  notice that Beijing expects it to stick to its commitment to  refrain from any future arms sales to cash-rich Taiwan.    "We are convinced that so long as the two sides strictly  abide by the principles for the establishment of diplomatic  relations and other relevant principles enshrined in the joint  communique, bilateral relations are very promising," spokesman  Wu Jianmin told reporters.    The French delegation, which also includes French officials  with a special interest in China and a former French ambassador  here, was scheduled to meet Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen on Thursday evening.</p>

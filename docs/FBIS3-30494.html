			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT 4 February within its  regular 17-minute newscast carries the following reports on the  situation in Sarajevo. According to a communique from the  Information Service of the 1st Corps of the Army of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina read by an announcer, "a calm morning in  the Sarajevo region was interrupted by enemy artillery shells  that ended their lethal flight in the region of Dobrinja. The  aggressor fired them from the region of Vranjes. They were 82-mm  mortar bombs. There were three bombs and Sarajevo has thereby  added one more massacre to its list. The victims of this one  are innocent civilians."    Jasna Niksic then reports live from Dobrinja that "so far  seven people have been killed and 17 injured, of whom four are  extremely seriously wounded and have been taken to the City  Hospital. This is the balance of the morning Chetnik shelling  in the Sarajevo Dobrinja district. Namely, the morning was  extremely calm, but this calm was interrupted by two Chetnik  shells that suddenly fell on Dobrinja One as civilians gathered  to divide humanitarian aid. This is all the information we have  now. We shall report with more details in our next newscasts."</p>

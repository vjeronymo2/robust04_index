			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Budget consensus boosts Nikkei to another peak REPORTS that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had reached a consensus over the size of the supplementary budget at the weekend boosted activity, and the Nikkei average closed at a new high for the year in heavy volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose by 312.52, or 1.6 per cent, to 19,759.46. It saw a day's low of 19,357.90 on profit-taking by domestic institutional investors, but active buying by foreigners and individuals pushed it up in the afternoon to peak at 19,820.60. Volume totalled 1.2bn shares against 1.5bn. Advances led declines by 778 to 329, with 71 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 25.04 to 1,551.35, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.34 to 1,209.38. Strong buying by foreign and individual investors lifted laggard stocks but domestic institutions, such as insurance companies, maintained a cautious stance. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, investment strategist at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, said: 'It is a mini-bubble caused by low interest rates.' He predicted that, although the index could rise above the 20,000 level, most conservative Japanese investors will remain on the sidelines. Meanwhile, the proposed amount of the upcoming supplementary package encouraged investors. The LDP is pushing for a Y13,000bn fiscal package, which includes Y9,000bn in public spending, Y2,000bn in social infrastructure, and Y2,000bn in additional lending to home buyers and small businesses. Construction companies were higher on a move to public works-related stocks. Obayashi rose Y80 to Y717 and Taisei Y81 to Y799. The brokerage sector was the top gainer of the day, appreciating 5.97 per cent. Nomura Securities advanced Y60 to Y2,250 and Nikko Securities Y110 to Y1,120. Stocks which had led the recent rally took a breather. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved in a narrow range and closed unchanged at Y1m, while Tokyo Electric Power fell Y79 to Y4,100 and Tokyo Gas lost Y1 to Y592. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, was unmoved at Y405. The higher yen was ignored by investors and exporters closed firmer. The dollar finished Y0.17 down against the yen at Y113.83. Hitachi added Y44 at Y890 and Toyota Motor Y50 at Y1,560. In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 355.41 to 21,426.29 in volume of 42.6m shares. Roundup THE REGION offered little reaction to Wall Street's tumble last Friday. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Seoul and Bombay were closed for public holidays. MANILA rose by 2.3 per cent, lifted by a new law granting Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippines president, special powers to solve the severe energy shortage. The composite index closed 35.10 up at 1,515.40 as combined turnover expanded from 336.34m pesos to 540.34m. Public utility Manila Electric reflected the news, the 'B' shares rising 17.50 pesos, or 5.7 per cent, to 322.50. KUALA LUMPUR reported frenzied speculative buying, with volume hitting a new high of 884.13m shares, up from a previous peak of 547.32m last Friday, but afternoon profit-taking trimmed share price gains and the KLSE composite index ended just 4.68 ahead at 656.13. Activity focused on finance stock Idris Hydraulic, which surged to a high of MDollars 2.31 before finishing at MDollars 2.01, up 43 cents from Friday's close. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index posted a new closing high for the second straight session, ending 12.66 stronger at 1,700.82. Turnover was heavy at SDollars 508.23m. There were useful gains in domestic blue chips and institutional demand for big local banks, and government-linked blue chips such as Keppel and NatSteel were also strong. AUSTRALIA shrugged off the worst effect of Friday's Wall Street drop, brokers giving credit to good sentiment in Asia. The All Ordinaries index slipped 13.0 to 1,670.1 in turnover of ADollars 278.8m. Tobacco shares weakened following Philip Morris's US announcement of steep discounting in its Marlboro brand. Philip Morris shed ADollars 15 to ADollars 100, Rothmans 20 cents to ADollars 5.50 and WD and HO Wills 10 cents to ADollars 2.35. CRA declined 16 cents to ADollars 13.24, while Coal &amp; Allied dipped 8 cents to ADollars 11.40 after the Tokyo-based Ube Industries, the second largest shareholder in Coal &amp; Allied with an 11 per cent stake, said it will reject CRA's ADollars 11.50 per share offer. NEW ZEALAND recovered from a 17-point fall to close a net 3.95 off at 1,562.74, mostly due to strength in leading forestry shares. A rise in Fletcher Challenge from a session's low of NZDollars 2.50 to close at NZDollars 2.54, and a 4-cent gain in Carter Holt Harvey to NZDollars 2.88 contributed to the recovery. Volume was a moderate NZDollars 20.5m.</p>

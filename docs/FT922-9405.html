			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Curtain falls on a Hollywood drama - Credit Lyonnais's ill-starred association with Giancarlo Parretti Shortly after 10 o'clock this morning, in the nondescript town of Wilmington, Delaware, the banging of an auctioneer's gavel should signal a most ignominious fate for MGM, the once legendary Hollywood studio. The auction is mainly a formality - the mechanism by which Credit Lyonnais of France forecloses on a huge loan default and takes possession of MGM stock by swapping around Dollars 400m of loans for 98.5 per cent of the studio's shares. In theory, anyone hoping to outbid the French state bank creditor and buy MGM could come along this morning with at least Dollars 570m of cash in hand  -Dollars 400m for the shares and another Dollars 170m for related loan commitments. But MGM suffered a Dollars 347m loss last year, and will need a further Dollars 200m of cash to make it through the current year. It's no bargain. Rather, the foreclosure by Credit Lyonnais is intended as the definitive severing of ties between the Paris-based bank and Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier from whom the shares are being taken away. The mercurial Mr Parretti, who is still appealing a four-year jail sentence in Naples on fraud charges, refuses to accept defeat. As recently as this week he claimed he would win out over Credit Lyonnais, but as far as the bank is concerned, a recent US injunction has rendered Mr Parretti more of a nuisance than a threat. Worse, from Credit Lyonnais's point of view, the ill-starred association with the stocky former waiter has shocked many of its blue-chip clients and investors and is costing the bank dearly. The doubling of its 1991 bad debt provisions, to FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.71bn), is believed to have included part of the MGM exposure. According to information obtained by the Financial Times, Credit Lyonnais's present loan exposure to MGM and to Mr Parretti's various companies amounts to Dollars 1.25bn. MGM was suffering long before November 1990, when Mr Parretti paid Dollars 1.3bn - most of it borrowed from Credit Lyonnais  - to acquire the studio. The studio's difficulties were the result of the juggling of assets and repeated sacking of executives by Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the Las Vegas nightclub owner who had owned MGM since 1969. When Mr Parretti bought MGM, he had as a partial backer, Mr Steve Ross, the fast-talking chairman of Time Warner who promised Dollars 650m of loan guarantees in exchange for right to the MGM film library. Within months Time Warner claimed it had been betrayed and sued Mr Parretti for breach of contract. In yet another reversal, Time Warner then decided to make peace and do business again with Mr Parretti. Mr Ross and Time Warner have come under harsh criticism for the association with Mr Parretti, but they got a home video distribution deal on the cheap. From the very start most of Wall Street and Hollywood were betting Mr Parretti would not last very long at MGM, and rightly so. By March 1991 - just four months after Mr Parretti took over the desk once owned by Louis B. Mayer - a group of MGM unpaid creditors sued to force the studio into bankruptcy. Credit Lyonnais, alarmed at the deteriorating state of affairs, sent two top executives to Hollywood, provided MGM with an emergency Dollars 145m fresh line of credit and insisted as a condition that Mr Parretti give up his position at Pathe, his master company, and at MGM. In his place as chairman Mr Parretti put Mr Cesare De Michelis, the brother of his old friend and fellow nightclub habitue Mr Gianni De Michelis, Italy's Socialist foreign minister. Mr De Michelis lasted less than a month before Mr Parretti and the French bank began to sue one another. By the summer of 1991 the legal battle between Credit Lyonnais and Mr Parretti had degenerated into a slanging match. Lawsuits flew back and forth in America. By late December 1991 the chancery court in Delaware, where MGM is incorporated, had thrown out all of Mr Parretti's claims and upheld the right of Credit Lyonnais to remove him and his associates. Mr William Allen, the presiding judge, even declared that Mr Parretti 'did not give truthful testimony when he testified under oath in this court'. Mr Parretti could not be in Delaware to hear the verdict; he spent late December in a Sicilian jail, accused of tax evasion. Down, but not forgotten, the controversial Italian returned to the fray two months ago, claiming that a Rome judge had ordered the sequester of MGM stock and once again named the brother of Italy's foreign minister as MGM chairman. It was at this stage that Credit Lyonnais secured the binding Delaware injunction that ruled any Rome judge's views to be irrelevant under US law. With today's foreclosure auction, Credit Lyonnais is seeking to sever all ties to Mr Parretti. True to form, Mr Parretti yesterday told the Financial Times he considered the auction to be 'phony' and swore once again that Mr De Michelis would be named to MGM. The voluble Italian even argued he was not really in default on his loans from Credit Lyonnais. 'How can I be in default? They never really asked me to pay interest,' he maintained. Asked how much he had borrowed from the French bank, Mr Parretti then claimed: 'I can't remember.' Mr Parretti may not recall, but the amounts are considerable. It has been learned that the Dollars 1.25bn total of Credit Lyonnais loan exposure includes nearly Dollars 650m of loans to MGM itself, plus another Dollars 595m to three of Mr Parretti's holding companies - Comfinance, Melia and Pathe Communications. Credit Lyonnais is owed some Dollars 75m by Comfinance, a company that jointly controls MGM by way of two other vehicles - Melia and Pathe. Melia owes some Dollars 400m, including interest, while Pathe, owes Dollars 120m, including interest. Although Credit Lyonnais will convert about Dollars 400m of these loans into equity as payment in today's auction, the bank will still be left with Dollars 850m of combined MGM and Parretti-company debt on its books. The bank does not expect to be able to sell MGM until the shattered studio can begin producing profitable films, and that is likely to take at least another two years. Internal bank plans call for financial support of at least Dollars 200m this year, and probably as much again in 1993. That means that by early 1994, assuming MGM is profitable and saleable again  -a big if in itself  - Credit Lyonnais will be sitting on a total outlay of more than Dollars 1.2bn again. Put simply, Credit Lyonnais is likely to be stuck in Hollywood, with heavy loan exposure and a battered and loss-making studio on its hands, for quite some time. Today's auction thus may represent a new beginning for MGM, but at blockbuster cost.</p>

Announcing this on Wednesday, the African National Congress  said its members and those of the mass democratic movement had  nominated Dr Chikane out of recognition for the contribution he  had made in working for a just and non-racial society. However,  because of his appointment as a member of the Independent  Elections Commission he was not eligible to stand election.    The ANC and Dr Chikane had agreed that his name would be  removed with immediate effect from all nominations lists, either  for the National Assembly or for any of the provincial  parliaments, the statement said.</p>

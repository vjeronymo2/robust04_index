			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 2, IRNA -- The recent maneuvers of  Britain and its imaginary claims of Iran's links with the Irish  Republican Army (IRA), perhaps more than anything else indicates  the problem with the government in London is afflicted in  relation to Northern Ireland.    The British Government, in order to divert public attention  from its failure to settle the Northern Ireland issue, does not  refuse to engage in any trick and propaganda artifice in and  outside Britain.    A glance at the past history of clashes in Ireland has  symptoms of the defeat of British policies, both military and  political, in this region and the continuous notoriety earned by  responsible persons in England.    The shooting of any person suspected of terrorist operations  is one sample of these policies. Perhaps the most conspicuous  sample of British policy was the killing of three Irishmen  suspected of membership in IRA in Gibraltar by British security  forces in 1988.    After killing them, the British police found out that the  three Irishmen were not busy laying bombs as suspected but in  fact had no weapons with themselves.    The accident caused the families of the three murdered  persons to file a complaint at European courts against the  British Government for trampling on the second paragraph of the  human rights convention of Europe.    The British Government does not have a good record at the  European courts and since 1950, of the 52 files presented  against Britain, the country has been condemned in 30 cases.    On the other hand in the opinion of many non-aligned  observers the government of Britain has itself been one of the  main causes of political chaos and violent actions in Northern  Ireland. The secret researches performed by the government have  also proved this true.    For example, the daily 'INDEPENDENT' last June disclosed  certain aspects of these secret researches which portrayed the  depth of discrimination against those Catholics of Northern  Ireland who want independence from British colonialism.    On the basis of this report London's political-military  control of Northern Ireland, has over the past 20 years led to  gross inequality and the strengthening of the Protestants who  support prolongation of British rule.    Statistical comparison between the two societies of Northern  Ireland indicate high level of unemployment among Catholics at a  rate that is twice as much as Protestants, in addition to  striking differences in housing, hygiene, and education among  the two groups.    In the opinion of the writers of this report, this is the  direct result of the deliberate policies of London for enacting  discrimination against those who want an end to its presence in  the northern part of Ireland.    On the other hand despite the claims of the British  Government for stopping clashes and armed encounters among the  two groups in Northern Ireland, the statistics of those killed  in these incidents indicate another bitter truth.    Statistics show that for the past seven years until 1993  about 220 Protestants were killed by the republicans. This is  while over the same period 368 republican Catholics were killed  by armed groups who are advocates of English rule.    The British Government while showing itself inclined to  peace  to end the bloody clashes in Ireland has in fact, on many an  occasion entered into coalition with rightist parties that are  opposed to negotiations with the Catholics, and has considered  many concessions for the Protestants in controlling Northern  Ireland.    For instance, British Prime Minister John Major late last  summer, in order to benefit from the support of the extremist  Irish Protestant parties in the parliament and specifically the  Ulster Unionists Workers Party, granted them many privileges  including the establishment of a special selection committee in  parliament.    This issue at that time caused independent observers to  raise  objections and voice concern over the grave results of this  political give-and-take and the probable invalidity of the  present political agreements between England and the Republic of  Ireland in connection with the future of Northern Ireland.    According to observers consider the only probable way for  creating a stable peace in Northern Ireland is for the British  Government to stop its discriminative policies against Catholics  and participate in direct negotiations to be attended by all  sides involved [sentence as received].    London for various reasons has thus far evaded this issue  and  occasionally by bringing up diversions and imaginary claims has  tried to mislead public opinion in and outside the country  especially among the powerful Irish community in the United  States.    Last year, too, an independent committee for investigating  the problem of Northern Ireland named UPSAL had said that any  peace agreement in relation to Northern Ireland without  considering the Catholics and Protestants as equals and with  equal rights for declaring their positions was doomed to fail.</p>

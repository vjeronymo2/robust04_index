			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mainz (DDP/ADN) -- According to the Association of  Democratic Doctors (VDAA), Turkish authorities have probably  taken 150 election monitors from Germany into custody in the  Kurdish town of Batman. The VDAA stated today in Mainz that the  representatives from political and medical, as well as human  rights organizations are no longer able to move freely and  contact their offices in Germany. The situation faced by  election monitors in the towns of Van and Diyarbakir appears the  same, they said. The detained Germans had traveled to Turkey to  follow the local elections in the Kurdish area of the country.  In view of the behavior of Turkish police, the VDAA fears for  the physical and mental well-being of the election monitors and  in particular the Turkish interpreters.    Alliance 90/Greens MP Angelika Beer reported from Diyabakir  today that groups of monitors had been detained and forced to  return, after being threatened with weapons in some cases. For  example, after they had been taken back from the town of Cizre  to Diyabakir, the Turkish Air Force had bombarded a village near  Cizre. In the process 14 people had been killed she said.</p>

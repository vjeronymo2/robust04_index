			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Union threat of strikes on Tube LONDON Underground may suffer industrial action after a vote in favour of a strike by members of RMT, the transport union. The threatened action is over the loss of 5,000 jobs from the the 21,000 workforce. Changes in grading structures and working practices are also planned. London Underground said that the job losses will be phased over three years and there will be no compulsory redundancies. No date will be set for the action until the union has had a response from management, RMT said yesterday. One-day stoppages are more likely than an indefinite strike. The 11,000 RMT members at London Underground voted two to one in favour of a strike in a 65 per cent ballot turnout. London Underground said its message for the union was to 'stop posturing and start negotiating'. The restructuring would go ahead regardless, it added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Northwest estimates a construction cost of $3,118,100, which would be installed and paid for pursuant to a facilities agreement with DA and the facilities reimbursement provisions of Northwest's tariff. Northwest estimates the net present value of the future revenues projected to be generated as a result of the proposed facilities of $4.6 million which would exceed the incremental cost of service of approximately $2.9 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest states that no significant impact on its system peak day deliveries is projected to result from the installation of the proposed facilities. It is indicated that, because DA elected to extend its existing firm transportation agreements with Northwest, the existing firm contract delivery obligations would remain the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : April 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

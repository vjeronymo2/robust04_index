			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "French Develop Materials With </F> Several Properties"]    [Text] Frankfurt. Every material has some characteristic  physical properties. According to recent research performed by  French material scientists, it will be possible in future to  plan materials so that they possess several properties which can  be built into them in a deliberate and controlled way. Thus it  will be possible in a single material to combine magnetic  properties with specific non-linear optical properties which do  not occur in nature and which it has hitherto been impossible to  produce. The basic principles for the production of such new  materials were discovered and investigated at the Laboratoire de  Chimie Inorganique of the French Universite Paris Sud.    In the view of the French scientists, the combinatorial  possibilities are unlimited, and this means that it will in  future be possible to go about creating completely new materials  on the basis of requirement profiles. One of the first such  materials they were able to obtain was crystallizing compounds  which combine a very high magnetic value with the capacity to  double the oscillation of light frequencies, that is, to produce  light oscillations of the second upper harmonic oscillation in  passing through the layers. At the same time the material  possesses permanent magnetic properties.    The combination of these two important properties is brought  about by deliberate construction of interconnected molecular  structures, of which one component is responsible for the  magnetic properties and another for the non-linear optical  properties.    But in order to achieve this, the atomic lattices of the  individual components must be made to interconnect. In the  process, the structure of an inorganic compound determines the  alignment and the intercalation of an organic compound. The  developers say that the design gives rise to interconnected  hybrid compounds which consist of both organic and inorganic  molecules.    For continuing experiments the scientists are using "DAMS,"  short for dimethyl amino-N-methyl stilbazoline, as an organic  compound. Because of its structure, it possesses non-linear  optical properties if there is no domain formation with symmetry  centers in the dipolar-type compound. In order to prevent this,  these organic, color-bearing molecules are combined as  chromophores with cations of a manganese salt and anions from  phosphide sulfide. In the process a complex hybrid compound  arises (MnO.86S3(DAMS)0.26), whose inorganic components take  care of the incorporation of the organic molecules in the  requisite interstitial structure, and thus causes the molecular  orientation for the optical behavior.    The new material created is permanently magnetic up to a  temperature of 40 K and doubles incident laser light over a  relatively wide frequency range. The new material is available  in crystalline form, but at the moment the question of whether  it can be drawn out into thin films for frequency filters, for  example, or applied to glass substrates in a few atomic layers,  has not yet been thoroughly investigated.    The scientists are consciously refraining from investigating  any practical applications more thoroughly yet, preferring to  research the principles according to which the formation of such  combinations of properties must proceed. For if these rules are  known, a very large number of coumpounds can be synthesized  which unite several properties, perhaps even opposing ones.    In some ways this method of synthesis may represent a  complement to the sol-gel procedure which is commonly used today  to build up new compounds from nanometer-sized components. In  comparison with materials currently in use, which are designed  to optimize a single property, the developers speak of a new  generation of "two-dimensional" materials. If more than two  properties can be combined in a material, "multidimensional"  materials are also theoretically possible.

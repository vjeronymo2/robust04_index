National Bank Chairman  Stanislaw Bahdankevich pointed out at a news conference that the  National Bank and the Council of Ministers had drafted a joint  resolution suggesting that the main directions of the  monetary-credit policy be adopted; the National Bank's payment  bill be proclaimed the only legal tender on Belarusian territory  for the period preceding the final merging of the Russian and  Belarusian monetary systems; the National Bank's motion on  commercial banks be confirmed. The motion envisions that  commercial banks earmark at least 13 percent of their credit  capital for the implementation of promising investment projects.    However, this draft along with other proposals by some  people's deputies was rejected by the Supreme Soviet.[passage  omitted]</p>

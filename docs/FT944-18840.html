			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fininvest forecasts debt cut Heavily-indebted Fininvest, the media, stores and financial services group owned by Italian premier Mr Silvio Berlusconi, expects to reduce the debt burden by one third, to L2,800bn (Dollars 1.8bn), by the year end. This was the group's forecast yesterday as it released its 1993 accounts. Last year, Fininvest debts totalled L3,920bn on a turnover of L11,552bn, up 10 per cent from L10,469bn in 1992. The forecast drop in net indebtedness comes from the anticipated L990bn in proceeds from the 53 per cent flotation of Mondadori, the group's publishing arm. Since January, Mr Berlusconi has had no direct managerial role. The chairmanship has been entrusted to his close friend Mr Fidele Confalonieri, while executive management is in the hands of Mr Franco Tato. Net profits were L11.5bn, down from L21.1bn and marginally lower than originally anticipated. However, the 1992 figures were boosted by large extraordinary revenues, while last year's asset disposals - notably the 24 per cent divestment of Fininvest Italia (insurance) to Ennio Doris, which raised L240bn - also helped the bottom line. During the year, debt restructuring helped cut financial charges from L556bn to L386bn. The operating result was up 12 per cent to L557bn, in part due to new accounting methods to cover the depreciation of television rights. It is understood that reservations about contingent liabilities, raised by accountants Arthur Andersen on the 1992 accounts, have been addressed. However, the 1993 accounts have apparently raised queries concerning a L330bn credit affecting foreign television rights. Pre-tax profits rose to L209.3bn, compared with L73.9bn in 1992. The heavily-increased tax bill was blamed on strong profits in the publishing and financial products divisions, plus reduced tax credits.</p>

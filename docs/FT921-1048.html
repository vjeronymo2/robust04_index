			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Coats plans to sell another Tootal division COATS VIYELLA, Britain's biggest textile company, is in talks to sell another division of Tootal, the rival it acquired last May after an acrimonious takeover battle. Coats wants to sell Lantor Group, the non-woven materials business, to the privately-owned Freudenberg Group of Germany, one of the world's biggest suppliers of high performance textiles. It would be Coats' second disposal of part of Tootal. The announcement comes ahead of its final results today. 'We had to release the news to satisfy Dutch laws,' Coats said. The Netherlands subsidiary of Lantor has to inform its staff that the company could be sold. Coats said that non-woven textile materials were peripheral to its activities. Freudenberg, the world's biggest producer of non-woven materials, said Lantor would fit well with its existing operations. There was no indication of the price Lantor might fetch. However, analysts suggested it was likely to be less than Pounds 25m. That compares with the near-Pounds 40m valuation in 1988 when Tootal bought the 49.9 per cent of Lantor it did not own. Lantor's products are sold for medical and marine defence applications and it has operations in the UK, the Netherlands, the US, Australia and the Far East. In September Coats sold Slimma, a womenswear maker, to Dewhirst for Pounds 14.1m.</p>

The meeting between Ambassador  Kingibe and the Togolese president, which lasted half an hour,  was witnessed by Nigeria's envoy in Togo, Ambassador Vincent  Okobi, and the Togolese foreign minister, Mr. Fambare Natchaba.  Correspondent Shegun Adeluye, who was in the minister's  entourage, asked Ambassador Kingibe what was achieved from the  diplomatic visit.    [Begin Kingibe recording] In light of these conversations, I  am very optimistic that the situation is going to improve day by  day until such a time that we can have the dialogue between  ourselves and our brothers, the Cameroonians, and we shall be  able to resolve our problems and bring ourselves [words  indistinct] to this dialogue. I think that with the conditions  at this point in time are getting more and more favorable toward  that end. I am sure that the initiative by President Eyadema  and others will all go a long way in contributing to create the  right atmosphere that will enable us to resolve this problem  once and for all in a very peaceful manner. [end recording]    The foreign affairs minister said he is confident that  General Eyadema is experienced and trustworthy enough to  contribute meaningfully to the peaceful resolution of the  Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute.</p>

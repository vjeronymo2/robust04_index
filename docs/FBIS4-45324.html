			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khriso Andoniadhou] </F>   [Text] Cyprus is being used as a transit point for dirty  money. Offshore companies, which are linked directly to  countries where dirty money is rife, use Cyprus to legalize  their unlawful actions. Although the Central Bank has  repeatedly sent circulars to commercial banks to avoid use of  the banking system services for dirty money purposes, no oney  can know whether and to what extent dirty money moves in Cyprus  through banks that operate here. Central Bank Governor Avxendis  Avxendiou's assurances that no dirty money moves through Cyprus  are unconvincing. This is because government departments are  investigating files of evidence about offshore companies with  "mysterious" dealings and "ghost" transactions. It appears  clear in specific cases that Cyprus is also used by swindlers to  facilitate transiting their money through clean channels in  Cyprus to European banks.    I SIMERINI has seen a Central Bank document which shows the  ways that offshore banks launder dirty money. The following are  the main ways:     -  --New customers open an account after being recommended by  a branch abroad or another bank whose headquarters is in a  country where the production, trafficking, or trade of narcotics  are well known.    -  --The use of credits or other means of trade financing to  move  money between countries when such trade is incompatible with the  usual business activities of the customer.    -  --Customers who make regular, large payments, including  electronic remittances, when it cannot be established that such  transactions are made "in good faith" or when the customers  regularly collect large amounts from countries involved in the  production, processing, or trafficking of narcotics.    -  --The creation of big credit balances in accounts when this  is  incompatible with the known profit of the customer's business  and when, later on, these balances are transferred to accounts  abroad.    -  --Electronic inflows and simultaneous outflows of money by  customers without these transactions passing through a specific  account.    -  --Frequent applications for the issuance of traveler's  checks,  foreign exchange checks, or other negotiable means of payment.    -  --Frequent deposits of traveler's checks and foreign exchange  checks coming from abroad.    -  --Numerous and frequent incoming electronic remittances to a  specific account.     1</p>

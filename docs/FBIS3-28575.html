This was Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo's  reaction to Senator Arturo Tolentino's pronouncement that the  country has renounced its claim to Sabah, which was relayed by  the president to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed:    [Begin Tolentino recording in progress, in English] ...it's  on border problems with the Philippines. Formerly, Mr. Mahathir  said that unless the Sabah claim is dropped, he would not step  again on Philippine soil. And he would not negotiate any  treaties such as border agreements unless the Sabah claim is  dropped. Now he has come here. He seems to be a very happy man  and even went to the extent of giving a gift of an automobile to  our president in exchange of a Timex watch. This means that he  is very happy now, and the only explanation for his satisfaction  is that the Sabah irritant has already been withdrawn. [end  recording]    Romulo said, however, that this is not true and that the  government has no intention of giving up its claim to Sabah.  Romulo added that the Malaysian Government is ready to help the  Sultan of Sulu's heirs with their territorial claim. [sentence  as heard]    [Begin Romulo recording, in English] I believe that was  brought up in the context of a conversation of the president  with Dr. Mahathir. I cannot give you any further enlightenment  on that. I assure you that there is no agreement on Sabah at  this point in time. It was more the desire of the president to  help the heirs of Sabah above and beyond the nominal rental that  is being paid now. [end recording]</p>

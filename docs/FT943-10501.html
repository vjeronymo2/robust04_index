			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Building boom lifts Austrian group Wienerberger Baustoff-industrie, the Austrian building materials group, said its pre-tax profit on ordinary activities jumped 53 per cent to Sch633m (Dollars 56.87m) in the first half, due to the home-building boom in Austria and in some neighbouring countries. The directors expect business to remain brisk in the second half, and have forecast that ordinary pre-tax profits for the year will rise to Sch1.1bn from last year's Sch938m. Group sales dropped 20 per cent in the first half to Sch4.7bn reflecting the sale of the sanitary fittings subsidiary to Wolseley of the UK. The group posted extraordinary profits of Sch215m in the period, virtually all of it coming from this sale. Pre-tax profits of the wall, ceiling and roofing systems division soared 45.8 per cent to Sch402.5m. Profits of the pipe systems and sewage technology division advanced 34.3 per cent to Sch79.4m. The property and investment division more than doubled its pre-tax profits from Sch73.4m to Sch168.7m, as the group realised its investment in a large development and made good progress in renting its Business Park Vienna. The troubled Treibacher ferro-alloys division reduced its loss to SFr17.2m (Dollars 13m) from SFr21.9m after more rationalisation and a slight improvement in markets.</p>

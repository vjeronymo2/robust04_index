			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: WHEN A WIFE IS ADDICTED TO SEX  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 40-year-old wife was always an exceptionally beautiful  woman, but she was never sexually promiscuous until recently. Since I still  love her, this pains me and causes me considerable embarrassment. She claims  she's addicted to sex and that she can never get enough. Is this possible, and,  if so, what does it mean? F.K.  </P> <P> DEAR F.K.: Before I answer this question, I'd like to know if you've talked  with your wife about what's happening in your marriage, if you've asked her why  she feels there was this sudden change and if she has any theories on why she  feels "addicted" now but never before?  </P> <P> It's possible for people to be addicted to sex. Those who are use sex as an  escape for their problems in much the same way other addicts reach for their  "fix." There's little doubt that women who've been great beauties have an  especially difficult time with the aging process. Unfortunately, remarkable  beauties often fail to develop their potential because they get used to relying  on their beauty even as small girls. If you have valued your wife primarily for  her beauty, she may be concerned that you're losing interest as you witness her  beauty fade.  </P> <P> She may be using sexual conquests as a way to reassure herself that she's still  attractive. If you want to salvage your marriage, get professional help.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son-in-law is physically abusive to my daughter. She  won't leave him because she feels she can get him to change if he stops  drinking. Each time, after he hits her, he swears it won't happen again and  each time he tells her he'll stop drinking. This last time, he bet his entire  bank account that he won't touch another drop and that he'll never under any  circumstances hit her. What do you think the chances are that he'll keep his  promise? G.W.  </P> <P> DEAR G.W.: Not good. This isn't to say that this man isn't capable of change,  but unless he is highly motivated and gets the help he needs, there's little  chance that he'll suddenly become the kind of man your daughter wants.  </P> <P> First of all, his abuse of alcohol isn't necessarily linked to his abuse of  your daughter. Alcoholics may sometimes blame spouse abuse on alcohol, but  studies indicate that abstention alone doesn't solve the problem. If this man  is an alcoholic, then he should become a part of the Alcoholic Anonymous  program, go to meetings every evening and dedicate himself to living their  doctrine one day at a time. This will undoubtedly help him gain control of his  temper, but I suspect he also needs special therapy to teach him how to talk  constructively about what upsets him and now to deal with his rage in a  positive way, rather than simply striking out at a convenient target, usually  someone or something weaker and smaller.  </P></p>

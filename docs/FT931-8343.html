			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Italian engineer plans share issue FINMECCANICA, the Italian state-owned engineering group which is merging with some listed subsidiaries, has revealed moderate gains in 1992 sales and earnings and plans for a fundraising share issue. The announcement came as shareholders of Finmeccanica's Alenia aerospace, Elsag-Bailey automation and Ansal-do engineering subsidiaries approved the merger proposals put forward last December. Mr Fabiano Fabiani, Finmeccanica's managing director, said group net profits rose by 7.7 per cent to L182bn (Dollars 121m) last year, while sales climbed 2.1 per cent to L11,200bn. Net debt climbed by 9.4 per cent to L5,320bn, while interest costs jumped to L450bn from L297bn in 1991, largely due to the sharp rise in interest rates in the second half of last year. Finmeccanica unveiled plans to raise up to L891bn through a multi-tranche capital issue over the next year. The proceeds would come from issuing 307m new shares, with a nominal value of L1,000 each. The shares would carry a L1,500 premium, which could be altered up or down by L400 a share, depending on market conditions. The Italian government has indicated it is ready to reduce its stake in Finmeccanica, owned through the IRI state holding company, to below 50 per cent, although no timetable has been set. Should all minority shareholders in Finmeccanica's subsidiaries accept the share swap linked to the merger, IRI's stake will fall to 86.6 per cent from 96.4 per cent. The planned capital increase could dilute that further. IRI has said it will spend L493bn underwriting new Finmeccanica shares. Rights to any remaining stock will be ceded to a banking consortium, on terms yet to be revealed. Mr Fabiani blamed the rise in Finmeccanica's net debts on the delays in payment from public-sector clients in Italy.</p>

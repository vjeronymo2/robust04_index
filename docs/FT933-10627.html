			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / France mars Abbey National's gain ABBEY National, the home loans and banking group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 301m, against Pounds 270m, helped by rapid growth in wholesale-funded fixed rate mortgages. Abbey achieved a 31 per cent rise in UK retail profits to Pounds 300m (Pounds 229m), helped by a lower bad debt charge of Pounds 118m (Pounds 146m). This reflected a fall in house repossessions and in the number of mortgages in arrears by more than six months. In France, the bad debt charge rose to Pounds 94m (Pounds 16m) because of the weak commercial property market. France accounted for most of an Pounds 86m loss in continental Europe and offshore, against a Pounds 9m loss in the first half of 1992. The European problems drove up the overall bad debt charge, which includes loan provisions and suspended interest, by 35 per cent to Pounds 222m (Pounds 165m). Abbey raised its share of new mortgage lending to 23.3 per cent of the UK mortgage market, against 12.4 per cent, by promotion of fixed rate mortgages. Net lending was Pounds 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) largely funded by wholesale funds rather than retail savings. The group's share of UK retail savings fell from 4.1 to 3.3 per cent as retail inflows dropped to Pounds 400m (Pounds 700m), and the percentage of the domestic mortgage book funded by retail savings fell to 80 per cent (86 per cent). Operating profits before bad debts rose 20 per cent to Pounds 523m (Pounds 435m). Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, said the result was 'encouraging, given that the UK housing market is only just beginning to emerge from a prolonged recession'. Sir Christopher said that Abbey believed trading results in France might be improved by interest rate cuts. He said it was committed to French operations, although it was 'difficult to make strategic decisions in the eye of a storm'. The group has failed to sell its Cornerstone estate agency chain, which it put up for sale six months ago. Sir Christopher said it was 'negotiating with other parties' over the chain. Treasury profits rose 74 per cent to Pounds 66m (Pounds 38m) but the growth of its treasury balance sheet, which was 48 per cent bigger at Pounds 24.3bn (Pounds 16.4bn), slowed to 4 per cent over the period as Abbey curtailed expansion. Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said the results reflected an inadequate return on shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.3bn, but he expected it to improve as it eliminated 'problem children' such as French commercial lending. Post-tax earnings fell 5 per cent to Pounds 164m because of a tax charge of 46 per cent, pushed up by unrelieved French losses. The interim dividend was raised 9 per cent to 4.15p (3.8p), while earnings per share slipped to 12.5 (13.2p). The share price closed 9p up at 392p. Lex, Page 14</p>

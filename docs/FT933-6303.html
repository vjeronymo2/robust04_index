			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Price rise may stall coffee scheme AFRICAN COFFEE producers could chalk up a notable victory in their battle against depressed prices without firing a shot if the world market sustains its present bull run. The continent's producers of robusta coffee agreed earlier this month to join in a scheme drawn up by Latin American producers of the milder arabica beans to withhold 20 per cent of their production from the market until prices recovered to a more acceptable level. But a market upturn in anticipation of the scheme, which is to come into operation on October 1, has already brought prices to the level at which retention would be scaled down to 10 per cent; and any substantial further gains could result in the scheme being suspended before it comes into force. Under the terms of the scheme the full 20 per cent would be retained while the 15-day average of the International Coffee Organisation's robusta indicator price was below 60 cents a lb; between 60 cents and 65 cents 10 per cent would be retained; and above that level retention of robustas would be suspended. Thursday's 15-day robusta average was 58.38 cents a lb, but with the daily price at 62.13 cents the market only had to stay where it was to bring the average up to the 10 per cent trigger level and within hailing distance of the suspension level. 'If prices remain where they are now they will not be retaining much (robusta) coffee,' one trader commented to the Reuter news agency yesterday. Meanwhile the London Commodity Exchange'e robusta futures market was adding to its already impressive recent gains. The November position yesterday reached a fresh 2 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 1,335 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,281, up Dollars 19 on the day and Dollars 79 on the week. The price was Dollars 463 above the low reached just four and a half months ago. With the retention scheme already discounted in market prices this week's advance was largely attributable to deepening concern about the availability of good quality robusta beans for delivery against the large open position at the LCE. As speculators who had sold the market short in the hope of squaring their positions at lower prices ran for cover the premium for the prompt September position over December futures climbed to Dollars 57 at yesterday's close, up from Dollars 28 at the end of last week. The cocoa market needed no technical factors to keep its uptrend going. With both chart patterns and fundamental factors pointing northwards the December futures position at the LCE had little difficulty in brushing aside the psychological barrier at Pounds 800 a tonne on the way to a 22-month high of Pounds 831 a tonne at yesterday's close, up Pounds 21 on the day and Pounds 52 on the week. The rise was not uninterrupted - fears that the market was becoming overbought prompted moderate bouts of selling on Wednesday and Thursday  - but buyers remained in the ascendancy as continuing concern about growing conditions in the Ivory Coast and Ghana (which produce about 40 per cent of the world's cocoa crop between them) strengthened the conviction that there would be a third consecutive overall crop deficit this year. Having moved tentatively towards the upper end of its recent narrow trading range last week, the gold market put up little resistance this week to speculative pressure aimed at breaking the other end of the range. The Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce support point gave way on Thursday under the weight of concerted selling by New York speculators. That triggered selling orders from the computer-controlled US investment funds and the price dipped to Dollars 265 an ounce at one stage. It rallied to Dollars 369 at yesterday's close, still Dollars 4.25 down on the week. The ups and downs of the gold price were magnified in the platinum market, with the price ranging between Dollars 466 and Dollars 481.50 an ounce before fixing yesterday afternoon at Dollars 469.50, down Dollars 9.50 on the week. But for palladium, platinum's sister metal, it was one-way traffic as the US investment funds that lifted the metal's price to a four-year peak of Dollars 146 an ounce in July turned against the market. It ended at Dollars 120 an ounce, down Dollars 16.75 on the week. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of Johnson Matthey's platinum group metals market surveys, said physical supply of the metal was tight and JM still expected a supply deficit this year. He suspected that the Japanese had been hoarding physical palladium because 'the yen price has been pretty low'. At the London Metal Exchange the copper market continued to defy bearish fundamental factors, aided by technical tightness on supplies available for early delivery. The cash/three months delivery premium (a reflection of the squeeze), which ended last week at Dollars 33 a tonne, widened to Dollars 42 at one stage before closing in to Dollars 38 at yesterday's close. The market appeared to ignore a 9,800-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks as the three months price rose Dollars 27 on the week to Dollars 1,931.50 a tonne. The exchange's biggest loser was again the nickel market, which ended at a fresh six-year low of Dollars 4,545 in the three months position. But tin was not far behind, a Dollars 176 fall on the week taking the three months price to Dollars 4,737.50 a tonne at yesterday's close. Early in the day the price had followed the Kuala Lumpur market downwards, reaching a fresh 20-year low of Dollars 4,695 a tonne. But it steadied on short-covering.  ------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium         +15,800  to  2,041,700 Copper             +3,000  to    517,250 Lead                  +50  to    278,000 Nickel               +972  to    106,260 Zinc               +6,800  to    762,500 Tin                   +75  to     21,410  -------------------------------------------</p>

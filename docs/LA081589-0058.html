			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALONEN: 'SO MANY POSSIBILITIES';  </P> <P> FINNISH CONDUCTOR GETS 3-YEAR CONTRACT  </P> <P> It's official. In a press conference at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Monday  morning, the Los Angeles Philharmonic presented Esa-Pekka Salonen as the new  music director-elect of the orchestra.  </P> <P> Michael Connell, president of the Philharmonic board, introduced the  31-year-old Finnish conductor in a conference room packed with media  representatives. With Connell were trombonist Jeffrey Reynolds -- who spoke  briefly -- and flutist Roland Moritz, who represented the Philharmonic  musicians on the search committee, and Ernest Fleischmann, Philharmonic  executive vice president.  </P> <P> "I'm really very greatly honored, and very excited about this project," Salonen  said. "The artistic potential is enormous."  </P> <P> Salonen's term begins with the 1992-93 season. His three-year contract calls  for him to be in residence 16 weeks a year, two of those at Hollywood Bowl. No  financial details were released.  </P> <P> For the 1987-88 season, former music director Andre Previn was paid $581,550,  an $80,000 raise over the previous season. Previn was named to the post in  April, 1984, after the resignation of Carlo Maria Giulini. He took over the  podium in January, 1986, and his initial contract, calling for at least 14  weeks of residence with the orchestra per season, ran through the end of this  season.  </P> <P> Last year, Previn signed a contract extension which would have continued his  directorship through the 1990-91 season. Renewal of that contract, due by June,  was considered unlikely according to members of the Philharmonic board of  directors. That, Fleischmann suggested, prompted the timing of Previn's  resignation in April.  </P> <P> Salonen will be sharing musical influence over the orchestra with Previn before  his accession to the podium in 1992. When Previn resigned, he announced that he  would continue with the orchestra as a guest conductor. He will return for  seven weeks in the 1989-90 season, and six weeks each in 1990-91 and 1991-92.  </P> <P> With an already full calendar, Salonen will be here for only one week in the  coming season. Fleischmann said that Salonen will conduct at least four weeks  of concerts in the 1990-91 season, and "at least as much" the following year.  He also said plans were being made for a major tour that Salonen would lead.  </P> <P> In his introduction, Connell said that Salonen wanted to avoid such a public  meeting if possible, reminding everyone that English is not Salonen's native  tongue. Salonen spoke clearly, earnestly and somewhat nervously, deferring  answers to questions about his impact on Philharmonic repertory and outreach  until he has a chance to study what has been done in the past.  </P> <P> When asked what led him to accept the Philharmonic post, Salonen said "the most  important thing is the quality of the orchestra." He will be in charge of all  artistic matters, including programming, personnel, guest artists, and touring.  He will also have input in the planning of Disney Hall, and met with architect  Frank Gehry Sunday.  </P> <P> Salonen did say that he is definitely interested in conducting opera here. He  also continues to compose, when he can find the time.  </P> <P> "At the moment," he said, "I am working on a piece for the London Sinfonietta  -- which was supposed to have been played three years ago!"  </P></p>

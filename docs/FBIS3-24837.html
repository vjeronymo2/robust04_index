			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Feb 1 SAPA--State President F W de Klerk  announced details of the East Rand peace plan on Tuesday [1  February] afternoon but warned there was no quick fix to the  area's problems. The peace blueprint is a major joint  initiative, planning for which took place in conjunction with  African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela and the  Transitional Executive Council.    It involves the withdrawal of the SA Police's Internal  Stability Division [ISD] and its replacement with a contingent  of SA Defence Force [SADF] troops.    In a statement, Mr de Klerk said 80 percent of all deaths  due  to political violence in the country in the past eight months  had taken place on the East Rand. Socio-economic conditions  were desperate and people lived in daily fear of losing their  lives.    Mr de Klerk announced the formation of a task group to be  headed by the former head of the SA Air Force, Gen Jan van  Loggerenberg.    The task group would be responsible for initiatives to  restore and upgrade community services, to establish stability,  to assist persons displaced from their homes and to restore  sound administration.    "The first task that we all face is the urgent need to re-  establish stability in the East Rand. Failure to do so will  amount to callous disregard of the misery of almost one million  South Africans. It will also have negative consequences for the  prospect of a free and fair election in April. I have  accordingly instructed the deployment of the SADF in the area  with immediate effect. This will correspond with the withdrawal  of the ISD from the area as well as creating the conditions  necessary for an increased role for the SAP [South African  Police] within a framework of community-oriented policing," Mr  de Klerk said.    "Special efforts will be made to achieve improved relations  between the SAP and the community," he said. "There have already  been signals from affected communities that the SADF will be  recognised for its role and, accordingly, welcomed into the  community."    However, he warned the initiatives would take some time to  bear fruit. "It must be clearly stated that it will not be  possible to undertake and implement all the above in the  immediate and short-term period. Many of these programmes will  require a much longer time frame for their successful  implementation. While much can and will be done to immediately  improve the daily lives of the residents, there is no quick fix  for the East Rand.    "At the same time this plan is aimed at rapidly bringing  stability, hope and confidence to the people ravaged by violence  and instilling confidence in the future."    Mr de Klerk said the task group would interact with  different  socio-economic upliftment forums.</p>

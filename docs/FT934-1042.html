			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bid talk in TSB TSB delivered the best performance among high street banks as the market responded strongly to whispers that it could be a takeover target for a domestic or overseas bank seeking to establish or increase a presence in UK retail banking. The stock matched a generally strong showing by bank shares from January to July this year, but faltered during the summer months and substantially lagged behind until recently. Yesterday the shares powered ahead to reach an all-time high of 259p before coming off the best level to finish a net 7 up at 257p. Dealers noted persistent strong demand via the inter-dealer broker system, where TSB was said to have remained well bid all day. The level of activity in the shares - 3.8m changed hands yesterday - tended to put some traders off the bid story, but others remained convinced that TSB was a genuine takeover target. The bank's shares were up and running from the outset yesterday as the market absorbed weekend press reports that the for sale sign had been taken off its Hill Samuel subsidiary - confirmed in a statement late yesterday from TSB - and that TSB was probably much happier with a recent improved performance from its merchant bank division. However, the takeover speculation, which has surrounded TSB since it lost its way following the disastrous purchase of Hill Samuel for Pounds 777m just after the great crash of October 1987 and its acquisition of the Target unit trust group, began to circulate again, pushing TSB shares forward. Stories yesterday suggested that Standard Chartered had taken a hard look at TSB, as had National Bank of Australia. The Standard story was quickly shot down by sources close to the bank. 'Standard has no aspirations to get involved in retail banking in the UK, it is not interested in excursions in such an area; it is much more interested in playing to its strengths across the world,' said one close observer. Standard Chartered shares hardened 4 to 1194p. One leading banks analyst described TSB as 'among the most compelling takeover targets in the UK, it is still a capital rich bank', and said a bid could be 'a disguised rights issue'. He played down the National Bank rumours, however, saying that TSB has a strong northern bias and that NBA had acquired its interests in the North via its purchase of Yorkshire Bank.</p>

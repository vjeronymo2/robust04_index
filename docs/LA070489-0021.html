			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEN MIND WINS NINTH CONSECUTIVE RACE; BECOMES SEVENTH TO GAIN FILLY TRIPLE  CROWN  </P> <P> Open Mind became the seventh horse to sweep the filly triple crown, being  placed first when Nite Of Fun was disqualified for bearing in during the  stretch run of Monday's $283,500 Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> It was the ninth consecutive victory for Open Mind, owned by Gene Klein. She  has won 11 of 13 career starts and was second the other two times. She has won  $1,569,764.  </P> <P> Nite Of Fun beat Open Mind to the wire by a nose but was placed second in the  field of six for bearing in on Open Mind after entering the stretch.  </P> <P> The other winners of the filly triple -- the Acorn, Mother Goose and Coaching  Club American Oaks -- were Dark Mirage (1968), Shuvee (1969), Chris Evert  (1974), Ruffian (1975), Davona Dale (1979) and Mom's Command (1985).  </P> <P> "She's done everything we've asked her," said Jeff Lukas, who handles East  Coast training for his father, Wayne Lukas.  </P> <P> Open Mind also became the second filly to sweep the Kentucky Oaks, Pimlico Oaks  and the three New York races. Davona Dale was the other.  </P> <P> Rose Diamond led through the first mile, with Open Mind her closest pursuer  nearing the far turn. Midway on the turn, Open Mind took the lead but soon was  challenged by Nite Of Fun, who drew even entering the stretch. Nite Of Fun  thrust her head in front entering the stretch but then bore in on Open Mind,  forcing Cordero to check her. Open Mind then recovered and altered course to  the outside.  </P> <P> Open Mind returned $2.60, $2.20 and $2.20. Nite Of Fun paid $4 and $2.10, and  Rose Diamond returned $2.10. Open Mind ran the 1 1/2 miles in 2:32 2/5.  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Rise in average earnings slows AVERAGE EARNINGS rose by an underlying 5 per cent in the year to November, slightly below the October figure, which was revised upwards to 5.25 per cent. This was the smallest increase in earnings since the current series started in 1980, but the Department of Employment said the figures were lower in the 1960s. The slowdown in the rise of average earnings reflected lower pay settlements agreed around the end of last year. November settlements included 3.6 per cent at Rover, the car manufacturer, compared with 7.5 per cent the previous year, and 4.9 per cent for firefighters, compared with 5.6 per cent the year before. In manufacturing the underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the year to November was 5.75 per cent, unchanged from the previous month. The increase in service sector earnings slowed to 5 per cent in the year to November from 5.25 per cent in the year to October. Productivity - output per head - in manufacturing rose 5.4 per cent in the three months to November compared with the same period a year earlier. This was the sharpest increase since June 1989 and reflected heavy manufacturing job losses. Slowing wage growth and rising productivity caused manufacturing unit wage costs - wages and salaries per unit of output - to drop 0.3 per cent month-on-month in November. In the latest quarter unit labour costs were up by just 0.5 per cent compared with the same period in 1991.</p>

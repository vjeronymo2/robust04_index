About 40 of them are of a priority  importance. The legislators will adopt a ratification law on  each treaty.    Speaking about the ratification of the treaty between Russia  and Georgia on friendship, cooperation and good neighbourly  relations, Pastukhov called attention to article 33, which says  that "the treaty shall be subject to ratification and shall  become effective after the exchange of ratification instruments  of the two countries." He pointed out that President Yeltsin had  stressed before signing the treaty that "its ratification is  possible only after obvious headway is made in the settlement of  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict."    According to Pastukhov, now the Russian Foreign Ministry and  Defence Ministry are unanimous in their opinion that "not a  single cartridge should be turned over to the Georgian side, not  even for the needs of the Georgian Interior Ministry." He  stressed the need for a closer cooperation between members of  the Federation Council and the Foreign Ministry.    The Federation Council adopted today draft regulations on  the  parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly. According to  Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, the  parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly will be made up of  members of the State Duma and the Federation Council in order to  represent the Russian parliament in international organisations.  Aside from it, the Federation Council adopted a resolution on  the creation of a hospitality fund.    The legislators adopted a resolution on the amount of  monthly  remuneration for members of the Federation Council holding  elective posts. According to the resolution, 299,000 roubles  will be added to their monthly salaries, equal to those of  ministers, and to other privileges. According to Shumeyko, "the  rise in wages is intended for members of Federation Council  committees working on a full-time basis, as well as for deputies  to the Federation Council to cover travelling expenses."</p>

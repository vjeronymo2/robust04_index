			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Seoul prepares for talks with N Korea South Korean government ministers will meet today to discuss preparations for a possible summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, the first since the peninsula was divided in 1945. The summit could be the first test of whether former US president Jimmy Carter has succeeded in defusing tensions over North Korea's nuclear arms plans following his private mission last week to Pyongyang. Mr Carter briefed President Clinton's foreign policy aides yesterday on an offer by North Korean President Kim Il-sung to meet South Korean President Kim Young-sam. The offer, made without pre-conditions, was immediately accepted by the South Korean president on Saturday. 'I personally believe the crisis is over,' Mr Carter said. 'The next step is to assure that the agreements that were worked out between me and Kim (Il-sung) are carried out.' Assistant US secretary of state Mr Robert Galluci told reporters at the White House that Mr Carter may have 'brought back something from which we can build' to defuse the tension which has built up over the past three months. Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, claimed that North Korea did not yet have a nuclear bomb. He quoted 'experts' as saying it would take the former Soviet ally three to seven years to develop one. While reiterating criticism of the US for failing to consult Moscow on proposals for phased sanctions of increasing severity against Pyongyang, Mr Kozyrev said there was no point in rushing ahead with them because they would be vetoed by China in the UN Security Council. The media in South Korea yesterday suggested the summit will be held within a month in Pyongyang. South Korea wants the summit agenda to include implementation of the North-South Korean 1991 denuclearisation treaty, the reunification of divided families and the establishment of business ties. The South Korean president offered to meet his Northern counterpart last year, but backed away from the proposal as the nuclear dispute deepened. His sudden acceptance of the summit offer from Pyongyang suggests that Seoul is worried that Mr Carter's mission could pave the way for direct talks between the US and North Korea, which could leave South Korea as a subordinate party in resolving the nuclear issue. However, some US and South Korean officials expressed caution about the summit meeting, explaining that Pyongyang might use it as the opportunity to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. The South Korean government has been criticised by opposition politicians for following too closely Washington's lead on the nuclear dispute. Carter solution awaits the test of time, Page 4</p>

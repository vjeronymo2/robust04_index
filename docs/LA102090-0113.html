			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Air Regulator Recall: A diving equipment manufacturer based in Santa Ana  announced Friday that it has voluntarily recalled all of its air regulators  because they may allow too much air to flow into divers' lungs.  </P> <P> The company, U.S. Divers, said that a functional problem with the high pressure  seats of the first stage of the regulators may allow an uncontrolled flow of  air to its second stage. "If this occurs during a dive, use of the product  could be hazardous," the company said. U.S. Divers said the recall affects all  regulators that were purchased or serviced since Aug. 15. The company did not  indicate whether any injuries have resulted because of the problem.  </P></p>

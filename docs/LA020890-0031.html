			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> IT'S TIME FOR AN AIRING OF ISSUES  </P> <P> The special election to replace William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) in the  state's 31st Senate District has given new meaning to the phrase quick and  dirty. The six-week contest -- which thankfully ended Tuesday -- included  little discussion of issues to help voters make an intelligent choice.  </P> <P> Earlier in the campaign, Republican candidate Ron Isles was censured by the  Orange County Republican Party for a campaign brochure that chided two of his  Republican opponents with the title, "Meet the Two Best Legislators Money Can  Buy." But what brought the election to new depths were remarks made last  weekend by one of the Republican candidates, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of  Newport Beach, who called a group of gay-rights activists "faggots." He was  reacting to their militant protest against his candidacy.  </P> <P> Ferguson is an elected official, so a little dignity could be expected from  him. Instead, his response was: "I don't care about them. I'm a retired Marine.  . . . A couple of faggots out there aren't going to scare me." He later refused  to back down. "I could have called them sodomites," he said.  </P> <P> This type of gay-bashing by a public official is inappropriate. Ferguson  demeaned not only gays but himself by stooping to this level. We hope that in  the April runoff election campaign, the candidates will sling less mud and talk  more about issues of import to the voters.  </P></p>

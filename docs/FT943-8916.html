			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Tunnel link data to be issued soon The Department of Transport said yesterday that it would announce details of the intermediate stations which will be needed on the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link in the next two weeks. Details of the stations for the 68-mile route, which will link London's St Pancras station with the Channel tunnel, were originally expected by the end of May. A series of delays has prevented the department from providing the four bidders for the project - which is regarded as a pilot scheme for the government's private-finance initiative for infrastructure projects - with the detailed specifications they need to prepare bids. Once these are available the formal tendering process is set to take six months. The government expects to introduce a bill authorising the project in the next parliamentary session and aims to pass the legislation in 1996. The rail link could then open in 2002. The department yesterday defended itself against accusations that it was taking too long to provide information to the four bidders. 'They are complex tender documents and they've got to be absolutely right. Although one or two people in the private sector may be thinking it's taking a long time, these things do take a long time.' Four consortia are bidding: Eurorail, including GEC, Trafalgar House and BICC; London &amp; Continental; Hochtief of Germany; and a fourth including the construction companies John Mowlem and Taylor Woodrow. The three losers will each be paid compensation worth a third of the costs of their bid, up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m each. They had to inform the government of their interest in April, and have assembled teams of expensive professional advisers, who as yet have nothing to do.</p>

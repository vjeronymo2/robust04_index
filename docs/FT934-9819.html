			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Another champion of sanity on Radio 3 Sir, I was so pleased to read ('From 'good morning' to 'hello matey', October 30) that Clement Crisp has not surrendered in the battle to restore sanity to Radio 3. Like him, I abhor chit-chat on the radio and one could always rely on this third programme to offer a haven of word-free, musical quality amidst a world changing too fast, in directions which no one seems fully to comprehend. Much of this has now become adulterated by news, reviews and interviews, already the staple diet of Radios 1, 2, 4 and 5. Mercy, mercy] Are Mr Crisp and I the only people in the land who want to listen to music and not drown in a torrent of trivia about music? Frankly, I am not too interested in the life and times of the glockenspiel understudy in the Liechtenstein Philharmonic. When will the controllers of Radio 3 come to realise that, for them, Classic FM is the most fortunate radio development of recent years? We live in an age of instant gratification where the media moguls presume and continuously affirm that our maximum span of attention is about 10 minutes. However, as we mature intellectually and emotionally we reject this affront to our humanity and gradually turn to more demanding, more satisfying newspapers and radio and television programmes. Classic FM is in the process of cultivating a whole new audience for Radio 3; that is, if Radio 3 will return to its roots as the premier broadcasting station of consistently rich and varied, non-ephemeral music. To achieve this it must renounce its stable of critics, reviewers and interviewers who contribute not one whit to our enjoyment of the music itself, who, indeed, seriously detract from it. If Radio 3 can find its way back on to the tracks of musical goodness and, in the short-term at least, set aside the irrelevance of audience figures, then it will again deserve to appear in the top 10 list of 'things most missed' by many expatriates. It will again stand as a beacon of British broadcasting quality in a confused world. Michael Wilson, Danesbrook Cottage, Dayhouses, Longville, Much Wenlock, Shropshire</p>

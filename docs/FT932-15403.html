			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Miners refuse to cheer for Yeltsin THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday failed to secure the propaganda victory he sought in his first provincial visit ahead of the April 25 national referendum. With his campaign appearing lacklustre and his reception in the Siberian mining town of Novokuznetsk distinctly lukewarm, the trip did little to convince onlookers that he had the enthusiasm for the political fight ahead. Barely a few thousand people turned out to line the streets of the town, part of the Kuzbass region which encompasses 100 mines. Mr Yeltsin no doubt still has the support of the region, which has long a been a bastion of support for him, but the president was yesterday greeted with a barrage of strident demands both from miners and regional leaders. Regional leaders, concerned about the future of the region's coal industry, are demanding both fresh subsidies and greater economic autonomy from Moscow. Local miners are furious that their salaries, once among the highest in the region, have been eroded by inflation. In a stuffy hall, packed with 400 miners, Mr Yeltsin announced that one of the largest mines in the area would embark on an experimental programme of partial privatisation, with 38 per cent of the mine's ownership to be passed from the state to the mine next month. Until now, the privatisation programme has barely touched the mining industry. However, Mr Yeltsin insisted that he could not free the price of coal, which is currently partly controlled by the government. 'If we did that, it would lead to a social explosion,' Mr Yeltsin said. The miners responded politely but without real conviction. Mr Vladimir Lavrik, director of the Abashaskaya mine, said that without further economic reform, the mining industry faced catastrophe. Mr Vachoslav Sharipov, leader of the mining unions, warned that unless further aid was forthcoming, the president could not rely on the support of miners. 'Presidents and governments come and go, but the union will remain here,' he said. He admitted afterwards that he was 'disappointed' by Mr Yeltsin's speech, although he believed that most miners would still support the president in the referendum.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BUSH, GORBACHEV TO VISIT GAMES?  </P> <P> Organizers of the Goodwill Games said today after a White House meeting that  there is a good chance President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev  will visit the competition this summer in Seattle.  </P> <P> "The feeling at the White House is very favorable," said the Rev. William J.  Sullivan, chairman of the board of directors for the Seattle Organizing  Committee.  </P> <P> "It is my own personal judgment that if President Bush decides to come, I think  Mr. Gorbachev in all probability would come too."  </P> <P> Sullivan, president of Seattle University, said he thinks the odds are better  than 50-50 that both world leaders will attend.  </P> <P> "The kind of public relations person Gorbachev is, I don't think he'd pass up  the opportunity," Sullivan said.  </P></p>

Mr Francis Hemsworth, formerly a senior engineer with the oil company, had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly accepting payments that totalled more than Pounds 31,000. The payments were made to him to influence the awarding of the contract for the vessel to be used in Shell's Gannet oil field in the North Sea. Mr John Napier, a former marketing manager, was also imprisoned for 12 months after pleading guilty to corruptly offering the bribes to Mr Hemsworth. Confiscation orders were also made against both men. Mr Hemsworth was ordered to pay Pounds 31,000 and Mr Napier Pounds 25,467. Both men were also ordered to pay part of the prosecution costs. Mr Hemsworth was ordered to pay Pounds 6,500 and Mr Napier Pounds 13,500.

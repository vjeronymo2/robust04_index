			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HSBC eligible for FT-SE 100 THE FT-SE 100 Index steering committee yesterday considered the eligibility and timing of HSBC Holdings becoming a constituent of the FT-SE 100 and agreed that all shares of HSBC Holdings would be eligible for inclusion in the Index from the date on which the final offer for Midland Bank became unconditional in all respects. In arriving at its decision, the committee took into account that: 1) HSBC Holdings is UK incorporated. 2) HSBC Holdings has made a public commitment that the enlarged company will become UK tax-resident from January 1 1993. 3) It would cause unnecessary confusion and disruption to exclude shares in HSBC Holdings following the final offer becoming unconditional in all respects, given that Midland Bank was presently a constituent of the Index and would need to be removed but not replaced by the enlarged HSBC Holdings until January 1993. The Committee reserves the right to remove HSBC Holdings from the Index should the company not become UK tax-resident, as planned. FT-A All-Share Index The Joint Index Committee of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries has agreed that HSBC Holdings will join the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index from the date the final offer for Midland Bank becomes unconditional in all respects. The committee reserves the right to remove HSBC Holdings from the Index should the company not become UK tax-resident as planned.</p>

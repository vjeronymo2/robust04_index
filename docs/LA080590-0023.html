			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN, LEGISLATORS END BUDGET IMPASSE  </P> <P> In response to "Governor Cuts, Signs the Budget," front page, Aug. 1:  </P> <P> Once again state government has undermined and sabotaged California voters and  the educational system, by offsetting voter-approved increased funding (i.e.,  the lottery and Proposition 98) with severe budget cuts. My yes vote to Prop.  98 was essentially nullified by Gov. George Deukmejian's "blue pencil."  </P> <P> And many wonder why voter apathy is at an all-time high.  </P> <P> Of all the areas to cut spending, education should be at the bottom of the  list. Education is a vital investment that provides many priceless returns. If  we don't invest in quality education now, we will certainly pay later, with  interest.  </P> <P> At this rate, our greatest natural resource, the human mind, may face  extinction in the U.S. Without proper education, illiteracy has become a  national epidemic and crime will continue to become an appealing alternative to  our discouraged, uneducated youth. The fallout of poor education guarantees  that our future governors, senators and presidents will be as mindless as our  current elected officials. On a brighter note, if ignorance is bliss, then  America will eventually become a euphoric paradise.  </P> <P> ANGELA SHEPARD  </P> <P> Monrovia  </P></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: George Weston has strong third quarter George Weston, the Weston family holding company controlling Loblaw, Canada's biggest grocer operation, as well as pulp and paper interests, posted third-quarter net profit of CDollars 21.2m or 45 cents a share, up almost 50 per cent from CDollars 14.2m or 27 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 5 per cent to CDollars 3.55bn. The profit comparison was distorted by a CDollars 12m special charge in the 1992 period. Loblaw and Weston Foods, a large processing unit, contributed higher sales and earnings. Revenues at the Weston Resources' businesses were up 25 per cent to CDollars 295m, due to an acquisition and strong timber markets, but profit dipped to CDollars 3.9m from CDollars 7.6m because of sharply lower results from the fisheries unit. Weston's overall nine-month profit was CDollars 50.6m or CDollars 1.08 a share, up from CDollars 24.1m or 39 cents, on revenues of CDollars 9.06bn, against CDollars 8.57bn. Nova Corp is selling its fully-owned Novalta Resources natural gas production unit to Seagull Energy, of Houston, for CDollars 275m cash. It will book a CDollars 120m gain on the sale.</p>

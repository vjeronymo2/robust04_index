			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: US insurers check impact of hurricane TWO leading US insurance groups yesterday unveiled only small dips in third-quarter profits despite the impact of Hurricane Andrew on their underwriting results. American International Group (AIG) recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars 344.6m in the three months to end-September, down 8.6 per cent on the Dollars 376.8m seen in the same period of 1991. This included realised capital gains of Dollars 26.8m and brought the group's after-tax income for the first nine months of the year to Dollars 1.18bn, a 2.7 per cent increase on the same period in 1991. AIG said the adjusted underwriting loss in the general insurance operation for the third quarter was Dollars 149.5m, compared with a deficit of Dollars 34.5m in the same period of 1991. But net investment income rose by 8.2 per cent Dollars 311.3m; operating income from the life side increased by 15.7 per cent to Dollars 156m; and the financial services operations boosted profits by 39.4 per cent to Dollars 99.6m. General Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 139.8m, down from Dollars 161.6m, with realised gains contributing Dollars 66.4m, compared with Dollars 22.6m. The group said the combined underwriting expense ratio for the domestic property-casualty companies in the third quarter was 113.8 per cent, compared with 102.1 per cent, and losses from natural disasters had added about 12 points to the combined ratio during the three-month period. However, Mr Ronald Ferguson, chairman, added: 'Excluding catastrophe losses, underwriting results in the third quarter continued to improve even though they remained unsatisfactory.' The third-quarter results mean General Re is posting after-tax profits of Dollars 506.1m in the first nine months of the year, including realised gains of Dollars 144.5m. This compares with Dollars 472.5m, with realised gains contributing Dollars 71.9m, in the same period of 1991.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo in demand from US Heavy US buying of Glaxo ensured that the pharmaceuticals group was the market's star performer yesterday. The buying reflected technical position-taking rather than an investment response to a new version of Zantac, its headline anti-ulcer treatment. The shares saw continuing support from a more positive stance taken by Goldman Sachs at the end of last week. Also, there was a rush of what one dealer described as 'panic covering' by US hedge funds. The leveraged investment funds had sold stock on concern over slowing sales growth for Zantac, which represents about 44 per cent of group profits. Apparently the short position in the US had reached 15m Glaxo American Depositary Receipts, the equivalent of 30m shares. The feeling that the stock had run down too far saw the bears scurrying for cover. The squeeze sent the shares racing up 20 at one stage before closing a net 17 higher at 629p on turnover of 6.4m. One international arbitrage dealer said: 'I think the panickers have panicked enough and Glaxo could consolidate at this chart level.' The buying of the shares reignited the bid speculation that now hovers over Wellcome and Zeneca, which firmed 2 to 678p and 5 1/2 to 823p respectively.</p>

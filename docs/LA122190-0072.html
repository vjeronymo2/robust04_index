			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAY GIVEN RELEASE BY ANGELS, SIGNS TO PLAY IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Veteran infielder Johnny Ray, who had asked to be traded or released by the  Angels at the end of last season, was given his release Thursday and signed a  two-year contract with the Yakult Swallows of the Japanese League.  </P> <P> Ray, 33, was under contract to the Angels for 1991 at $1.4 million, but the  club will no longer be obligated, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The terms of his contract with the Swallows were not announced.  </P> <P> Ray, who batted .277 in 105 games and missed more than three weeks in midsummer  with a strained shoulder, said he believed he had fallen into disfavor with  Manager Doug Rader.  </P> <P> His ability to cover ground at second base seemed to come into question, and it  was clear when the Angels acquired second baseman Luis Sojo from the Toronto  Blue Jays in a December trade that Ray was no longer a factor at the position.  The Angels, currently trying to invest in free-agent third baseman Gary Gaetti,  were obviously seeking a way out of the contract.  </P> <P> The team secured protection at second base Wednesday with the re-signing of  free-agent infielder Donnie Hill.

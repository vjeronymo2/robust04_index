			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Law brings no relief - Briefcase My son and I are the only shareholders of a small limited company. The new law exempting small businesses from the burden of an audit account has not brought any relief. What would be the consequences regarding capital gains tax if the asset and liabilities were transferred to either one of us or changed to a partnership, leaving the company dormant? Would we have the same VAT number as the company which was no longer active? You appear to have so little knowledge of company taxation etc that you need professional guidance - from the company's accountants, perhaps? Briefly, if the company's assets were distributed (leaving it dormant), the distribution would be treated like a dividend. Ask your tax office for the free booklets IR1 (Extra-statutory concessions) and 1R131 (Statements of practice). In the IR1, look at concession C16 (Dissolution of companies under section 652 of the Companies Act 1985: distributions to shareholders). In the IR131, look at SP D3 (Company liquidations: tax on shareholders' capital gains). The company's VAT number would not be transferable. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

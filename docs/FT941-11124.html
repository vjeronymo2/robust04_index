			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Gardening: Your strategy for summer starts now - Play it by eye when designing the layout Beneath the wind and rain, the year is ahead of itself; among the snowdrops, gardeners need to take a grip. The sunlight has that pale washed tone to it and buttercups are creeping wherever you want them least. If you are planning to change things, map out your strategy and start now. Like untried horses, new garden-owners will do anything rather than face the fence head-on. Where must I go to learn to draw? I was asked yet again last week by a new female recruit to FT gardening. Her City husband has given her charge of their new garden by default during the week: she feels she can start only if she gets it down on paper. Why bother? I always tell them, unless you want the social life of an architect's class. Every book on the subject now tells us to buy squared graph paper, reduce our new garden to a scaled grid plan and experiment with modules. We are all being brain-washed. Drawing has no necessary connection with garden planning unless you want to design gardens for other people. You have the vision in your head, which is the best place for it. What you need is string, not graph paper. Better, I find, to work it out on the site. Learn to look, not to draw. There are mistakes which we all make: planting too closely, making beds too small at the first attempt, and succumbing to impatience. They are our basics, and that is why we keep straying back to them. But there are other mistakes which we really should not make: mindless imitations of bits of other people's gardens; fussy curves and features; multi-coloured foliage where a good green leaf would be better; gardens with the wrong season and no sense of place. Drawing lessons will do nothing to protect you from these mistakes. Instead, begin by appreciating what you have: the site and its setting with all its probable ghastliness. It could be so awful that you want to turn inwards and develop a contrary fantasy: block in your own setting by using good evergreens, box osmarea, yew, or the cherry laurel if you live in the country and are in a hurry. Stage design is often a better starting point than architectural drawing: give the garden props which are to be clipped from its green screen without going over the top. You might be more fortunate. Between the neighbours and the sodium lighting, there could be a character which you can pick up, something which tells you to go for a low-growing formal design or a vista to your only decent tree. Fasten on the intuition and dress it up mentally, as if you are dispensing a wardrobe round it. You then have the beginnings of the style, not a recycled copy of Sissinghurst in London SW10. Some people are helped by colour photographs of other people's gardens, but I find they make me envious and suspicious simultaneously: photographs lie, although the best ones can set you off at a tangent. If you are stuck, think back to your childhood in the hope you can conjure up a scene, a setting or a place with ideal landscape you want to recapture. You might as well be explicit because it could well be there implicitly, anyway. Most of us design a garden only once or twice in a lifetime and, when I know the personal history, I often find it easier to see why somebody went for that particular style. If you cannot remember anything about your childhood, you might well decide that garden designing is not your first priority until you have unravelled other balls of personal string. This advice is probably most helpful for people with bigger gardens who do not need to turn inwards and create their own stage. It does not matter if the intuition is not altogether true to reality. I remember how Ottoline Morrell, the Edwardian hostess, described her village of Garsington as the most Italian place in Oxfordshire. It was not Italian at all, but she presided over a good, formal garden developed in the belief that it had this latent genius. Sometimes, you see something and then you must go for it, even if others are doubtful if it is really there. The result will be personal and successful. This encouragement might seem rather abstract and you could want to draw with a ruler and feel better instead. I will end with one specific tip. Much more is now being written about planting schemes and putting plants well together. The recent seasons have made glorious nonsense of them by bringing out the flowers early and spoiling all these designer groupings. Nonetheless, I think they miss a more important point. The style of planting needs to vary with a garden's size. Unless you want a two-weeks wonder, sequence and season ought to be the next obsessions after your initial vision. In a very small garden, you have no choice; you can choose only one or two plants for each month and spread them round a small plot. In a big garden, you can do what the books now tell you and plant those seasonal groupings and special blocks of colour at particular seasons. When they are over, you can walk past them to the clump of the moment somewhere else. Most of us do not live in big gardens but on sites up to half an acre at most. Here, we would do better to scatter the features of the moment round the main design, rather than amalgamate them in one clump. Textbooks tell you the result is spotty - but it is not if you give the main setting a coherent framework of green hedging and shrubs. As you set out on this new season, I would tell you to be more relaxed, spread it around, and give your eye something at all angles, repeated at each season.</p>

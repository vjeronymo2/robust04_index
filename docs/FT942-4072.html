			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Insurer advances into Europe - CU reinforces recovery with big purchase Commercial Union, the UK insurance company which was close to insolvency 10 years ago, yesterday signalled the full extent of its recovery by announcing its planned acquisition of France's sixth biggest life insurance company, Groupe Victoire. The deal, expected to be finalised later this year, puts CU firmly among the biggest European insurers and leaves it with a solid base in the Dutch, French and UK markets. More than any other UK company, CU is well placed to take advantage of the expected liberalisation of the continent's insurance market, a process which is expected to gather speed after the implementation of a new regulatory framework next month. However, above all the acquisition also marks a decisive turnround in CU's fortunes since the early 1980s, when a combination of bad luck and bad management left it with a reputation as the sick man of the insurance sector. Following losses of more than Pounds 100m (Dollars 150m) in 1984 and 1985, a new management spearheaded a strategic shift in the group's business, It reduced exposure to the loss-making US commercial liability business and increased the emphasis on Europe, especially in life business, which was seen as guaranteeing more stable and higher quality earnings. Between 1990 and 1992, while its UK rivals experienced some of their worst losses, CU escaped relatively unscathed, posting only one year of losses and leading the return to profitability in 1992. The acquisition of Victoire would further increase the proportion of business represented by life operations, from 32 per cent to 40 per cent, based on 1993 figures. CU's annual premium income will increase by more than 30 per cent as a result of the deal, confirming its position as the biggest of the UK composite (general and life) insurance companies. However, Mr John Carter, who took over as chief executive earlier this year, said CU was not 'doing the deal just to get bigger but to increase shareholder value'. CU will pay FFr12.5bn (Dollars 2.2bn) for a company whose net assets are valued at FFr9.5bn. The price compares favourably with some made for recent acquisitions in the sector. The company believes Victoire's growth prospects are good, especially in the French life market, which should be lifted by the expected liberalisation of pensions legislation. Premiums at Abeille Vie, Victoire's life subsidiary, rose 14.5 per cent in 1993, to FFr15.8bn, with about two-thirds of this generated by the rapidly growing savings club, the Association Francaise d'Epargne et de Retraite. Abeille Assurances, Victoire's non-life arm, is the 11th biggest non-life insurer in France, specialising in small-scale commercial and personal business. The company sells through a network of 1,200 exclusive agents, and is strong in small provincial towns. Mr Carter said CU, which will finance the deal through a combination of new equity, debt and cash, would introduce tighter financial management to improve returns from Victoire's financial assets. 'We think we can add value by setting the business according to very strict financial parameters. They wouldn't have run the business on the basis of shareholder value,' he said, Additional cost savings could be achieved through linking the Victoire companies with CU's existing French operations. These include L'Epargne de France (a life insurance company distributing through a direct sales force), a long-standing commercial lines business and a recently-formed direct motor insurer. At the same time, some central functions, such as investment management, could be consolidated. In the longer term, CU believes the size of its operations in Europe - which already include Delta Lloyd, the Netherlands' fourth biggest insurer - will also yield a number of advantages. Mr Carter accepts there is a 'gradual convergence' in the European market, and says CU is already 'finding more and more examples of ways in which we can add value today'. German, French, Italian and UK insurance companies tend to dominate their national markets. However, the implementation of new rules by the European Union is expected to lead to greater competition over the next few years. Implementation of the new rules will lead to the abolition on July 1 of laws requiring minimum premium levels for some types of personal insurance. Also from July 1, insurers will no longer need to submit the wordings of insurance policies for approval by local regulators. Similar restrictions on the market for commercial insurance have already been lifted.</p>

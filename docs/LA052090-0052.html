			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC  </P> <P> Based upon the absolutely glowing review by Michael Wilmington (Movies of the  Week, April 15), we decided to view "That's Life!" rather than Vaclav Havel's  "Audience" on PBS or "20/20" on ABC. We saw a tedious, unfunny, unwitty, pop  psychology movie and now understand why we never heard of it before. I taped  the Havel play (fortunately) but regret missing "20/20."  </P> <P> Alan Rosin, Camarillo  </P></p>

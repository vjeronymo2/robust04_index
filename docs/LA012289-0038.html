			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAMBI BUCKS  </P> <P> Though "Bambi's" re-release last year didn't cost Disney anything in terms of  production, it ran up other costs that Leonard Klady overlooked ("Box Office  Champs, Chumps," Jan. 8).  </P> <P> Whenever a movie is reissued, it costs money to strike new prints, to  distribute those prints, to run ads and TV commercials and to supply the TV  review shows with clips.  </P> <P> So, I have to ask: How much of the $38.1 million brought in by "Bambi's"  re-release was used by Disney for costs? If those costs are figured into the  budget-vs.-box-office ratio the same as for all the other movies, what will  "Bambi's" place on the chart be then?  </P> <P> JIM BOYD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

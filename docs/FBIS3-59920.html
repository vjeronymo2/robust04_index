			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] By the middle of December Ukraine had removed from  operational service 17 nuclear SS-24 missiles and detached the  warheads from the delivery medium, the Ukrainian Vice Premier  for the Military-Industrial Complex, Valeriy Shmarov, told  INTERFAX-Ukraine.    We hope that our partners in nuclear arms negotiations will  appreciate this unilateral step, he said. Shmarov said that the  deactivation of missiles was a labor-intense process, however,  Ukraine was well aware of that, when it made the decision. The  Vice Premier said that in 1994 the rest of the SS-24 missiles  stationed in Ukraine must be deactivated.    Shmarov also said that Russian experts continued to service  nuclear warheads in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Vice Premier  dismissed as populist and senseless the Russian government's  statement to the effect that such servicing had been stopped.    In the course of trilateral talks, American, Ukrainian and  Russian delegates had in Kiev last week progress was achieved in  resolving the problem of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, Shmarov  said. For instance, he said, the question of compensation to  Ukraine for the tactical nuclear arms removed earlier, became  specific. For instance, Ukraine said it would agree to accept a  smaller compensation, if Russia were to write off Ukraine's debt  to it.    The sides achieved understanding on the need to hand over to  Ukraine enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear warheads.  Shmarov said that Ukrainian experts had computed the amount.  "Probably that uranium will be processed and handed over to the  United States under a Russian-US contract," Shmarov said.    The United States Deputy Defence Secretary William Perry is  reported to have said during the talks that Washington was  considering an additional 400 million dollars in compensation to  Ukraine for nuclear disarmament.    So far the United States has given Ukraine 175 million  dollars under the Nunn-Lugar amendment in technical and other  assistance for removing nuclear missiles from Ukraine.</p>

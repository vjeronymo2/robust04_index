			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: Notions about Orpheus English Touring Opera has an established reputation for taking enterprising stagings to opera-starved venues, but its current tour, which opened at the Richmond Theatre on Wednesday, is saddled with a new production of Orpheus and Eurydice that tries just too hard. The special qualities of Gluck's opera appear to have eluded the inventive producer Stephen Medcalf, who conjures up a series of ideas that detract from the 'beautiful simplicity' the composer sought. Some of his images are affecting: the opening, staged as Eurydice's funeral with Orpheus cradling the urn containing his wife's ashes; and portraying the entrance to the underworld as cardboard city, with dishevelled Furies sleeping rough and guarding the boarded-up window that leads to Elysium, is a metaphor of some potential. But many of Medcalf's notions - is it all Orpheus's nightmare? is he a ghost? - have not been developed. The ballet numbers cue 'meaningful' mime, and the lovers' reunion is staged as a series of charades. The final rejoicing calls forth toasts, party hats, streamers and cringe-making choreography. At least Charles Edwards's black-and-white sets provide an element of restraint. Circumstances beyond the company's control - pit lights went out on the orchestra twice - added to the unsettling feel of the evening, but Martin Andre's musical direction was in itself uneasy. And from a company that regularly commissions translations, it was worrying to hear how little of Michael White's new version came across. With 'authenticity' not a high priority, the casting of a counter-tenor Orpheus was perhaps perverse when ETO could have had excellent mezzos cueing up. Timothy Wilson's intonation was good, though his voice did not carry the emotional weight Gluck's hero requires. Elizabeth Woollett, a strong soprano with a feel for the style, made an apt heroine, but Helen Wold's Cupid was compromised by the pixie-like characterisation imposed on her. One reason for cherishing ETO is the opportunities it provides young singers, and there was considerable talent on show in the revival of the company's Boheme on Thursday. Leading the principals was Sarah Pring's beautifully focused Mim and John Cogram's fresh sounding Rodolfo; Adrian Clarke's secure Marcello, and Naomi Harvey a capricious Musetta whose entry brought chaos to the Cafe Momus. Thomas de Mallet Burgess's production has been tightened with profit and Andrew Greenwood conducts the reduced orchestra with feeling and flair. English Touring Opera's autumn season runs until December 3 (071 820 1141). Sponsored by Barclays Bank.</p>

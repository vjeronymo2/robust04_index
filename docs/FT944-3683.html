			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Buy-backs set to enhance returns for shareholders - Electricity Dividends will be on everyone's minds when seven of the 12 regional electricity companies report next week. Analysts are expecting average growth of about 20 per cent, a trend which has already been set by the handful which have reported in recent weeks. The RECs are able to deliver such healthy increases partly because most of them have been busily buying back their shares over the last year. By spreading the same amount of cash over fewer shares, they have found a reasonably economical way of enhancing shareholder returns. A few companies such as Eastern and Southern have not been as active in share buy-backs, so their dividend increases will be of special interest. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 85m for Eastern and Pounds 92m for Southern and dividend increases of almost 20 per cent. Eastern's propensity for surprises has some market observers hoping for news of a special pay-out. Yorkshire, which is forecast to report profits of about Pounds 98m, is also a promising candidate. Northern Electricity is expected to show one of the larger dividend increases with a rise of about 22 per cent. The market is anticipating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 61m. South West and London are likely to trail behind with dividend increases of about 18 per cent. Forecasts are for interim profits of Pounds 46m at SWEB and Pounds 85m at London. Few expect the RECs to divulge much about plans for the flotation of the National Grid in the spring. The companies are waiting for the government's response to proposals on sharing flotation proceeds between customers and shareholders. Some investors are hoping for clarification on another subject from Manweb, with expected profits of about Pounds 53m. Questions are likely to be asked about the abrupt departure of Manweb's finance director this year.</p>

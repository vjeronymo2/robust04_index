			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Safety mechanisms at Sizewell B n-power station may need strengthening SAFETY mechanisms at the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk might need strengthening because of doubts over the efficiency of a computerised fault-detection system, according to the British Computer Society, David Green writes. The primary protection system for the plant, which is due to start generating electricity next year, involves 300 microprocessors and 98,000 lines of computer code. The society says it doubts whether the existing programme of testing will prove the efficiency of the system because of its complexity and it is suggesting that either the testing programme or the secondary protection system should be enhanced. The society has made seven recommendations it wants Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, to carry out before the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate approves the system. Nuclear Electric said yesterday that the existing test programme was capable of demonstrating the efficiency of the primary system and there would be no need to enhance the secondary system.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Italian new car sales plunge by 21% NEW CAR sales in Italy, Europe's second biggest market, were down almost 21 per cent last month compared with March last year. Demand was hit by the recession and price rises for some imports. The 20.8 per cent plunge in March sales to 189,940 units was the eighth monthly fall since August. The decline is likely to rekindle friction between domestic and Japanese manufacturers which have increased sales. Sales by Nissan soared 90 per cent to 4,372 from 2,301 in March 1992 thanks largely to new models from the group's UK plant. Honda sales rose by nearly 9 per cent, while Toyota rose fractionally. Japanese exports and transplants still account for less than 5 per cent of the market. However last week's agreement between the European Community and Japan on import levels for this year, which allowed a 17.5 per cent rise in Japanese exports in Italy, was criticised by some motor industry executives. The drop brings Italian car sales into line with trends in Germany, France and Spain, where demand for cars has fallen heavily recently.</p>

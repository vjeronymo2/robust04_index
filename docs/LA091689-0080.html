			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AN UNSTICKY ANIMAL FAIRY TALE  </P> <P> There's something delightfully pure and fresh about the children's film "The  Adventures of Milo &amp; Otis" (citywide).  </P> <P> This epic fairy tale about male bonding between an orange kitten and a  pug-nosed puppy, refashioned from Masanori Hata's Japanese movie "The  Adventures of Chatran," is full of clean sunlight and waving grass. Populated  entirely with animals from Hata's private island menagerie -- bears, foxes and  snakes as well as the usual barnyard assortment -- it generates the blissfully  dry sense of wonder the best children's books or movies often do.  </P> <P> Hata creates a little world, as magically detailed as Oz, Wonderland or Pooh  Corner. And he draws us into it, serenely, effortlessly -- guiding us along a  rushing river where the frightened kitten, Milo, is swept along in a runaway  crate; following the puppy, Otis, as he chases along the banks; pausing  quizzically over the antics of a fox, the stately stare of an owl and the  relentless pursuit by a bear; lingering on the snowy forest that eventually  imprisons Milo, Otis and their respective families. Then gazing out to the sea,  as Otis stands stranded on a tide-lashed rock, ultimately rescued by a  disgruntled but duty-bound sea turtle.  </P> <P> The basic story deals with the friendship of all animals, exemplified by Otis's  yearlong expedition to rescue his childhood companion. It's an idealistic  theme. Obviously, it translates to universal community among all species. Yet  there's nothing sticky about the movie's visual execution. In its original  Japanese form, "Milo and Otis" may well be a classic. And even in its shortened  American version -- with roguish narration by Dudley Moore, a bouncy score and  a ricky-tick country-Western theme song that's a real mistake -- it's  engrossing, genuinely heartwarming stuff.  </P> <P> It's certainly unique. Hata hasn't used the conventional method of training the  animals to perform according to a pre-existing scenario, tricking or teasing  them. The animal actors, including as many as 30 roughly identical kittens or  puppies pressed into service as Milo or Otis, were filmed in their natural  environment responding to situations Hata and his crew helped create. This  makes the movie the animal equivalent of an "improvised" drama like John  Cassavetes' "Shadows" or Henry Jaglom's "Always."  </P> <P> The movie is full of what Francois Truffaut called "privileged moments": little  jolts of charm or reality. One scene, where Milo and Otis watch a chick  emerging from his egg and then nuzzle him as he stretches out, strikes me as a  more impressive achievement -- at least a more heartening one -- than anything  in "Batman."  </P> <P> Hata worked on the film for more than four years, turning to one of the great  masters of the Japanese cinema, Kon Ichikawa, to help him edit the unwieldly  mass; Ichikawa's title here is "associate director." The director of "Fires on  the Plain" and "The Makioka Sisters" is no stranger to animal or children's  films. He's directed Topo Gigio, the Italian-mouse puppet, and another of his  movies is an adaptation of Natsuke Sosemi's "I am a Cat," a Japanese literary  classic from a cat's eye view. He has strong affinity for the material and he  helps give the movie a seamless shape and flow.  </P> <P> "The Adventures of Milo and Otis" (MPAA-rated G) is an unabashed children's  film, made with a wit and intelligence that adults can enjoy too. It reminds us  that sometimes it takes the purest sophistication to see with an innocent eye.  Just as Milo and Otis, drifting kitten and determined pup, learn that they're  not alone in the world -- so, perhaps, will the children and parents who will  see, and love, this movie.

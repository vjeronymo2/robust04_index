			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdulayeva, </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 13 May TASS -- Important problems pertaining to  the settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict and the  liquidation of its consequences are being discussed in Baku  today.    At noon, Azeri President Geydar Aliyev met with the chairman  of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh, Jan Eliasson, his  deputy, Matthias Mosberg and plenipotentiary representative of  the Russian president and special envoy of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, Vladimir Kazimirov, who arrived in the region on a  special mission late on 12 May.    According to Aliyev, the current meeting in Baku means the  beginning of a new stage in the Karabakh settlement. He  believes that recently, the Minsk CSCE group has extended the  framework of its activities and has taken a more realistic  approach to the possibilities of the conflict settlement,  relying on efforts made by all of its member-states. A positive  assessment was given to its contacts with Russia and the Russian  Foreign Ministry, in particular, for the purpose of the conflict  settlement.    According to the Azeri president, "this can be regarded as a  new qualitative level in the peace-keeping process."    Aliyev shares the opinion of Eliasson and Kazimirov about  the  importance of ceasefire as the necessary condition for the  process of settlement. "I believe that the cease-fire should be  followed by concrete practical steps, including immediate  withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the occupied  territories, strengthening measures of confidence and carrying  out a programme envisaged by CSCE documents and Russia's  proposals," Aliyev said. He is convinced that there should be  no interval between these stages, since only on this condition  real results in the settlement can be achieved.    Aliyev pointed out that the signing of the Bishkek protocol  by Azerbaijan, which was received in Azerbaijan not  unequivocally, was a correct step leading to cease-fire and the  creation of conditions for lasting and reliable peace in the  region, saying that there are the necessary grounds for this  process. It is calm today in the area of the conflict, he said.    "Now we have to see to it that international observers make  their contribution to what was achieved, taking under control  the process of demilitarization and the withdrawal of occupying  troops. This will inspire everyone with confidence that the  peace-keeping process is irreversible," the Azeri president said.</p>

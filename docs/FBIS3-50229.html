[Churov] In essence, Partnership for Peace is a compromise  between at least three quantities. The first is NATO as an  organization, which is well aware that it has to change its  character and, probably, its range of action. Second, there are  the countries of Eastern Europe, practically all of which have  declared that they want full membership. The third factor is  Russia. As a result of the balance between these three  quantities, whose interests both coincide and diverge in certain  fields, we have Partnership for Peace.    For some time now, NATO has been facing the problem of how  to  take account of the new circumstances, which tend to induce  changes in an organization that from the outset was formed and  adapted to the bipolar security model. Now there is a new  understanding of security, a realization of the need for a new  architecture for the security structures and, in the final  analysis, for new, more varied forms of behavior.    For its part, Russia displays a degree of sensitivity  regarding NATO's position and, more precisely, its geographical  scope. Russia is a state of the first magnitude, regardless of  the problems that it is suffering at the moment. It continues  to be a leading state and a permanent member of the UN Security  Council, and it has a first-grade nuclear potential at its  disposal. As a state, it carries great weight in international  relations, and NATO cannot fail to take it into consideration.  A further important factor is the internal political balance  inside Russia between forces that are rather skeptical about  cooperation with the West and other forces that believe this is  the only reasonable alternative.    Third, we have the states of Central and Eastern Europe.  Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, they have found  themselves in a certain "security vacuum" and naturally have the  lawful right to seek guarantees for their security, territorial  integrity, and sovereignty, which includes following a  consistent policy aimed at joining the West European or  Euro-Atlantic structures. Accordingly, in the final analysis,  Partnership for Peace is a vector resulting from these three  lines of force representing different interests and foreign  policy behavior.    [Badzheva] Is Moscow applying any pressure on our statesmen  to keep us from joining NATO?    [Churov] I have no information to confirm such a thesis. I  think rather that Russia's attempts to exert influence are  directed toward the West. A certain postulate has been strongly  expressed in statements recently made by NATO politicians, and  it contains a grain of logic. It suggests that the immediate  inclusion of a group of states from Central and Eastern Europe,  or only from Central Europe, in NATO would in practice mean  shifting a line of division further to the east, no matter where  it should end up -- at Russia's borders or somewhere to the west  of our own border.    I think that at the present stage, we cannot fail to  appreciate Russia's problem -- no such line of division should  exist. Anyway, this was the message sent to the NATO summit  meeting in Brussels.    [Badzheva] In the Western press, Partnership for Peace has  revived the hypothesis of a "new Yalta," according to which the  Central and East European countries would again be left within  Moscow's sphere of influence. What do you think about this?    [Churov] To be able to claim that such an accord exists, one  needs to have absolutely authentic information. One cannot  simply put forward hypotheses.    On the other hand, attempts are still being made to  delineate  spheres of civilized compatibility. Ideas were suggested of  making culturological divisions between the countries of Europe,  based on religious traditions, alphabets, and ethnic features,  and according to this, we lie in the eastern orbit. However,  this thesis does not hold water, because it refers to a  Byzantine Europe, but the state that historically personifies  Byzantium turns out to be one of the Western group of countries.  I am referring to Greece, which is already quite well  integrated in both NATO and the European Union.    [Badzheva] Nevertheless, views still prevail that  Partnership for Peace restricts the countries of the former  socialist block from holding full membership in NATO.    [Churov] First and foremost, Partnership for Peace  represents a commitment on the part of NATO to open up the  organization to the East. It is something like the EU's  Copenhagen declaration, in which it declared that in principle  it was an organization with an open character. The states that  have been active in the Partnership for Peace Initiative will be  able to hold consultations similar in scope and content to those  specified in Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This means  that in the event of a direct threat appearing to their national  security and sovereignty, the member countries will be able to  seek consultations with NATO on these issues.    The second level of Partnership for Peace is that it gives  the opportunity to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, if  they so desire, to participate in important NATO military and  political bodies. This gives them real access to the process of  formulating decisions, despite the fact that this cannot, of  course, be compared to full-blown participation in the  decisionmaking process. In addition, the initiative provides  for cooperation in specific military-technical fields, such as  military planning, access to certain types of confidential  information, cooperation in the fields of troop training,  command, and administration, and, naturally, participation in  wide-scale costly operations, such as joint military exercises,  joint peacekeeping operations, and so on.    [Badzheva] Has NATO invited us to take part in joint  military maneuvers this year?    [Churov] In principle, NATO is planning to hold joint  maneuvers in 1994 but, so far, it is not clear which states in  Central and Eastern Europe will take part in them. It has been  left to them to decide whether they are ready to join in and  allocate the relevant resources. However, we have already been  invited to notify them which of our combat units might be placed  at NATO's disposal for joint operations of this type.    [Badzheva] Are we ready to answer in the affirmative?    [Churov] No, and not only us. It is still too early.    [Badzheva] Are you afraid that the states of the former  socialist camp are moving toward NATO at two speeds and that we  are in the second group?    [Churov] I would say that from now on, the states of Central  and Eastern Europe, and not only them, will move at more than  two speeds. Despite our formal equal standing, in a certain  sense, this is embodied in the Partnership for Peace initiative  itself. For many countries, the initiative essentially  represents a solution to their situation and, for this reason,  they find this program exceptionally acceptable. Some states  will turn out to be better organized, better equipped from the  material viewpoint, and with a stronger psychological motivation  and a higher level of public awareness. In other words, these  states might prove to be more suitable for faster integration  into NATO.    [Badzheva] Nevertheless, we can demonstrate our activity  only within the limits of our financial capabilities, because no  one knows how we will be able to pay for our cooperation with  NATO. Does this mean that the richer states will overtake us?    [Churov] This is possible. However, if we give high  priority to our links with NATO on national security grounds, we  could allocate more funds. If again we reach the assessment  that the balance between the economic factor, including our  financial problems, and the aspiration to integrate with NATO is  in favor of giving priority to economic problems, the outcome  would be different.    In this case, however, the statement made by Ms. Albright  during her visit offers us some reassurance. She said that the  quantitative aspect is not so important as the qualitative one,  and as far as the latter is concerned, I do not think we are  inferior to any other state.    [Badzheva] What does the qualitative aspect include?    [Churov] From the political viewpoint, it includes  conducting sensible foreign policy, acting as a stabilizing  factor, not having any territorial claims against our neighbors,  having a democratic social system, abiding by international  obligations, and so on. As regards all these requirements,  Bulgaria is in no way inferior to the other states of Central  and Eastern Europe. Our state also has to prove that it is a  reliable partner in the Partnership for Peace initiative.    [Badzheva] Do you consider that a condition for us joining  NATO is that our weapons should conform to Western standards?    [Churov] If we talk about Western standards, it is a  somewhat paradoxical fact that the East European armies are  standardized to a far higher degree -- that is, they are far  much more compatible than the NATO armies. In this respect, I  am inclined to think that the idea that we are unsuitable for  NATO because our standards are totally different is somewhat of  a myth.    [Badzheva] Is it possible to say that, in a certain sense,  military diplomacy has outstripped classical diplomacy on our  path toward NATO?    [Churov] I would not make this distinction, because it is  very difficult to separate the one from the other. It is true  that a number of specific programs for cooperation with NATO  exist in the military-technical field. On the other hand, the  political process is also quite well developed.    [Badzheva] In your opinion, who in Bulgaria is afraid of  NATO?    [Churov] I do not know if we can talk about fears. However,  a certain trend does exist, and among serious politicians at  that, who think that it is not the best thing for Bulgaria to  commit itself to one or another organization or state, and that  Bulgaria should be neutral.    In the present conditions, the very concept of "neutrality"  is losing its meaning in a world that is no longer bipolar, thus  presupposing the existence of third neutral countries. In  organizations like NATO, in which mutual cooperation is  developed to a high degree, a democratic process exists for  reaching decisions, and the interests of all are considered, the  member states are divided into two groups: the insiders and the  outsiders. The ones inside have advantages, while those outside  are in practice prevented from being able to influence the  collective decision- making process.    If we decide not to integrate ourselves with NATO at such a  speed and show a tendency to consider whether we have any other  alternatives, this will inevitably place us in the second  category, even when we are equal in all other respects to the  other Central and East European countries. In this case, there  is a very big risk that this would have a knock-on effect  regarding the process of our integration into the European Union  and other similar structures.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste is the price we have to pay Sir, John Willman came close to summarising the current state of the public services in the UK ('Tidal wave of dirty water', February 5) but was diverted from the crucial point. Everyone involved in implementing the radical changes of recent years knows that, by their nature, they have increased the opportunities for waste, extravagance and fraud. Everyone involved also knows that the changes have, by contemporary criteria, improved the management of some parts of the public services. What no one yet knows is whether the improvements will be enough to compensate for the increased fraud. It is this ignorance that has created so much resentment. In the absence of any evidence that the changes would be beneficial, we had no choice but to have blind faith in zealots. Talk of stemming the flow of dirty water, by briefing managers better, is double-talk. The only ingenuous response to the tidal wave is for the policy-makers, Canute-like, to demonstrate openly that nothing can be done. This hardly seems likely. But it does not alter the fact that waste, extravagance and fraud are part of the price we will necessarily continue to pay.

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Satanic Verses translator shot A NORWEGIAN publisher whose company translated The Satanic Verses by Mr Salman Rushdie, the British author, was shot and seriously wounded outside his home in Oslo yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Mr William Nygaard was shot three times in the back by an unknown assailant. Mr Nygaard was known in international literary circles for his staunch defence of Mr Rushdie's right to publish the novel. Oslo police could not say whether an Islamic group was behind the attack. They were watching airports, border crossings and harbours.</p>

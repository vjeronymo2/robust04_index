			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Swiss plan to ease property rules Buying and selling Swiss property will become much easier for foreigners if a plan approved by the federal cabinet this week wins acceptance. It would enlarge the number of holiday homes which can be sold to non-nationals each year and eliminate curbs on foreign residents buying property for their own use. There is no plan to ease restrictions on property purchases by foreigners for investment. This means that some Swiss companies, such as insurance companies, which invest widely in property, will want to continue regulating the number of their shares held by non-Swiss. The proposals are less drastic than Switzerland would have been forced to accept if it had joined the European Economic Area, the free trade pact between the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. Swiss voters vetoed EEA membership in a referendum a year ago, but hard pressed holiday property developers have been pressing hard for the Lex Friedrich law restricting foreign ownership to be changed. The plan calls for replacing the criterion of nationality with that of place of residence. A foreigner living in Switzerland or one who had lived in Switzerland in the past for at least five years would no longer face restrictions. For others, the principle of a continually declining national quota for sales of holiday homes would be abolished, and the quota would rise from 1,420 permits a year to the maximum 2,000 allowed by the Lex Friedrich. Distress sales or sales by one foreigner to another would no longer be counted against the quota. Nor would purchases of time-share premises up to 16 weeks. The justice ministry has set a January 17 deadline for comments, and intends to put a final proposal to parliament in June. Provided no one insists it be put to a referendum, the change could be in effect by November.</p>

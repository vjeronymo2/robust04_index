			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson rises to Pounds 3.1m Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research group, doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.06m in the six months to end-June. This compares with Pounds 1.55m in the first-half last year, when the company invested Pounds 526,000 in an associated business. The company attributed the improvement to rigorous cost controls and a reduction in low margin business, as well as an upturn in general business. The increased volume had been handled with little increase in administrative costs. Operating profits rose by 47 per cent from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 2.77m, while turnover increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 28.6m. Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said the company had been promoting branded services, where margins were higher. In the business service sector the brand Foqus, which measures levels of customer satisfaction, had won several large contracts. However, the healthcare sector, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of group sales, had proved the strongest performer. Turnover grew by 40 per cent as the pharmaceutical industry responded to dramatic change, with a move from branded to generic products. The net cash position improved from Pounds 8.46m at the end of last year to Pounds 12.3m at the end of the half. Net interest receivable rose from Pounds 195,000 to Pounds 288,000. Earnings per share rose from 0.47p to 0.91p, and the interim dividend is lifted from 0.13p to 0.3p.</p>

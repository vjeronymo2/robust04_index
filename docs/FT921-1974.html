			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: Remy lines up a world class list  -The drinks group's expansion strategy The restructuring of Remy Cointreau, the family-controlled French cognac, champagne and liqueurs company, to be completed shortly with a public offering of 20.8 per cent of shares, will consolidate Remy's position among the leading international drinks groups. Remy will emerge as a diversified drinks business with turnover of FFr6.5bn (Dollars 1.15bn) and profits of FFr214m. Some 20 years ago, the original Remy Martin cognac company had turnover of FFr72m and profits of FFr4.5m. Rivalry between the related Heriard Dubreuil and Cointreau families, which has hampered the development of the group, was resolved two years ago when Mr Max Cointreau's family sold its stakes in both Remy Martin and Cointreau to Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks, food and retailing group. The Pounds 100m deal enabled the Dubreuil family to merge the Remy and Cointreau businesses - and the group will now buy back the GrandMet holding for Pounds 120m (Dollars 207.6m) over the next three years. The deal also greatly simplifies the maze of interlocking interests which has characterised the group's structure. After the public share offer, the Dubreuil family's holding company, Orpar, will have 51 per cent of Remy Cointreau's equity. The rest of the shares will be publicly held via stock market listings in Paris and Frankfurt. Marc and Francois Heriard Dubreuil, the brothers who run the group, will oversee three operating divisions - covering cognac, champagne, and wines and spirits - and one of the most extensive, wholly-owned international distribution networks. 'The company that controls its distribution, controls its independence,' says Francois Heriard Dubreuil. The strength of the network built up by Remy has been a crucial factor in its development. Despite the restricting family squabbles, it has enabled the brothers in recent years to extend their drinks portfolio from its cognac base by adding Piper Heidsieck and Charles Heidsieck champagnes to their existing prestigious champagne house, Krug. They have acquired Mount Gay rum from Barbados, St James rum from Martinique, and Galliano liqueurs from Italy. Distribution of third-party brands includes Absolut vodka, Campari bitters, Jim Beam bourbon, Domecq sherries, Drambuie liqueurs, and French, Italian, Californian, and Australian wines. Towards the end of 1990, the brothers tied up a marketing and distribution deal with Highland Distilleries, maker of The Famous Grouse, the UK's second best-selling Scotch whisky, and acquired a 26 per cent stake in Macallan-Glenlivet, another Scotch distiller. Export volume sales of Famous Grouse rose last year by 16 per cent against an overall industry decline of 3 per cent. Following the example of Guinness and LVMH, the relationship is cemented with cross-shareholdings. Highland holds convertible bonds equivalent to a 30 per cent share in Orpar, and Orpar may raise its present 2 per cent stake in Highland to 10 per cent. Wines and spirits now account for 48 per cent of Remy Cointreau's turnover, cognac for 40 per cent, and champagne for 8 per cent. The network, into which the distribution of Cointreau will be fully integrated over the next two months, gives an even geographical spread to the business. Last year, France accounted for 25 per cent of turnover, the rest of Europe 35 per cent, Asia/Pacific for 24 per cent and North America for 17 per cent. Few potential customers are neglected - distribution even reaches into the Pacific islands of Guam and Saipan to target Japanese holidaymakers. The group is now looking towards eastern Europe. 'St Petersburg was our biggest market at the turn of the century,' Marc Heriard Dubreuil muses. More than half the group's 3,000 employees are engaged in sales and marketing, and the business is tightly focused on premium quality and price. The Dubreuil brothers have no immediate plans to acquire more brands. The FFr1.2bn expected from the public share offer will be used to reduce borrowings presently standing at FFr7bn. Development of the existing drinks portfolio and more effective use of distribution is expected to increase earnings per share by more than 20 per cent this year and by about the same amount next year. Profits are forecast to rise this year to FFr261m from FFr214m, and to FFr313m in 1993. The brothers, who have long been concentrating their cognac business into the VSOP and higher categories, believe firmly in the reliability of the long-term trend for consumers everywhere to 'drink less, but drink better'. Marc says: 'We are selling products which are perceived as luxuries but which a growing number of people can afford. A bottle of Remy Martin VSOP is less expensive than a tankful of petrol.'</p>

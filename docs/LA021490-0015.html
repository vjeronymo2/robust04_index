			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SPILL NEXT TIME (CONT.)  </P> <P> Smog-free and potentially cheap, nuclear power would be far more prevalent if  the public really believed that the industry was capable of controlling any  potential accident. The fact that nuclear power does not enjoy that confidence  is not an economic disaster since there are alternative forms of power. But the  nation does not yet have a substitute for the petroleum needed to run much of  its economic machine. For now, we are stuck with oil. Therefore, as the Exxon  Valdez and the American Trader have demonstrated, we must do a better job of  handling the millions of barrels of petroleum products the nation guzzles daily  -- from the moment the stuff comes out of the ground, or the ocean floor, to  the point at which the last vapors flow from the exhaust pipe.  </P> <P> It's true that an oil spill does not carry the potential for mass human  destruction that people fear -- whether rationally or not -- from a nuclear  accident. Long-term environmental damage is bad enough, though. And  fortunately, Americans have the technical skill to develop safeguards against  major oil spills and adequate cleanup programs. But the people and their  political leaders must demand that the job be done, and agree to pay the  necessary cost.  </P> <P> The Alaskan spill conceivably might have been prevented if budget cuts had not  reduced the Coast Guard's ability to track and control shipping traffic,  according to Congress' General Accounting Office. Damage to Huntington Beach  might have been limited if the Environmental Protection Agency hadn't been  forced to suspend research and development in oil-spill prevention and cleanup  because of lack of money.  </P> <P> If offshore moorings are a problem, safer alternatives must be found. Double  tanker skins will prevent or minimize spills. And much more work needs to be  done in developing booms that truly contain the oil in the immediate vicinity  of a spill.  </P> <P> Finally, accidents don't just happen to ships. Offshore rigs, tanker trucks,  refineries and every other facility pose a risk. Petroleum industry workers  everywhere must conduct themselves as if an accident could happen at any place  at any moment. Because it could.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: BAT to cut 700 US tobacco jobs Brown &amp; Williamson, BAT Industries' US tobacco subsidiary, is to cut 700 jobs in a drive to maintain its competitive position in the US domestic market. The restructuring - a response to the cigarette price wars begun last year by Philip Morris's decision to lower the price of Marlboro - will result in a Pounds 45m charge against BAT's 1993 profits. BAT said it expected to recoup the investment through increased profitability over the next two years. The reorganisation, which follows a review by McKinsey, the management consultants, will streamline sales, marketing and administration. The sales force will be reduced by 25 per cent and 20 per cent of the Louisville headquarters staff will go. B&amp;W expects the programme to be completed by the end of March.</p>

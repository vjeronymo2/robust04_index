			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 April  react to the talks on the North Korean nuclear issue between  Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and ROK  officials, including Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, held in  Seoul on 18 April.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 1,000-word article by  reporter Pak Tu-sik on page 3 which welcomes the ``simple and  clear'' demand for North Korea's allowance of additional nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA,  made in the recent Seoul talks between the ROK and the United  States. The article reports: ``It seems that, for the time  being, the United States and the ROK will concentrate their  efforts on creating an atmosphere for North Korea to allow  additional inspections by the IAEA.''    The article reports that ``the United States will strongly  demand that South and North Korea hold a dialogue on  implementing the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula'' and conduct bilateral nuclear inspection after the  third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, ``which will likely be  held in Geneva in May as soon as the IAEA inspection team enters  North Korea if North Korea meets the IAEA demand.''    The article also expects that ``the South-North Joint  Nuclear  Control Committee will be held if the North Korea-IAEA and North  Korea-U.S. dialogue is successfully held'' and that ``this will  make progress in resolving the nuclear issue.''    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 400-word article by Chong  Pyong-chin on page 1 which reports that in the 18 April talks,  the ROK ``asked the United States to propose a contact with  North Korea first'' and that the United States said it ``will  consider proposing to North Korea to hold a contact before the  end of this week.'' The article concludes by noting that ``it is  highly possible for North Korea and the United States to hold a  contact in New York sometime this week.''    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 900-word article  by Pak Chong-mun on page 2 on the result of the talks between  Robert Gallucci and ROK Government officials. While reporting  that the ROK and the United States ``failed to make any clear  decision'' on the nuclear issue, the South-North dialogue, and  the U.S.-North Korea talks, the article notes as a ``tangible  result'' of the talks that the ROK and U.S. authorities ``have  shared the view that the U.S.-North Korea talks and South-North  dialogue should be promoted in a harmonious way of complementary  cooperation.'' Pointing out the ``inevitability of sharing a  view on South-North dialogue between the ROK and the United  States'' because of the linkage between South-North dialogue and  the U.S. interests, the article stresses additional agreements  on South-North dialogue must be reached between the ROK and the  United States if North Korea allows additional nuclear  inspections.    The article expects no tangible result for resolving the  nuclear issue from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's  upcoming visit to the ROK, noting the ``flexible situation''  regarding this issue.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO also carries reporter Kang  Yong-chin's 1,000-word article expecting that a working-level  contact will be held between the United States and North Korea  before the end of this week. Citing an unidentified government  official's remarks, the article reports that the United States  will no longer allow North Korea to ``attempt to stall for  time'' since, through repeated negotiations with North Korea,  the United States is now able to easily grasp North Korea's  intent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting government spokesman Spiros Arotis said the  government is satisfied with the United Nations Security Council  letter to the UN secretary general. He stressed that the  Cypriot Government believes the Turkish Cypriot side must lift  its objections before an agreement on implementing the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] is reached.    The letter notes that President Glavkos Kliridhis accepted  the 21 March document on implementing the CBM's on condition  that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas do the same, although  he did raise a series of protests.</p>

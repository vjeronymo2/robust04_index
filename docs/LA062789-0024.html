			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL LICENSE BID DRAWS FIRE;  </P> <P> HEARING URGED ON 'HOT LAB' RENEWAL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility said Monday it  will contest Rockwell International's bid to renew its operating license for a  nuclear fuel recycling facility at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory.  </P> <P> The organization is concerned about the risk of conducting nuclear activities  near populated areas and about Rockwell's record at a nuclear weapons plant  near Denver, said Dr. Richard Saxon, an orthopedic surgeon in Encino and board  member of the Los Angeles chapter.  </P> <P> The anti-nuclear group, which has a membership of about 2,300 doctors, dentists  and other health professionals in Los Angeles, will ask the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission to hold hearings before ruling on the license renewal, Saxon said.  Such hearings are discretionary under NRC regulations.  </P> <P> Rockwell is seeking a 10-year license to operate the facility, known as the  "Hot Lab." From the early 1960s until 1986, the lab was used to remove  plutonium and other materials from nuclear fuel rods and package them for  future use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> License Extended  </P> <P> The firm's license, which expires June 30, has been extended indefinitely while  the agency assesses the environmental impact of the facility west of  Chatsworth, NRC spokesman Greg Cook said. Rockwell officials said no nuclear  work is being done at the lab, which they said contains traces of radioactivity  that pose no health threat. The lab is being decontaminated while the firm's  Rocketdyne division seeks future contracts.  </P> <P> "Rocketdyne has and will continue to operate all business activities at Santa  Susana Field Laboratory in a safe and responsible manner," said company  spokesman Pat Coulter. "All reports, tests and surveys by the government and  private groups have supported that fact."  </P> <P> Coulter was referring to concerns growing from publicity about a U.S.  Department of Energy report on low-level chemical and radioactive contamination  at Santa Susana, where the company operated about 16 nuclear reactors between  1947 and 1986.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles members of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which has  35,000 members nationwide, said the laboratory should be prohibited from doing  further work with radioactive materials. The chapter will use about $3,000  contributed last week by an anonymous donor to launch the campaign against  renewal of the license.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Record Cited  </P> <P> "We oppose the licensing on the basis of the fact that the area has a  tremendous number of people," Saxon said. "We have great doubt that Rockwell is  capable of doing things properly, given the company's record in Colorado."  </P> <P> Rockwell manages the Energy Department's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near  Denver, which is the subject of a criminal inquiry by the FBI and U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency over alleged hazardous-waste violations.  </P> <P> Cook said the agency will probably take months to complete an environmental  impact report on the Hot Lab. The report involves reviewing the lab's safety  records. After the report is completed, there will be a 30-day public comment  period during which individuals or groups may request a public hearing, he  said.  </P> <P> Cook said "everybody and his brother at NRC" have received hundreds of letters  from residents concerned about future nuclear operations at Santa Susana. But  he said an administrative law judge appointed by the agency would not grant a  hearing on the Hot Lab unless residents had a "germane and reasonably specific  issue."  </P> <P> "We don't renew or not renew based on public opinion; we do it based on safety  records and on the impact on the environment," Cook said. "Our experience with  this licensee has been good."  </P> <P> But Saxon said the potential risk of an accident at the lab outweighs all other  considerations.  </P> <P> Since 1959, Rockwell has had NRC licenses to operate six other nuclear  facilities at its Santa Susana and Canoga Park plants, Cook said.  </P></p>

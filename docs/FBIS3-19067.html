			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said in the most  explicit manner that during the talks on the confidence-building  measures [CBM's], the UN secretary general's representatives  never directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, suggested  that the Greek Cypriot side would get Famagusta's fenced-off  area [Varosha] in exchange for recognizing the so-called Turkish  Cypriot passports.    In a written statement on press reports on safe access to  and  from Famagusta, Kliridhis added that they have no connection to  the UN suggestions. The president said that these press reports  give the United Nations the impression that we are trying to  create an excuse to reject the CBM's.</p>

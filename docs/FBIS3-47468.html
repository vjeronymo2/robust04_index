Saying Tokyo and Washington have agreed to do their utmost  to  achieve progress in bilateral framework trade talks, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that  the resurrection of the U.S. measure would run counter to the  accord.    "We want the U.S. to act cautiously," the top government  spokesman said.    "Super 301," in effect from 1988 to 1990, required the U.S.  Government to conduct an annual review of trade barriers abroad  and impose trade sanctions if those barriers were not removed  within a year.    Takemura's comment came after U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor said Wednesday the administration of President  Bill Clinton may renew the punitive measure through an executive  order in connection with bilateral trade "framework"  negotiations.    "That would be an option," Kantor told a group of Japanese  reporters.    Touching on the framework talks, Kantor said Washington will  insist on setting quantitative criteria to gauge the openness of  Japanese markets.    Japanese and U.S. negotiators have become bogged down on how  to define and set "objective criteria" in the negotiations,  which are being held under the bilateral trade framework accord  reached last July.    Washington wants to use the level of imports in other group  of seven major industrialized nations as the "norm" for Japan to  follow.    Japanese officials call the U.S. position unacceptable,  saying such measures would amount to setting aside a specific  market share for foreign goods and services, tantamount to  managed trade.    Earlier Thursday, a government source also expressed  displeasure about the potential revival of "Super 301."    "Negotiations will be impossible if they are based on  retaliatory actions," the source said.    Stressing that Tokyo will continue efforts to further open  the nation's markets, the source said Japan and the U.S. should  talk with each other on the principle of an equal partnership.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will meet Clinton on  February 11 in Washington to assess progress in the framework  talks.</p>

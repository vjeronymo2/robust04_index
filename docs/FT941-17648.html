			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Future of Work: Prepare to man the barricades - The plight of French industry There is not much life to be seen along the Roubaix Canal these days, particularly on a bitterly cold winter's morning. Viewed from here, the industrial heart of northern France is a grim, ghostly vision, a dark landscape of empty streets shrouded in fog. On the canalside, a man fishes where factory effluent has melted the ice. Shadowy figures move behind the steamy windows of the Cafe de Calais. All is silent, but for the muffled noises emerging from the old Fabrique Leroux next door. The sounds coming from the Leroux mill are not productive ones. After years of inactivity, the plant is being demolished piecemeal. Inside, a bulldozer and a team of Arab immigrant workers are vigorously smashing, pounding, cutting and burning. The work keeps them warm. But one man stands quietly in the cold, watching the world come banging down around him. He has come to rescue a few timbers from the fire on the factory floor in order to heat his own house. He has lingered to watch the hammers and flames destroy the only kind of work-place and life he knows. For this destruction he blames the sweatshops of Asia. In its heyday, the Leroux woollen mill employed 1,200 workers. Along with thousands of other factories it made the region surrounding Lille the largest and most prosperous textile centre in France. More than half of the country's fabrics and clothing came from this one small area on the Belgian border. Since the early 1960s, however, 75 per cent of the textile jobs have vanished; in the past 10 years alone, job numbers have plummeted from 110,000 to 48,000. As the mills disappear, the number of unemployed people continues to rise; in the Nord/Pas de Calais region, unemployment resulting from decline in the textile, mining and steel industries now approaches 250,000. Few of the 1,500 textile and clothing plants that remain are untouched by the crisis and the future of Roubaix mill workers, both in work and out, becomes ever less sure. Roger Glorieux's life has been anything but glorious. His father and grandfather were woollen mill workers. Roger started in Roubaix mills at 14 and stopped 45 years later when the plant in which he was employed as a machine maintenance mechanic closed down. 'At 74, it is hard to see it all go like this,' he says. 'We worked six days a week and it wasn't a luxurious life. We couldn't buy the things working people today can buy - if something breaks now, people just throw it away and buy another. We used to repair things. But, back then, at least we had work we could count on. You cannot do that today. I liked the life.' Like most of the residents of Roubaix, Glorieux has no hesitation when asked the reasons for his town's demise. 'It is many things but, mostly, it is south-east Asia. Workers there produce everything so cheaply. Salaries are low. Workers get by on a few bowls of rice a day. They do not take holidays. They work six days a week. Raw materials are cheap. Their bosses do not have to pay the social charges our bosses do  - pensions, unemployment insurance, paid holidays. Of course they can keep prices down. How can we compete against that?' But if Glorieux attributes Asian success partly to the kind of regime Frenchmen followed before the introduction of social legislation for workers in 1936, he also blames European mismanagement. 'It is partly the fault of the French government. They should have put a brake on cheap imports long ago. And now, with the European Union, it is even worse. We cannot control the frontiers; anything can come in.' A battered hand brings a roll-up cigarette to his mouth. 'It is also the fault of the bosses. They used to run their businesses like little kingdoms, each one looking after his own interests. They should have worked together. They have modernised now, but it is too late.' Is the situation beyond repair? 'The great days of the mills are over,' says Glorieux, with a Gallic shrug. 'We do not even wear that much wool any more. We must find other things to do, using the skills we have. My son is a computer programmer. But he is lucky. I feel sorry for the young ones who have nothing ahead of them.' On the whole, his analysis echoes that of industry and government pundits. Like them, he accepts the need to develop new kinds of jobs, new professions, new industries providing the region with a competitive edge; and, like them, he is not quite sure just what these might be. The fact is that, with no real solution in sight, most authorities in France are as anxious to preserve the past as embrace the uncertain future. In the face of unbeatable competition, they assert, the protection of old and ailing industries is the only way jobs can be preserved. The rules of global trade have become unfair, says Jean-Paul Robert, the secretary-general of GRIT, a regional grouping of textile industrialists. In France, employer-paid social provisions equal the cost of wage bills; in developing countries, there are often no provisions. Many non-European textile producers subsidise exports, practise dumping, copy styles and production techniques illegally and get round quotas by illegal imports or by 'Europeanising' products through minimum value added tax. All these practices render French textiles uncompetitive. In the past four years, imports from Thailand and other Asian countries have grown by 50 per cent; more than half the textiles on the European market are now imported. Worst, complains Robert, a system of unequal tariffs allows foreign textiles cheap access to European markets but, effectively, bars European producers from foreign markets. 'China is the great competitor of the future. It puts high tariffs on imports and pays its workers next to nothing. Yet it exports cheaply to Europe,' he says. 'It is unthinkable that we put Frenchmen out of work because of this. We are all for a Gatt agreement provided it is adjusted so the same rules apply to everyone. If it is not, we demand barriers that will protect us.' Suggest to Robert that, for all Roubaix's suffering, he is advocating measures that hinder developments in a new global economy, and he will tell you they are not developments the continent of Europe can survive. Suggest that protectionism is out of favour and he counters with his own provocative suggestion. 'Trade barriers may seem unfashionable,' he says, with a smile, 'but wait. It will not be long before they are back in fashion in Europe once again.'</p>

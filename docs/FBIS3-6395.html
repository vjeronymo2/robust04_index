			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa wants his March 19-21 visit to China to emphasize the  development of future ties with Japan's neighbor rather than  dwell too much on the past, government officials said.    During the trip that will take him to Beijing and Shanghai,  Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier  Li Peng to discuss bilateral and international affairs, Foreign  Ministry officials said.    In Shanghai, he will visit the Pudong development district  and attend a luncheon hosted by Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju.    The officials predict that recent exchanges between Japanese  and Chinese leaders will result in "frank discussions."    Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year.    Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  met Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in September, and  Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November. In  January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month.    Officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued  support for Beijing's market-oriented reforms and backing for  China's bid to become a member of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.    Hosokawa said earlier this week there are no major pending  issues between the two nations. He cited the signing of a  bilateral environmental treaty and discussions on North Korea's  alleged development of nuclear weapons as events scheduled  during the trip.    Japan has closely consulted with the United States, South  Korea and China over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  program, agreeing to seek a "diplomatic solution" to the problem.    Hosokawa is expected to urge Beijing to continue its efforts  to persuade Pyongyang to allow international inspections of all  its nuclear cites to eliminate international concern that it is  developing nuclear weapons, the officials said.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday  that North Korea refused to allow IAEA inspectors to conduct  tests at a laboratory in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers northwest  of the capital. Washington said a third round of talks with  Pyongyang, scheduled for Monday, would be postponed because of  the refusal.    Among other topics on the agenda for talks between Hosokawa  and the Chinese leaders are disarmament and bilateral  cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, the officials said.    The officials said both sides will confirm that Tokyo and  Beijing should work together to maintain the free trade system  in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum while  taking into account the region's diversity.    Japan and China will also seek to increase their dialogue on  security matters, they said.    Hosokawa may be briefed by the Chinese on Sino-U.S.  relations  in the wake of last week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, the officials said. In that connection,  Hosokawa may urge China to take immediate steps to improve its  human rights record "in a way understandable to the  international community," according to government sources.    Hosokawa is also likely to voice concern over China's  increasing defense expenditure and call for greater openness or  "transparency" in its defense budget, the sources said. Last  week China announced an increase of some 22.4 percent over 1993  in its defense budget to 52.04 billion yuan (about 653 billion  yen), up from last year's 42.5 billion yuan (about 533 billion  yen).    The officials said Hosokawa will also call on Beijing to  institute a permanent ban on nuclear tests and ensure the  peaceful transition of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997.  China resumed nuclear tests in October.    Hosokawa also plans to offer an apology over Japan's wartime  atrocities by citing examples of such actions by the Japanese  Imperial Army, but the specific wording has yet to be worked  out, sources close to the prime minister said.    Hosokawa is also expected to tell the Chinese side what kind  of projects Japan is interested in extending yen loans for from  fiscal 1996. The Chinese Government has not yet given Japan an  official list of projects it wants the loans to cover.    Under the environment cooperation treaty to be signed during  Hosokawa's visit, Japan will provide China with technology to  combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in the wake of  China's rapid industrialization the officials said.    In the cultural field, Hosokawa is to pledge Japanese  financial cooperation to restore Sheyuan Palace in the ancient  capital of Xian, the officials said.</p>

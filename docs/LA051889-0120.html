			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO RETAINS MODERATE COUNCIL;  </P> <P> PARTON LEADS 'CLEAN SWEEP' OF CONTROLLED-GROWTH CANDIDATES  </P> <P> In a runoff election that retains a moderate-growth alignment on the City  Council, Redondo Beach voters have selected 28-year-old W. Brad Parton as the  city's new mayor, reelected Councilwoman Kay Horrell to a second term in  District 2 and brought in newcomer Terry Ward to represent District 4.  </P> <P> The outcome was a "clean sweep . . . (that) put the people in place that we  need to accomplish a series of things," said District 5 Councilman Ron Cawdry,  a member of the majority in power over the last four years.  </P> <P> Cawdry, who was not up for reelection, said he campaigned hard for the three  winners. He introduced them to an exuberant crowd at Horrell's victory  celebration at Pancho and Wong's restaurant late Tuesday night after the votes  were tabulated.  </P> <P> The series of things to be accomplished, he said later, include completing a  revised General Plan, developing more park space and rebuilding King Harbor and  the Redondo Pier, which were devastated by floods and a fire last year.  </P> <P> The minority on the new council, after the runoff winners are sworn in Tuesday,  will be Councilwoman Barbara Doerr, who won the District 1 seat in the March  general election after serving eight years as mayor, and Councilman Stevan  Colin, who was elected to the District 3 post in 1988.  </P> <P> There was a runoff because no candidates for the three posts at stake Tuesday  received a majority of votes in the March balloting.  </P> <P> Parton, who owns a retirement investment firm, received 3,669 votes, or 55.7%  of the total cast, while his runoff opponent, architect Frank Bostrom, got  2,914, or 44.3%  </P> <P> In the District 2 race, real estate agent Horrell won with 891 votes, or 52.4%,  compared to 811, or 47.6%, for Michael F. Ford, a real estate appraiser. Ward,  a data communications consultant, took the District 4 seat with 528 votes, or  52.2%, while school board member Valerie Dombrowski received 483, or 47.8%.  </P> <P> Dombrowski narrowly missed victory in the general election, falling only four  votes short of the 50%-plus-one majority needed to be declared the winner.  </P> <P> She said her chances in the runoff were hurt by personal attacks on her family  from Ward's supporters and by Ward's success in registering about 150 new  voters who supported his candidacy.  </P> <P> "But I'm not bitter," Dombrowski said. "I'm not shattered."  </P> <P> At her victory party, Horrell faulted the losing faction for being "so negative  and down on everything. . . . I think they scared some voters by their meat-ax  approach" to the city's concerns about overdevelopment and traffic congestion.  </P> <P> In response to those concerns, Horrell said, the present council has  "practically downzoned the entire city" over the past four years. She said she  believes the new council "will continue to take a moderate approach that allows  for quality, controlled growth."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stricter Limits  </P> <P> The opposition faction, which advocated stricter limits on growth, blamed the  outcome Tuesday on what Bostrom called "dirty political tactics" and on heavy  campaign spending by the winners.  </P> <P> Parton, Horrell and Ward spent a total of about $60,000, compared to about  $15,000 by the three opposing candidates, Bostrom, Ford and Dombrowski.  </P> <P> Mayoral candidate Bostrom, who watched at City Hall as his opponent seized a  commanding lead in votes at the outset and maintained it to the end, blamed his  defeat on a last-minute mailer sent out by Parton over the weekend.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind," Bostrom said, characterizing Parton's mailer  as a "hit piece" that used "character-assassination" tactics. He provided  copies of flyers that suggested Bostrom had a "hidden agenda" for development  in Redondo Beach and that questioned statements in Bostrom's resume about his  accomplishments as an architect and volunteer community worker.  </P> <P> The mailer asserted that Bostrom was one of three candidates "backed by the  political machine."  </P> <P> Parton, who raised the specter of a political machine frequently during the  runoff campaign, said in an interview last week that he was referring to a  "tight, little group that attacks me in a variety of ways but doesn't get down  to the issues." He declined to be more specific.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cardinal Error'  </P> <P> Bostrom said he had a response mailer prepared but decided not to send it out  because the cost would have pushed him over a self-imposed limit of $10,000 on  campaign spending.  </P> <P> "I probably made a cardinal error, politically," he said. "But I said, '$10,000  is my limit and I'm not going to spend another nickel.' "  </P> <P> He predicted that Parton, who depicted himself as an independent in the  campaign, would buckle under pressure from developers during his tenure as  mayor.  </P> <P> At a boisterous victory celebration at his home, Parton was busy making  telephone calls to supporters, including his parents in San Jose and a close  friend in New York. He defended his mailers as "all fact" and attributed his  victory to hard work, which he said focused on walking much of the city  door-to-door.  </P> <P> Voters also liked his independent stance, he said. "I was not part of any  slate," he said. "I was out there running on my own."  </P> <P> On the campaign spending issue, Parton said he needed to spend more money than  Bostrom because his opponent had been backed by politically well-known figures,  such as Doerr and Dombrowski.  </P> <P> Parton also discounted Bostrom's prediction that he would be influenced by  developers. "I've got my ethics and my integrity," he said.  </P> <P> Ward, who will replace outgoing Councilman Archie Snow in District 4, seemed a  bit flabbergasted by his victory over Dombrowski, a longtime community activist  and school trustee for 12 years.  </P> <P> "I came from behind (after the March election)," said Ward, a political novice.  "But we managed to build momentum . . . the more I walked and talked, the  better I fit in with how (voters) felt," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Development Views  </P> <P> He said the voters he met generally agreed with his views on development. "I've  said from the beginning that I want controlled, quality growth," he said. "But  I don't think we can stop growth entirely, because if you stop growth, you  die."  </P> <P> Tuesday night also was sweet for Snow, who lost his bid for the mayor's post in  March and then went on to campaign for Ward. "I kind of like the way things  turned out," he said above the clamor at Horrell's party.  </P> <P> Snow was viewed by some as the council majority's leader during his eight years  in office, in part because of his frequent verbal clashes with former Mayor  Doerr. The City Charter barred both from running for third terms in their  respective posts.  </P> <P> Colin, who has been Doerr's only ally during his first year on the council,  struck a conciliatory note Wednesday at the conclusion of the often-rancorous  campaign.  </P> <P> "I look forward to working with Brad, and I think he will be a good mayor," he  said. "I don't know a lot about Terry (Ward) yet, but I think he'll be fair. .  . . Basically, we all want to do what's best for Redondo Beach."  </P></p>

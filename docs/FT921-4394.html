			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's futures, options charges to double COMMISSIONS on stock futures and options trading on Japan's stock exchanges will be doubled from March 23. The increase is the first in commission on futures and options contracts in Japan. The move comes as a surge in trading in the Nikkei 225 futures listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) has been blamed for the price volatility in the underlying cash market on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The TSE raised margins on arbitrage trading between the futures and cash markets three times last year. The OSE denied the move was designed to limit activity in the derivatives markets. 'The price difference in commissions between the futures and cash markets is too large, and is unfair,' it said. For example, commission on cash stock trading worth Y100m would total Y385,000, while commissions on Y100m worth of futures would be Y40,000. The announcement comes amid debate on liberalisation of fixed-cash stock commissions. Market participants said trading on the Nikkei futures last Friday was not affected by the measures, announced that day, but it predicted negative long-term effects. 'The rise in commissions will drive small-lot players away, reducing market liquidity,' said a derivatives trader at a leading US brokerage. The move is also expected to drive business to offshore markets - such as the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - which offer trading in Nikkei 225 futures. Trading in Simex's Nikkei 225 contracts has surged during the past two months, with daily average volume rising from last year's 3,045 contracts to last month's 6,789. Costs of trading on the Simex will be around half of that of the OSE after its commissions are raised. The move will affect brokerage commissions of the OSE Nikkei 225 futures and options, TSE's Topix futures and options, and Nagoya's Option 25.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS STRAND 25, BEAT BRAVES IN 12TH INNING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: SHARPERSON'S ONE-OUT, BASES-LOADED SINGLE DRIVES IN WINNING RUN IN  5-4 VICTORY. LOS ANGELES SETS MAJOR LEAGUE RECORD FOR 12-INNING GAME.  </P> <P> After 5 hours 3 minutes, after stranding a club-record 25 runners on base,  after struggling into the 12th inning, the Dodgers finally edged the Atlanta  Braves Friday night, 5-4, when Mike Sharperson bounced a single over the head  of second baseman Jeff Treadway with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Sharperson's hit also ended a evening of personal frustration. He had gone  hitless in his first seven at-bats in the Dodger Stadium marathon.  </P> <P> The 25 runners left on is also a major league record for a 12-inning game.  </P> <P> The two sides used a total of 41 players, issued 22 walks, accounted for 20  hits, committed four errors and left 33 runners stranded in all.  </P> <P> Dave Justice's ninth-inning home run had tied the game, much to the  disappointment of the Dodger Stadium crowd of 40,907.  </P> <P> The game began at an agonizingly slow pace, but the Braves wasted little time  in scoring.  </P> <P> After Dodger starter Terry Wells had walked Jim Presley to open the second  inning, DaleMurphy slammed his 16th home run of the season deep into the  left-field pavilion between the 370- and 385-foot sign to give the Braves a 2-0  lead.  </P> <P> The home run was memorable for Murphy, moving him past Ralph Kiner into a tie  with Gil Hodges and Dave Winfield for 33rd on the all-time list.  </P> <P> But the night was anything but memorable for Wells.  </P> <P> After Murphy's home run, Wells seemed to lose his control and, perhaps, his  hope of filling that troublesome fifth spot in the Dodger rotation. The next  two Braves got aboard. Then Wells got ahead of Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine with  two quick strikes, only to walk him, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Goodby Wells.  </P> <P> Mike Hartley came on to turn the Braves back without any further damage for the  moment, but there seems no relief in sight as the Dodgers continue their  frustrating search for a replacement for injured Orel Hershiser.  </P> <P> John Wetteland, Mike Maddux, Tim Crews and Wells have all taken a shot. The  result is a 1-7 mark over 13 starts.  </P> <P> Things weren't much brighter Friday night on the Braves' side where Glavine  also did plenty of struggling.  </P> <P> Glavine gave up two runs in the third. Hubie Brooks got one home on a fielder's  choice after a double by Kirk Gibson and a walk to Kal Daniels. Glavine gave up  the other on a bases-loaded walk to Jose Vizcaino.  </P> <P> In all, Glavine, who had walked a total of six over his last four starts,  walked that many through 4 1/3 innings Friday.  </P> <P> At that point, he departed after giving up back-to-back singles to Juan Samuel  and Vizcaino.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn then got Samuel home on a sacrifice fly to left off  Doug Sisk.  </P> <P> Then the scoring went back and forth, the Braves getting a run in the seventh  to tie it, 3-3, and the Dodgers going ahead 4-3 in the bottom of that inning.  Justice's home run in the top of the ninth put it in extra innings, 4-4.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Better luck last time: Tom Glavine was also the starter for the Braves last  July 27th. That day, Dale Murphy hit two home runs behind him as Glavine  breezed over the San Francisco Giants, 10-1.  </P> <P> After being examined by Dr. Matthew Bernstein Friday, Alfredo Griffin appeared  as a pinch-hitter later in the night, but he continues to have problems with  his left eye, which is still sensitive to light. The eye injury is a lingering  result of a fight in a Pittsburgh bar last weekend. Griffin will be re-examined  Monday. . . . Pitchers Don Aase and Pat Perry, both recovering from shoulder  problems, threw before the game. Aase pitched a simulated game for about 15  minutes. Perry threw in the bullpen.  </P></p>

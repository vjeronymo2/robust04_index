			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Deal for Sun Microsystems: Sun Microsystems Inc. said it had signed  licensing agreements with two Taiwanese computer clone makers, strengthening  its bid to make its computer architecture an industry standard. Datatech  Enterprises Co. and Tatung Co. will begin next year making low-cost computer  workstations based on Sun's Sparc microprocessor technology, Sun said. Sun, of  Mountain View, Calif., hopes that by signing licensing agreements it will be  able to entice more software developers to write application software for Sparc  machines, which would make them more attractive to large corporate customers.  </P></p>

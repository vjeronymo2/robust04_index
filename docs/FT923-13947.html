			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hafnia downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's HAFNIA, the Danish insurance group which came close to going into receivership last weekend, has had its credit rating downgraded from A to BBB. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, said the downgrading took Hafnia to the lowest rating of any European insurance group. Hafnia will stay on creditwatch, said S&amp;P, pending the successful implementation of a DKr2bn (Dollars 348m) share issue, launched on Monday, and clarification of unauthorised financial commitments by a senior manager, which Hafnia claims have cost the company an unrealised loss of about DKr350m. Hafnia's problems centre on its 'two highly-illiquid and rapidly-deteriorating strategic stakes' in Danish insurance group Baltica and Swedish insurer Skandia, said S&amp;P in a statement yesterday. 'Only the resolution of the strategic impasse will bring any lasting stability to the Hafnia group, though this may be at the expense of its independence,' it said. Hafnia has a 34 per cent holding in Baltica Holding and 14.8 per cent in Skandia. The deterioration in the value of these holdings, as well as other share and bond holdings, had by July 2 reduced Hafnia Holding's equity to a negative DKr450m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "People's Party Sets Election in </F> Fall of 1995"]    [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party national leadership  has centered its political strategy on the certainty that Felipe  Gonzalez will call a general election in the fall of 1995, with  October as the month most likely to witness this new appointment  with the polls, according to what prominent leaders with offices  on Genova Street have told this newspaper.    According to the same sources, this conviction is based on  the fact that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] has  only two choices when it comes to attempting to win a new term  in power, in view of the fact that the current government has  shown itself in just six months' existence to be "incapable of  facing up to its minimum responsibilities." These choices would  be to hold the general election before the successive timetable  of municipal and European elections -- both of which are  scheduled for this year -- or else to postpone it "in order not  to acknowledge this government's failure so obviously by  dissolving it after less than a year's existence," according to  People's Party leadership members.  <H5>  Madrid Test </H5>   The People's Party strategists see this second option as  more  feasible, so the general election would be held when the echoes  of the autonomous community elections are still ringing in  political offices. In this connection, particular importance is  attached to the results in the Madrid community.    "Leguina will not be running, because he himself has said  so,  and it is for him to say," Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, People's  Party spokesman in the Senate, recently assured this newspaper.  In the People's Party leadership's opinion, the candidates for  the succession to the current Madrid premier are Jose  Barrionuevo and, to a lesser extent, Juan Barranco. Barrionuevo  worries the People's Party because he is regarded as "a worthy  man with an image, and very popular in Madrid." This is not the  case with Barranco, "who is always playing a double game" --  referring to his "calculated" fence-sitting between the  renewalists and Guerraists -- "in order not to miss any boat,"  according to the sources.    The People's Party believes that the next autonomous  community elections are its big chance to govern the Madrid  community as an essential step toward reaching the Moncloa  Palace, "in view of the showcase status which Madrid has in the  rest of the state."    Not to win the 51 seats giving an absolute majority in the  Madrid Assembly would be deemed a major failure by the People's  Party, and Ruiz Gallardon himself acknowledged to YA that "if I  do not win a majority, then it will be time to say good-bye."    The People's Party takes it for granted that the capital's  city council is assured, although the PSOE will seek a `poster'  candidate with an image to compete with Alvarez del Manzano. In  this case, Genova Street's greatest fear is that the PSOE will  opt for Fernando Moran, who is credited with "sufficient pulling  power" to threaten the municipal majority.  <H5>  European Elections </H5>   As a first step in the People's Party strategy for tackling  the general election, the debate centers on whether the European  elections, scheduled for 12 June, should be tackled as a  "primary" or a "special" election, prone to surprises and  "exotic, Ruiz Mateos-style" candidacies, according to People's  Party leadership members.  For the present, the view that Jose Maria Aznar should openly  support Abel Matutes' candidacy for Strasbourg seems to be that  of the majority, because a victory in Europe -- which the  European People's Party deems more than feasible -- would be a  good starting point at the national level.    Another basic factor which will mark the People's Party  strategy for the hypothetical date of October 1995 -- apart from  the evolution of the crisis -- will be the outcome of the 33d  PSOE Congress, which will reflect -- according to the People's  Party leaders consulted -- the party's true correlation of  forces, and which therefore will make it possible to guess which  candidates the Socialist Party will put forward in the election  and especially whether it will continue to set aside its  internal differences in order to present an image of unity for  the polls.  <H5>  CiU Would Remain Key Factor </H5>   The People's Party team of election strategists -- a team in  which Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy has emerged as the  strong man (he will direct the People's Party campaign for the  European elections) -- do not trust Felipe Gonzalez' signs of  approaching retirement. "He is always giving signs, but never  acts," YA was told by the People's Party leadership.  Nevertheless, if Gonzalez did not run for the premiership in  1995, the People's Party believes that this would smooth much of  its way toward being the party with most votes.    However, the strategists themselves take it for granted that  this victory will be very far from securing an absolute  majority, so the nationalist parties, and specifically  Convergence and Union [CiU], would remain a key factor for the  stability of the legislative term. People's Party leaders  flatly reject the possibility of a "Greek-style pact" with the  United Left, and take it for granted that "the PSOE will not  wish to burn itself out with us."    Relations between CiU and the People's Party are "terrible,"  it is asserted in the People's Party. However, there is a  conviction that, if the situation arose, it could have Catalan  support. "Roca would justify himself by saying that he was  helping us for the country's good, and in the meantime he would  continue to work for Catalonia," the sources state. "But he  should be clear," they add, "that we will not be as soft as the  PSOE."</p>

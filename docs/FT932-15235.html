			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei peaks as Hang Seng accelerates in London EQUITIES climbed by 4.3 per cent to a new 1993 peak as the announcement of Japan's Y13,200bn supplementary budget to resuscitate the economy triggered active buying from dealers, arbitragers and public fund managers, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 858.15 higher at 20,740.29, after reaching an intraday high of 20,753.74 during the final minutes of trading and opening at its session low of 19,902.42. The last time the average closed above this level was March last year. Volume shot up again to 750m shares compared with Monday's 336.6m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 1,055 to 65, with 66 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section issues rose 53.35 to 1,608.76 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.75 to 1,268.43. Traders had initially expected share prices to fall since the stimulus package, although the largest ever, was in line with expectations. However, hopes of a sustained bullish trend offset concerns over weak economic fundamentals. Mr Ryoji Tanaka, head of Japanese equity trading at Kidder Peabody International, said that most investors believed that additional buying will enter the market as the Nikkei average has settled above the 20,000 level. Large-capitalisation stocks were bought aggressively, with Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, settling Y16 higher to Y409 while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose Y27 to Y682. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the recent market rally, closed up Y40,000 at a session high of Y1.07m. Reports that the fiscal package announced yesterday included government investments in telecommunications infrastructure encouraged broadly based buying in the sector. Nippon Comsys, the telecommunications engineer, soared Y130 to Y1,400. Electric wire and cable issues were also strong with Fujikura up Y40 to Y1,040 and Furukawa Electric rising Y23 to Y724. Exporters were higher in spite of the higher yen. Hitachi rose Y39 to Y908, Sony gained Y200 to Y5,000 and Toyota Motor advanced Y50 to Y1,740. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 660.89 to settle at 22,113.38 in volume of 33m shares. Roundup WIDELY divergent routes were taken by equity markets around the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG went into a slow burn. Shares surged 2.1 per cent in anticipation of the announcement, which came after the market closed, of a resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's future. The Hang Seng index rose 132.54 to 6,418.21 as turnover improved slightly to HKDollars 2.54bn. The mood subsequently carried over into London trading of Hong Kong shares. HG Asia in London said that prices peaked at the equivalent of a further 300 point rise in the Hang Seng before settling to close 275 ahead at 6,693. One analyst said: 'This was a big surge for trading in London but we are used to this kind of volatility.' Gains in Hong Kong were recorded across the board, with banks and utilities leading the way. HSBC Holdings, which topped the actives list, climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69.50 and Hong Kong Telecom rose 20 cents to HKDollars 10. Jardine Matheson bounced HKDollars 2 higher to HKDollars 48 on hopes of a thaw in Sino-British relations. There was also talk of disposal of its Hongkong Land subsidiary, on which the group declined comment. AUSTRALIA closed at a 17-month high, taking its lead from the strength of the Japanese and US markets. The All Ordinaries index rose 23.0 to 1688.7, its highest since November 11, 1991. BOMBAY ended with slight gains in a declining market on intervention by the state-owned Unit Trust of India. The BSE index rose 13 to 2,235, having fallen in early trading to a 14-month low of 2,175. KARACHI closed lower on political uncertainty after the resignations of two more cabinet ministers and the 100-share index ended 15.53 down at 1,094.11. SEOUL failed to maintain the momentum that took shares to an 18-month high on Monday and the composite index edged 0.44 lower to 720.52 in turnover of Won807.9bn after Monday's Won933.2bn. SINGAPORE was prey to profit-taking after last week's rally and the Straits Times Industrial index shed 14.33 to 1,693.51. TAIWAN was lower for the fifth straight day in thin turnover. The weighted index spent most of the session moderately easier before a late wave of selling pushed it down 84.61 or 1.8 per cent to 4,597.66.</p>

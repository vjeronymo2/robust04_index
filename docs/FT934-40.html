			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Catering for those in-flight requirements - The flotation of Alpha, the airport services operation being spun off by Forte A red light flashes and a siren wails shortly after an innocent vegetarian leaves the check-in desk at Heathrow. The passenger has thrown a spanner in the works by responding to the airline's routine question on dietary requirements. The warning is sounding in the heart of the kitchen where the meals are being prepared for the flight. It might be only an hour before take-off, but by the time the plane taxis onto the runway a vegetarian meal with the passenger's name on it will be aboard, ready for serving. Lights and sirens might at first seem over the top for a catering company, but the statistics involved in getting food ready for airlines leave no room for error. The warning, perched atop a glass and steel cabinet containing a computer, cannot be ignored. A manager opens the cabinet, keys in a personal code and the instruction. The message and the answer are numbered. The control centre can relax in the sure knowledge that the special requirement will be catered for. In order to serve the passengers on a modern jumbo jet 40 meal carts have to be loaded. They contain 33,000 pieces of equipment. Add on the food items, and the total reaches 46,000 items on any flight where two meals are served. As Mr Paul Harrison, managing director of Forte Airport Services, explains, the business is as much concerned with logistics as with catering. At the end of next month the company, founded 35 years ago, is being spun off from Forte. It is expected to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 200m and will be known as Alpha. Forte will retain a 25 per cent stake. Alpha made operating profits of Pounds 17.2m on turnover of Pounds 404.5m for the year ending January 1993. Its sales are split 50:50 between airline catering and airport retail. At busy airports the retail side adds what are known as 'the weepers and greeters' to the passengers as potential customers. But 70 per cent of the profits are expected to come from airline catering, where Alpha will be the UK market leader, with 48 per cent of the business. In the first half to end July, operating profits were Pounds 11.7m on sales of Pounds 207m. Heathrow, the world's biggest airport, is the most competitive arena for in-flight catering - with nine companies fighting for market share. Alpha's Heathrow division usually prepares 14,000 meals a day, although its maximum capacity is 20,000 meals. However, the total Alpha flight catering business supplies 45m meals a year to 150 airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, All Nippon Airways and Pakistan International. Mr Andrew Murphy, director of the Heathrow operation, aims to run things with military precision, but also to remain flexible. 'If it's foggy or raining I know I've got a very interesting day ahead,' he says. Diversions to other airports play havoc with schedules, while a delayed flight can turn an order for breakfast into an order for lunch. Hence the importance of the computerised control centre, and the outlying terminals complete with sirens and lights in every department of the operation. The progress of each flight is followed on a screen linked direct to the airport. The catering is logged separately, flight by flight, with a simple system using red and green lights to show the progress or otherwise of each meal. The cycle begins with the offloading of used meal carts from an aircraft. The dirty crockery is sorted and the rubbish sent to a compactor that can deal with 7.5 tonnes a day. The carts themselves are sent through a huge washer and sterilised. The crockery is put onto belts and sent through huge washers. The cutlery is washed, burnished in a machine that shakes it in ball bearings, and washed again. The whole process takes just one hour. Goods are delivered on a just-in-time basis and there is remarkably little on the premises at any one time. There are five daily deliveries of 20 different types of rolls, and fruit and vegetables arrive at least twice a day from two suppliers. In one year 1m cartons of milk, 400,000 cheese portions and 150,000 kilos of fresh strawberries are delivered. However, there are no baked beans or sprouts - for the obvious reasons. The goods pass to the preparation department, where exactly the right amount for each flight is loaded onto a numbered trolley. Here can be found a woman cutting 74 lemons into eight slices each by hand - airlines do not use enough to make a machine worthwhile. But there are slicing machines that can be programmed to cut a particular weight. In the kitchen proper, the chefs are hard at work. One trolley contains enough ingredients for 350 Lufthansa breakfasts. While the chefs can produce Halal food, Japanese and French cuisine, some of which is very labour intensive, some of the simple things are just as demanding - one man can spend his eight hour shift juggling four pans to produce 1,100 omelettes. The cooked items are quickly blast chilled and sent through to the assembly department, where all the numbered trolleys are brought together. The department co-ordinates the equipment from the wash, the dry goods, cooked meals, right down to the chocolate mint. The 'bible' of the department is the specification book, which contains notes and full colour pictures of the tray that will be served to passengers. This ensures that the company is keeping close to the menu agreed with each airline customer. The trays are loaded onto meal carts and sprayed with a 'snow' of dry ice, and then sent to the holding fridge. When they are loaded onto a truck for the airport, the control centre logs them carefully and the truck is sealed. Without the right seal and documentation it will not get into the airport. It takes three specialist trucks, costing Pounds 110,000 each, to load a jumbo. Given such a complex operation, it is hardly surprising that computerisation is used. For back-up, the control centre relies on a chart system known as the Mayfly, as each chart lives for only 24 hours. And if all else fails? 'We use the Tannoy,' grins Mr Murphy.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Genny opens London store GENNY is an Italian label that does not have the high profile of a Versace or an Armani but has become a favourite with many a busy, working woman as well as with some of the more lively glitterati of the Italian social scene. Monica Vitti, Princess Pignatelli and Isabella Rossellini are just a few of Genny's fans. For some time a small selection from the line has been available at Browns of South Molton Street and at Harrods but this week Browns has given Genny a separate shop at 18, South Molton Street, London W1 where a much broader range of Genny can be seen. Besides her beautifully soft and understated suits for day which many a working woman adopts with a sigh of relief there are some delicious pieces for the evening - simple empire-line velvet dresses (around Pounds 400) and some flirty double-layered chiffon numbers in chocolate brown or black (Pounds 600). The hallmark of her collection is its simplicity and a new-found softness - many of the pieces are ageless and could become the main prop around which a wardrobe could be built. The picture, above, perfectly sums up this winter's day-time look.</p>

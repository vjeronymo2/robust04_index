			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Susan St. James said Tuesday that if "Kate &amp; Allie" gets picked up by CBS  for another year, she won't be back. "My reasons for not coming back and  re-signing would strictly be that I have two small kids, as well as two older  ones, and they would kind of like to see me around," St. James said on ABC's  "Good Morning America." She has co-starred for six years with Jane Curtin as  divorced women sharing an apartment. Curtin's character, Allie, remarried this  season. "I don't know what everyone else's plans are. I couldn't speak for  them. The network hasn't even called." St. James said she was happy with the  "freshness" of the show this season -- it added new characters -- but not with  the way CBS has bounced it around the schedule. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

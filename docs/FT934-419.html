			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: Lessons of a splendid time for gilts - London You would think, from the fuss that has been made about the stock market's performance in the last few months, that 1993 had been a particularly fruitful year for equity investors. In fact, the 20.6 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index from the end of last year to the middle of this week is good but not spectacular. If these gains are preserved until December 31, this will only be the tenth best year since 1970, ranking below all but one of the years of the great 1980s rally. The really striking performance by historical standards this year has come from gilts. The FT Government Securities index passed the 100 mark for the first time in years, and the FT-Actuaries All Stocks index of gilts rose 10.4 per cent, the highest figure since 1982 and one of only five double-digit rises in nearly a quarter century. Gilts benefited from a worldwide fall in interest rates - the long end of the US treasury market apart - and from a belief that chancellor Kenneth Clarke's first Budget represented a serious attempts to get the government's borrowing under control. In the past month, gilts have delivered the best performance of all the world's main government bond markets. Still, when you take dividends and interest into account, equities retain the lead for the year as a whole. The FT's latest Monday table, showing the total return on all asset classes, gives a 22 per cent return on 7-10 year gilts and a 28 per cent return on UK equities. This comparison is a tribute to the traditionally generous dividend policy of UK companies. It also tells us something important about the way companies have weathered the recession. Though 1993's dividends were paid on results ravaged by the recession, they stayed high: in fact, on S G Warburg's estimates the market paid out 6 1/2 per cent more in dividends this year than it did last. You can interpret the grim determination with which British boards kept up their dividends in two ways, optimistic and pessimistic. The optimistic view is that if UK plc was still able and willing to raise dividends in the teeth of the recession, it will be committed to keeping them growing in the years to come. Steady dividend growth and low long-term interest rates will provide a strong valuation underpinning for the market. That will help push the FT-SE to the 4,000 mark that is being talked about as the next peak on the horizon, now that 3,500 looks comfortably within reach. The pessimistic case is that keeping dividends up has strained historical ratios. Cover - the extent to which dividends are covered by earnings - has dropped to around 1.5 or so, if you exclude the utilities, a figure that is well below traditional levels. The normal pattern is that as the economy recovers, profits rise sharply and cover is rapidly restored. But, as a letter from a reader, A H Carter, of Kempsey, near Worcester, points out, the low inflation rate which has contributed to low bond yields and this year's stock market performance has another consequence. He argues that lower inflation will cap prices. 'There are 1bn workers in China and eastern Europe willing to work for under Pounds 2 an hour,' he says, 'and they will be given the opportunity.' These factors will limit profit gains. Cover will need to be rebuilt, so 'dividends may rise, but only marginally.' His conclusion is that as interest rates fall, investors will again become risk averse, and equity yields will end up higher than the yield on gilts, as used to be the case until the 1960s. Even without pushing the argument that far, Carter has a point. Is equity enthusiasm based in part on a fervent belief in a free lunch? There are many aspects of low inflation which are good for equities: falling interest rates, a more stable business environment, and so on. But the supply-side factors that hold prices down, including overcapacity and the growing competition from low-cost producers, are not good for those companies exposed to them. The chart of the best and worst-performing sectors in the All-Share, shown above, may be hinting at some of these forces. Not surprisingly, the best performers are companies that stand to benefit most from low interest rates, especially property companies and banks. In general, though, all the sectors with specially strong performances this year benefit from being protected from the price competition that has become endemic among manufacturers. Down at the bottom of the performance rankings come sectors where pricing power is under threat. Food retailers and manufacturers, for example, risk a supermarket price war. The pharmaceutical companies that dominate the health and household sector face a worldwide attack on drugs prices by governments and health insurers. And the drinks companies' strategy of pushing up margins to compensate for flat or falling volumes has run into problems this year. Perhaps the striking outperformance of smaller companies, shown in the other chart, also owes something to this factor. Smaller companies, in general, are better protected from the fierce winds of international price competition than their larger rivals. And the second-tier stocks - those represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 index - are dominated by utilities, with regulated prices. Even commercial television companies face greater competition, though you might not think so from the performance of media stocks, up 33 per cent on the year. The driving factor here, of course, has been the rush to merge, leading to the hostile bid by Granada for LWT. As the industry switched off its collective brain for the Christmas viewing season, the outcome of the bid was still in doubt. LWT's main defence manoeuvre - an elaborate attempt to merge with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, then sell off the Tyne Tees franchise to Anglia - seemed to be getting nowhere. That left the LWT board to appeal for shareholder loyalty on the basis of an exemplary management record. Since Granada's cash alternative is a low one, shareholders will mostly be deciding on the basis of its offer of shares. They will have to make up their minds whether they prefer the long-standing performance record of the LWT team to the impressive recovery staged by the new men at Granada. The City has been enjoying the week before Christmas, cheerfully playing the traditional festive game of squeezing market makers caught short of stock ahead of the holidays - a routine which contributed to yesterday's 40.8 point rise in the FT-SE 100 index, to a new record close of 3,396.5. During the day, the index passed through the 3,400 level for the first time. The week also saw a flurry of corporate news. Lasmo eased its debt problems by selling a stake in the Liverpool Bay gas field to PowerGen. Together with a clutch of other assets, this raised Pounds 123m. Unilever strengthened its position in the ice-cream business - one of its strongest sectors - by buying control of France's biggest independent producer Ortiz-Miko. The company has 18 per cent of total French ice-cream sales, giving Unilever the country's sales leadership, with roughly a third of the market. The deal is valued at around Pounds 220m, a mouthful for most companies but no more than a threepenny cornet for Unilever. Perhaps the biggest corporate development, however, was the government's announcement that it plans to open all British Gas's domestic markets to competition. The shares had reached a record high of 360p last week, as investors decided that the government was not, after all, going to break up British Gas. Though Tuesday's announcement confirmed that guess, the news of the competition decision came as a nasty shock. The shares lost 10p on the day, closing yesterday at 336 1/2 p, a fall of 20 1/2 p since last week. It was yet another piece of evidence that even in the utility sector, price competition is breaking out all over.</p>

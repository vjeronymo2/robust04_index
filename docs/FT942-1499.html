			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Tougher rules planned for pensions: Fraud prevention targeted in white paper - Regulator would enforce standards A far-reaching overhaul of the occupational pensions industry, with the proposed creation of a regulator with powers to enforce common standards, was unveiled by the government yesterday. Its white paper was tougher than had been expected, endorsing many of the proposals urged nine months ago by its own advisory panel, the Goode Committee. The paper also proposes that pension schemes meet minimum solvency standards, allow members to appoint at least a third of their scheme's trustees, and contribute to a compensation scheme that will pay pensions if assets disappear through fraud. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the prevention of fraud was at the heart of his proposals. He emphasised that no single measure could provide a satisfactory defence against fraud, but claimed the new arrangements could have prevented the Maxwell pensions scandal had they been on the statute book some years ago. Mr Lilley said his proposals would 'strengthen the whole pensions industry by providing the three basic essentials of security, equality and choice'. Industry reaction to the white paper was generally supportive, although employers, scheme advisers and the pension industry's trade association all expressed some reservations. Industry professionals estimate pension schemes will have to spend 10 times the Pounds 60m to Pounds 140m that the government says is needed to meet the new standards. The Goode Committee was formed in June 1992 following the death of Robert Maxwell and the subsequent discovery that more than Pounds 440m had disappeared from pension schemes he controlled. The government proposes, however, that the regulator be less powerful than suggested by the Goode Committee. It will have to rely largely on 'whistle-blowing' by professional advisers and scheme members to uncover wrongdoing and will not routinely inspect scheme financial statements. Also, contrary to recommendations that it be financed from general revenues, the government proposes that a levy on industry finances a budget of about Pounds 10m. Labour criticised the white paper as failing to ensure the regulator would be independent. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, accused the government of making a mistake in deciding the industry should pay for the regulator, instead of the state, saying 'people will not trust a regulator that is not independent of the industry'. Employers will have up to 10 years to meet new minimum solvency standards in full. However, once they begin to take effect, employers whose schemes have less than 90 per cent of assets needed to pay liabilities will have to add additional cash almost immediately, a proposal which the industry had opposed. The white paper proposes eliminating guaranteed minimum pensions and substituting a new protection against inflation. It will be required to increase pensions in payment by 5 per cent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. The white paper proposes linking tax rebates for personal pension holders to their age and allowing those about to retire some flexibility in buying an annuity. Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, criticised the proposal to make schemes pay for the cost of the regulator. 'Regulation should be paid for by the state if - as we believe - it is in the national interest for pension funds to be regulated effectively.' Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said the role of the regulator was too limited.

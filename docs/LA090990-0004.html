			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Have you been contemplating the artistic potential of your toaster? Got an urge  to spout some poetic couplets? Want to paint a fence? You can do all this and  more during a month of festivities in Claremont, where they're putting on the  Fourth Annual Fringe of the Fringe Arts Festival, starting Saturday.  </P> <P> More than 100 events, to be held from Pomona to Riverside and points in  between, are scheduled for the festival, which runs through Oct. 13.  </P> <P> The Fringe of the Fringe got its start three years ago as an offshoot of the  Los Angeles Fringe Festival, which was originally organized as an artistic  component of the 1984 L.A. Summer Olympics.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Fringe Festival is now known as the Open Festival, running as  an adjunct to the Los Angeles Festival. Got that? See related listings, JX.  </P> <P> "There are not enough venues for artists in this area so we really wanted to  bring some events here," explained Marlene Pou, a board member of Pomona's DA  Gallery, the nonprofit arts organization that sponsors the Fringe of the Fringe  festival.  </P> <P> The opening ceremony on Saturday begins  </P> <P> with a mask parade in which artists create moving, noise-making sculptures that  will frolic around Claremont's Memorial Park, starting at 8th Avenue and Indian  Hill Boulevard at noon. The day will continue with music, airborne art such as  kites and balloons, performance art, puppetry in the park and a 40-foot-long  fence mural that the public is invited to paint.  </P> <P> On Sept. 22, people are invited to bring household objects, such as the  aforementioned toaster, to the DA Gallery in the afternoon and help transform  them into objets d'art for exhibit that night.  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, at the Huntley Bookstore in Claremont, there will be a "Night of  Full Moon Madness" during which 100 poets will take turns reading short  selections from their work.  </P> <P> Periodically throughout the festival, 28 local artists, including Michael  Woodcock of Claremont, will open their homes and studios to tours.  </P> <P> Most of the events are free, but some have small admission fees, Pou said. For  a schedule of all the events, write the DA Gallery at 244 1/2 S. Garey Ave.,  Pomona, 91766 or call (714) 397-9716. KAREN E. KLEIN  </P></p>

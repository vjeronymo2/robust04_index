			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures gave up Friday's gains as dealers focused instead on the lack of further news of a cut in UK base rates, writes Joel Kibazo. After brief strength at the session's opening, the sell off of September got underway and the contract fell to 2,491 by 10.15am, down 15 from its opening, and sending the underlying cash market lower. BZW and County NatWest were reported to have been the two leading institutions on the offer, with others choosing to remain on the sidelines. However, weakness in the gilts and sterling markets, caused by a lack of news on interest rates, led to further falls. Wall Street's performance had little effect on the downward trend in the contract and September closed at 2,490, down 42 on Friday's close and around 5 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Traded options also saw a fall in activity and turnover reached only 25,476, against Friday's total of 31,570 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,247 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 2,717 contracts. Land Securities was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 1,138 lots. Most of the business was concentrated in the October 390 calls. This was followed by GEC at 1,057 lots and by Hillsdown at 963 lots.</p>

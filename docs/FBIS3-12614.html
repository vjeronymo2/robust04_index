			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Eminence Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad  Sayyid Tantawi has called on Palestinians to kill an equal  number of Israelis. Asked by an AL-'ARABI correspondent if an  earlier statement he made, expressing readiness for dialogue  with the Israelis, remains valid after the massacre in the  Ibrahimi mosque, the mufti asked: "What is the use of canceling  dialogue between the Arabs and Israelis?"    The AL-'ARABI correspondent said the mufti's office  represents a symbol for Muslims in Egypt and is therefore in a  delicate position; it must not get embroiled in efforts aimed at  normalization with the enemy, something that several  professional associations and popular organizations still  oppose. The mufti commented, saying: "Don't get emotional. We  are averse to dialogue with no one, as long as it can help to  solve problems and conflicts."</p>

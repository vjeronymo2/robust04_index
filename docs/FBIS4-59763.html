			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party Central Committee, proceeded on an inspection  tour of military units this morning in the eastern area, during  which he met military and political leaders. The military  forces of unity and democracy there are conducting decisive  military confrontations with the forces of the separatist gang  of the al-Ahmar clan.    A responsible source at the political bureau has told the  Yemeni news agency, SABA', that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid made  the tour in implementation of the resolution adopted by the  political bureau that party members and leaders should tour the  various axes following 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's rejection of all  the national, Arab, and international initiatives and appeals to  stop the bloody war he declared against the Yemeni people.  Salih is targeting the southern and eastern governorates,  thereby causing the destruction of towns, villages, and  installations, violating homes and causing the deaths of  citizens in the areas his forces have entered. This leaves the  forces of unity and democracy with no alternative but to  confront those forces, which have transformed unity into a  bloody struggle. Full historic responsibility is borne by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih for this disaster being suffered by Yemen and  its sons. It was he who during these blessed days decided to  transform the joy of the sons of the Yemen attending the blessed  id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of unity on 22 May into  days of grief.</p>

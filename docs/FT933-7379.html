			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Free hand on mortgages - A look at the growing demand for interest-only home loans THE MORTGAGE market is dominated by endowment and repayment loans, which together account for 85 per cent of new sales. But growing numbers of house-buyers are looking for interest-only mortgages where borrowers are free to choose the type of investment to repay the capital when the mortgage term ends. Figures from the Building Societies Association indicate the increased popularity of interest-only loans, which have leapt from only 4 per cent of all new mortgages in 1991 to 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. The gain seems to be mainly at the expense of endowments. These figures must, however, be treated with caution because of a change in the way the BSA collects them. It now asks lenders for a more detailed breakdown of the interest-only mortgages they sell (the categories being endowment, Pep, pension and interest-only). As a result, it believes that part of the apparent increase in interest-only mortgages sold is due to endowments simply being recorded under a new heading. Strictly speaking, an endowment is an interest-only mortgage, since the borrower pays only interest during the life of the loan. The premiums go to a life office, which invests the money (with some life cover thrown in) with the aim of repaying the capital at the end of the term. Most endowment mortgages are sold as one product, though. The borrower takes out the loan but the endowment part is arranged by the bank or building society in what is usually an exclusive distribution agreement with a single life office. Similarly, some banks and building societies link mortgages directly to Peps and pension plans. But it is much harder to find a pure interest-only mortgage where the lender lets you decide the type of savings method. These were more common in the 1980s when people assumed that inflation and steeply-rising house prices would reduce the capital sum to an easily affordable amount when they came to repay it 25 years later. But many lenders now regard such loans as too risky. 'We believe it is only rarely appropriate for either a lender or borrower to take on a substantial loan commitment without a clearly identified and allocated mechanism or resource for repayment,' says Geoff Ellerton, director of Midland bank's mortgage services. 'An interest-only mortgage is, in principle, an unmatched liability which creates significant additional risk for the borrower and dependants.' Along with several banks and building societies, Midland will grant such a mortgage only on a case-by-case basis. This will usually mean lending to an older borrower, who is assumed to be more financially aware or responsible than a first-time buyer, or on a second property which can be sold if necessary to meet the commitment. Sometimes, the interest-only loan will be granted only if a large deposit is available or, paradoxically, on large loans - again, on the assumption that the borrower will be sophisticated about arranging a repayment plan. Halifax building society, the UK's largest lender, offers interest-only mortgages on a minimum loan of Pounds 100,000 and gives a maximum advance of 90 per cent of the property's valuation. It requires some kind of security or backing and says that the very flexibility of interest-only mortgages makes them 'a very niche market for those people who may have other types of investments besides the more traditional one.' Bristol &amp; West says that if the only security is the the property, it will restrict the loan to the society's basic advance - which is 75 per cent for loans under Pounds 50,000. Lloyds bank follows a policy similar to Midland's in that it looks at individual cases before deciding whether to grant an interest-only mortgage. Customers must usually be aged at least 45 and the loan must be repaid by the main income-earner's retirement age (or 65 years, if earlier). The bank would not normally offer a loan for more than 50 per cent of a property's value. The Leeds will grant pure interest-only loans, but at one percentage point above the society's standard variable rate. The premium is waived for maturity loans to the elderly. National Westminster bank and Royal Bank of Scotland do not offer such mortgages at all By contrast, some lenders have made a virtue out of offering interest-only loans. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society - which announced last week it would no longer sell insurance products - has concentrated on providing interest-only and repayment mortgages since 1990. Bradford &amp; Bingley building society also provides interest-only loans. The market for these mortgages is not as restricted as it might seem, since many lenders offering pension or Pep mortgages will give advice on repayment methods but do not insist that these are used to repay the loan at the end of the term. Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol, says: 'With a lot of lenders, you end up with an interest-only loan through the back door, since the lender does not take assignment of the policy.' This is both good and bad. It is a welcome development that there should be more ways than an endowment to repay an interest-only loan. The down-side is that irresponsible borrowers, or those with little financial discipline, may find themselves in severe financial difficulty if they do not set up a long-term savings plan.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Paris theatre takes on a mirror image of today's world  -Parisian theatregoers continue to benefit from the Jack Lang years, with new productions from Peter Brook, Jerome Savary and Luc Bondy Bolstered by nearly a decade of ex-arts minister Jack Lang's lavish and liberal policies, Paris has in the last few years been making a bid to become Europe's theatre capital. Compared with London, subsidy is a major element of its theatrical budget, either as direct grants to theatres and companies, indirectly through co-production with France's rich panolply of regional subsidised theatres and companies, or through the funding of an individual production, particularly if it concerns that rarity, a worthwhile new work. Even the Parisian commercial theatre received a direct FFr23m (Pounds 2.7m) from the state for 1993. But France's recent major government cast changes are likely to see a severe curtailment of such largesse, therefore placing in jeopardy the French capital's present high theatrical profile. But for this season at least, Parisian theatregoers can continue to benefit from the legacy of les annees Lang. Skimming the top off the creme de la creme of the hundred or so plays that have opened in and around the capital during the past ten weeks, Peter Brook's name is inevitably written large. After deftly retailoring the Debussy/Maeterlinck opera into Impressions de Pelleas, Brook now brilliantly mutates the eminent neurologist Oliver Sack's book, The Man who thought his Wife was a Hat, into a singular theatrical experience. Premiered at the atmospheric old music hall, the Bouffes du Nord, where Brook founded his Centre International de Creations Theatrales some 20 years ago, L'Homme qui is a series of Sack's medical case histories: genetic tics, involuntary reactions, waking dreams, false blindness, are acted out by four of Brook's most penetrating disciples, with amazing insight, sensitivity, simplicity and a disturbing verity. MC93-Bobigny, an important suburban cultural centre, rounds off its present theatre season with a perceptive and immensely entertaining revival of Marcel Pagnol's Les Marchands de Gloire - which against a characteristically Pagnolian provencal backdrop strikes out against war and political corruption by amusingly bringing a dead hero back from the grave. This is to be followed by Sans titre, an untitled work by Federico Garcia Lorca, which accuses the theatre of acting out lies to distract from the surrounding reality. Unbuttoned enjoyment has little place in this season's programme at the Colline, Paris' newest, most user-friendly and outspoken national theatre, which under the enlightened artistic direction of Jorge Lavelli admirably fulfils its mission as a stage for contemporary theatre. Currently, Terres Mortes, a French production of Bauern Sterben by German playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz, is spilling its 20th century entrails over the studio theatre. Now, it is a French production Stalin by the Chilean-born Gaston Salvatore, who writes in German and lives in Italy, that is spelling out its potent social message. Demain une Fenetre sur rue, in the Colline's main theatre, goes one step beyond the watching of war live on television, and imagines a family observing, through their window, a civil war bent on exterminating the poor. Not a spoof on CNN's recent exploits, the play was inspired by TV coverage of Biafra and written in 1968 by Jean-Claude Grumberg, one of France's most socially alert playwrights. Parisian theatre is playing to the full its role as a mirror image of today's world. However, a gimmick-ridden, much-heralded French production of Edward Bond's Jackets, distorted beyond recognition the English playwright's already poorly defined reflection on children as victims of society. In complete contrast, La Compagnie Des Hommes, Bond's pin-hole view of the world of big business, was beautifully crafted into a dazzlingly glossy production when, at the start of the season, it was world premiered, also at the Theatre de la Ville. Jerome Savary continues to cock a snook at the establishment, now from the inside, as artistic director of the palatial Chaillot national theatre. His penchant is to take a hallowed classic and turn it into a circus act, reminiscent of those that he put together in the 1960s as founder of the Grand Magic Circus. The latest old master to be framed by Savary is Goldoni's The Boors. Translated into Les Rustres it becomes a hilarious romp. For classical purists it is a travesty, for the rest of us it is a laugh-a-minute British panto with a strong Franco-Italian accent. Les Rustres, chased from the Chaillot in the full flight of success by Savary's new production of The Taming of the Shrew, is now at the Mogador, dark since the premature closure of a disastrous French production of Kiss Me Kate. This was the latest in a long line-up of international hit musicals to bite the dust once they touch French soil. Sell-out success was virtually guaranteed for a revival of Jean Cocteau's Les Monstres Sacres at the Bouffes Parisiens. Who could resist the chance to see Michele Morgan and Jean Marais in harness together for the first time. Themselves monstres sacres of the French cinema, no matter if the play, about two stage stars at their height, and written in 1937, is beginning to show its age - or that the octogenarian Marais is a shade too mature for the role. Revivals of Alfred de Musset's On ne badine pas avec l'amour and Il ne faut jurer de rien, both directed by Jean-Pierre Vincent, are a disappointment. One has come to expect the unexpected from this remarkable director, whose talents made him an eminently suitable successor to Patrice Chereau as artistic director of the Amandiers, a vast theatre complex in the university suburb of Nanterre. Despite the heady presence in On ne badine pas . . . of Emmanuelle Beart, who gained international acclaim in the film Jean de Florette, the Musset duo merely glows with professionalism, but never burst into flames of great theatre. That elusive tingle factor is to be found in a new French adaptation of Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman. Directed by Luc Bondy, a name increasingly known in operatic circles, and starring Michel Piccoli, it is set against a series of magnificent, megalomaniac decors by Erich Wonder. The production comes to the Odeon-Theatre de L'Europe from the Vidy-Theatre, Lausanne. A French revival of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion at the Arts Hebertot, is playing to full houses, thus taking the wind out of the stormy reviews it received. The scene stealer is Sophie Marceau as Eliza Doolittle, whose irreproachable performance dispels for ever her image as a cinema nymphet of little consequence. For some time, the Comedie Francaise has been resting on its laurels as France's most historic and prestigious national theatre. A double bill of Moliere's Les Precieuses Ridicules and L'Impromptu de Versailles, the latest revival to enter its current repertoire, continues to display the complacent mediocrity that has attracted forceful criticism from the media. Audiences remain undauntingly loyal, although when the curtain comes down a lot of them are caught napping. A green shoot at the start of the season was a French revamp of Goldoni's La serva amorosa. Not a particularly memorable production, it nonetheless has just won for the Comedie Francaise a Moliere for this season's best play in the subsidised sector(the Molieres are France's most important theatre awards.) Temps contre Temps - Ronald Harwood's Another Time - at the Bruyere, was voted best play in the commercial sector. Its success rests squarely on the seemingly frail shoulders of Laurent Terzieff, who directs and plays the lead. In recent years, the dearth of new French plays has seen an avalanche of foreign imports, particularly from among New York hits. All too often their adaptation into French has a castrating effect, which strips them to their quintessential raunchy appeal One to survive with its dramatic genitalia almost intact is David Mamet's Speed the Plow, as Partenaires, at the Michodiere.</p>

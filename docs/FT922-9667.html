			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sappi buys 90% of Hannover Papier SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper company, is to pay DM400m (Dollars 242.4m in US dollars and R825m in financial rand) for control of Hannover Papier, one of Germany's leading producers of coated woodfree paper. The deal is a considerable breakthrough for South African companies, being the first occasion since the implementation of financial sanctions in the mid-1980s that a SA company has used its own paper to finance a large acquisition. It also consolidates the position of Sappi, a member of the Gencor group, in the speciality paper market in Europe. In June 1990, it bought control of five paper mills in the UK, from which a new company, Sappi Europe, was formed. Sappi will acquire 90 per cent of Hannover Papier's share capital - 80 per cent from Swedish company Ncb Aktiebolag, the state-owned forestry group, and 10 per cent from Commerzbank of Germany. Sappi will issue new ordinary shares to Commerzbank and convertible debentures for the Ncb shares. Ncb will receive cash and Sappi will assume Hannover Papier's borrowings of DM370m. Sappi will seek a listing on London, Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman of Sappi, said the deal made Sappi one of the world's 15 largest paper groups. He said Hannover had been extensively modernised so about 40 per cent of its capacity (430,000 tonnes of paper and 190,000 tonnes of sulphite pulp a year) was new. Hannover was regarded as an environmental leader in Germany; meeting environmental standards would not be an issue. The German company was put up for sale late last year when Ncb, Hannover Papier's owner, announced it would have to realise assets because of heavy losses. Ncb made a loss of SKr178m (Dollars 30m) in 1991. Ncb's SKr1.25bn sale of its 80 per cent stake in Hannover Papier is a vital part of the Swedish state-owned forestry group's preparation for early privatisation, adds Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Mr Lars Henrik Forssblad, Ncb's managing director, said yesterday the group's liquidity would 'improve dramatically' and the deal would have a 'positive effect on its profit ability this year'. Ncb calculates the divestment of Hannover Papier will reduce its interest-bearing liabilities to SKr1.75bn from SKr3.27bn last year.</p>

Tomorrow our nation celebrates Republic Day.  On this auspicious occasion, I have great pleasure in extending  to you my warmest greetings and felicitations. Our Republic Day  is a day of national resolve, a time to contemplate our position  as a nation in relation to the world around us and to introspect  upon our duties as individual citizens in enhancing and  safeguarding the gains of freedom.    As we enter the 45th year of our republic, each of us must  realize and act upon the realization that increasingly the world  of today will test our every sinew and faculty, virtue and  ideals, every system and sector. More than ever before common  sense and clean understanding of present realities enjoin that  we must organize ourselves to stand on our own resources --  human, institutional, material and spiritual. Indeed, we shall  have to strive ever harder unitedly and with self-reliance to go  from strength to strength, howsoever difficult the task may be.    For three centuries past, the history of the world has been  determined by the relations between a few nations, even though  they were involved in varying groups and in different periods in  confrontation and war with one another. The waging of a valiant  and principled struggle for equity and human dignity as in our  country and other parts of the world was a crucially important  trend in this context. In the present times and the future, the  main features of the world's political economy will be molded by  those nations which lead in science, technology and  industrialization and occupy the commanding heights in global  trade and commerce.    Today the world is at relative peace, threat of  confrontation  having been dramatically lessened and instead the scope for  friendship and mutual collaboration having been enlarged. The  leading nations are well-poised to cooperate in fashioning the  emerging world order. Powerful and far-reaching initiatives in  this direction are under way. A new global balance is being  adjusted as between the continents of America, Europe, Africa,  and Asia. A framework of guarded globalization including  elaborate regulatory parameters is under settlement. New  regional and zonal groupings are also assuming shape.  Prestigious international organizations are facilitating  peaceful establishment of the new environment for nations and  peoples around the globe.    Friends! These developments impinge upon the lives of each  of us as individuals and as citizens of one nation. Together,  we must respond to the challenge and prove our mettle. Let us  fully appreciate that within us we have the wherewithal to  achieve positive dynamic transformation. Our nation has a  tremendous wealth of talented and dedicated men and women  comparable with and even superior to the best in the world. Our  being wedded to democracy and having absorbed and gained fuller  sensitivity to the concepts, processes and needs of democratic  governance is an advantage of profound importance. We have  built, gained experience in, and developed the institutional  infrastructure and mechanisms of parliamentary democracy at the  federal, state, district, taluka [revenue district] and village  levels. We must impart greater qualitative and quantitative  impetus to true democratic decentralization and augment  political democracy with economic democracy. This would create  the channels and scope for releasing and galvanizing the  creativity and manifold genius of our vast human resources.  Prudently husbanded, our remarkable range of biodiversity and  mineral wealth, human talent, institutional structures and  strategic location on the globe can spell rapid self-sustaining  growth and development.    At the heart of this endeavor, we must uphold clearly and  fully our great national values. The dignity of every human  being, individual freedom, rights and duties, equality and  social justice, service and selflessness and resolute commitment  to materialize these must inform our tasks. Let us heed the  voice of our sages and saints and learn the lessons from our own  history.    Pluralism, oneness and equality are intrinsic elements of  our  heritage and comprise a source of national strengthen of  enormous importance. For centuries, we have absorbed and  reflected upon the truth of the oneness, of the inner doctrine  and purpose of all religions. Let there now be full  manifestation of this realization in our day-to-day actions in  the social, political and economic areas of national life.    Friends! We Indians have to comprehend that the world is  fast entering a new chapter in its history in which the modern  imperatives of patriotic duty have to be analyzed, grasped and  fulfilled by each citizen in his or her sphere of existence and  service. The kisan, the jawan and the mazdur [peasant, soldier,  laborers], our artisans and entrepreneurs, scientists,  engineers, teachers and doctors, writers, poets and artists,  representatives of the people, the judiciary, the civil service,  and the armed forces, and especially the women of India, all of  us must ponder over and perform with utmost devotion our  respective individual and collective duty.    The father of our nation -- Mahatma Gandhi -- had said: I  Quote: I want India to realize that she has a soul that can rise  triumphantly above every physical combination of a whole world.  Unquote. Our victory will be on the strength of our dedication  to truth, nonviolence and unflinching constructive effort  arousing the conscience of the world and the moral and ethical  force of democracy in nations and peoples of the East and of the  West.    India seeks peace, friendship, and cooperation with all  nations and peoples, especially our neighbors in the  subcontinent and other countries in Asia with whom we have ties  of kinship and culture. We are committed to the wellbeing of  all humanity and performing a creative role in world affairs.  Equally, we shall zealously guard our freedom and national  sovereignty and integrity. The government and the people of  India shall brook no interference in this respect.    Friends! Let us strive to fulfill the dreams of those who  gave their all for India's freedom and render service such that  for generations hence our nation may regard us too as having  done our duty well. Tomorrow, on our Republic Day when we  unfurl the national tricolor, let us salute our flag of freedom  and pledge ourselves to the glory of India and the good of all  humankind.    Jai Hind [Hail India].</p>

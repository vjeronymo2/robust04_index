			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Mugabe promises to retain socialism Zimbabwe's president, Mr Robert Mugabe, brushing aside the demise of communism, pledged his party's commitment to socialism yesterday and also said he would speed up control of the economy by the black majority, Reuter reports from Harare. 'Socialism remains our sworn ideology,' Mr Mugabe told a congress of his ruling Zanu-PF party. Amid applause from nearly 8,000 delegates assembled at the futuristic Harare Conference Centre, he said: 'The challenge is to continue to redefine it (socialism) in a manner consistent with our culture and historical experience, the changing times and the aspirations of our people. 'Naturally, such an ideological synthesis calls for a committed and conscious cadreship which agitates for the realisation of our objectives.' Mr Mugabe, in power in Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980, said Zanu-PF found it unacceptable that the majority 10m blacks, who outnumber whites by 10-to-one, were still marginalised in the control of the country's economy. 'Our people still suffer economic disablement as a result of myriad old laws, business practices and prejudices, themselves a legacy of a colonial past that sought a wholesale disempowerment of the blacks. Needless to say, this situation is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue,' he said. Mr Mugabe said his government was setting up an investment fund which, together with an improved business climate in Zimbabwe brought about by western-backed economic reforms, should quicken the pace of transfer of economic power. He also pledged to accelerate a controversial plan that allows the state virtually to seize mostly white-owned farms to resettle thousands of blacks thrown out of their original homes by previous white governments. 'Currently five million hectares of land is being purchased from the large-scale commercial area to bring total land acquired for resettlement purposes to 8.3 million hectares,' Mr Mugabe said. The plan, introduced in 1992, is opposed by Zimbabwe's 4,500 commercial farmers - producers of most export crops and food. The five-yearly congress will also elect new leaders for the party that has ruled alone for the past 14 years.</p>

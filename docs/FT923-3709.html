			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Record results at Campbell Soup CAMPBELL Soup, the US food company which underwent a big restructuring in the early 1990s under a new chief executive, yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 490.5m during the 12 months to August 2. The record results were scored on sales of Dollars 6.26bn, virtually unchanged from the previous year. In the final quarter alone, Campbell saw after-tax profits rise by 29 per cent to Dollars 109.2m, on sales of Dollars 1.43bn compared with Dollars 1.35bn. Mr David Johnson, Campbell's Australian chief executive, said the group was par-ticularly pleased by the growth in its core soup business, both in the domestic market and overseas. He also pointed out that exchange rates had the effect of depressing reported sales in the first three quarters, and that underlying sales from continuing business rose by five per cent during the year. The Campbell North America division, the largest part of the group, saw operating profits rise by 19 per cent during the year, to Dollars 792.8m, with sales from continuing businesses rising by 5 per cent. Helped by some new varieties, soup volume increased by 5.5 per cent. The Campbell bakery and biscuit operations fared less well, with operating profits easing to Dollars 90.6m.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US sector shaken by renewed pressure on dollar The US Treasury market was shaken yesterday by renewed pressure on the dollar, but a sharp drop in commodity prices helped limit the damage to bonds. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at 85 11/32 in light trading. The yield rose to 7.454 per cent, after flirting with 7.50 per cent, the upper limit of its recent trading range, in the morning. The two-year note was off  3/32 at 99 15/16 per cent, yielding 5.89 per cent. Jitters over monetary policy, never too far from the surface in recent weeks, resurfaced yesterday as the dollar's value eroded in the foreign exchange markets. The persistent weakness of the US currency has alarmed bond traders because it could force the Fed to tighten monetary policy for the fifth time this year, perhaps as early as next month. At least one Fed governor, Mr Lawrence Lindsey, was on record as saying the dollar's decline had contributed to the central bank's decision to lift rates last month. Amid these misgivings, Treasuries moved moderately lower in early trading, following through on overseas activity in which the yield on the long bond tested the 7.50 per cent support level. Later, bonds were given a sorely needed boost by reports that central banks were quietly entering the foreign exchange markets to support the dollar. US-denominated securities would benefit from the reinvestment of such purchases. But the bond market mostly benefited from the biggest one-day decline in commodity prices in three years. Their sharp rise in recent weeks has complicated the inflation outlook. A softer tone in gold, oil and other products helped bonds trim their losses to modest levels as the afternoon commenced. Later Treasuries nudged into positive ground, only to recede again in the final hours of trading. After last week's barrage of economic data, traders were looking ahead to a rather quiet week. The most significant news is due on Thursday, with the release of May durable goods orders and weekly figures on claims for unemployment benefit. The market is also facing a fresh influx of supply this week. The Treasury is scheduled to auction Dollars 17bn in two-year notes today and Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow afternoon. European government bond markets fell to new lows in volatile trading yesterday, on weakness in US Treasuries, a falling dollar and worries over rising inflation and talk of a global capital shortage. After opening lower on the back of the mark-down in Treasuries on Friday, markets rose in the afternoon on a technical squeeze before heading back downwards. Futures trading dominated, with little activity reported in the cash market. Traders said many US-based investors took advantage of the weakness of the dollar to switch from European into US assets. Dealers also reported position-squaring by investors ahead of the end of the second quarter. Although German government bonds were the least affected by the sell-off, the September bund futures contract on Liffe fell by more than 1 point to a new low for the year before settling around 90.33, down 0.78 points on the day. 'The market is taking the worst-case scenario on inflation and interest rates,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. 'They are taking nothing on trust and want to see actual proof that (German) money supply growth is under control and inflation is falling.' May M3 money supply data are expected this week. The French market was dragged down with the rest of Europe, with some added political uncertainty following the resignation of Mr Michel Rocard as head of the French Socialist party. The September future contract settled at 122.84, down 0.94 points. UK gilts also had a roller-coaster day, falling sharply on early selling in the futures pits and recouping some of their losses on late short-covering. In the absence of market-moving domestic news, gilts tracked international markets lower. The September long gilt futures contract fell by about  7/8 points to 98 29/32 . Italian bonds fell sharply early on but recovered somewhat on late short-covering. A sharp rise in the repo rate at the Bank of Italy's latest open-market operations aggravated weak market conditions. The minimum rate rose to 8.05 per cent, from 7.75 per cent at the last repo and above the 8 per cent Lombard rate. However, the central bank said this was an anomaly and it had no intention of pushing rates higher. Spanish bonds fared even worse, with the September 10-year futures contract falling 2.3 points to 87.75. Its early plunge prompted the Spanish futures exchange to widen its daily limit up or down for the contract to 300 basis points from 200 points. The Spanish 10-year bond yield spread over bunds widened to 362 basis points, from 336 points on Friday. Japanese bonds took another tumble, dogged by jitters over domestic politics, the rise in commodities prices, fears of an expanding budget deficit and worries that economic recovery may lead to monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan. Since May 30, the yield on the benchmark government bond has risen by about 80 basis points to 4.51 per cent.</p>

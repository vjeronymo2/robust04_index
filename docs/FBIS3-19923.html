			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Borje Karlsson: "Bitter Electoral Promises From </F> the Social Democratic Party: `Sacrifices Are Required To Combat  Unemployment'"]    [Text] It is not with promises of reforms but rather with  calls for sacrifices that the Social Democrat Party [SDP] is  going to win this fall's election. Party secretary Mona Sahlin  is making no secret of that.    In a few weeks, she will present an electoral platform, or  an  electoral manifesto, to the SDP's executive committee. It will  not be a multicolored brochure with gold-plated promises.    "No, we're promising no strange reforms, but we're promising  to fight tooth and nail to create new jobs, and that will mean  sacrifices," she told DAGENS NYHETER.    "We have been very careful about not promising anything that  would mean new costs. It's not reforms but rather the opposite  we have to implement if we win the election."    Sahlin does not think any party will promise gold and green  forests. Instead the campaign will be a contest to see who can  save the most, she believes.  <H5>  Right To Work Restored </H5>   "The party that can most convincingly show that sacrifices  will lead to new jobs will win the election," she predicted.    Sahlin and Ingvar Carlsson will not commit themselves to  rescinding every hateful act of the Riksdag and restoring the  good old SDP order. This will only occur to the extent that it  does not cost money. Thus far, then, in statements or motions,  the Social Democrats have issued the following  messages:     -  The right to work should be restored. That means  that the probationary period should be reduced to six months and  that employers on their own may not exclude any employee from  the seniority list when pink slips are handed out.    -  "School  money" should be abolished. That means that private schools can  no longer ask towns for support for their activities.    -  The new  grading system for elementary schools should be rescinded.    -  The  family doctor law and the right of private specialist physicians  to set up practices should be abolished. The right to freely set  up private child-care centers might also be halted.  <H5>  Home Care Allowance To Be Abolished </H5>   In some instances, the Social Democrats will save bundles of  money by rescinding nonsocialist decisions:     -  The home-care allowance is to be abolished if it has now  been implemented.    -  Double taxation on stocks will be reintroduced  and the capital gains tax on sales of stocks will be  increased.    -  The property tax will not be abolished in  1995.    -  Capital income taxes will remain at 30 percent.    Furthermore, the Social Democrats will hike the national tax  for those with high incomes from 20 to 25 percent. This is a  "temporary" tax hike but Sahlin would not say when the tax rate  would be reestablished. That depends on how quickly the deficit  in the labor market fund can be eliminated.    She said, however, that she was ready to defend a tax cut  for  those with high incomes the day Sweden's economy is back on its  feet.  <H5>  Opposes National Federation of Trade Unions </H5>   "Yes, I get to go out and say that now we have carried the  burdens together to achieve long-term financing of the labor  market fund and now we will return to the 1990 tax reform."    The Social Democrats have explicitly pointed to one promise  they are not making in this year's campaign: The compensation  level for unemployment insurance will not return to 90 percent  as quickly as the National Federation of Trade Unions [LO],  among others, has demanded.    "I'm not promising any timetable, but it will not be during  this fiscal year or the next one," Sahlin said.    First, compensation for those with long-term illnesses will  be increased from 70 to 80 percent.    "I hope we can implement the increase during the term of the  next government."    That would extend through 1998.    Nor are promises made to families with children. Might the  promised 1991 increase in the child-care allowance be shelved  for good?  <H5>  No Pension Promises </H5>   "The increase is not included in the electoral manifesto,  but  I will continue to be a politician for another 40 years," Sahlin  replied hurriedly.    The Social Democrats have not forgotten the old promise  about  extended insurance for parents, she stated.    "It's clear we haven't. But that lies far in the future."    No promises are made to towns and county boards about higher  state subsidies even if the Social Democrats strongly criticized  cuts that were made in 1993.    No promises are made to retirees that pensions are to be  completely inflation-proof and not just 98-percent so.  <H5>  Fighting for Growth </H5>   "We are now fighting for a new pension system and to achieve  growth so we will be able to deal with the pensions of the  future," Sahlin stated.    No promises are made to tenants and owners of single-family  homes regarding a new home financing system.    "But we want to push for the discontinuation of the  3-billion-[kronor] interest-rate subsidy that the nonsocialist  government wants to implement in 1994-96," Sahlin remarked.</p>

On the  other hand, hardened addicts will have to go to the end of the  line.    ``That is how prioritization works. Our hope is that a solid  effort at a very early stage will prevent children from later  ending up on the streets,'' said Jens Hansen, a drug-education  consultant in Copenhagen.    Recently, the authorities have made room for young drug  abusers, despite an overburdened treatment system.    Care providers have become concerned because new drug users  are younger and younger. The rise in life expectancy of drug  addicts has stagnated, so that they now live an average of 31 to  32 years.    One reason for the increase in younger addicts is the  appearance of so-called smoking heroin. There is an abundance of  it on the streets and it is less expensive than heroin that is  injected.    ``Many young people still believe they will not become  addicted to the stuff if they smoke it, but of course that is  wrong,'' said Lasse Gaardsoe, the leader of 24-Hour Contact in  Copenhagen.    Thirty to 35 young people frequently visit 24-Hour Contact.  Five or six of them have tried smoking heroin.    Copenhagen Country has set up several projects for young  people under 18 years of age who have been drug users, but they  still have no place for detox where they would not be in contact  with hardened addicts. According to the Social Affairs Ministry,  however, it is a virtual certainty that Copenhagen will soon  receive 2.4 million kroner in subsidies for a detox center.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Non-Stop" </F> rubric: "Kazannik Denied Permission to Go Abroad"]    [Text] The dismissed Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey  Kazannik, who lives in Omsk, was to leave for Germany on 20 May  to appear before the student body of Bonn University and  elsewhere and to read a series of other lectures in German  cities.    However, as Aleksey Ivanovich [Kazannik] told MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS in an interview, the Russian Foreign Ministry would  not issue him the visa without actually explaining why.  Aleksey Ivanovich believes this is simply political revenge in  the wake of his criticisms directed at President Yeltsin.</p>

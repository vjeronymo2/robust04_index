			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Right to advice backed by extra Pounds 87m over 3 years - Careers The Careers Service will receive an extra Pounds 87m over three years to provide advice and education in schools, but the government has spelt out in greater detail than previously what it expects in return. For the first time it has specified at what ages guidance and advice should be given independently, with the aim of providing young people with better signposts at a time when career options are being offered. Advice will be given at the ages of 13, 15 and at 17 (for those still in full-time education). For the first time, young people will have an 'entitlement' to such guidance, and it details the sort of information that will have to be given to parents after interviews. Until recently the service concentrated on advising and placing 16-year-old school-leavers in jobs, with schools making help available on course choices. This will now be provided by the Careers Service. The government last year transferred the duty in England and Wales of providing a careers service from local education authorities to the employment secretary. The employment department is inviting bids from local interests, including education authorities and Training and Enterprise Councils, which manage government training schemes, to run the service. Mr Rob Stokes, president of the Institute of Careers Advisers, said he welcomed the new entitlements. He said surveys had shown a deterioration in careers guidance and advice. He estimated that if the Careers Service chose to spend the extra money on advisers, then some 900 more could be recruited. He said: 'We also welcome the fact that the government wants advice to be independent at a time when impartial advice is very necessary. It could be in the financial interests of schools for example, to persuade young people to stay on at school.'</p>

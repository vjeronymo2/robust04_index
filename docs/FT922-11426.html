			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Markets: Thrills, spills and an end to recession - London Markets Hello, good morning and welcome to Stockmarketland, the fun-for-the-whole-family attraction that packs all the thrills and spills of the financial markets into a single eventful day] You start your tour at breakfast time on Thursday April 23. For the next eight hours you will: Gasp at the appetite of TI's Christopher Lewinton, as he tries to gobble up an Pounds 800m company at a single sitting . . . Thrill with fear at the German money supply figures . . . Shudder as the tightrope-walking pharmaceutical stocks wobble on the high wire . . . Cheer as plucky little sterling scrambles fearlessly up the ERM rankings . . . Melt as romantic couple ICI and Du Pont find they have plastics in common; and Lloyds Bank decides whether to press its stormy, Heathcliff-style advances on Midland. Take your places now] * * * In one day, indeed, the markets managed to pack in more excitement than most investors experienced in the whole of 1991. The events were not merely interesting in themselves, they also reflected some of the market's trends for the next few months. One such theme is the end of the UK recession, which showed up in two studies reported in Thursday's papers. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce showed that the services sector resumed growth in the first quarter for the first time since the recession started in mid-1990. And an IMF report said that Britain is about to move into recovery, with gdp growth between the fourth quarter of 1991 and that of 1992 forecast at 2.1 per cent. Corporate financiers are doubtless hurrying to get takeover bids under way before the end of the recession pushes potential targets out of reach. One such deal came through on Thursday, as TI Group, the tubes and engineering company, offered paper worth Pounds 482m for Dowty Group, the aerospace components manufacturer. If successful, the deal would nearly double TI's turnover overnight, though planned disposals would then reduce the combined company to a size roughly half as big again as the present group. Dowty has rejected the bid, but its weak performance in recent years hampers its defence tactics. The offer was thought to be a relatively generous one by the market, intended perhaps to scare off any other potential bidders. At the moment it was made, the offer represented a price of 191p for every Dowty share, with a fully-underwritten cash alternative of 175p a share. At Wednesday's close, with rumours of the bid already in the market, Dowty was priced at 145p (up from 136p at the end of the previous week's trading), and TI Group at 716p. By the end of the week, TI had dropped to 669p, its bid was worth 178.4p, and Dowty was at 177p. Smiths Industries, another aerospace components manufacturer which had also been seen as a potential bidder, weakened after the TI bid, with the market wondering if Dowty would turn to it as a potential white knight. Smiths recovered by Friday, however, and closed at 310p, up 1p on the week. Another recession-induced deal was announced on Thursday: ICI swapped its fibres division for Du Pont's acrylics business and a chunk of cash. ICI's fibres operation has been a problem area for years, but the group had hoped to turn it around with swingeing cost cuts. The recession put paid to those hopes, and they have gone to an owner with the necessary worldwide market position in this product area. The market responded favourably to the news: ICI closed the week at 1364, up 19p. The perception of an end to the recession - only slightly dented by poor trading comments from Abbey National and Legal and General - has led investors to think seriously about which sectors will benefit most from recovery. As the chart shows, the health and household sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index, dominated by the big drugs companies, has at last shed its role of market favourite. Sectors that might do better (or at least stop doing worse) if the economy picks up have performed notably more strongly in recent weeks - the chart shows examples such as Motors and Construction. Analysts at SG Warburg Securities argued on Friday that the market was in danger of predicting the wrong sort of economic recovery, by bidding up capital spending stocks rather than those oriented to an upturn in consumer spending. An analysis of sector attractiveness from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reached a rather different conclusion: with economic growth likely to continue sluggish, it argued, the big boost to profits would come in those heavy manufacturing businesses which would benefit most from the cost cuts of the past year. The market's views on the speed of the recovery were influenced by two offsetting factors this week. One was the strength of sterling, which on Wednesday climbed decisively off the bottom of the ERM rankings. On the face of it, this left scope for a relatively speedy cut in base-rates, if the government wished. This sentiment was badly affected, however, by Thursday's revelation of unexpectedly rapid growth in the German money supply. M3, the broader measure of money, rose by 9.7 per cent in March, nearly double the Bundesbank's target for the year. This reinforced the view that a decisive downwards move in UK interest rates - inevitably dependent on a similar move in Germany - was likely to be delayed. Torn between these two views, the stock market bounced briskly around on heavy volume, closing on Friday at 2643.0, up 2.8 points on the week.</p>

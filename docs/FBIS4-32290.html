			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stastny: "The Czech Republic Exported Arms </F> to 53 Countries Last Year"]    [Text] The Czech Republic exported arms and special  military material to 53 countries last year. Egypt and Thailand  were among the most significant importers of our aircraft  hardware. We exported small arms mainly to Turkey, where the  Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod rearmed the police force. We  sold seven ground armored vehicles to Angola.    Bretislav Gregr, the director of the Special Materials  Department at the Trade and Industry Ministry, told us that the  provision of import and export licenses for military material is  the basic condition for conducting international trade in arms.  A license is issued on the basis of an application, the most  important detail of which is the confirmation of the end user;  this is verified by the representative offices. At the moment,  the situation is more complicated because a new law on  conducting foreign trade in military material has been in force  since 1 April. It stipulates a two-tier licensing procedure.  First, a company must apply for a general permit to enter onto  the market with military material, a permit that entitles it to  supply, market, or enter into tender proceedings. The holder of  this permit must then apply for a license for each specific deal  he wants to complete. A company must comply with a number of  conditions before being issued a general permit. The company in  question must, for example, have a majority share of Czech  capital, its owners must be Czech citizens with permanent  residence in the Czech Republic, and they need to have a  negative screenings certificate, a clean criminal record,  sufficient financial backing for the company, and so on. At the  moment, some 10 enterprises are applying for this permit; one of  them has already obtained it. According to B. Gregr, it is a  new limited company whose statutory bodies had Army connections  and, thus, knowledge of the military sphere. The new wording of  the law allows for the validity of the licenses issued  previously. Some 40 companies that obtained a license to export  military material before 1 April of this year have to obtain a  new export permit within six months. These companies include,  for example, Aero Vodochody, whose shipment for the Thai Royal  Air Force was impounded recently in Austria.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Meanwhile, hunger, fear, and despair are common  occurrences in the border area between Haiti and the Dominican  Republic, where local authorities are still waiting for  instructions to authorize the crossing of humanitarian aid, the  only aid allowed since the UN Security Council ordered the total  embargo against the Haitian junta on 21 May. Thus, in Dajabon, a  city located in the north of the Dominican Republic, the  district retains $20,000 of humanitarian aid out of the $40,000  collected by the national Catholic Church. The problem here is  that there is no one, there is no one [repeats] who has civil,  military, or international authority, Father Regimo Martinez  complains.    While in Port-au-Prince the effects of the embargo have  begun  to be felt, the situation at the border is desperate. It is one  of the poorest areas of Haiti. In the villages close to the  Dominican Republic, cities like Dajabon in the north of the  country and Jimani in the south, some Haitians manage to elude  the vigilance of the Dominican border guards to obtain something  to eat, even though it is often dried pieces of cake or simple  pieces of bread.    In Villa Anacaona, the last border post before the road  enters Haitian territory, the military and security services  control the vehicles to make sure they do not carry anything  into Haiti. On a road through Haitian territory, children are  seen desperately pursuing the rare vehicles that pass, begging  for food. The children hurry down the hills to ask for food or  money, with their hands on their stomachs to show that they are  hungry. They all live in small huts with straw roofs, but  without walls, on the 50 km of the nearly impassable road. At  the approach to the Dominican Republic, there are a few  Dominican workers repairing the road. In this area, there are  four Dominican surveillance posts, each comprising two soldiers  who are sent for eight days.    One of the extremities on the way to its highest point is  Pedro Santana, a poor village on Dominican territory, whose  inhabitants sit in the doorways of their houses, commenting on  the events of the day while sipping a beer.</p>

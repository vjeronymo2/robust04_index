			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The British--Once Again on the Wrong Path!"] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.    It appears on the basis of current facts and figures that  Iranian-British relations will never acquire any stability. The  British seem constantly itching to disrupt existing relations  with Tehran by taking advantage of the situation.    If we were to assess the history of Iranian-British  political  relations over a 15-year period, we would conclude that these  relations were never trusting. On one day the British  Government--in its emulation of the United States and as a sign  of sympathy with Washington--mars relations with Iran because of  the fall of the den of spies [U.S. Embassy in Tehran]. However,  when it stands to lose, it grovels for eight years for the  restoration of relations. Eventually, because of the requests  and pleading on the part of London, relations were resumed. On  another day the mischievous British, who have used the  unfortunate Salman Rushdie as a tool for their policies, once  again broke off relations and then apologized and relations were  resumed.    Today, once again the British have adopted a new policy in  their propaganda and are making new claims. The response to the  latest British claims is something that pertains to our Foreign  Ministry, which on principle has delivered a firm and poised  response on this matter.    However, it is essential that our officials should study  this  dossier and learn the appropriate lessons. They should reach  the conclusion that the British are not reliable people and  therefore it is necessary that the level of relations with  London should be reduced to a minimum, especially in the  economic field.    We should not forget that even on sending our students to  England the British sought to capitalize on this issue for  political leverage. They even deprived our students at the  doctorate level from presenting their dissertations and expelled  them in a hostile and unprincipled way.    With such a black dossier, the British are absolutely  untrustworthy and the objective of their latest game has not yet  been revealed. In any case, it is necessary that the Foreign  Ministry and the decisionmaking centers be vigilant and appraise  all aspects of the issue so that the London Government cannot  capitalize once again on this foolish politico-propagandistic  game. The experience of the past 15 years since our Revolution  proves that it is only possible in this manner to make London  realize that it is mistaken in its calculations and is treading  the wrong path.</p>

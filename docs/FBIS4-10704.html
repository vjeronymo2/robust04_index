			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 16 Apr (EFE) -- The Zapatista National  Liberation Army [EZLN] said it has no involvement in the attack  on an Army post, which took place in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas  State, in southeastern Mexico, on Friday. In a communique sent  to the media, EZLN leader "Subcommander Marcos" indicated that  the EZLN has no military position at all or troops in the area  where the attack took place.    Unidentified persons early Friday morning attacked an Army  post in the town of Chicoasen, some 8 km from the Chiapas State  capital, in which a sergeant was killed. "The EZLN does not  have good weapons or sufficient vehicles, but it does have  military honor and its word; the EZLN promised, if it is not  attacked, not to carry out offensive military operations against  federal troops or their positions," the communique stated.    The rebel group reiterated its commitment to respect the  cease-fire and promised not to carry out offensive military  actions against government forces in the entire national  territory under the conditions set forth on 12 January when the  truce was accepted. Marcos reiterated the guerrillas' commitment  to continue working for a dialogue in search of peace with  justice and dignity. He added that the EZLN is waiting for the  reestablishment of the proper conditions to resume the dialogue  with the government.    The EZLN rose up in arms on 1 January to demand social  justice for the Indians, and their clashes with the government  forces lasted until 12 January, when a cease-fire was decreed by  both sides.</p>

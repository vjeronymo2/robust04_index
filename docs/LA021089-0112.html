			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER HORSE RUNNING AT SANTA ANITA TURNS UP WITH POSITIVE COCAINE TEST  </P> <P> Trainer Laz Barrera, whose son, Albert, ran a horse last week at Santa Anita  that tested positive for cocaine, said Thursday that someone would have to be  "very stupid" to try to win a race that way.  </P> <P> "They would have to be very stupid . . . to use cocaine," said the elder  Barrera, who is in racing's Hall of Fame. "Because you know that if you use it,  they're going to pick it up."  </P> <P> According to the Associated Press, Albert Barrera denied knowledge of how the  cocaine got into the system of the horse when he was questioned by a California  Horse Racing Board investigator.  </P> <P> The most recent detection is at least the third since a horse trained by Roger  Stein tested positive for the drug after a race last October at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Len Foote, executive secretary of the CHRB, said that the state lab has found  two other cocaine positives recently.  </P> <P> Albert Barrera, 34, trains Coastal Commission, a 4-year-old filly who ran next  to last after going off as the 2-1 favorite in a race at Santa Anita last  Thursday.  </P> <P> A California state investigator said that a search of Albert Barrera's barn at  Santa Anita turned up nothing illegal.

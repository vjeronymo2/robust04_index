			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Airflow dives to Pounds 87,000 PROFITS before tax of Airflow Streamlines, the Northampton-based cab manufacturer and Ford main dealer, fell from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 87,000 over the 12 months ended February 29. Earnings per share dived to 0.07p (8.97p) and the dividend for the year is a nominal 0.1p - shareholders received a 4p total the previous year. The directors said reduced demand had affected both the cab-making operations of the production division and Whiteleys during the opening half year. They added, however, that the delayed introduction of a new model range in August had improved the trading position in the second half but not enough to recover the loss in the first half. The Ford main dealership continued to experience reduced sales and margins for new vehicles, but used car sales and margins were improved. Looking ahead, the directors said that 'after two years of reduced demand . . . the prospect of improved trading conditions appears to be emerging'.</p>

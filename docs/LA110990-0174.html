			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> RED ALERT WINDS UP FALSE ALARM  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies rushed into a home with guns drawn in response to a series  of 911 calls but found out they had been summoned by a tomato.  </P> <P> Authorities became interested last weekend when a Montgomery County dispatcher  traced repeated emergency calls to the home of Linda and Danny Hurst.  </P> <P> The Hursts were not home, so police figured someone might have broken in.  Deputies went in with their guns drawn and found the house empty.  </P> <P> Then Danny Hurst, who had been called to the scene, found an overripe tomato in  a hanging basket dripping juice onto a telephone-answering machine below.  </P> <P> As best police can figure it, the juice from the distressed tomato shorted out  the machine's dialing system, causing it to call the Sheriff's Department  emergency line.  </P></p>

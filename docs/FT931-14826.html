			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Thyssen Industries soars 50% to DM460m pre-tax THYSSEN INDUSTRIES, the engineering arm of West Germany's biggest steel and engineering conglomerate, raised pre-tax profits by 50 per cent to DM460m (Dollars 289.3m) for the year to end-September from DM307.3m the previous year. The group, which produces components for the transport and energy sector, saw its sales rise 4.2 per cent to DM8.7bn. Strong results were recorded in its elevators, transport technology and maritime innovation divisions. But losses continued to plague its engineering group, which is suffering from the recession trends on the car industry. But Mr Eckhard Rohkamm, board chairman, said losses in the engineering divisions had been halved over the previous year and now stood 'under DM40m'. The group will transfer DM186m to Thyssen AG, the parent company which also owns Thyssen Stahl, the loss-making steel operations, compared with DM52.1m previously.</p>

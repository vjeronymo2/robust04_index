			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Washington told Japan will resume aid to Vietnam soon JAPAN has informed the US that it will resume economic aid to Vietnam shortly after the US presidential election next Tuesday, the Washington Post said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. The Japanese decision would open a big new breach in the US-led economic embargo against Vietnam. The Post quoted US administration officials as having said that the Japanese decision might be announced about November 6. The Japanese had postponed, at the request of the US, resumption of aid to Vietnam, which they were intending to start in August. The newspaper quoted a US State Department official as having said that the Japanese had been most co-operative with US policies toward Vietnam. This response suggests that US reaction to the new Japanese decision would be muted. The US is involved in a review of its relationship with Vietnam, the Vietnamese having provided access to extensive archives dealing with the fate of US prisoners of war and missing servicemen. The Bush administration has delayed any improvement in relations, however, because of lack of progress in determining the fate of 2,265 Americans who were involved in the Vietnam war. The future of the trade embargo and normalisation of diplomatic relations are issues under review by the US administration, following the opening of Vietnamese records that include 4,800 photographs of American war dead and prisoners. According to figures provided to the Washington Post by the Vietnamese State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, at least 37 nations are trading with or investing in Vietnam, including such friends of the US as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Britain, France, Germany, Australia and Canada. The Japanese decision will make the embargo even less effective, according to economic analysts quoted by the Post.</p>

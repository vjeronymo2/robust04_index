			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The CFA franc has been devalued by 50 percent as of  0000 GMT last night. In other words, 1 French franc, which was  worth 50 CFA francs, is now worth 100 CFA francs. Since the  announcement of news of the devaluation yesterday, a lot of  images have collapsed -- that of a friendly and generous France.  And for most francophone countries, especially those in the  franc zone, the attitude of France is felt as an apparent  affront to solidarity, a form of injustice and even a betrayal.    For instance, in Gabon it is believed that with the  devaluation of the CFA franc, the yard sale of the black  continent has been set in motion. This perhaps harsh statement  is tinged with more or less justified pessimism. Today,  everyone knows that this devaluation will plunge all the  countries of the zone into a maze of difficulties which they  will now have to face all alone. These difficulties comprise a  budget deficit, debt, a decrease in purchasing power, and  unemployed youth, bringing in their stride the risk of social  conflicts.    Our country, which is presented as one of the rare African  countries likely to gain from the CFA franc devaluation, and  which has for a long time prepared for this eventuality, hopes  that the devaluation which has just been decided in Dakar will  make for a better exploitation of its economic potential.    Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan returned to Abidjan this  morning. The head of government has just participated in the  deliberations of the dual-purpose summit on multinational  company Air Afrique and the CFA franc. The heads of state and  government of the franc zone -- as we very well know since  yesterday -- have accepted the devaluation of the CFA franc by  50 percent. While waiting for the news conference on this  decision, here are the initial comments of the head of  government on his return this morning from Dakar. He was  talking to Rene Bah:    [Begin Duncan recording] At several meetings that we had  with  the national and international press, I indicated clearly that  when an economy is sick, there are three types of measures to be  taken. There is internal adjustment which is an important  measure consisting of reducing state expenditure and increasing  state revenue. The second measure is monetary adjustment while  the third measure consists of a mixture of the two. In reality,  in a case where internal adjustment does not yield sufficient  results, monetary adjusment will complement the internal  adjustment measure. This has positive elements and I will  elaborate at length later. But first of all I must give an  overall account to the head of state.    However, I simply wish to say that this measure will make  our country more competitive and improve its chances of  exporting abroad. That we are one of the relatively  industrialized countries in Africa and therefore have a large  export capacity worth over 400 billion CFA franc a year. So we  can have a larger revenue. It is a positive measure since state  revenue will increase. This means that the country will have  more room for maneuver. It will especially enable us to solve  the dogged problem of internal debt. This is something that we  must not lose sight of. Moreover, it will enable us to increase  internal savings and permit the rapatriation of capital from  abroad, since there was an evident lack of confidence in our  economy.    It will also permit the development of our local industries  and what is important our local agricultural production. We  shall have to consume much more of local produce because local  prices of imported products will increase. So there are  significant prospects for the country and it must be underlined  that there will again be significant financial assistance to the  country. We shall have the opportunity to develop all these at  a news conference before the end of the week. [end recording]</p>

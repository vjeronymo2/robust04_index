			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Hazards on the high seas: Traditional methods of guaranteeing maritime safety are proving inadequate The Ship that Died of Shame tells the story of a wartime gunboat which is bought by its crew and used for smuggling in peace time. In the novel by Nicholas Monsarrat, subsequently turned into a film, the ship acquires a character of its own and resists the actions of its owners. In real life, of course, ships do not revolt in this way, though governments and the international shipping organisations charged with maintaining maritime safety might be forgiven for wishing they could. For far too many among the world shipping fleet represent a hazard afloat, and it is not just the ships but their crews and the marine environment which are the victims. So bad have matters become that national and worldwide regulatory authorities are being forced, as a last desperate measure, to shame shipowners into improving the quality of their vessels. The UK government this month produced its first monthly blacklist of sub-standard ships docking at British ports. The US Coast Guard, meanwhile, has published a list of 137 shipowners and operators, including some prominent names in the industry, whose vessels will be the subject of special safety checks when they enter US waters. These actions by the British and US authorities have been spurred by an increasing awareness that the established methods of guaranteeing maritime safety are proving inadequate. Presenting his report into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping in UK waters in May, Lord Donaldson, a former senior appeals court judge, spoke of his 'astonishment' at the conditions he had discovered and of 'the quite appalling record' of defects found on vessels visiting UK ports. The Donaldson report, Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas, was prompted by the sinking of the oil tanker Braer off the Shetland Isles in January 1993. In the 15 months it took the inquiry team to produce its 103 recommendations for safety improvements, no fewer than 67 serious incidents - just over one a week - occurred in UK waters, which could have led to serious pollution. The Donaldson inquiry and recent US legislation were both the result of oil spills - the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was prompted by the grounding of the tanker the Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989 - but governments, seafarers' trades unions and the international shipping organisations are concerned not only with environmental dangers but with the broader aspects of safety. No fewer than 121 ships were lost at sea in 1993, a 9 per cent increase on the year before, leading to the loss of 592 lives or 35 per cent more than in 1992, according to Numast, the international union of ships' officers based in the UK. The picture presented by the Donaldson inquiry, Numast and the US coastguard is one of the world's oceans criss-crossed by ageing rustbuckets, lurching, and sometimes failing even to lurch, from port to port. The 522-page Donaldson report includes worrying photographs of badly corroded ballast tanks and rusted support brackets. Individual shipowners deny that maritime safety is as bleak as critics suggest. 'In every sack of potatoes there will be a rotten one but the whole industry is being judged by these exceptions,' says Mr Jacob Stolt-Nielson Jr, chairman of a shipping company which operates speciality chemical tankers. The Donaldson inquiry painted too alarmist a picture to grab attention, commented another Scandinavian shipowner. The International Chamber of Shipping, the London-based association of shipowners, in its latest annual review, points out that 99.9 per cent of the 1.7bn tonnes of oil carried by sea in 1993 reached its destination without mishap. 'Merchant ships have been quietly engaging in what they do best, carrying the world's 4.3bn tonnes of seaborne trade economically, efficiently and safely,' the chamber says soothingly. But this gloss on the state of the world's shipping fleet is not supported by the frenzy of activity among the regulatory bodies concerned at the potential environmental disasters and accidents to crew that could be caused by the world's shipping fleet. They point to a combination of factors which have led to a downward spiral in the quality of ship operations. These include: Overcapacity in the world's fleet, which has put fierce pressure on the rates shipowners can demand for their vessels. The owner of a new 250,000-tonne supertanker would need to earn between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 50,000 a day to meet his operating and financing costs on his Dollars 100m-plus purchase. In recent times he has only been able to earn about Dollars 10,000 a day. 'This encourages owners to keep their older ships trading because no one has the capital to invest in new ones,' says Mr Julian Parker, secretary of the Nautical Institute, an international organisation representing professionally qualified mariners, such as ship's captains and harbour masters. 'There is a downward pressure to lower costs and reduce safety.' The declining importance of the traditional shipping nations and a shift of both vessel ownership and registration to third world countries, many without established training schemes or the infrastructure to provide a high-class shipping industry. 'Thirty years ago 80 per cent of the world fleet was owned by the traditional maritime nations,' says Mr Parker. 'There was bags of money, shipowners sat in the House of Lords and everyone operated to a good standard. Then 70 per cent of the fleets began to sail under flags of convenience to save costs.' Many of the world's ships are now owned or registered - flagged - in countries with weak regulation. The flag states are responsible for implementing inspection regimes and ensuring a ship's safety. For some of the smaller or poorer countries with expanding fleets, European or American concepts of safety can appear unrealistic. 'If standards are set too high, the poorer countries say they will not be able to trade,' says Mr Fernando Plaza, senior deputy director of maritime safety at the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency responsible for maritime affairs. The inability, and in some cases the unwillingess, of countries to police the ships which sail under their flags, has led to a breakdown in this traditional mechanism for maintaining maritime standards. If the flag state does not insist on a proper technical inspection of its vessels or demand high standards of its crews, an important plank of shipping safety is taken away. Panama heads the table of numbers of ships lost in the first six months of this year, compiled by the Institute of London Underwriters, followed by Cyprus, Malta, Honduras, Indonesia, China and St Vincent and Grenadine. Liberia, which is frequently singled out for criticism and the country of registration for the Braer, lost one ship during the period. The mixed quality of the classification societies, the organisations which provide the technical experts to ensure that vessels are well-designed, solidly built and properly maintained. The societies are called in by owners or insurers to evaluate a ship's seaworthiness. The older-established societies such as Lloyd's Register, Det Norske Veritas and the American Bureau of Shipping have been joined in recent years by a host of newcomers, and there are now nearly 50 societies around the world. Few have the resources to maintain a worldwide network of inspectors, so they cannot always inspect a ship involved in a collision or grounding, and all are under strong commercial pressure to be generous in their ratings. Even if a classification society is doing its job well, there is nothing to stop a shipowner moving his vessel to a different society, which may not set such high standards and may therefore be cheaper. Though the system is voluntary, insurance would, in practice, be impossible to obtain without a rating. The apparent inability of the International Maritime Organisation to act speedily to improve standards. Frustration with the slow pace of reform through the organisation has been a recurrent theme of complaints by individual governments. 'Prolonged debate by member states in committees and sub-committees can imply a lack of urgency or a failure to set adequate or clear priorities,' Britain's then shipping minister, Lord Caithness, told an IMO assembly last October. Public opinion concerning safety would not be willing to await 'completion of the IMO's deliberations or to accept a long-delayed compromise solution. If IMO and its member states don't act, others will,' the minister warned. The London-based organisation has tried to speed up its procedures in recent years but is limited in what it can do. The IMO is not a political body but is a technical organisation with a mandate to provide the machinery for co-operation among its 147 member states, explains Mr Plaza. 'For some of our members the pace is unbearably quick, for others we are very slow,' he adds. The speed of change is determined by the need to reach a consensus among member states and then achieve ratification of a measure by their governments. Obtaining ratification for changes in international agreements by a two-thirds majority can take up to 10 years. The failure lies not with the organisation for its inability to devise agreements but with member states for failing to implement them, according to Mr Plaza. The IMO is now shifting its emphasis away from writing new rules to making sure its members implement those already in existence. However, the perception exists that the IMO is ineffective. The vacuum is being filled by individual countries, including the UK and the US, or by larger regional groupings such as the European Union. The European Commission has been working on a series of proposals to tighten up controls on the industry. These are aimed at setting minimum requirements for seafarers' qualifications, requiring separate ballast tanks so that tankers do not discharge oily ballast water into the sea, and tough controls of vessels docking at European ports. The International Chamber of Shipping worries about the possible fragmentation of global responsibility for maritime safety. It wants the IMO to retain responsibility for policing the oceans, but fears the Commission 'is trying to make a takeover bid'. However, an official of DG7, the EU transport directorate, says the Commission is merely trying to give force to the IMO's resolutions, which would otherwise be ignored by its members. 'It must all be done within the framework of the IMO,' she adds. Shipowners, too, are anxious that regulation of the industry should remain centralised under the IMO. They point to the US Oil Pollution Act, which has set demanding new requirements for tankers entering US waters and imposed unlimited liability on shipowners whose vessels cause pollution. One unintended effect of the unlimited liability clause has been to keep some responsible shipowners out of US waters. 'The good shipowners can't get the level of insurance cover the US wants, while the lousy ones don't bother,' says Mr Mike Plumridge, deputy secretary of the Nautical Institute. 'The US could end up with the world's scrapyard ships.' The growing move towards inspection of vessels in the ports where they dock also weakens global regulation of shipping safety. Port state control, as this is known, undermines the supervisory role which should be exercised by the flag state, the country under whose flag the vessel sails. If inspection moves from the flag states to the local port authorities, it will become difficult to maintain common standards. In some parts of the world, port control could become an excuse for delaying ships unjustifiably to extort payments from their owners. 'Shipping is a global industry,' says Mr Parker. 'Port control could inhibit free trade.' It is this concern to balance the traditional self-regulation enjoyed by the shipping industry with the need to reduce the risks to seafarers and the environment that lies at the heart of current debate. The industry points out that the openness of the maritime market has produced enormous benefits for the shipper and meant that shipping costs are no higher in real terms than they were 30 years ago. Consumers have also benefited from this cost control. Resolving the conflicts between flexibility and safety will not be easy and may mean a change in much cherished shipping practices. But it will be difficult to reverse the developments currently under way. Shipowners, it seems, will have to find a way to adapt to a patchwork of regional rules and port inspections.</p>

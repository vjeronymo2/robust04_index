			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Girolami defends Pounds 9m package Sir Paul Girolami yesterday defended a Pounds 9.37m two-year package of salary, bonuses and pension contributions at his last annual meeting as chairman of Glaxo. Sir Paul, who retired yesterday after 14 years at the helm of the pharmaceuticals company, was questioned by angry shareholders about his remuneration. The payments include Pounds 6.44m in pension fund contributions, of which Pounds 2.05m result from his retiring two years early. Sir Paul, 68, countered his critics by arguing that the figure was an arbitrary calculation. 'This so-called package consists of apples and oranges. It consists of salary over two years, but why not make it 10 or 20 years? 'It is not a package, and includes payments made to the pension fund and not to me. My pension is determined by my contract.' Since Sir Paul stepped into the chief executive's shoes in 1980, Glaxo's market capitalisation has increased more than 40-fold from Pounds 429m to Pounds 18.8bn. He transformed the group from a diversified also-ran into Europe's largest prescription drugs company. In the year he took over the reins, the company posted pretax profits of just Pounds 66m. That compared with Pounds 1.84bn last year. The Pounds 9.37m is equivalent to 34 hours of global sales of Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which is the world's best-selling medicine. Sir Paul's marketing prowess is widely credited with the product's huge success. At yesterday's meeting, Sir Paul also faced uncomfortable questions on Glaxo's Pounds 115m provision for losses on its bond portfolio in the year to June 30. The company warned it would incur a further Pounds 16m loss this year and has since liquidated its Pounds 1.7bn portfolio and reinvested the funds in bank deposits and gilts. 'We made a series of bad judgments. We got into the wrong bonds at the wrong time and we got into so-called derivatives without understanding what they meant,' he said. In a trading statement, Sir Paul confirmed Glaxo's sales growth had slowed in the first four months of the year, with the weak dollar contributing to the slowdown. 'However, I am pleased to tell you that our new generation of products continues to make a strong contribution to the group's results,' he added. Sir Paul, who worked at Glaxo for 29 years, is replaced by Sir Colin Corness, chairman of the building group Redland and the Nationwide Building Society.</p>

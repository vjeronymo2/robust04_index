			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Warning on equal opportunities ENGINEERING union negotiators should refuse to sign annual pay-and-conditions agreements with employers unless they contain an 'open commitment to guaranteeing equal opportunities', the women's section of the AEEU engineering and electrical workers' union said yesterday . The AEEU's ruling executive council looks certain to accept the unanimous vote at the women engineers' annual conference that no agreements be signed without the equal opportunities clause. The conference also condemned Opportunity 2000, the employer-led initiative which aims to improve the position of women in the workforce, as 'no more than a convenient smokescreen' behind which companies were hiding.</p>

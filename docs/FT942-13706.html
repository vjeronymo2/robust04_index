			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Increased likelihood of further bids The 'for sale' signs have yet to be hoisted outside the headquarters of the UK's larger building societies, but it is already clear that the Lloyds Bank offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, has increased the prospects that such signs will appear. In particular, if the way is cleared in the High Court for cash to be handed out without restriction to a society's members and savers, then banks, life insurers and other financial services organisations which have been eyeing societies will be more inclined to make an offer. The new interest in valuations and purchasing was summed up by the reaction to comments from Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the retail division at Abbey National, the former building society which became a bank in 1988. Regardless of his protestations that there was nothing happening and that the banking group had been saying for some time that it could well be interested in acquiring a building society, his remarks fuelled speculation about which society would be next, and with whom. 'It's a lottery,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS. 'There are two sorts of societies which are likely to be approached: aggressive, excellent performers, and the 'also rans' which might be acquired by a potential partner with a view to asset stripping.' Before the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal put the spotlight on the idea of a society being acquired by another financial services organisation, attention had been focused on which societies might simply convert into becoming banks as Abbey National did in 1989. Inevitably, this highlighted the future plans of the very largest societies, such as Halifax, Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance &amp; Leicester, which provide a full range of financial services rather than fitting easily into another organisation's structure. Such societies would be extremely expensive to acquire, even for cash rich groups. Putting a value of Pounds 1.8bn on C&amp;G, the sixth largest society, has led other societies to estimate their own worth, and the prices rise sharply. It is not easy to see who would have the billions of spare cash that would be needed to raise even the slightest flicker of interest at Halifax. So the very largest societies might well not suit a UK-based financial services operation as an acquisition. The picture might be different, however, for any US, Japanese or European bank which might be interested in acquiring UK distribution and would be content to leave the existing management considerable autonomy. That is a point that has not been lost within the societies sector. However, in terms of a joint operation with a UK financial services group, it is the slightly smaller - though still substantial - societies which seem likely to be at the top of lists of prospects being drawn up by merchant bankers and other advisers. Within this category, there are both the well-performing, clearly branded societies and also those which can see that as the competition intensifies further, their own future looks bleaker, perhaps because their scale does not allow them to offer products as competitive as they will need to be, or simply because their geographical spread is too limited. While it would take a very long time for a society to fall into serious trouble - and at that point the need to guarantee its deposits might well make it too expensive - years of genteel decline might not appeal to management. They might not appeal either to members. One of the threads running through societies' responses to the Lloyds and C&amp;G deal is that the conventional charge that societies' boards are unaccountable because they do not have to put any offer to their members and their members cannot be targeted directly, no longer applies. More than one senior figure can envisage that a bank or insurance group which found its approach to a society blocked by the board, might simply let it be known publicly that it wanted to buy the society, and wait for the members to insist they be given the chance to make a decision on it. None of the successful though slightly smaller societies in the top twenty is admitting to having any offers yet in the wake of Thursday's announcement. They believe, however, that if the deal is cleared by the High Court in a judgment probably next month, then that will open the way much more clearly and could lead to an upturn in approaches to them. 'Like all societies now, we will be revisiting our strategic plan,' Mr Ken Culley, chief executive of Portman Building Society, said yesterday. Another attractive prospect might be Birmingham Midshires, which has been gaining size through acquiring mortgage books. Mr Mike Jackson, the chief executive, says that he does not see the society as being other than a lead partner in a merger or joint operation. But the current climate in the sector is such that one of the phrases most in use is 'never say 'never''. While some senior executives believe that their members will have new temptations to cash in their membership of a mutual for a lump sum, they believe also that not all investors will want to lose their continuing rights. Mr John Burke, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West Building Society, said there was no need to rush into immediate change, and that the society needed to carry out some research on what its customers wanted. Particularly at a time of low interest rates, building societies tend to appeal to investors who want safety first rather than high returns. However, in the new landscape, where some investors can see others getting 'windfall' benefits, some senior executives believe they may have to remind their members about the advantages of continuing mutuality. One slight difficulty with this is that some of the more obvious benefits investors see in remaining with a society rather than a bank relate to questions of risk rather than of their role in the running of the institution: a plc that simil-arly specialised in retail savings and residential mortgages might be equally attractive. Perhaps the most realistic note was struck by the senior executive who discussed how, though the benefit of membership of a society had been newly given tangible - indeed cash - form, members could still be induced not to lose sight of the longer term. If faced with an unwelcome approach, he said, 'I would say to them that if I wanted to crystallise shareholder value I wouldn't want to do it now. I would tell the members that when we eventually pay out, they will be in a better position to get a bigger payment.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Assets                                            (Pounds bn) Society                                 1993      Percent*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax (year to Jan 94)                67.20        6.5 Nationwide (year to Apr 93)             35.00        2.5 Woolwich                                25.23        8.5 Alliance &amp; Leicester                    21.09        2.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Leeds Perm.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILLIP L. ROSSMAN; FOUNDER OF THE VENICE FAMILY CLINIC  </P> <P> A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. today at Hillside Memorial Park for  Dr. Phillip L. Rossman, the much beloved and honored internist who gave birth  to the Venice Family Clinic 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Rossman was 76 when he died Monday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center,  where he had been on the staff for many years.  </P> <P> In 1970 he and Dr. Mayer Davidson, now director of the diabetes program at  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, established the clinic after Rossman learned there  was only one doctor serving 18,000 people in the Venice area, as opposed to a  1-400 ratio statewide.  </P> <P> Rossman first became aware of the Venice community's need when he attended the  opening of a county health facility in nearby Santa Monica. What was to have  been a celebration, he recalled years later, nearly became a riot.  </P> <P> "Loud chants of 'We want medical care!' came from protesters outside," he said.  The demonstrators were poor people from Venice who would have had to take two  buses just to get to the new Santa Monica clinic.  </P> <P> Rossman, who was there as the appointee of the Los Angeles County Medical  Assn.'s Bay District 5 Public Health Committee, went outside to hear their  complaints.  </P> <P> "I just told them to give me their names and a number where I could reach  them," he said. "And in the meantime I told them to go inside and eat their  cookies and drink their tea. . . . Just behave yourselves and we'll work it  out. . . ."  </P> <P> From that conversation and meetings with Davidson, who arranged for volunteer  physicians, a nonprofit free clinic was established in a UCLA dental facility  on Lincoln Boulevard near Rose Avenue. Rossman guided the clinic in its  formative years. In the clinic's first year it served only what few patients he  could see at the end of his own professional day.  </P> <P> But as physician interest expanded and drug and X-ray services became more  plentiful, the clinic grew to a point where it now serves 30,000 a year. With a  recent building addition at its new location at Rose and 6th avenues, it is now  capable of serving 50,000.  </P> <P> In 1987 Rossman was honored by the National Philanthropy Committee as  "Outstanding Founder in Philanthropy"; the same year St. John's named him its  outstanding physician. This year the clinic -- which many thought would  eventually have to be funded by county taxpayers but instead exists on  fund-raisers, some state help and private foundation grants -- also honored  him.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Ruth, a daughter, two grandchildren, a sister and a  brother, who ask donations in his name to the clinic at 604 Rose Ave., Venice  90291.  </P></p>

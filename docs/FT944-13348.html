			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Compromise in OECD job row France and Canada have reached a compromise that could settle a dispute over who should be the next secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Under their proposal Frenchman Jean-Claude Paye, who was seeking a third five-year term after his mandate expired last month, would be reinstalled as head of the 25-nation economic think-tank for two years. Donald Johnston, a former Canadian finance minister and the candidate backed strongly by the US and most other non-European members, would then serve a full five-year term. The question now is whether the US will swallow the deal, a diplomat said. The US is keen that the job should go to a non-European and diplomats said the OECD dilemma may not be resolved until the contest for the top job at the World Trade Organisation - the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - is over. Washington is promoting Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who leaves office on November 30, for the the WTO job.</p>

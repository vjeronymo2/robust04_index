			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERATIC CLOWN HAS SERIOUS SIDE  </P> <P> Bass-baritone Francois Loup sees comic opera as serious business. But, although  the Swiss-born singer has made his musical mark as an adept basso buffo, he  cannot help but absorb the societal second-class stigma that brands the  comedian.  </P> <P> "When I sing a comic role, I have to fight against the feeling that I am just a  clown in life, because the comic part is often the mirror of somebody who was  not successful in life, somebody society makes fun of," he said. "But, when I  sing some serious role, I feel more important."  </P> <P> Saturday at Civic Theatre, Loup will sing the title role of Donizetti's "Don  Pasquale" in San Diego Opera's production of this classic opera buffa. His  local debut two years ago in another typical comic role, Dr. Bartolo in  Rossini's "Il Barbiere di Siviglia," brought him both critical acclaim and a  return invitation to San Diego.  </P> <P> If operatic comic roles do not have the cachet of serious roles, they are still  harder to bring off, according to Loup.  </P> <P> "It is easy to make people cry -- I know, I do serious roles," he said. Before  his arrival in San Diego last week, Loup had sung the role of Schigolch in  Alban Berg's bleak Expressionist tragedy "Lulu."  </P> <P> "I'm always surprised that just by opening my mouth and singing a serious role,  I can reduce people to tears," he said.  </P> <P> But to make people laugh is another thing. Loup compared his task as a comic  singer to telling a joke to friends. They may laugh the first time, he noted,  but, if you tell the joke again, there's usually no response. The trick in  singing a comic role is to get the audience to laugh every time, even when they  know what the joke or the comic situation is.  </P> <P> In "Don Pasquale," among the last of Donizetti's 66 operas, the composer's wit  and dramatic skills make the singers' task easier.  </P> <P> "Usually, when you have early 19th-Century music, even Bellini, you can foresee  much of what is going to come," Loup said. "Donizetti, however, is much less  predictable. When I revived the role of Don Pasquale, I had forgotten that we  go from one surprise to the next, which keeps the opera alive for the  listener."  </P> <P> Politicians have given Loup unintentional models for his comic  characterizations.  </P> <P> "I like to watch political characters," he said. "When I sing, sometimes I take  things from them, although someone like Francois Mitterrand is a bit too  humorless to be much of a model."  </P> <P> According to Loup, it is the politician's calculated sincerity that is the most  applicable trait for the comic opera singer.  </P> <P> "Politicians have to please the public," he said. "They cannot become too  involved; they need some distance and a certain amount of objectivity. If you  are too sincere, you don't know what you are doing with your hands and eyes.  The politicians watch themselves and their words."  </P> <P> "I am happy and proud to be a comic basso," he said. "I have worked years in  front of a video camera to develop my attitude, my looks, my reactions to comic  situations."  </P> <P> Among the 40 roles Loup performs, his comic roles are nearly all from the 18th-  and 19th-Century opera repertory. The successful comic opera, he noted, is rare  in this century.  </P> <P> "It's a typical modern attitude. They do not want to laugh anymore --  everything has to have a philosophical bent," Loup said.  </P> <P> Contemporary musical styles have not been particularly conducive to the comic  muse, either. Loup cited Frank Martin's 1962 opera, "Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,"  which the noted serial Swiss composer based on a Moliere comedy.  </P> <P> "It is a well-written opera, but, when I sang it, I felt no comic feeling  coming out of the opera. Whenever Poulenc is comic, for example in his 'Les  Mamelles de Tiresias,' his style is tonal."  </P> <P> Loup comes from a long line of educators. His father, writer and educator  Robert Loup, founded the school Francois attended in his native  Estavayer-le-Lac, Switzerland. Although Loup's performing prevents him from  carrying on the family pedagogical tradition, he does run an informal summer  school for singers at his home in Bourges, 120 miles south of Paris.  </P> <P> "During the summer, I have five or six students who come and live at the farm.  Completely abandoned from the rest of the world, they can concentrate on  singing. They sleep well and eat well, because I like to cook," Loup said.  </P></p>

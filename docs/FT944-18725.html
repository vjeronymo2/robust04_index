			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / BSkyB to decide on flotation in London and New York British Sky Broadcasting will have to decide this week if it is to go ahead with a flotation before Christmas on the London and New York stock exchanges. Shareholders of the satellite television venture have been in talks for the past month trying to agree on a flotation that would value the company at more than Pounds 4bn. Immediate agreement would allow a share issue to go ahead between now and Christmas - when most new satellite dishes and subscriptions are sold. If this opportunity is missed, conditions for a flotation might not be as favourable again until autumn next year. Unanimous agreement is almost certainly needed between the main shareholders  -Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Chargeurs, the French transport and media group; Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times; and Granada, the media, leisure and computer services company. A flotation would be difficult to organise without the agreement of all the main shareholders because the four have pre-emption rights to buy if any of the others want to sell. In addition, there are complex tax issues involved in replacing debt with equity. Mr Murdoch, who is being advised by Goldman Sachs, is keen to float, primarily in order to reduce debt and release capital to invest in his Asian satellite venture, Star TV. There may also be a political dimension. A future Labour government might present News Corp with the choice of selling its national newspapers or reducing its 50 per cent stake in BSkyB. The latest date for the next general election in the UK is 1997. Of the other main shareholders, Granada has frequently made clear that it would sell its 13.5 per cent stake under the right conditions. Pearson, which is being advised by Lazard Brothers, has suggested it might be interested in increasing its stake in BSkyB, which lifted its operating profits in the year to June from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 176.8m. However, it is not thought to be averse to a flotation. The main obstacle to a flotation appears to be Chargeurs, which does not have a pressing need for funds and believes the value of the satellite company will rise. It may decide to hold on to its stake. One possibility under consideration is to sell shares directly to 3.45m subscribers, 74 per cent receiving the television channels on dishes, with most of the rest attached to cable networks. At the weekend BSkyB added five new services to its Sky Multi-Channels package and increased all subscription charges by Pounds 3 a month.</p>

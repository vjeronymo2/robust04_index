			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Geneva talks stave off war in ex-Yugoslavia - for a while: Gloomy prospect from Bosnia 'contact group' discussions The spectre of war spreading through former Yugoslavia has been staved off, but only a small amount of time, perhaps just a few weeks, has been gained. That was the gloomy prospect to emerge from the weekend's talks in Geneva among the five-nation 'contact group' on Bosnia. Foreign ministers from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany, plus Greece as the outgoing chairman of the European Union, met to select a mix of carrots and sticks to drive on their peace initiative, slow to move forward since its birth last month. They were also keen to prevent the Balkan conflict from poisoning their relations with one another. The plan would in effect divide Bosnia between the Serbs and a Moslem-Croat alliance, with the Serbs cutting their share of territory from 70 to 49 per cent. Faced with a 'yes' from Bosnia's Moslem leaders and a virtual 'no' from the Bosnian Serbs, the ministers agreed on a gradual escalation of pressure, while keeping the door open. They pledged to reinforce and broaden the flagging regime of sanctions against the Yugoslav republic (which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro); and also to police more strictly Bosnia's exclusion zones designed to protect Moslems. A new resolution on sanctions could be presented to the Security Council within a week, and by the end of this month, Nato should have devised a way to use more air power against the Serbs without leaving UN's ground troops too vulnerable. As part of the attempt to reinforce sanctions, the ministers pledged to approach Serbia's neighbours and offer financial compensation in return for policing borders more tightly. The US delegation, led by the secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, came away from Geneva frustrated because of the mildness of the proposed action against the Serbs. In a bow to congressional pressure for a unilateral US move to permit arms supplies to the Moslems, Mr Christopher said: 'We are not prepared to see this process strung out indefinitely. We cannot continue this situation where the victims are punished by the arms embargo and are denied the right to defend themselves.' Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, retorted that 'hot-heads' in the Moscow parliament would respond to any unilateral US move by pulling out of economic sanctions against the Serbs. It was clear in Geneva that Russia feels no enthusiasm whatsoever for the idea of intensifying economic pressure on Serb leaders in Belgrade, who are viewed in Moscow as a helpful influence on their kinsmen in Bosnia. Mr Kozyrev did grudgingly sign up to the principle of tightening existing sanctions and exclusion zones; but he saw it as a necessary price for damping US zeal for the idea of allowing arms supplies to the Moslems. The Russian minister views the 'arm-the-Moslems' slogan with unmitigated dismay, and this alarm is broadly shared by the governments of Britain and France. All three governments made it clear they would withdrew their troops, which form the mainstay of the UN's peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, in the event of conflict reigniting and spreading. Yet Mr Kozyrev is aware of the desperate need to induce the Bosnian Serbs to come up with a more plausible position, if US enthusiasm for a 'fair fight' is to be kept under control. Because the contact group's map was presented on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' basis, there seems to be little room for the Serbs to modify their position and parry international anger - except through outright acceptance. Yet senior UK officials did see some scope for further negotiations at the margins of the plan. The contact group will not change its territorial proposals, but in principle the parties could do so by mutual agreement, they point out. Also, the peace plan does not lay down the constitutional arrangements - so that too is open to negotiation. Some observers see potential for give-and-take over Sarajevo, where the Serbs have hinted they would sacrifice the suburbs they control in return for territory elsewhere. In the words of one UK official: 'We have told the Serbs that it is no use saying 'Yes, but. . .' However, they could say 'Yes, and. . . ' Both Mr Kozyrev, and his Greek counterpart, Mr Karolos Papoulias, stressed that they viewed some softening in the Serb position as both desirable and possible. Yet even in the unlikely event of the Serbs coming round to virtual acceptance of the plan, the Bosnian government is likely - to judge from the statements of Moslem commanders - to seek ways of wriggling out of its own commitment. So the danger of an intensified war, which could spread northwards to Croatia and possibly southwards, to pit Slavs against Albanians, will not go away. This danger seems to weigh more heavily on European governments than in Washington. Where US politicians cling tenaciously to belief in 'righting wrongs', the foreign ministries of Europe have taken a more cautious attitude which stresses the need to limit damage and avoid further bloodshed. The Geneva meeting threw up repeated examples of a contrast in approaches between the US on one hand and all the Europeans - British, French and Russian - on the other. The European countries were at pains to stress the fragility of recent achievements, including the relative normalisation of life in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. All these achievements, they have pointed out, would be scuppered in the event of a general conflagration with Russia supporting one side and the US the other. Mr Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, both made the point that disagreements over Bosnia among the the big powers have had some disastrous consequences in the past. This, they implied, was a reason why the powers involved in Bosnian peace-broking should struggle to overcome their differences of approach, and to prevent these differences from poisoning their broader relationship. 'This century has many examples of what happens when other countries disagree about the Balkans,' said Mr Hurd, referring to the start of of the first world war 80 years ago after an assassination in Sarajevo.</p>

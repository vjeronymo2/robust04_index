			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Derwent Valley expands with Pounds 10m purchase DERWENT VALLEY Holdings, the property company, is expanding its portfolio with a Pounds 10.3m cash acquisition of 10 freehold properties funded by way of a net Pounds 16.9m placing and open offer. The company believed that values had stabilised and that confidence in the property market had returned. 'Attractive opportunities for property investment exist,' the directors said. Derwent has agreed to buy three freehold office buildings at Wrexham, Wellingborough and Shoreham, and seven freehold retail properties at Wallington. The principal purchase, for Pounds 5.25m, is a 54,560 sq ft office building in Wrexham. The Pounds 16.9m placing and open offer, fully underwritten by Warburg Securities, is priced at 450p for each of the 3.8m new shares to be issued - a discount to Wednesday's closing value of 493p. Qualifying shareholders can apply at the same price on 1-for-2 basis. Proceeds will be used to finance the acquisitions.</p>

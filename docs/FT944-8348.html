			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Renamo accepts poll defeat Fears of renewed war in Mozambique have receded with former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama's acceptance of defeat for his Renamo movement in last month's first multi-party general elections. Mr Dhlakama said on Saturday he accepted results giving victory in the poll to his civil war foes, President Joaquim Chissano and the Frelimo party, which has ruled since the 1975 independence from Portugal. But he insisted that final results announced by the independent National Electoral Commission contained irregularities and were not free and fair as declared by international observers. 'We accept the election results. But they were not fair,' he said.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4m loss at Gent after retail withdrawal A withdrawal from retail activities led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.28m at SR Gent, the Marks and Spencer garment supplier, for the year to June 30. The group reported a downturn from pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 2.52m, despite turnover rising 7 per cent from Pounds 120.5m to Pounds 129.3m. Retailing losses stood at Pounds 10.5m, including a provision of Pounds 7m of exceptional costs to cover the sale of Susan Woolf, a chain of women's fashion stores. However, the group's core business of garment production posted a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 5.93m), while turnover rose just 1 per cent to Pounds 117.5m (Pounds 116m). Mr Peter Wolff, chairman, said the Barnsley-based group was completing a strategy of moving 50 per cent of its garment production overseas. The company owns 25 per cent of a manufacturing company in Sri Lanka, with a workforce of 14,000. 'We are going back into our core business of manufacturing,' he said. Demand from Marks and Spencer is expected to rise this year as the group enters the menswear clothing market for the first time. The company has also seen growing demand for cinema-related merchandising in children's clothes. The pre-tax profits figure was struck after net interest charges up from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 2.4m, although the share of associates' profits rose to Pounds 758,000 (Pounds 430,000 losses). The shares closed up 6p at 75p yesterday. Earnings per share fell from 3.2p into a loss of 12.6p this year after exceptional costs. The final dividend was again 1.35p for a total of 2.25p (2.1p).</p>

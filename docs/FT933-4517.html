			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recession forces US coal consolidation - A third of the national market is now controlled by 23 companies A DECADE-long recession in the US coal industry has forced substantial consolidation over the past three years, as oil and steel companies have left the industry to focus on their core businesses. While the economic and environmental liabilities make coal a chancy investment, foreign natural resource companies, particularly UK and continental European interests, have moved in in surprising strength to acquire US coal reserves. In a study of the 81 coal company mergers and acquisitions in the US between 1990 and 1992, the consultants Resource Data International and Hicks and Associates found that ownership of 12 per cent of US coal production moved overseas during the period. This year, the world's biggest mining company, RTZ Corporation of the UK, boosted the foreign ownership figure to 17 per cent when it entered the US coal business through its purchase of the US mining company, Nerco. Nerco's assets included coal mines in the Powder River Basin with annual production of about 28.7m short tons (2,000lb each). RTZ quickly boosted its coal interests in the region by also acquiring Sun Oil Company's Cordero Mining Company for Dollars 120.5m. The Cordero property produced 13.3m tons of low sulphur coal last year. The expansion by overseas companies comes as some analysts say the coal industry's recession is bottoming out, and prospects, at least for environmentally correct low sulphur coal, are improving. A 20-year pattern of long-term coal contracts is also ending, a development that will change the economics of coal pricing. The trend toward consolidation and increasingly international ownership seems likely to continue. International companies like RTZ tend to take a longer view of the business, assessing the risk factors of coal mining quite differently from domestic companies. Coal is not a glamorous business, but it is a steady one. It generates more than half of the electric power produced in the US and of the 1bn tons of US coal mined annually, 75 per cent is consumed by electric utilities. The government suggests that US electric power consumption will to rise about 2 per cent a year over the next decade. 'The coal industry here is still very profitable, despite a long-term decline in coal prices,' says Mr Ronald McMahan, president of Colorado-based RDI. 'What we're seeing is a consolidation of properties in the hands of bigger, stronger players.' The consolidation includes not just the existing 2,800 coal mines in the US, but vast coal reserves that remain to be tapped. When Hanson bought 100 per cent of the Peabody Holding Company in two transactions valued at Dollars 1.23b in 1990, it became the owner of the largest coal mining company in the US. Peabody and related subsidiaries own 43 mines with 86.6m tons of annual production. Peabody's proven coal reserves are reckoned to be near 8.7bn tons. In 1991 the German concern, Rheinbraun AG made an even bigger investment in US coal, purchasing 50 per cent of Consol Energy for Dollars 1.3bn. Consol, a joint venture between Rheinbraun and DuPont, the US chemical company, is the US's second largest coal company, with 55.2m tons of annual production from 26 North American mines. Although most US coal is consumed domestically, 14 per cent of Consol's production was exported to the Far East and Europe, slightly above the US average of 11 per cent. Domestic mining companies also see the benefits of consolidation. If authorities approve the merger of US mining groups Amax and Cyprus Minerals, the combined company will become the second largest coal producer in the US. Coal mining in the US has suffered for a decade from the after-shocks of the 1970s coal boom, when energy companies rushed to pay top-dollar for coal mines, and then invested heavily to expand production and employment. The glory days lasted through the 1970s energy crisis but faded in the early 1980s. As boom-year profits evaporated, however, competitive pressures forced remarkable increases in productivity. US coal production rose 52 per cent between 1979 and 1992, while the mining workforce was nearly halved. At the same time, the production surge toppled prices. Mr Ralph Barbaro, partner in Virginia-based Energy Ventures Analysis, estimates that US coal prices on average are half of what they were 15 years ago. Shrinking margins and low returns on capital prompted at least eight bankruptcy-related coal mine sales since 1990. New buyers are squeezing resources, including labour, to make their acquisitions more profitable. Both Peabody and Consol are currently locked in a struggle with the United Mine Workers union. The companies are seeking to gain more flexible working practices in a new national contract with the union, and job security issues are at stake as well. The strike, which began on May 10, is costing Peabody about Dollars 1m a day. The companies that have snapped up the coal mine bargains have done so with an eye to acquiring reserves that are in compliance with the new US clean air standards. Recent purchases of US coal properties reflect the impact of the clean air legislation. Most have focused on the low sulphur coal regions of central Appalachia in the eastern US and the west's Powder River Basin. Mr McMahon says the trend reflects regional concentrations that are often obscured by national statistics. 'Twenty-three companies (with assets above Dollars 10m) now control 66 per cent of the US coal market, compared with 40 per cent in 1981,' he says. 'However, regionally, one large company, like Consol in northern Appalachia and Kennecott (an RTZ subsidiary) in the Powder River Basin, may have 40 per cent of the market.'</p>

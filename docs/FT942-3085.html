			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Observer: Girolami and his rival The retirement of Glaxo's chairman, Sir Paul Girolami, at the ripe age of 68 rounds off one of the most remarkable careers in British business this century. It also shows an interesting sense of occasion. Under Sir Paul, the mandatory retirement age for other Glaxo directors was reduced from 65 to 60. He himself, he always made clear, would go in his own good time. He also made clear that his chief goal was to overtake Merck of the US, headed by Roy Vagelos, as the world's biggest drug company. Although he has done a remarkable job in closing the gap, he has failed in his object. Vagelos, meanwhile, has said he will retire in November. Girolami, no doubt by coincidence, is to go in the same month. Given the intense competition between the two companies and the two men, it is worth asking who won in the long run. On one view, the answer has to be Girolami. Back in 1978, when he was Glaxo's finance director, the company had no sales in the US. It is now America's second biggest drug company after Merck, with sales of Pounds 2bn. This was chiefly due to Girolami's promotion of the ulcer drug Zantac. According to company lore, Glaxo originally planned to license Zantac in the US to Merck, before Girolami blocked the idea. Similarly, since Girolami took over in 1981, Glaxo's sales and profits have doubled at twice the rate of Merck's. Merck's market value has risen eight-fold, Glaxo's 44-fold. But on any of these criteria Merck - one of the most admired companies in America - is still clearly ahead. Vagelos is ahead in another sense. Last year Merck shook its competitors rigid with the Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco, a leading US drug distributor. In an industry obsessed by shrinking healthcare spending, this looks increasingly like a strategic masterstroke. Glaxo, like most of its rivals, is still struggling to respond. Girolami, in other words, looked until lately to be ahead on points; but he leaves his company at a point of maximum uncertainty, with his arch-rival stealing victory at the final bell.</p>

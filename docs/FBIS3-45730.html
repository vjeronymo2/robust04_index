			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Rising Status of Chinese Capital on Hong Kong </F> Stock Market"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION)--  Chinese capital is expanding on the Hong Kong stock market.  Statistics show that by the end of November 1993, the total  market capitalization of Chinese capital had reached HK$156  billion [Hong Kong dollars], about 6.02 percent of the total  market capitalization of HK$2,300 billion. [all figures as  published] With more and more mainland state-owned enterprises  listing on the Hong Kong market and the continuous expansion of  Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded listed companies, the total  market value of Chinese- funded companies is estimated to  account for 10 to 15 percent of the Hong Kong stock market's  total value this year. The situation is heartening.    Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded companies with a solid power  base in the early 1980's were mainly the China Resources Group,  China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation Company, China Travel  Service, and the Bank of China Group. In the mid-1980's, the  Yuehai Group and Huamin Group, under the direct authority of the  Guangdong and Fujian provincial governments, started trading in  property, finance, and tourism in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, CITIC  [China International Trust and Investment Company] and Beijing's  Everbright Group were also building up business in Hong Kong.  After years of development in Hong Kong, from the latter half  of 1992 onward, these big corporations began floating their Hong  Kong-based subsidiaries to raise more funds for business  expansion and to enlarge their scale of operation. CITIC  Pacific was prominent among these companies, becoming a  composite share of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index in August 1992.    Authoritative figures in Hong Kong economic circles hold  that  given the strong force behind Chinese-funded stocks, the growth  potential for these stocks is enormous and their development  prospects are considerable.</p>

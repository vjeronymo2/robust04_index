At this moment the clashes  are continuing in the vicinity of the university. Muriel  Pomponne:    [Pomponne] Yes, at the moment students and the police are  facing one another outside the university. The riot police have  just received the back-up of gendarmerie reinforcements in order  to contain the demonstrators who have erected barricades with  burning tires. The clashes began at about 1630 hours, when  angry students burned two vehicles of the U.S. Embassy. The  police went into action using tear gas grenades to disperse the  demonstration, which was not authorized, and this is when the  skirmishes began. Thus, at present they are restricted to the  area of the university. During the afternoon the university's  4,000 or so students had attempted to reach the Ministry of  Education to demand the payment of nine months' grant arrears.  This morning school pupils had organized a sit-in outside the  same ministry in support of the same demands. The authorities  say that they are prepared to open negotiations and that they  are ready to offer payment of six months' arrears during the  next few days, in accordance with a calendar that is to be  negotiated, but adding: we have a cash-flow problem with paying  nine months' grant arrears immediately.</p>

Several statutory changes have been made affecting the 8(a) program that have not previously been incorporated in SBA's regulations. This final rule is needed to remove the inconsistencies that currently exist in SBA's regulations due to these statutory provisions, as well as a procedural inconsistency that currently exists between SBA's regulations and the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> April 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Judith A. Roussel, Office of Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, (202) 205&hyph;6410. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On August 21, 1989, SBA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 54 FR 34692, amending its regulations with respect to the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;636(j)(10) and 637(a). That rule finalized SBA's implementation of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;656, 102 Stat. 3853. SBA published technical amendments to this rule on August 27, 1990, 55 FR 34901. Several statutory changes have been made affecting the 8(a) program since these regulatory revisions and need to be incorporated into SBA's regulations. This final rule is needed to remove the inconsistencies that currently exist in SBA's regulations due to these statutory provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 203 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2818, statutorily amended SBA's requirement that an applicant concern be in business for two years in order for it to be eligible for Program Participation. That law authorizes SBA to establish a minimum time in business requirement only if a possible waiver of that requirement is also provided. SBA's regulation concerning the two-year in business requirement, contained in 13 CFR 124.107, needs to be amended to identify the criteria for a waiver to the two-year in business rule. Confusion among 8(a) applicants has arisen because this regulation has not yet been amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 101&hyph;574 also made three statutory changes, relating to participation in the 8(a) program by tribally-owned concerns, that need to be implemented in the regulations. The first of these changes overrides SBA's previous regulation concerning affiliation of tribally-owned concerns for size purposes. Section 204 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2819, amended section 7(j)(10)(J)(ii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)(J)(ii), to specify that, for purposes of the 8(a) program, the size of a tribally-owned concern generally shall be determined without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe. SBA's previous regulation permitted affiliation to be found with other tribally-owned entities based on one or more relationships other than common tribal ownership. This final rule incorporates the statutory language into SBA's regulations. The other two statutory changes pertain to 8(a) joint ventures between tribally-owned concerns and large businesses. Section 205 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2819&hyph;20, increased the number of 8(a) joint ventures authorized between tribally-owned concerns and large businesses from two to five and extended, through September 30, 1994, the authorization for tribally-owned 8(a) concerns to enter joint ventures with large businesses. This final rule incorporates these changes into the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, Section 206 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2820, extended SBA's surety bond waiver authority in section 7(j)(13)(D)(iii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(13)(D)(iii), from October 1, 1992, to October 1, 1994. This final rule adds that statutory revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Lilas Island, a bulk carrier chartered by  the Cubans and flying the Panamanian flag, left the Ukrainian  port near Odessa carrying 100 tonnes of powdered milk, 210  tonnes of canned meat, 50 tonnes of medicines, and other goods  bound for Cuba. This consignment of humanitarian aid has been  put together by several governmental and public organizations in  Ukraine, notably the young people's fund "Children of  Chernobyl." This is not the first such humanitarian action by  Ukraine toward Cuba as a mark of gratitude for its participation  in the treatment and recuperation of children affected by the  Chernobyl accident.</p>

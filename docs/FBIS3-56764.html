			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from press center of the Foreign Ministry of the </F> Republic of Latvia]    [Text] According to reports in the Russian media, at a  discussion meeting of Russian foreign ministry organizations,  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made a speech of a conceptual  nature touching on relations with the Baltic countries. The  report expresses ideas that are contrary to Russia's previous  official position, and which are to be regarded as threats to  Latvia's sovereignty. The Baltic states, including Latvia, are  named as a region in which Russia's most important interests are  concentrated, and from which the greatest danger to Russia's  interests comes. Thus it is important that Russia should not  leave, and should not withdraw its troops from these regions.    The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Latvia is analyzing  the new situation. Latvia will also propose discussing this  issue at tomorrow's meeting of the three Baltic prime ministers  in Jurmala.</p>

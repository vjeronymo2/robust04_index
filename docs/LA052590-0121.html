			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRAUD CASE MAY HINGE ON MUFFLED AUDIOTAPES;  </P> <P> COMMODITIES: PROSECUTORS SAY RECORDINGS ARE PROOF OF ILLEGAL TRADING, BUT THE  DIN ON THE FLOOR MAKES IT HARD TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID.  </P> <P> Now that everyone has to wait at least until next fall to find out who killed  Laura Palmer on "Twin Peaks," here's a real-life mystery to ponder: What's on  those tapes they are playing in the first big trial in Chicago's  highly-publicized commodities fraud case?  </P> <P> The 130 audiotapes, recorded in 1988 by undercover FBI agent Randall Jannett  while he was posing as a crooked trader in the Swiss franc pit of the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, are at the heart of the government's fraud case against  three Swiss franc currency traders and brokers, the first group of traders to  be brought to trial in the federal government's wide-ranging probe of fraud and  corruption on Chicago's two big commodities exchanges, the Mercantile Exchange  and the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Jannett, the prosecution's star witness against currency broker Robert Mosky  and traders Danny Scheck and David Zatz, has testified at length during the  first two weeks of the trial that the secret recordings he made show Mosky,  Scheck, Zatz and others in the pit conspiring to bilk their distant customers  by skimming profits off of trades.  </P> <P> In highly complex and detailed testimony, Jannett, an agent with an accounting  background who worked undercover in the Swiss franc pit for 10 months in 1988,  has attempted to catalogue instances in which Mosky and his allies made quiet  deals in private conversations while they stood in the middle of the trading  pit, conversations which they hoped would be masked by the chaotic noise from  the hectic trading activity going on around them.  </P> <P> They were right; their conversations were masked, even from Jannett's tape  recorder. In fact, it has become increasingly clear as the trial has progressed  and the government has played the first of Jannett's nearly inaudible tapes,  that the content of those recorded conversations will be the central issue in  the case.  </P> <P> On each tape played so far, it has been almost impossible for the untrained ear  to pick out what Mosky and his allies are saying underneath the roar of the  trading activity. So far, the only way for the jury to understand the tapes has  been to read along on transcripts of the conversations while they listen.  </P> <P> Now, attorneys for Mosky and the others say, they plan to center their defense  on the assertion that Jannett misunderstood what the traders were saying among  themselves in the special shorthand of the commodities markets. When the  defense opens its cross-examination of Jannett, which will probably come next  week, it will argue that the traders were talking quietly among themselves  merely to double-check earlier trades made through the exchange's normal open  outcry system. Rather than cutting secret deals, they were simply catching up  with earlier work in the frenzied, and still non-computerized, trading pit.  "They were just checking, checking each other's work," said Harvey Silets, an  attorney for Scheck.  </P> <P> Silets opened his counter-attack on Jannett's testimony this week, when he  submitted a transcript of one of Jannett's tapes that conflicted significantly  with the government's version. U.S. District Judge Ann Williams allowed the  jury to listen to the taped conversation twice, once while reading along with  the government's transcript, and a second time with the defense version.  </P> <P> Silets provided a far more detailed transcript, one which identified more  voices in the background, and which provided much greater context for the  conversations. In one key tape from March 17, 1988, Silets' version is six  pages long, compared to just two for the government's transcript. The defense  version also attributes some critical comments to different people than in the  government version.  </P> <P> At one point, the government transcript shows Mosky forcing another trader to  accept a non-competitive, secret deal; the understanding being that the  opposite trader will make up his losses on another secret deal later. But in  the defense version, the conversation shows a deal that is much less one-sided,  with both traders appearing to amicably agree on the terms of their trade.  </P> <P> With the tapes virtually impossible to understand without a transcript, the  defense may score important points if it can persuade the jury that appearances  can be deceiving.  </P> <P> A TALE OF TWO TRANSCRIPTS  </P> <P> Below are partial transcripts of a tape recording from trading activity in the  Swiss franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on March 17, 1988.  </P> <P> The beginning of the conversation shows what the government contends is a  secret, non-competitive trade, with Robert Mosky dictating unfavorable terms to  Mark Fuhrman (nicknamed "Furball").  </P> <P> But the defense version has Fuhrman responding directly to Mosky ("A hundred  away") and seeming to cooperate in a more mutually beneficial deal.  </P> <P> Government's Version:  </P> <P> Robert Mosky: Hey, take this sh . . . hey Furball, take this. It's a hundred  away. I sold you two at sixty.  </P> <P> Danny Scheck: Right now?  </P> <P> (75 offer)  </P> <P> (Trading Activity)  </P> <P> Mosky: I'll sell you thirteen lots.  </P> <P> Unknown Person: What?  </P> <P> Scheck: Where?  </P> <P> Mark Fuhrman: Eighty offer. I just wanted to let you know where it was.  </P> <P> Mosky: At a half.  </P> <P> Fuhrman: Filled in the gap.  </P> <P> Scheck: The gap. That's a trend line.  </P> <P> Defense Version of Same Conversation:  </P> <P> Robert Mosky: Take this sh . . . Hey furball, take this.  </P> <P> Mark Fuhrman: A hundred away.  </P> <P> Unknown: 10 at 80  </P> <P> Unknown: 20 at 80.  </P> <P> Mike Ansani: Hey, the low was a half.  </P> <P> Mosky: I sold you 2 at 60.  </P> <P> Danny Scheck: Right now?  </P> <P> Ansani: The low was a half.  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 75.  </P> <P> Unknown: The low is 48.  </P> <P> Ansani: No, I was a 51 on 50.  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 75, 2 at 75.  </P> <P> Ansani: I was a one bid.  </P> <P> Gary Kost: Make the half the low.  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 75.  </P> <P> Ansani: I was a one bid.  </P> <P> Kost: Half bid.  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 70.  </P> <P> Larry Wright: 10 at 70.  </P> <P> Unknown: 60 on 10.  </P> <P> (Noise)  </P> <P> Unknown: 75 on 10.  </P> <P> Mark Spector: 75  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 80.  </P> <P> Mosky: I sold you 13 cars.  </P> <P> Spector: What?  </P> <P> Scheck: Where?  </P> <P> Unknown: A hundred at 80.  </P> <P> Fuhrman: 80 offer.  </P> <P> Unknown: 2 at 80.  </P> <P> Unknown: A hundred at 80.  </P> <P> Mosky: At a half.  </P> <P> Fuhrman: Filled in the gap.  </P> <P> Scheck: The gap. That's a trend line right there.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No 'aircraft claim' immunity KUWAIT AIRWAYS CORPORATION v IRAQI AIRWAYS AND ANOTHER Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): April 16 1992 AN OVERSEAS state-owned company, properly served at its UK address with proceedings for delivery up of civilian aircraft removed from a foreign airport in a military attack, is not immune from the jurisdiction of English courts if the aircraft, though removed on government instructions, were to be put to commercial use. Mr Justice Evans so held when refusing an application by the first defendant, Iraqi Airways Co, to set aside judgment obtained against it by Kuwait Airways Corporation for delivery up of commercial aircraft and damages. A judgment against the second defendant, the Republic of Iraq, was set aside on the ground of invalid service of the writ. HIS LORDSHIP said that Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990. Kuwait airport was occupied by Iraqi military forces. At the airport were 15 aircraft owned by Kuwait Airways. Five were removed by the Iraqi air force. The remaining 10 were civilian airliners. They were flown to Iraq on August 6-8. There they remained in the custody of Iraqi Airways. When military attack on Iraq became imminent in January 1991, six of the aircraft were flown to Iran and interned. The remaining four were destroyed by raids on Iraq. The present action was begun by writ issued on January 11 1991. Kuwait Airways claimed delivery up of the aircraft and damages for unlawful interference. Judgment was entered in default of appearance against Iraqi Airways and the Republic of Iraq. Damages were assessed at Dollars 489.455m. Summonses were issued in which the defendants claimed extensions of time within which to give notice of intention to defend, and challenged the validity of service. Execution was stayed. Iraqi Airways claimed immunity under section 14 of the State Immunity Act 1978. It was common ground that Iraqi Airways was a 'separate entity' for the purposes of section 14(2), which provided that a separate entity was immune from jurisdiction if the proceedings related to exercise of sovereign authority and 'the circumstances are such that a state . . . would have been so immune'. The scheme of the Act was such that a state had general immunity, except as provided in Part 1 of the Act which included, by section 3, 'commercial transactions'. The government of Iraq had identified the 10 aircraft as required for civilian operation by Iraqi Airways. There was no evidence to justify a finding that the purpose was governmental rather than commercial. Iraqi Airways was not immune by reason of section 14(2). Kuwait Airways submitted that Iraqi Airways had lost its immunity by submitting to the court's jurisdiction under section 2 of the Act. Section 2(3) provided that a state was deemed to have submitted if it had taken any step in the proceedings. By subsection (4), that did not apply to 'any step taken for the purpose only of - (a) claiming immunity'. Kuwait Airways asserted that Iraqi Airways had taken steps beyond those taken for the purpose 'only' of claiming immunity, because it issued a summons and applied for stay of execution, and included in its present application grounds other than state immunity, ie objections to service, and forum non conveniens. The applications were in substance objections to exercise of jurisdiction, and were alt-ernative to the claim for state immunity. The section was not intended to make it compulsory that the immunity claim could not be heard at the same time as and in conjunction with other objections to jurisdiction. The next issue was whether Kuwait Airways's claim was justiciable in English courts. Iraq Airways relied on the principle in Buttes Gas (1982) AC that 'the courts will not adjudicate upon the transactions of foreign sovereign states'. The authorities showed that certain issues could not be adjudicated, because the process of investigation and judgment would take the court into areas which the law recognised as the proper and sole concern of the government and of foreign sovereign states. The submission necessarily failed in proceedings where the court had jurisdiction under the State Immunity Act because their subject-matter was a commercial transaction. There was no bar to jurisdiction over issues in respect of which Iraqi Airways was not entitled to state immunity. The United Nations had established a compensation commission to consider claims against Iraq for damage and loss caused by the invasion of Kuwait. Iraqi Airways submitted that by analogy with the forum non conveniens principle under-lying Spiliada (1987) 1 AC 460, the court should refuse jurisdiction in favour of the commission. The submission failed. There was no suggestion in the Security Council resolution that it excluded the jurisdiction of municipal courts. Iraqi Airways relied on Dallal (1986) 1 All ER 239, where Mr Justice Hobhouse held that the court should recognise the competence of an arbitration tribunal established by treaty and authorised by municipal law with regard to nationals. In the present case, there was no international forum equivalent to an arbitration panel; there was no relevant municipal law; and there was no exclusion of municipal law remedies. The objection to jurisdiction was rejected. Before August 2 1991, Iraqi Airways carried on business at premises in Regent Street, London. The manager was transferred to Baghdad in October 1990. When he left, Mr Dinha Isaac, an accountant employed at the office, was left in charge. The writ was served on Mr Isaac at the Regent Street premises on January 11 1991. Section 695 of the Companies Act 1985 provided for service of documents on an 'oversea company' at the registered address, by leaving them at 'any place of business established by the company in Great Britain'. By section 744, 'oversea company' meant '(a) a company incorporated elsewhere than in Great Britain'. By RSC Order 65 rule 3, personal service could be effected by service on the 'clerk, secretary, treasurer or other similar officer'. Iraqi Airways was established by Law No 108 of September 26 1988. Article (1) provided that it was a 'state-owned entity having a judicial personality and operated on profit and loss basis'. There was no doubt that Iraqi Airways was a 'company' incorporated by statute in Iraq. Mr Isaac was the 'acting manager' of its business at the Regent Street premises. Service was effective. Ex parte leave to serve concurrent writs on the Republic was granted on January 11 1992. Service was to be effected in accordance with section 12(1) of the State Immunity Act 1978 and RSC Order 11 Rule 7. Section 12(1) required that a writ should be served by being transmitted through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the defendant state. Service was effected when the writ was received at the Ministry. On January 12 1991, the FCO closed the British Embassy in Baghdad. Iraq broke off diplomatic relations as of February 6. The Iraqi Embassy in London continued functioning and on January 15 it was recognised as a diplomatic mission. The documents were served on the Embassy in London and were received by an accredited diplomat. Kuwait Airways contended that service took effect as service on the Republic. Service under section 12(1) was effected by transmission 'to' the Ministry and took effect when the document was received 'at' the Ministry. In no sense was a diplomatic mission in a foreign state the same as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the sending state. For Kuwait Airways: Anthony Clarke QC, Rosalyn Higgins QC and Joe Smouha (Clyde &amp; Co). For Iraqi Airways and the Republic: Richard Plender QC and Stephen Nathan (Landau and Scanlan).</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Amsterdam remembers Nono / Review of 'Prometeo' and other late works at the Holland Festival Luigi Nono died in Venice in May 1990. He belonged with Boulez and Stockhausen as one of the mainsprings of the post-war avant-garde, a composer whose music continued to pose new questions and to colonise fresh expressive territory right to the end of his life. In most of Western Europe his music is recognised and accorded the importance it deserves. In Britain it remains too little known and too rarely performed, regarded with unease because of its uncompromising rigour and unflinching political idealism; in particular only a handful of the wonderfully refined and elusive pieces from the last decade of Nono's life have been heard here. One of the mains strands of this year's Holland Festival, which runs its usual discursive course throughout June in Amsterdam, is a survey of those late works. Five concerts include one or more pieces, and they are clustered about three performances of what is the most extraordinary and refractory of all his output, the tragedia dell'ascolto after Aeschylus, Prometeo. Claudio Abbado conducted the first performance in the deconsecrated church of San Lorenzo in Venice in 1984; a revised version was performed at La Scala, Milan, a year later. If the percussion piece Con Luigi Dallapiccola of 1979 and the string quartet Fragmente-Stille of 1980 were the signals that the poster-bright, agit-prop rhetoric of Nono's music of the 1960s and '70s had been superseded, Prometeo emerged as the key to that late contemplative style. In retrospect it appears as the fixed point, the philosophical, musical and textual centre, around which all the other pieces revolved. The idea of a new kind of dramatic synthesis was conceived in the wake of the Frankfurt staging of his second music-theatre work Al gran sole carico d'amore in 1978; Nono settled upon Aeschylus' tragedy as his starting point and enlisted the philosopher Massimo Cacciari to prepare the text. What Cacciari produced was dense and many-layered: it incorporated material from Aeschylus alongside other classical Greek poets, the cosmogony of Hesiod, extracts from Nieztsche and Holderlin, Walter Benjamin and Cacciari himself. In place of a linear narrative there is a series of independent sections, which Cacciari likened to a group of islands in an archipelago. These 'islands' are interspersed in the revised version with other elements borrowed from the forms of Greek drama, and prefaced with a substantial prologue. Nono's musical response was similarly intricate. Prometeo is scored for five solo vocalists, two narrators, mixed chorus, a collection of solo instrumentalists and four instrumental groups; computers transform the sounds and pan them around the auditorium. The Venice premiere took place within an ark-like construction of platforms designed by the Italian architect Enzo Piano; the audience sat in the nave of the church, with the performers arrayed around and above them. The Amsterdam performances took place in the magnificent space of the Goederenbeurs in the Beurs van Berlage, home of the Netherlands Philharmonic; the solo instrumentalists were grouped around the upper galleries, while the ensembles at the points of the compass were also above the audience. There is nothing conventionally dramatic about Prometeo, no dramatis personae, no scenic directions. It is, as the subtitle suggests, a 'tragedy to be heard'; not an oratorio nor a piece of music theatre, but something of both, a musical ritual of strange power and enchantment. It is not, though, an easy or ingratiating experience. Prometeo is long, an unbroken two-and-a-half-hour span, a musical journey with only the most generalised of maps. Much of it is hermetic and bare, with slowly changing choral and orchestral lines and sudden eruptions of colour or subdued moments of drama  -an intricate instrumental solo or duet here, sensuously intertwined vocal lines there, passages of limpid narration which break through the misty outlines of the text settings. A portion of the near capacity audience failed to stay the course, but the vast majority that remained responded with great enthusiasm to the performance, which was co-ordinated by Andre Richard, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher and Peter Rundel, with the Netherlands Chamber Choir and Radio Chamber Orchestra and a distinguished roster of soloists. The total effect of Prometeo is certainly vastly impressive, much more than the sum of its individual parts; every element in its arcane scheme seems perfectly placed. It is never going to be a regular concert work, but will continue to give perspective to the last phase of Nono's career. The evening before the opening of Prometeo the Nieuw Ensemble was directed by Andre Richard in three of Nono's late pieces; barely 50 minutes of music altogether, yet fiercely concentrated pieces in wonderfully committed, intense performances that drew the listener with absolute certainty into their magical sound world. Guai ai gelidi mostri (1983) offers another textual collage by Cacciari in a setting for two contraltos, six instruments and live electronics; Post-Prae-Ludium no. 1 'Donau' (1987) places a solo tuba among computer reflections and transformations of itself, a delicate study of tiny gestures. Omaggio a Gyorgy Kurtag (1986) is again based on a text devised by Cacciari, a conflation that includes Melville and Ingeborg Bachmann. Nono's own programme note makes reference to Schubert's Winterreise, an allusion that could be applied to almost all the music here. The suppressed expressive world, the intimate relationship between sounds and texts, conjure Schubertian comparisons; it is 'late' music of the most rarefied and special kind.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila did not deny  the existence of a small terrorist group in the country. He  also announced the arrest of four alleged rebels accused of  carrying out the attacks at the Lima Mayor's Office and the Air  Force installations.    [Begin recording] [Briones] No, we cannot discount the  possibility of another small group and -- I repeat -- a small  group. We do recommend that they take the appropriate measures,  because the terrorism law is very strict. I would not like  anyone to claim later that we acted too drastically with them.  At this time I think we should say -- and I would like to end  with this -- that we will continue our counterterrorism  operations. We want to finish this once and for all, arrest all  those involved in the recent terrorist actions, and punish them  with the full force of the law. We will keep working until we  attain complete peace in the country.    [Unidentified reporter] Are any suspects under arrest?    [Briones] At this time we are still investigating. There  have been a few arrests.    [Reporter] How many?    [Briones] We now have about four people in custody. They are  important people within their organizations. We continue to  investigate, and we expect to see some results soon.    [Reporter] Are these people members of Shining Path or the  Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement?    [Briones] The people we have arrested are members of Shining  Path. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Shuyi (2621 2885 5030) from the Heilongjiang </F> Provincial Financial Department: "The Basic Principles and  Contents of the Tax Distribution System"]    [Text] Our province reforms the financial management system  by carrying out the system of distribution of taxes between the  province and cities and counties basically in line with the  principles as follows: First, we should persist in the  principle of giving consideration to the interests of both the  province and cities and counties. The province should not only  ensure the reasonable increase in the province's revenues to  enhance the provincial government's ability in macroeconomic  regulation and control, but also take into consideration the  interests of cities and counties to mobilize their enthusiasm  for developing the economy, increasing revenues, and reducing  expenditures. According to the provincial party committee's  guiding ideology that to make the province rich, we must first  make the grass roots rich, we must ensure that three aspects  must not be changed when the new tax distribution system is  carried out. That is, the original pattern of distribution of  interests between the province and cities and counties must not  be changed; the basic frame of the tax distribution system,  defined by the central financial department, must not be  changed; and the ratio of revenues shared by the province and  cities and counties as defined by the central financial  department as well as the coefficient of the progressive  increase rate of the refund on tax revenues must not be  readjusted.    Second, we should persist in the principle of linking  unified  policies with management by various layers. The legislative  powers of central taxes, sharing taxes, and some important local  taxes as defined by the central financial department must be  concentrated in the central financial department so as to ensure  the unified implementation of government decrees and to  safeguard the coordination of markets throughout the country and  the equal competition between enterprises. Tax revenues should  be collected and managed by various layers. Central taxes and  sharing taxes should be collected on a responsibility basis by  the central tax affairs organization. Of the sharing taxes, the  portions obtained by the localities should directly be  distributed to the treasuries at various layers by the central  tax affairs organization. The local taxes should be collected  on a responsibility basis by the local tax affairs organizations  at various levels. The revenues that belong to the provincial  level should directly be transferred to the provincial treasury.    Third, we should persist in the principle of combining  overall design with step-by-step advance. On the basis of  defining reform targets, the central financial department should  define to set up the basic frame of the tax distribution system  through step-by-step reforms and to perfect the system in a  step-by-step manner in the course of implementation. The  methods for division of revenues, refund on tax revenues, and  transfer of payments should be standardized throughout the  country. So far, we should first divide major tax categories  and standardize, in a step-by-step manner, the division of other  revenues. In the course of transition from the old tax system  to the new one, items on subsidies, delivery to higher levels,  and some accounts as stipulated in the old tax system should  continue to be implemented.    The specific contents of this new tax system are as follows:  First, division of revenues -- Revenues should be divided  between the province and cities and counties according to the  power to manage affairs exercised by the province, cities, and  counties and in line with tax categories. The provincial  level's fixed revenues include the income taxes of  provincial-level enterprises (excluding the income taxes of  local and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary  enterprises), the profits handed over to higher levels by these  enterprises, the income taxes of the grain enterprises under the  special management of the province, the profits handed over to  higher levels by these enterprises, the regulatory taxes on the  orientation of the investment in fixed assets, the business  taxes paid by the banks at various levels and the insurance  departments, the taxes on natural resources, and some other  provincial-level revenues. The revenues paid by Daqing city  (excluding three counties) should temporarily be divided  according to the original methods.    The fixed revenues of the city- and county-level financial  departments (excluding that of Daqing city) include the income  taxes of local enterprises (excluding the income taxes of local  and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary enterprises),  the profits handed over to higher levels by local enterprises,  the income taxes of individuals, and the taxes on utilization of  urban land. Taxes for city maintenance and construction  (excluding the portions concentratively paid by head offices of  banks, railway departments, and general insurance companies),  the taxes for real estate, the taxes for use of vehicles and  ships, stamp taxes, the taxes on slaughtering animals, the taxes  on agriculture and animal husbandry, the taxes on special  agricultural products, the taxes on occupation of cultivated  areas, the taxes for contracts, and the revenues from paid use  of state-owned land.    Revenues shared by the province with cities and counties  are as follows: The 25 percent of the value added tax paid by  petroleum, power, petrochemical, and nonferrous metal  departments to be retained by the local authorities belongs to  the provincial-level revenue. The 25 percent of the value added  tax paid by enterprises to be retained by local authorities is  shared by the province with cities and counties 50 to 50  percent, the same ratio as they shared the former indirect tax.  Business tax (excluding the business tax paid by the head  offices of banks, railway departments, and head offices of  insurance companies), inheritance tax, bequest tax, land value  added tax, and the agricultural tax resulting from increase of  grain price are shared by the province and cities (counties) 50  to 50 percent.    Second, division of the expenditure -- Based on the division  of power between the provincial government and city and county  government, the provincial finance department chiefly takes  charge of the expenses needed in the operation of  provincial-level state organs, the expenditures needed in  restructuring the economy, coordinating the development of  various localities, and exercising macro regulation and control,  and the expenditures on the development of the undertakings  directly managed by the province. City and county finance  departments take charge of the expenses needed in the operation  of local organs of political power and the expenses needed in  the development of the local economy and other undertakings.    Third, delimitation of the tax revenues returned by the  provincial finance department to cities and counties. To  maintain the vested interest of cities and counties and  gradually attain the goals of the reform, the amount of the tax  revenues to be returned by the province to cities and counties  is determined with 1993 as the base period. Based on the actual  1993 revenues of various localities, the tax reform conditions,  and the division of revenues among the central, provincial, and  city and county authorities, the net revenues turned over to the  central authorities and the province by various localities are  determined (namely consumption tax plus 75 percent of the value  added tax plus the part to be retained by the province of the  revenues shared by the province with cities and counties minus  the revenues refunded by the central authorities and the  province to cities and counties). The net revenues turned over  to higher authorities by various localities in 1993 are all  returned to the localities to ensure their vested financial  strength, and the amount will be taken as the base figure of the  tax revenues to be returned by the province to various  localities in the future. Beginning 1994, the tax revenues to be  returned will increase every year based on the 1993 base figure.  The increase rate is determined on the basis of the coefficient  of 1:0.3 of the average growth rate of the province's value  added tax and consumption tax. That is, when the average growth  rate of these two types of taxes rises by 1 percent, the tax  revenues to be returned to cities and counties should grow by  0.3 percent. After 1994, when the net revenues turned over to  the central authorities and the province are lower than the 1993  base figure, the tax revenues to be returned to cities and  counties will be reduced accordingly. The measures for the  central authorities to return tax revenues to the province  remain unchanged.    Fourth, the handling of the fixed-quota subsidies, the  revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to  systems, revenues to be turned over to higher authorities for  special purposes, and matters related to final accounts. In  line with the central guidelines of "keeping the distribution  pattern of the original system unchanged for some time after  implementation of the tax distribution system and gradually  standardizing the work after a transitional period," the  fixed-quota subsidies from the province to cities and counties  according to the original system will continue; and the  progressive decrease of the fixed-quota subsidies applied to  some cities and counties will remain unchanged. The various  revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to  the original system will continue; the progressive increase of  the revenues to be turned over to higher authorities applied to  some cities and counties will also continue, and this method  will be applied for the time being to the prefectures and cities  which retain a certain amount of the total. A progressive  increase rate will be determined based on the actual amount  turned over to higher authorities by these prefectures and  cities in 1993, and these prefectures and cities will hand  revenues over to higher authorities according to this  progressive increase rate every year.</p>

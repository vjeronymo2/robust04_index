			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Wine: Double act that buyers cannot afford to miss / A look at the real wine bargains that are available this summer GREAT VINTAGES can be assessed only with the benefit of some sort of historical perspective. But since so many of the best wines have traditionally been available only in infancy, clever wine buyers have had to take a foreshortened view of potential greatness. We should all be gazing in wonder at the magnificence of Europe's 1989 and 1990 vintages and working out just how many cases of this surely unrepeatable double-act we can afford. And to think how good we thought 1988 was before they came along . . . This is particularly true for the great sweet whites - of Bordeaux, Alsace, the Loire and Germany, and indeed of Germany's exciting drier wines too. The exceptional ripeness of 1989 and 1990 gave them unparalleled exuberance, particularly from the stars of the Rheinpfalz such as Lingenfelder and Muller-Catoir whose wines are marvels of heady concentration whether they be dry (Trocken) medium dry (Halbtrocken) or unreined; both producers' wines are sold by Oddbins whose greatest bargain has been Muller-Catoir's 1990 (and last) vintage of Muller-Thurgau (Pounds 4.99) which makes one revise all previous assumptions about this workaday grape variety. But even the wines at the very top of Muller-Catoir's glorious range, which should continue to develop well into the next century, cost less than Pounds 10. Which is more than can be said for the equally successful famous French reds of 1989 and 1990, the smartest burgundies and (less rare) classed-growth bordeaux. There are bargains in other regions however, and these vintages were just as successful in the Loire, the Rhone and the Midi. So difficult is it to go wrong with 1990 made in and around Hermitage that even Sainsbury's lowly Crozes-Hermitage (Pounds 3.99) from the area's co-operative is rich, plump and deserves to be decanted off its low-rent label. In the Loire, these two great vintages arrived just as a decent proportion of producers had got to grips with making serious sweet whites without recourse to overdoses of sugar and sulphur, and had mastered the vigour of their vines to coax maximum ripeness from their reds. We can, therefore, choose not only from some Vouvrays which can truly be called fabulous - for Huet, try Bibendum of London NW1 and The Wine Society of Stevenage, Herts - but also from reds with more lush fruit than I have ever tasted from the Loire. Britain's greatest range of Loire wines of all hues is on the list of the restaurant RSJ and its wholesale wine company around the corner, an enclave of Loiremania in London SE1 (071-633-0489) - but you do have to buy by the dozen. Charruau's stunning Saumur-Champigny, Les Folies 1989 is Pounds 82 a case and it is a miracle that the French allowed even a bottle of this wine for today, tomorrow and the next century, to escape across the Channel. The assumption that fine wine has to be bought in infancy is being called into question however by some of the bargains being offered around the trade at the moment. One of the more talked-about has fetched up on Oddbins' shelves, resulting in such delicious vintage ports as Dow 1985, selling there for Pounds 11.49 a bottle. This is rather less than it would have cost by the dozen in 1987 and less than half the notional market price - although quite what constitutes the port market at the moment is anyone's guess.</p>

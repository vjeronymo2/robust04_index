			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IFP spokesman Dr. Ziba Jiyane by Leslie </F> Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program in the Johannesburg studio --  live]    [Text] [Mashokwe] We are now being joined by Dr. Ziba  Jiyane of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Good evening to you,  Dr. Jiyane.    [Jiyane] Good evening to you, Leslie.    [Mashokwe] Many people are now happy with your  participation.  It almost presupposes that people were concerned about your  exclusion?    [Jiyane] Yes, many thoughtful South Africans were concerned.  But, indeed, God is able. We are now able to be in the election  and give our people a chance to make a choice.    [Mashokwe] What happened? Why all this sudden change of  heart?    [Jiyane] There are several reasons. Of course you know about  the very special gentleman from Kenya who came here, who is a  man of God, and who was able to relate to the chief minister and  president of the IFP, and the president of the African National  Congress, and you know we were just there on the brink, and we  saw the abyss, and fortunately the last minute we all shrunk  back. So many corpses would have gone by, people would have  died, but we are Christians, and nobody would ever benefit from  that, and I'm glad we shrunk back from the abyss.    [Mashokwe] What did he say to you that was so special. I  mean, we talk here of a tough proposal that he presented to  Inkatha and the ANC in Durban on Sunday. What was contained in  it?    [Jiyane] Well, the draft proposal I've shown you at the  beginning here, it contains a possibility of Parliament coming  together to make an amendment that satisfies what his majesty,  the king of the Zulus, has asked for -- that is, an entrenchment  and protection for the kingdom, plus which says something  definite about the constitutional issues that are outstanding,  that they will be resolved through mediation after the election.  But now, particularly the coming together of Parliament, and  putting this in the constitution of 1993, was a major point that  enabled us to say we could go in.    [Mashokwe] What is different that you were offered in  Johannesburg as opposed to what was being offered at Skukuza,  the Kruger National Park, a week or so ago?    [Jiyane] Well, at Skukuza obviously, for one thing, there  was  no agreement -- there wasn't. It merely actually frustrated the  whole thing. The other side, I wouldn't mention which one, was  reluctant to allow Parliament to come and make this on black and  white in the constitution. That possibility was not there at  Skukuza.    [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly what was so  special today, because seemingly the positions of say the ANC  and the government, vis-a-vis the proposal in Skukuza, has not  changed. It's only the entrenchment of the writing in of this  agreement about the king, that has changed the whole atmosphere?    [Jirs?] Yes, of course, but you remember, Leslie, that one  of  the fundamental problems of the whole process is lack of tr?st,  given the animosity and the killings. Now because of this lack  of trust, for example, we, the IFP, couldn't go in knowing that  there was no assurance that after elections there would in fact  be consideration to his majesty's call for the recognition of  the Zulu kingdom. I mean commitments on paper without any legal  commitment, something that would be justiciable in a court of  law for example, and something that the whole world would say,  if you renege on, you would be actually saying you're no longer  for the rule of law. Now its a matter of trust that does not  exist, that will be built over time. But at least this action  of going to call Parliament goes a long way to assure us that we  are not going to be taken for a ride.    [Mashokwe] Okay, we're talking about say something like  Article 54 here, because we've had now something like Article  53, which entrenches self-determination in a way. What is  different from that article?    [Jiyane] Well that principle, like all principles, is just a  general principle. We were talking of a specific case of the  Zulu kingdom with a lot of people in support of that view, and  history behind us, which we needed to be there in the  constitution, because if it was not there, there wasn't going to  be a way of living in South Africa with the understanding that  all the uniqueness of South Africa is taken into consideration.  The Zulu kingdom is a special case. Even the president of the  African National Congress has recognized this, but we knew  because of the depth of feeling among Zulus, particularly in  kwaZulu/Natal, that if that question was left unresolved after  the constitution, because of this general principle, because for  example there is no assurance that the issue of a volkstaat  [homeland] will be resolved just because there is that  principle. [sentence as heard] But on the question of the Zulu  kingdom, we couldn't take a risk in terms of not committing  people legally, you see, to the....[pauses] But of course we  know that the greatest guarantee is not the legal and what [as  heard]. It is the political muscle which we are going to show  electorally, and the fact that the Zulu kingdom and the Zulu  people will still be there after elections, and God forbid any  politician who would try to play tricks with that. Of course  they would be responsible.    [Mashokwe] Are you going to be able to persuade your  followers to accept that you've now changed your mind, you're  now into elections? Is it not too late?    [Jiyane] Well, our followers have been fighting for the  interests that the IFP has articulated, plus the fact that  because the IFP historically has the bulk of its membership in  Zulu, the fact that the Zulu king, his majesty, had to be  catered for. Now they have agreed. They will call Parliament.  Everybody will see on the screens that they are going there to  meet about the issue of his majesty, the Zulu king. Now anybody  who didn't know--I mean, it would only be people who didn't know  why we were out of elections. That was one of the important  issues, and the other one--that is, the constitutional  differences, will be addressed through mediation.    [Mashokwe] Are you going to accept the outcome of the  elections without any hesitation. Won't you say you came in  late, therefore you will not accept the outcome?    [Jiyane] Well, it's difficult for anybody to say they would  accept the outcome of the elections unless they are asked: Will  you accept the outcome of free and fair elections.    [Mashokwe] Will you call them free and fair?    [Jiyane] Well free and fair elections, yes.    [Mashokwe] No doubt?    [Jiyane] Why should there be doubt. But if they are not free  and fair, no politician can say they will accept such.    [Mashokwe] In your region, in kwaZulu/Natal, you have not  been electioneering; you have not being electioneering anywhere  else. Is that not putting you in a disadvantage. Won't you use  that as an excuse to say we fared badly because we were not  electioneering?    [Jiyane] Well, you yourself know it wouldn't be an excuse;  it's a fact. We know it now that we're at a huge disadvantage;  we haven't educated our people as much as other people on voter  education and we haven't had funds. I mean, we know all those  disadvantages, but to us what counted more than anything was  when we saw the (?possibility) of this abyss and the corpses  that would go with it, and we said no we would not be held  responsible, even if as a party we will suffer so many  disadvantages. If we've saved lives, to us that was more  important.    [Mashokwe] What about the fact that some cynics are saying  you are going to disappear into oblivion come the 27th of April  anyway?    [Jiyane] That's laughable. The Zulu nation would never  disappear?    [Mashokwe] No, no, the politicians in kwaZulu at Ulundi. We  have a new order coming into place, and you would disappear?    [Jiyane] Yes, those are people who think we are there  because  of kwaZulu government, as we always say the Zulu nation is  there, irrespective of the Bantustan structure. In fact, we  went there knowing it was an apartheid structure, but which we  wanted to use to avert, to divert, the course of other Bantustan  leaders who wanted to take independence. That's why we grafted  in a legitimate Zulu kingdom structure there, and now if that  goes, that doesn't mean that the people who deliberately with  wide open eyes went into it to use it, and we've used it  successfully to stop the apartheid system of separate  development and negotiations, and the (?tricameral) constitution  without Mandela, and so on and so forth. Now if that goes, that  does not mean that the people of that area will go. They will be  there, and they have a king.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, talk to me about this Zulu kingdom.  If it comes into being, does that assure Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi of a position as premier or adviser to the king, as he  is now?    [Jiyane] Well, that's the wrong way to ask the question,  because this is a problem even with the king. The problem is  not ?positions and assurances; the problem is the kingdom of  kwaZulu, a historical reality. Now Chief Buthelezi, our leader,  is the president of the IFP; he is a politician, a hardbitten  politician, and that's why he is going through an election,  which you know, ironically, Leslie, people have said we are  afraid, we are afraid of elections, but very few politicians  would have been as brave as Dr. Buthelezi, to go into an  election with so few days. I mean such a short time, They will  be scared, but he's not scared because the support is there. So  he depends on that, he has the support and he's not scared of  elections. Few politicians would take that as he has done.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Jiyane, thanks for your time and for talking  to us.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tenghiz Pachkoria] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi January 28 TASS -- The Liberation of  Abkhazia Organization (LAO), which is well-known for its radical  statements and judgements about the questions of the return of  refugees to abkhazia and restoration of georgia's jurisdiction  over this autonomous republic, has been functioning in Tbilisi  since the past four months. It comprises 16 georgian public  movements and organizations which were forced to leave the  conflict zone at the end of September 1993 and are at present  located in tbilisi.    The radicalism of this organization's leadership was clearly  manifested during today's meeting of the LAO leadership with  representatives of the parliamentary majority. On behalf of the  alo its chairman Boris Kakubayev has called on Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze and parliament to arrangee a meeting of LAO  representatives with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his  forthcoming official visit to Tbilisi on February 3-4.    "If we are denied such ameeting, then we will be compelled  to  start a hunger strike in the near future at different places in  Tbilisi, demanding to arrange our meeting with the president of  Russia to expound our vision of the Abkhazia problem," Boris  Kaubayev said. Georgian parliamentarys vice-speaker Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili noted that President Yeltsin's programme of  meetings in Tbilisi is not planned by the Georgian parliament,  but by the president of russia himself and his team.    Boris Kakubayev's demand has evoked a contradictory reaction  of those present who continued debating problems of Abkhazia and  after LAO representatives and Boris Kakubayev himself left the  conference hall. They explained it by the fact that the  majority of deputies, comprising this parliamentary majority,  had not come to the meeting. Kakubayev considered it as an  indifference and lack of consideration to problems of Abkhazia.</p>

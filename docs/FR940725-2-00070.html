In making award decisions, CSAT will give special consideration to applications that demonstrate the potential for knowledge dissemination, interface with health promotion concepts and practices, promote appropriate resource utilization and/or consensus building, and yield a product (report or document) of specific relevance to furthering of the CSAT mission of improved delivery of addiction treatment and recovery services at the State or community level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this grant program, a Conference is a symposium, workshop, or any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days where persons assemble to exchange information and address information or strategy development needs in such areas as sharing new technologies, problem-solving, network-building or public policy deliberations. While a conference may result in educational experiences, this is not a program to impart training. The conference program should be consistent with the CSAT mission. Under the authority of Section 507, CSAT may sponsor regional workshops on improving the quality and availability of treatment services; however, sponsors of regional workshops may invite people from other regions in the country. The conference may be conducted at more than one site, provided that each separate workshop, meeting, etc., relates directly to the central conference topic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conferences supported by this program are not intended to carry out research or to synthesize or disseminate research information for the non-clinical scientific research community. However, transmitting scientific information via the conference to those involved in AOD related services or in training to provide AOD services is supportable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program addresses the HHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people served, preventing future problems, and improving services to customers through modern management approaches. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications may be submitted by public and non-profit private entities.

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES UP 2.2% OVER '89; PRICES 0.7% LOWER  </P> <P> Spurred by declining new home prices as builders begin bringing lower-priced  models to market, home sales in Orange County last month climbed 2.2% from a  year earlier, a regional real estate data service reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> Total sales of 4,266 new and used homes and condominiums were up from 4,173 a  year earlier and represented the fifth-highest level in the past 18 months.  </P> <P> June sales were virtually unchanged from May's 4,261 units, but industry  analysts say even a small increase is a good sign because May is a  traditionally strong month for home sales.  </P> <P> And in what may be the best news in months for new home shoppers, the June  median price for a new home in the county was down 11.7% from May -- to the  rest of $251,703 from $285,156. Compared to a year earlier, June's new home  median also was 0.7% lower than the $253,433 figure for June, 1989.  </P> <P> The resale market, which typically accounts for 75% or more of all sales in the  county, remained sluggish with June's total sales of 3,539 units reflecting a  nearly 1% drop from 3,573 sales in May.  </P> <P> June's resales were up 6% from 3,337 units in June, 1989, however.  </P> <P> The median resale price of $249,917 was up 0.6% from $248,336 in May and was 1%  higher than the $247,357 posted for June, 1989, TRW reported.  </P> <P> TRW's monthly housing summaries combine single family and attached homes in the  new and resale categories.  </P> <P> The combined median sales price for new and resale homes in the county last  month was $250,331, up a scant 0.7% from $248,638 in June, 1989, and down 2.2%  from May's $256,043.  </P> <P> SLOWDOWN: Home resales throughout California fell again in June.

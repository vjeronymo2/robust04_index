			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Mar 30 SAPA -- South Africa would seek  an international credit rating as the first step in re-entering  global capital markets, African National Congress economist  Maria Ramos said Wednesday [30 March].    She told an ANC meeting with business leaders in  Johannesburg  a new government was keen to tap international markets following  the country's absence for most of the last ten years, bar a  400-million German marks issue in September 1991.    Ms Ramos said a return to these markets would assist the  country in improving the maturity structure and reducing the  cost of the debt portfolio.    South Africa has been inhibited from approaching world  capital markets for funds due to previous apartheid governments  and, since 1991, the high perceived risks of the country's  political transition and domestic violence.    The Transitional Executive Council's finance sub-council is  preparing a strategy for the country's return, likely after the  April polls which are expected to be won by the ANC.    Ms Ramos said domestic markets would continue to be  important  and the ANC wanted to improve the operation and capacity of the  capital market.    A new government's responsibility would be to ensure  economic  policy certainty and credibility to achieve efficient borrowings.    Ms Ramos said an independent central bank and autonomous  auditor- general's office would help to nurture a sound and  stable financial system.    ANC money and finance analyst Neil Morrison assured the 500-  strong gathering of business people the Reserve Bank would not  be hindered in its key task of protecting the value of the  currency. The independence of the bank was critical to the  establishment of financial credibility as well as having a  sobering influence on fiscal policy, he said.</p>

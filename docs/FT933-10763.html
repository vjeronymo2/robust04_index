			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Qantas chief to resign MR John Ward, chief executive of Qantas Airways, is to resign this month, ending speculation about his role at the Australian carrier after the arrival of British Airways as a major shareholder, Reuter reports from Sydney. Mr Ward, chief executive since 1989, said he had decided to resign for a 'whole host of reasons', but denied the decision had anything to do with British Airways. Speculation about Mr Ward's future emerged after it was revealed he had not backed the idea of a foreign carrier taking a big stake in Qantas. His position will be filled in the short term by chairman Mr Gary Pemberton.</p>

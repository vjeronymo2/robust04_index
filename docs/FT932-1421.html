			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Semi-Tech to sell 51% Singer interest SEMI-TECH (Global) is to sell its 51 per cent interest in Singer Company to International Semi-Tech Microelectronics (ISTM) for HKDollars 6.63bn (USDollars 850m) cash. ISTM is Semi-Tech's controlling shareholder. It is a Toronto-quoted company controlled by Mr James Ting, who is also chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-listed Semi-Tech, and Singer, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Semi-Tech said it would use the proceeds of the sale to develop G M Pfaff of Germany, Europe's leading sewing machine manufacturer, in which it has a 51 per cent interest, and Sansui, a Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer. ISTM is paying USDollars 33.50 a share, compared with Singer's closing price in New York on Monday of Dollars 35 1/8 . Semi-Tech said the sale was not outside the group and that current business relationships between Singer, Sansui and Pfaff would not be affected by the deal. Mr Ting said yesterday that the sale of Singer represented a logical development for Semi-Tech which he described as 'in-house investment bank' to the group which invests in sound businesses requiring restructuring. 'We want to re-create another Singer in Sansui and Pfaff. In addition, we will attempt to refocus our near-term investment and acquisition strategy on the high-growth Asia-Pacific region, including China.' Last week in the US, Semi-Tech reached a HKDollars 730m out-of-court agreement with Bicoastal Corp, the former owner of Singer, for settlement of certain disputes between the two arising from Bicoastal's 1989 sale of Singer. The purchase by ISTM of Semi-Tech's interest in Singer will be funded by USDollars 300m of borrowings and the issue to Semi-Tech of 'A' shares in ISTM to the value of USDollars 55m. The issue of these shares will be underwritten by a group led by Dominion Securities.</p>

There are other problems to be dealt with. The  Clinton Administration's alleged weakness in foreign policy  matters; its demonstrative lack of interest in many events in  Europe, already became obvious when "foreign policy expert"  George Bush was voted out. This indicated that American  decision centers were shifting away from the traditional East  Coast establishment to the depths of the continent and the West  Coast.    Bill Clinton, the man from Arkansas, stands for a new  development in American society that is associated with terms  such as regionalism, group interests, discovery of ethnicity.  All this has led to a certain domestic view of politics that is  quite similar to trends that are becoming noticeable in Europe.    For many people this may come as a surprise, since they had  read that Clinton went to college in Europe and acquired  qualifications at Washington's Georgetown University that  predestined him for foreign policy. After his first year, there  is not much to be seen of this, apart from the fact that Russia  comes first in the White House as it is still considered a  superpower -- particularly because of its nuclear weapons.  Clinton urges that the problem of proliferation be solved. If  this attempt fails, the world faces new risks; but the United  States' geopolitical security, being a continent separated from  the crisis spots of the world by two oceans, will also be lost.    Clinton's foreign policy itinerary during his first 15  months  demonstrates the new American self-restraint in foreign policy  very clearly. As was common for American presidents before  1945, and also for American secretaries of state, he stayed in  his own country; he only went to Seattle to welcome the Pacific  states' heads of government, after having gone north to  neighboring Vancouver a few months earlier to meet with Boris  Yeltsin for the first time.    Then, early this year came his first trip to Europe, with  the  NATO summit in Brussels, visits to Prague, Moscow, and a few  successor states to the Soviet Union that possess nuclear  weapons. There was no time to meet the most important West  European heads of government in their capitals. He will make up  for this in the summer. When things got critical in Moscow  shortly after the NATO summit, Helmut Kohl jetted to Washington.  A few weeks earlier, Vice President Al Gore, coming from  Moscow, had visited the chancellor in Oggersheim.    This is not enough for the American-European consultation  process, whereas the European Union [EU] heads of government,  and particularly their foreign ministers, definitely meet too  often. In this most critical year in terms of foreign policy,  the Clinton Administration does not spend enough time on foreign  and security policy issues. At Clinton's insistence, the  defense secretary had to go after just under a year in office.  This had never happened since the Vietnam War. Clinton has not  been very lucky with the rest of his staff, either. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher is a Methusalah. But his bad luck  is partly due to the fact that the departments are understaffed.  There is a constant coming and going in the State Department's  Yugoslavia section. Meanwhile, the Clintons are stumbling  through the shallow morasses of the Whitewater affair.    But it is not the Americans alone who are to blame for the  poor foreign policy performance. Europeans are not exactly  representative of states that are capable of acting at crucial  times, either. But the Gulf War did not result in a new world  order. The failed pacification of Somalia was a setback for the  world's boldest expectations. China threatens to block the  Security Council because of North Korea; Russia might do the  same because of Serbia. Haiti was a tragedy for the United  States; and the same goes for the Europeans, who have nightmares  about the future of the Balkans.    Meanwhile, war, which seemed to be banned forever in 1945,  has returned to Europe. America and Europe are afraid to suffer  losses in conflicts that are not rated as vital interests by the  television societies that are today's democracies. American  fear of going it alone is forming an unholy alliance with  European restraint for real and hypocritical reasons. The  Germans, especially, take too much time clarifying their role.    Everyone still tends to have a transfigured view of things,  although world politics after 1989 has clouded over in an  unexpected way. The Western democracies prefer to celebrate in  Normandy and avert their eyes when parallels to the 1930's  become apparent. If the world had not accepted Hitler's  occupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Omaha Beach would not have  been necessary in 1944. But this statement is mainly directed  at our own address.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Savage shows 19% advance and expands in shelving SAVAGE GROUP, the USM-quoted hardware supplier, reported profits up 19 per cent in the six months to December 31. Turnover on continuing operations dipped 4.2 per cent to Pounds 32.3m. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.04m, up from Pounds 874,000 on continuing operations last time. Last year's result excluded losses of Pounds 198,000 on discontinued businesses. The outcome was struck after reduced interest payments of Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 746,000). Earnings per share were 0.7p, against losses of 0.3p; an interim dividend of 0.25p (nil) is declared. The group also announced the acquisition of Strongbeam, a supplier of fixed shelving, for Pounds 900,000. Strongbeam had turnover of Pounds 1.5m last year. A placing of 1.9m shares at 46p, equal to 5 per cent of the share capital, raised Pounds 864,000 net. Proceeds will be used to help pay for Strongbeam and to fund investment in shelving manufacture. Mr Tony Philipson, chief executive, said UK business remained 'very difficult, with no tangible signs of recovery', but all overseas businesses increased sales and made profits, after several years of losses.</p>

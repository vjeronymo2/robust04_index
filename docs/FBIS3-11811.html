			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to  confront a possible turbulence in the foreign exchange market,  which has been strengthened by the $6 billion of support from  the U.S. Treasury through the "reciprocal support agreements"  established between the two nations, Pedro Aspe Armella, finance  and public credit secretary, stated yesterday.    These lines of support were increased 500 percent after  President Bill Clinton issued instructions to U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to bolster President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari's monetary and economic policy.    The finance secretary explained that the transactions  revolving around Mexican foreign debt shares abroad experienced  quite a drop when stock market operations opened in New York and  London. This drop, however, was attenuated during the course of  the day, in what was interpreted as a sign of confidence in the  country's prompt stabilization. He said he felt conditions are  right for national financial market operations to resume today  after having been closed yesterday because of the decree  declaring a national day of mourning. The stock market, banks,  and money-exchange offices will observe regular hours today.    The Mexican official explained that the reciprocal support  agreements allow for granting lines of credit up to $1 billion,  but that Secretary Bentsen advised him that this had now been  increased to $6 billion.    Aspe Armella noted that this aid strengthens the country's  international foreign exchange reserves, which he regarded as  "sufficient." He said "real stability is obtained at home" and  noted that this year there will not be any fiscal deficit,  according to the directives issued by President Salinas de  Gortari aimed at ending his administration with an economy that  is "growing, with solid reserves, order, vision, and direction."    Analysts of Salomon Brothers, one of the five most important  brokerage firms of the world, anticipated that they will  recommend that U.S. and Mexican investors "not overturn the  Mexican market" on account of the assassination of Luis Donaldo  Colosio, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential  candidate.    They noted that in the coming days the Mexican Stock Market  will experience "hectic days" with a low tendency, which will  annul the progress achieved in the past two days.    The offices of Standard and Poor's and Duff and Pheps in  Mexico called an urgent meeting of their analysts to study the  country's current situation so they will be able to orient  investors' criteria in the coming days.  <H5>  Adequate Reserves To Avoid Speculation </H5>   After meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  yesterday, Miguel Mancero Aguayo, the general director of the  Bank of Mexico, and Roberto Hernandez, the president of the  Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] Accival [not further  identified] Group, said the level of foreign exchange at the  Central Bank is adequate and will avoid any speculation or  disproportionate increase in dollars in the country. Interviewed  at the official Los Pinos residence, both officials maintained  that the country has the necessary stability. This stability is  supported by its foreign exchange reserves and the certainty  created by the ratification of the Stability, Competitiveness  and Employment Pact (PECE).    Roberto Hernandez asserted that rumors about an over demand  for dollars are baseless and only seek to trigger speculation.  The country's reserves are sufficiently strong to allow it to  react to any factor that attempts to destabilize our economy.  There are no real conditions that can weaken our currency, he  said.    When he spoke, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, who will be the first  governor of the Bank of Mexico as of 1 April, said they are  preparing an evaluation on the country's level of reserves to  guarantee greater stability. In this way, he said, if there is  a disproportionate demand for dollars today, Friday, we will  have the necessary support to avoid abrupt movements that could  hinder the country's economic growth.    Furthermore, both officials stated that the Bill Clinton  administration had begun a program yesterday to support any  abrupt movement of foreign exchange in the country. Roberto  Hernandez stated: "At this time, I would make a call to maintain  our tranquility and objectivity with what is happening in the  country. The advances and achievements are there and are  supported by our economy. There is no reason to be concerned."    They noted that there is a financial backing of up to $6  billion that will allow banking operations in the entire country  to be carried out regularly today. Finally, Roberto Hernandez  noted that Mexico's entry into OECD is recognition of the  advances made by Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the area of  economic policy.</p>

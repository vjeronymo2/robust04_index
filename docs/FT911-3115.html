			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: A city with a silver lining - The Museum of Walloon Art, Liege Lovers of fine silver quiver at the mention of Liege, the lovely but much-ravaged city which bestrides the River Meuse. In the middle ages, along the length of the Meuse there were towns and monasteries famous for metal-working. The latest flowering of that tradition was the beautiful 17th- and 18th-century silverware of Liege, worthy to rank with the finest in Europe. This vanished craft has inspired an important exhibition at the Museum of Walloon Art in Liege (until June 2). Domestic Silver of the Province of Liege may not the most alluring of titles. However, this major exhibition sponsored by Banque IPPA, is something of which Walloon patriots can feel justly proud. There has been some highly effective string-pulling behind this exhibition. Of the 300 or so exhibits, a remarkable two-thirds come from the private collections of old and unnamed Liegois families. Since it has never been shown in public nor even published, the experts and dealers are not going to want to miss such a golden opportunity. They will also appreciate the exceptionally handsome and scholarly catalogue (BF 950); it is also, I might add, dry-as-dust. It gives a complete directory of Liege hallmarks, with the wry comment that it will be a great help to silver fakers. A few examples of fake pieces have been included in the show, their modern origin detected because of misunderstood hallmarks. However, the fake can also be detected thanks to recent research into the kind of alloy used in Liege, mid-way in quality between Bavaria and Paris. For the low-brow silver enthusiast, however, the exhibition offers the pleasure of a vast and varied hoard of covetable objects, ranging from coffee-pots and candle-snuffers to sword-hilts, cake-slices, and a clothes-brush. A short didactic section describes the workings of the all-powerful guild of silversmiths. However, the kind of detailed information about craftsmen, their workshops and customers which makes students of the London silver trade so happy, is missing. When the French army took Liege in 1794 and, horrible deed, burnt the vast cathedral of St Lambert, they also abolished the guilds and the archives vanished. Liege in the Ancien Regime was an unusual place. It was the capital of a principality ruled, as it had been since the days of the great Bishop Notker in the 10th century, by a Prince-Bishop. And that, we are told with rather tantalising brevity, accounts for the style of Liege silver. No king meant no vying to impress foreign diplomats and hostile powers, no posturing noble courtiers. It meant no Madame de Pompadour, no Madame de Montespan. The Church dominated life in the city; when the bishop died, they changed the hall-marks. Customers for new silver and those who equally often took heirlooms along to be refashioned, were either clerics or sober-sided bourgeois. Some impression of the social setting comes from a reproduction of a painting by the 18th-century artist, Paul-Joseph Delcloche. It shows the bishop and his dinner-guests supping off oysters. There is plenty of silver about the room and on the table, but by far the richest object is the jewelled crucifix on the episcopal midriff. So Liege silverware tends to be elegant and unostentatious, whether the pieces are Baroque, Rococo or influenced by the new classicism which creeps in from around 1750. Generally, fashion tends to be ten years behind Paris and London. On the other hand, in terms of technique masterpieces were produced to match anything which could be brought at more metropolitan centres. Not all the exhibits come from Liege; there is a group of objects from the so-called bonnes villes of the province, such as Maastricht, Waremme and Saint-Trond. Splendid table fountains, containing no one know quite what, were a particular feature of the Low Countries and there are many in the show, majestically pear-shaped on three legs. Many coffee-pots and candlesticks of the 1770s have a violently twisted, swirling form which reminds us that art nouveau was later to flower spectacularly in Belgium. Centre-piece of the exhibition is an elegant table laid for a six o'clock dinner for eight persons. The date would seem to be sometime round the 1780s, last years of the good life in rich, tasteful, independent Liege.</p>

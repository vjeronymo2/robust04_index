			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Scaffolding in short supply THE scale of repairs following the Bishopsgate bomb is exacerbating a shortage of scaffolding, suppliers say. Mr John Cripps, president of the National Association of Scaffolding Contractors, said that demand for scaffolding had increased substantially following the bombing. The association said shortages of scaffolding were emerging before the bombing, because of closures and cuts by suppliers during the recession.</p>

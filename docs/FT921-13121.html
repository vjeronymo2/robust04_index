			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: More bank rescue cash for former Nobel unit SWEDEN'S 14 commercial banks are to provide SKr2.2bn (Dollars 386m) in the form of subordinated loans to cover losses and restore the balance sheet of Gamlestaden, the real estate and finance company. The banks took control of the finance company last August after its collapse as part of Nobel Industries, the chemicals and defence group controlled by financier Mr Eric Penser, when bad property loans exhausted its capital. The latest rescue move, led by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, followed Gamlestaden's startling announcement that its credit losses for 1991 were likely to total SKr6.5bn. This is about SKr3.8bn more than originally feared. Last summer, the banks provided new capital of about SKr5bn to Nobel Industries to cover the SKr5.4bn they lost through investments in Gamlestaden. Their estimated outstanding loans to Gamlestaden are SKr14bn. The need to provide more financial support for the rescue of the company comes as a blow to the Swedish banks, who are already facing severe difficulties. The magnitude of their soaring credit losses was revealed yesterday by Mr Gabriel Urwitz, chief executive of Gota Bank, who said they would total around SKr25bn, or 2 per cent of all loans, for 1991. He also warned that credit losses for the banks would remain high this year and next. It would not be until 1995-1996 that losses would decline. Gamlestaden blamed several factors for the dramatic deterioration in its credit losses. It said it had increased the quality of its risk assessment; there had been several investment write-offs involving losses; and the impact of a weak financial market had become more pronounced. The SKr2.2bn loan is conditional on the banks acquiring all Gamlestaden's remaining shares at SKr1.50. The banks already own 91 per cent of them through Gamlestaden Interessanter.</p>

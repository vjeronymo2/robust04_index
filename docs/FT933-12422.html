			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Fighter with a taste for pre-emptive strikes ARMED with the L505bn (Pounds 211m) pay-off for his wife's stake in the Ferruzzi family holding company, and deeply embittered by his experiences in Italy, Mr Raul Gardini vowed in 1991 to leave the country for good. Shortly before, he had clashed with members of the Ferruzzi family over reorganising their holdings and lost a fight with the Italian government over the Enimont chemicals joint venture. Having already built up Ferruzzi into one of the world's leading agro-industrial concerns, Mr Gardini determined to try his luck again. In the two years before his death, he created the beginnings of a sizeable group, spanning foods, commodities and trading. However, it still had to gain the cohesion required to be a substantial force. Not surprisingly, his activities were based on know-how and contacts accumulated building up Ferruzzi. He chose Paris as his base, and joined forces with Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, founder and then-chairman of Beghin-Say, the sugar group in which Ferruzzi was the controlling shareholder. Mr Gardini bought into Societe Centrale d'Investissement, the cash-rich French company which was Mr Vernes's main investment vehicle. SCI subsequently became the major shareholder in a new Gardini-run investment concern, which in December 1991 paid FFr1.165bn (Pounds 130m) for a 16.6 per cent stake in  - and three industrial units from  - Sucres et Denrees (Sucden), the debt-laden French commodity trader. The deal gave Mr Gardini and Mr Vernes control over Barry, Sucden's cocoa bean processing subsidiary, the world market leader, along with Vital and Sogeviandes, France's largest meat trading and processing businesses. Subsequently, Mr Gardini reversed his decision to avoid Italy, and took over a number of companies in the food and mineral water sectors. Last July, Garma, another Gardini-contolled joint venture set up with a leading industry practitioner, paid about Dollars 300m for control of the popular Levissima mineral water brand. Soon after came the purchase of four lesser brands, lifting the share of Gardini-controlled companies to about 20 per cent of the big Italian market. In February, Garma expanded further by taking a stake in a new joint venture creating Italy's third largest frozen foods group. Mr Gardini also showed he had not lost his taste for daring pre-emptive strikes. Last October, he stunned the stockmarket with steady purchases of shares in the state-owned SME foods group, which was set for privatisation. The plan, according to dealers, was to launch a takeover bid, based on a substantial minority stake, which would have frightened the then-Amato government into ceding control. The attempt failed, but did nothing to dim Mr Gardini's enthusiasm for getting back into the fight.</p>

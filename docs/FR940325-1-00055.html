			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Included in this category are disqualification of applicants for grazing permits and leases, expedited procedure for the review of administrative appeals and implementation of decisions, issuance of grazing preference, a surcharge for the authorized leasing or subleasing of grazing preference associated with base property or pasturing of livestock owned by other than the permittee or lessee, suspended nonuse, and unauthorized use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has made several changes in the initial proposals affecting administrative practices in response to public input. Aspects of the initial proposals regarding administrative practices that received the greatest number of comments were adjustments in permit and lease tenure as a performance incentive, full force and effect of decisions, disqualification of applicants who have had permits or leases canceled for violation of terms and conditions of State and Federal grazing permits, authorized leasing and subleasing surcharges, and the elimination of suspended nonuse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to limit permit and lease tenure in some instances to 5 years has not been carried forward from the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. Public comment on the advance notice suggested the proposal would do little to encourage stewardship and would inadvertently penalize operators new to public land grazing, especially those starting in the business, by inhibiting their ability to secure necessary financing. The Department agrees that the proposal in the advance notice related to permit and lease tenure could result in unacceptable impacts and has withdrawn that proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to place grazing administration decisions in full force and effect generated some confusion and has been clarified in this proposed rule. The objective of placing decisions in full force and effect is to expedite placing decisions into effect to benefit resource conditions and to address administrative problems. The proposal would not take away the ability of affected parties to file an appeal or to request a stay of the decision until such time as the appeal is decided. The Department believes this is critical to meet the goals of streamlining administration and focusing limited resources where they can do the most good, and has retained the substance of the initial proposal. An attempt has been made to clarify the explanation of the proposed appeal provisions in this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, persons choosing to appeal a decision of the authorized officer would be provided a 30-day period in which to file an appeal. Appellants requesting a stay of the decision would be required to file a petition for stay with their appeal. In the instance where a petition for stay has been filed with an appeal, the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals would have 45 days from the expiration of the 30-day appeal period either to grant or deny the petition for stay, in whole or in part. Thus, where a person has filed a petition for stay of the decision of the authorized officer along with an appeal, and where the request for stay is denied, implementation of the decision could be delayed up to 75 days. In the event a stay of the decision is granted, the decision would be stayed until such time as a determination on the appeal is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial proposal to disqualify applicants for grazing permits and leases as a result of cancellation of State or Federal grazing permits and leases during the 36 months preceding application has been modified in response to public comment. This proposed rule would limit the provision for disqualification on the basis of cancellation of grazing permits during the preceding 36 months to applications for new or additional permits and leases. Also, consideration of an applicant's history of compliance with the terms and conditions of State permits and leases has been limited to State permits and leases within the boundary of the Federal grazing allotment for which application has been made. Cancellation of such State permits or leases within 36 months prior to application would disqualify applicants for new or additional Federal permits or leases. A new provision has been added that would make it clear that partial suspension of a Federal grazing permit or lease would not be grounds for disqualification. Partial suspension of a permit or lease is a measure used where actions of the permittee or lessee are not determined to justify cancellation. The Department feels that disqualification of applicants on the basis of partial suspension would result in excessive punitive action and would reduce the usefulness of partial suspension in addressing violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advance notice of proposed rulemaking provided for automatic disqualification on the basis of the suspension or cancellation of an applicant's other Federal or State grazing permits or leases during the 36 months prior to application. Under the proposed rule, the consideration of an applicant's history of performance on other Federal or State grazing permits or leases would not apply to applicants for the renewal of a BLM grazing permit or lease. The Department invites comment on whether an applicant's history of performance on other Federal and State grazing permits and leases should be added as a discretionary, rather than automatic, basis for determining qualification for the renewal of a BLM grazing permit or lease. Also, the Department invites comment on whether a similar provision for a discretionary review of past performance should apply to applicants for new or additional BLM permits or leases, in addition to the automatic disqualification where an applicant has had a Federal or State permit canceled for violation during the 36 months prior to application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Hoped That the New Airport Issue Will Be </F> Settled As Early As Possible"]    [Text] Ambassador Guo Feng-min, the Chinese Joint Liaison  Group team leader, said this week: The Chinese side has taken a  preliminary look at the "fourth financial package" proposed by  the British side on the new Hong Kong airport and related  projects, and still has to study some of the problems in an  in-depth manner. In addition, it is necessary to exchange views  with the British side, so we hope that the expert panel under  the Airport Committee will call a meeting this month. The  so-called "fourth financial package" was proposed by the British  side early this month. The Spring Festival holidays interrupted  the process, but the Chinese side still studied the package very  quickly and immediately proposed the expert panel meeting. It  indicates that the Chinese side is, as always, positive and  practical in dealing with the Hong Kong airport construction  project.    The Chinese Government consented to the construction of a  new  airport in Hong Kong a few years ago. As far as this project is  concerned, the Chinese side has been consistently saying that it  is necessary to handle the matter in strict accordance with the  Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] signed by heads of both the  Chinese and the British Governments and with relevant  stipulations of the Annex III to the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, which not only abides by the mutual commitments  made between China and Britain, but also safeguards the  interests of Hong Kong residents and of the future government of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. With the  exception of these, the Chinese Government does not have any  gains from the Hong Kong new airport project. Actually, the  problem would have been settled long ago if the previous  financial packages proposed by the British Hong Kong authorities  accorded with the Sino-British MOU.    When the "fourth financial package" was proposed, officials  of the British Hong Kong authorities went so far as to describe  it as "presenting a big gift," saying that it "meets every  demand of the Chinese side." As a matter of fact, the wealth of  Hong Kong belongs to its people, and there is no point in saying  that the British side "presents a gift." Moreover, as far as  the lately proposed "fourth financial package" is concerned,  what needs to be studied is merely the question of whether or  not it accords with the Memorandum of Understanding and meet  other relevant requirements, and whether or not it meets the  demands of the Chinese side is not a question in itself.    A review of the past shows that even when China vehemently  argued with Britain on the issue of electoral arrangements in  Hong Kong, the Chinese side still extended its timely support to  construction projects which accorded with Hong Kong people's  interests. For example, the Chinese side consented to the  construction of the Western District Cross-Harbor Tunnel and to  the reclamation project from the Central District to Wanchai.  Regarding the problem of financing the new airport, the Chinese  side has already stated its views in a systematic manner at the  Airport Committee meeting last August. However, the British  side merely called for the reconvening of the Airport Committee  meeting without redrafting the package so as to make it conform  to the stipulations of the MOU. Only after the matter was  delayed for almost half a year then the British Hong Kong  authorities put forward the "fourth package," whereas during  this period, they repeatedly broke the package into different  parts to appropriate funds for individual projects. Even when  the "fourth package" was sent to the Chinese side and the  content was not made public, they allowed the Legislative  Council, which did not have a clear idea of the package, to pass  an appropriation of nearly 4.8 billion dollars for the new  airport project. Hence, the Chinese side could not but state  that before China and Britain reach an agreement on the  financing problem, the Chinese side and the future SAR  Government will not bear responsibility for any cost and debt  incurred by the new airport. On the one hand, the British Hong  Kong authorities put off proposing the overall financial  package. On the other hand, they authorized, without the  consent of the Chinese side, the appropriation for project  expenses. People cannot but doubt whether or not they are  sincere about working according to the understanding and  agreement reached between China and Britain.    What the Sino-British MOU asked for is that the airport  project should be in line with the cost-benefit principle in  order not to put a burden on the future SAR Government: Up to  30 June 1997, no less than 25 billion Hong Kong dollars of  financial reserves and no more than 5 billion dollars of debts  will be left over for the SAR Government. As far as the new  airport project is concerned, all debts, whether incurred by the  Airport Authority or the Airport Railway Company, must be  finally undertaken by the SAR Government. If the total amount of  all these debts exceeds 5 billion dollars, the Chinese side has  to raise a query on it according to the MOU.    As prescribed by Annex III to the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, land granted before 1997 shall be considered and  decided by the Sino-British Land Commission and the total amount  of land to be granted shall be limited to 50 hectares a year,  but an increase in the amount of land granted each year can be  considered after proposals by British Hong Kong Government.  Investing some of the proceeds gained by selling land along the  new airport rail line in the airport project was the original  proposal of the Chinese side. Land along the airport rail line  granted before 1997 should be, of course, discussed by the  Sino-British Land Commission. As shown by its performance over  the past few years, the Chinese side always took a positive  attitude towards this and approved sales over the annual limit  of 50 hectares of land in many years. The Chinese side can  guarantee that it will support the construction of the airport  railway by granting land through the Land Commission.    As a matter of fact, it is not difficult to settle the new  airport financing problem as long as the matter is handled in  accordance with the stipulations of the MOU and of the Joint  Declaration. The people of Hong Kong hope that the Sino-British  expert panel meeting to be held at the end of this month can  conscientiously and profoundly discuss the matter and make  preparations for calling the Airport Commission meeting and  finally reaching an agreement.</p>

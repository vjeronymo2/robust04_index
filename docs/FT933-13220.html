			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips as Pakistan welcomes caretaker premier INVESTORS reacted cautiously to the outcome of Sunday's lower house election, where the ruling Liberal Democratic party lost its hold on power and share prices receded on arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average shed 180.61 to 20,150.92, the first fall in three trading days. The index rose to a day's high of 20,350.53 at the start of the session, but soon fell to the day's low of 20,089.71. An estimated 260m shares changed hands, down from Friday's 344m. Declines outnumbered rises by 640 to 337, with 188 stocks unchanged. The Topix index of all first section issues slipped 8.20 to 1,644.68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.14 to 1,252.71. While the result of the lower house elections came as little surprise, investors were reluctant to take fresh positions because of the uncertainty over who will lead the next government. Traders said that, while the downside remained limited due to underlying hopes of monetary easing, the stagnant economic growth will weigh on share prices. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, said prices would not be affected by political developments, since the political changes were following the shifts in the economic and financial structures. Reports on the political situation had little effect on movements in individual shares. Mitsubishi Kasei, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y12 to Y530 on its development of an anti-Aids drug. Nippon Express, which was also actively traded, rose Y50 to Y1,070. The company, which has close links to Japan Railway, gained ground ahead of JR East's listing, scheduled for October. Reports of listing plans for DDI, a new telecom company, encouraged trading in its leading shareholders. Ushio climbed Y82 to Y982 and Kyocera appreciated Y160 to Y6,460. Some financial issues were lower on arbitrage-linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y40 to Y3,200 and Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y30 to Y2,850. Profit-taking depressed mining issues, taking the sector down 1.99 per cent. Sumitomo Metal Mining dipped Y10 to Y1,060. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 16.30 to 22,363.56 in volume of 24.9m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y290 at Y9,600. Roundup POLITICAL events provided the key to developments in several Pacific Rim markets. PAKISTAN was higher in brisk trade after Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the president, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, resigned, ending months of political uncertainty. The KSE index rose 9.24 to 1,280.74. Mr Kaikobad Kakalia, senior equities trader at BMA Capital Management in Karachi, said investors had taken heart at the smooth transition of power to the new caretaker premier, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice-president of the World Bank. 'He is regarded as a respected international economist and people feel that the economy will be in safe hands,' added Mr Kakalia. HONG KONG saw across the board selling by overseas institutions. There was news over the weekend that the Shanghai Petrochemical flotation had received a tepid reception, and the institutions were unsettled by reports that China's Guangdong province may slow its property investment in the colony and that local property developers were pulling out of projects in China as austerity measures begin to bite. The Hang Seng index fell 111.50, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,813.72 in turnover of HKDollars 3.2bn, after Friday's HKDollars 2.6bn. The property sector, 2.7 per cent lower, bore the brunt of the selling pressure. AUSTRALIA recouped much of its early loss to close only slightly down on the day. Firm oil and gas shares also helped to offset weakness, and the All Ordinaries index finished only 3.6 off at 1,796.2. TAIWAN was mixed, with industrials up on a minor technical rebound, while banking stocks remained weak. The weighted index closed 7.32 higher at 3,917.81 in thin turnover of TDollars 10.55bn. MANILA's composite index put on 6.64 at 1,621.70, boosted by the strength of second line issues. SEOUL was easier in slow trading on fears that protracted labour disputes at Hyundai subsidiaries would worsen. The composite index dipped 9.79 to 749.38. KUALA LUMPUR extended Friday's gains but closed off the day's highs. The composite index moved up 6.72 to 742.50 on demand from institutional and retail investors after Malayan Banking further cut its base lending rate. BANGKOK picked up after last week's five straight days of losses. The SET index rallied 13.55 to 898.91.</p>

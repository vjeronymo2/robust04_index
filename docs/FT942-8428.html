			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Burton Group At first sight it is difficult to see why Burton's shares rose 4.5 per cent in response to yesterday's interim figures. While Debenhams continues to perform creditably, the rest of the group is hardly firing on all cylinders. Top Shop/Top Man and Principles are the biggest problems, together showing trading losses of Pounds 16m in the first half. That is worse than last year. With gearing of less than 10 per cent after the latest property sale, the balance sheet has been restored to full health. Since cash generation remains strong and capital spending will peak this year, one might wonder whether last year's Pounds 160m rights issue was strictly necessary. But Burton still has to demonstrate that it can use financial freedom to revitalise its stores. The suspicion remains that the disparate parts of the empire compete too much with each other, while attempts to narrow the focus of each chain have not delivered the right result. The poor performance of Top Shop is a case in point. Early indications are that the second half is shaping up better than the first and tax increases do not appear to have damped consumer spending. The rationalisation of the stores portfolio now taking place - including a 20 per cent reduction in the number of sites - looks like solid groundwork. But on a multiple of around 30 times this year's consensus forecast earnings Burton needs to prove that it can do more than stop the rot.</p>

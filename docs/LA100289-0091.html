			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY WANTS ADDRESSES VISIBLE FROM STREET  </P> <P> To speed police and fire response times, Huntington Beach officials will start  enforcing a law requiring homes and businesses to make their addresses visible  from the street.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of problems with our larger (apartment and industrial) complexes  in finding the addresses," Fire Department Capt. Tom Huntley said.  </P> <P> City inspectors have the authority to fine building owners for not complying  with the law, but that probably will not be necessary, Huntley said.  </P></p>

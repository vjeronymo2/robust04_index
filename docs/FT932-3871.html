			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Bonds: French borrowers find strong demand for FFr37bn of deals THREE new issues totalling FFr37bn, were launched in the French franc sector, yesterday, all for French borrowers, reflecting the lack of arbitrage opportunities available in the market. Swap spreads have narrowed to a point where only borrowers willing to lock into fixed-rate French francs are likely to find the market attractive. However, international investor demand for French bonds remains strong, particularly at the medium and longer maturities, given the firm tone of the government bond market. Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the AAA-rated French agency, launched a FFr1.7bn six-year deal via Credit Commercial de France, priced to yield 20 basis points over the comparable French government bond, while Credit Lyonnais arranged FFr1bn of five-year Eurobonds for its parent. A FFr1bn seven-year deal for Eurodif, a French uranium company, was structured as a Eurobond but the unrated paper, for a company little known outside France, was targeted mainly at domestic investors, dealers said. In the dollar sector, a Dollars 150m five-year issue for Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals company, was rapidly sold out, due to its rarity value - it has not tapped the Eurobond market since 1985 - and its AAA rating. The launch spread of 15 basis points had tightened by several basis points by the end of the day, according to lead manager Morgan Stanley. Also in the dollar sector, Iceland launched a Dollars 125m issue of five-year bonds arranged by Goldman Sachs. Banco Comercial became the first borrower from Uruguay, apart from the government which recently came to the market, to tap the Eurobond market. The small Dollars 40m issue arranged by CSFB was well received, according to dealers. Banca Cremi, the Mexican bank, is planning to launch a USDollars 150m, two-year Eurobond shortly, lead-managed by Banco Santander de Negocios, writes Sara Webb. Banca Cremi is Mexico's ninth largest bank in terms of total assets and was privatised in 1991. It will use the proceeds to refinance existing debt. Santander said it is looking at a yield spread of about 450 basis points over US Treasuries. Banca Cremi did a USDollars 50m three-year bond issue in October 1992 which was priced to yield 490 basis points over the US Treasury bond. 'The bond issue is meant to increase the duration of debt and introduce Cremi to the international financial community,' said one of the bankers involved in the deal.</p>

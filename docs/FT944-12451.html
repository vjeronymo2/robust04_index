			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (1): Bumpy ride to a new identity - Changes in Australia's ethnic make-up, its international orientation and economic culture are a test of its political maturity As political rallies go, the recent gathering in Cabramatta, one of Sydney's western suburbs, was a low-key affair. A few hundred people, perhaps two-thirds Vietnamese, gathered in the local park to hear speeches and sing songs. A solitary policeman tapped his foot in time to the music. But the fact that it occurred at all was extraordinary. A few days earlier, the local state MP and an outspoken opponent of Asian gangs who had infiltrated the area, had been shot dead. While the reasons for his killing have yet to be revealed, the local media quickly declared this to be Australia's first political assassination. The racist tone of subsequent public reaction on radio chat-shows worried community leaders, and they decided a backlash should be forestalled. The rally, it was hoped, would demonstrate the area's real feelings. It would be easy to get Cabramatta out of proportion. In truth, there are not many streets in Australia where European script is barely visible. The suburb's electorate is amongst the nation's most diverse, almost one-fifth Vietnamese, but with other large immigrant communities, drawn from both Asia and Europe. Australia, meanwhile, remains more remarkable for the accessibility and informality which surrounds its public figures. All that said, Cabramatta's recent experience, and the preconceptions and responses which it unleashed, do highlight the key question which confronts the nation. For a decade, Australia has been engaged in a process of fundamental change, encompassing everything from the country's trade focus and its wage-bargaining mechanisms, to its cultural priorities and racial mix. Key objectives have been (and remain) a closer integration with Asian neigbours and a more competitive business environment at home. But how fast this restructuring can, or should be, pushed is an extremely difficult issue - and one which gets no easier as the changes dig more pervasively into everyday lives, and trade-offs between political consensus and what is optimal from an economic standpoint become inevitable. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, made reference to the issue during his keynote speech to delegates at the recent Australian Labor Party conference. 'We are in office. We are doing what we do best - which is making the changes, preparing Australia for the future,' he said. 'And we are bringing the people with us,' he continued in a slight departure from the prepared text. 'That's the important thing, they're coming with us.' From a political perspective, the prime minister's assessment seems correct. Since winning the supposedly 'unwinnable' election in early 1993, when recession was biting hard and dissatisfaction rife, the Keating administration has established a clear lead over its opponents in the opinion polls. A Newspoll survey published in late-October, for example, suggested that if an election were held today, 46 per cent would vote for the Australian Labor Party versus 41 per cent for the Liberal/National coalition. On polling day in 1993, the same survey showed the two votes neck-and-neck. The government's edge does owe something to the leadership turmoil within the Liberal Party, the larger partner in the coalition, and to the opposition's policy confusion in the wake of its unexpected 1993 election loss. Moreover, the ALP's ascendancy in federal politics is not mirrored at state or territory level, where only Queensland remains in outright Labor control. This situation, in turn, makes for tension and confusion in key areas, ranging from Aboriginal rights to labour relations. But it is also arguable that one major factor in Labor's successful retention of popular support at federal level has been its astute but cautious timing of the reform process - a sharp contrast to New Zealand, whose faster restructuring has provoked a political backlash. In Australia, where the electorate is generally conservative, the Keating government has shown a marked willingness to adjust the tempo in sensitive areas, ensuring that a majority is kept on board. But while this careful pace of change has so far bought political stability, it is possible that problems are being created on the economic front. On a short-term view, there seems little cause for concern. Growth in GDP is forecast to run out at around 4.5 per cent in 1994/5, and then at perhaps four per cent in the following year, figures which compare favourably with any other 'western' economy. The inflation outlook has begun to look a little less favourable in recent months, in part because of the potential long-term implications of the current drought which has crippled key agricultural areas on the east coast. Nevertheless, the situation is not all that alarming. The consumer price index is forecast to rise by just 2.1 per cent this year, and perhaps 3.5-4 per cent in the following 12 months. Moreover, a larger-than-anticipated one percentage point jump in interest rates in late-October suggests that the Reserve Bank of Australia, the central monetary authority, is firmly determined to keep price rises under control. It is over the medium-term that the clouds start to loom. Unemployment has been slow to fall in Australia, and is expected to average a little under 10 per cent in 1994. The government responded earlier this year with a comprehensive package of measures, including a promise of subsidised employment or training for all long-term unemployed. It was costed at ADollars 6.5bn over the next four years. But rather than fund the package with new tax measures, which could have been politically troublesome, ministers chose to utilise the 'growth dividend' - the higher than expected tax receipts flowing from the country's rapid economic recovery. That, in turn, meant that there was no scope for accelerating the government's deficit reduction plan in the 1994 budget, which repeated the previously-stated aim of cutting this to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. More recently, there have been suggestions that fiscal strategy may be reviewed next year. But analysts are sceptical. An even larger cloud on the horizon is the current account situation. This has been a bugbear for Australia in the past, with an upturn in domestic activity tending to lead to a surge in imports - in part, to meet capital investment requirements. As the trade balance has gone out of kilter, interest rates have been forced up, and a 'boom and bust' scenario has developed. This time, the anticipatory response has been twofold. There has been an all-out effort to promote Australian exports, most notably to Asia, which now accounts for over 60 per cent of the country's trade. And there is an attempt to lift the country's low saving rate, through changes to the pension/superannuation system. It is in the context of the former strategy that Australia's desire to establish a 'free trade' zone in the Asia-Pacific region assumes considerable importance. The Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation group is due to meet this month to consider a report seeking the goal of free trade in all goods and services by 2020, with more developed nations lowering their barriers at a relatively faster rate. Australia is expected to push the proposal hard. At this stage, it would be a brave individual who tried to predict whether enough change had been wrought to break the previous cyclical pattern. Government ministers say yes; some local business leaders, and many Asian competitors, say no. 'Reviewing the scorecard, I'd give us about five out of 10 for our current policy mix,' remarked Don Mercer, head of the ANZ banking group, earlier this year. 'Unless we commit ourselves to picking up the reform agenda, we stand a pretty good chance of wasting the best opportunity in decades to secure the sustained recovery we deserve to have'. Perhaps all that can be said with certainty is that the balancing act is a delicate one on which political fortunes will undoubtably ride.</p>

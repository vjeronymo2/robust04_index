			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Labour hits at tax break A Pounds 60M SUBSIDY will go to people living in the UK's most expensive homes through the single-person council tax discount, Labour said yesterday. The party said the subsidy would be at the expense of middle and low-income families. The emphasis on the 25 per cent cut in council tax available to single-person households regardless of wealth is a key element in the opposition's attempt to highlight what it sees as the unfairness of the new tax. Tories seem more worried about the squeeze on spending to prevent bills rising too sharply, given the limited amount of grant that was available for the first year of the new tax. Even so, Labour is determined to attack the basis of the tax as well as the spending settlement. Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's local-government spokesman, pointed out that in terms of cash reductions, the discount most benefited those in the top bands. He said last night that the Pounds 60m could have been used instead to save every household Pounds 3 from its council tax bill. Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister, attacked Labour for challenging the discount, available to 6m people, without saying how the party expected single people on low incomes to pay the full charge. Mr Henderson emphasised that benefit from the discount was concentrated in London. 'It is clear that ordinary householders in London and the rest of the country are subsidising a small number of rich single people, Mr Henderson said. Son of Poll Tax, Page 6 Weekend, Page IV</p>

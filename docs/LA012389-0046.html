			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION, RESIGNATION DEAL SETBACKS TO GANDHI PARTY  </P> <P> Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi suffered a double blow Sunday, with his Congress-I  Party heading for a humiliating electoral defeat in south India and a key  political lieutenant forced to resign.  </P> <P> The regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, known as the DMK, appeared  certain to win an absolute majority in the Tamil Nadu state assembly after the  election Saturday.  </P> <P> "We have won the election. That is how it looks," party leader Muthuvel  Karunanidhi told reporters as thousands of jubilant supporters besieged his  headquarters in Madras.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holds Wide Lead  </P> <P> With more than half the ballots counted, the DMK or its allies led in 151 of  the 232 constituencies, the government election agency reported.  </P> <P> The Congress-I Party was ahead in 35 districts.  </P> <P> Gandhi's problems were compounded when the party leadership asked the  Congress-I chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, Arjun Singh, to resign after  a court ordered an inquiry into a lottery with which his family is connected.  </P> <P> Gandhi, whose government has been battered by corruption charges in the last  year, sent Singh to Madhya Pradesh in central India last year to rebuild the  Congress-I's fortunes before national elections.  </P> <P> Singh denied in his resignation statement that he had done any wrong.  </P></p>

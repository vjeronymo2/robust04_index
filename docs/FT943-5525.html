			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / London Tube increases offer The threat of possible London Underground strikes to coincide with signal workers' stoppages receded last night when the Tube's management said it was prepared to increase its staff's cost of living increase from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The offer was conditional on Aslef, the train drivers' union, and the RMT transport union withdrawing their ballots on industrial action. The conciliation service Acas said the unions had agreed to respond by September 14.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: ANZ accounts again qualified ANZ, the Australian financial services group, has had its 1993 accounts qualified for the second successive year because of doubts surrounding the company's ADollars 250m (USDollars 163m) exposure to court action in India, report Bruce Jacques in Sydney and agencies. KPMG Peat Marwick, the group's accountant, said uncertainties remained on the outcome of a claim totalling Rs5.06bn (USDollars 161.3m) against ANZ by the National Housing Bank of India. But the auditors added that they agreed with the basis upon which the financial statements were presented. The claim arises from a financial crisis in India which resulted in an agreement for arbitration over the disputed monies. Under the previously-announced agreement, ANZ Grindlays in India has paid the Rs5.06m to the National Housing Bank of India, but can have the amount returned with interest if it successfully defends the claim. ANZ directors said in their annual report, out yesterday, the arbitration was unlikely to be completed before the middle of 1994. They also noted 'inadvertent breaches of India's Foreign Exchange Regulation Act' by ANZ Grindlays. 'These matters were discovered by our staff and reported to the relevant authorities for investigation,' ANZ directors said. 'After reviewing these issues in detail, directors do not consider it necessary to make any provision for loss.' ANZ made a ADollars 246.5m net profit in the year to September 30 against a ADollars 579m loss in the previous year.</p>

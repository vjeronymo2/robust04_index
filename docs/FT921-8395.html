			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons signs pub deal with Brent Walker ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, yesterday announced that it had signed agreements for the lease of 734 of its pubs to Pubmaster, the Brent Walker retail subsidiary. The deal was completed in spite of a warning from the Office of Fair Trading that the pubs would still form part of Allied's tied estate. Allied's legal advice is that the pubs would count towards the 2,380 which government orders require it to free from exclusive beer supplies by November. Under the terms of the agreement with Brent Walker, Allied will supply the enlarged Pubmaster estate with two thirds of its beer for seven years. The differences between Allied and the OFT over the status of the pubs may have to be settled by the courts, though modifications of the beer supply agreement would probably meet the OFT's requirements. Mr Don Marshall, Allied Breweries' commercial director, said: 'We have been working for some time to structure the deal in such a way as to take into account any concerns the OFT may have. In announcing the signings, we are confident that this is a further step towards meeting the requirements of the tied estate order.' As part of the deal, Allied is buying 46 pubs from Brent Walker for Pounds 20.1m cash, of which Pounds 7m is deferred for one year. Brent Walker had originally intended to sell 57 pubs to Allied but said yesterday that 11 had been withdrawn by agreement and had been sold instead to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries.</p>

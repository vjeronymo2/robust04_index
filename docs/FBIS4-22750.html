			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Volume of Migration in Latvia Has Declined"] </F>   [Text] The Latvian State Statistics Committee has compiled  data and performed an analysis on the migration of inhabitants  in Latvia in 1993. It shows that migration in the last year, in  comparison with previous years, has declined. The number of  inhabitants of the Republic of Latvia, according to inter-nation  migration, has declined in 1993 by about 28 thousand people. The  total volume of inter-nation migration (the total number of  persons who have entered and those who have left Latvia as a  place of permanent residence) in the last year, in comparison  with 1992, declined by 39 percent, with emigration declining  more rapidly -- by 39.6 percent, than immigration -- by 32.5  percent.    The decline in both immigration and emigration volume is  attributed to the flow of immigration to our neighboring  countries of Lithuania and Estonia, and especially to the CIS.  Immigration from the CIS countries in 1993 declined by 38.2  percent, while emigration to these -- by 41 percent. Emigration  from Latvia to western countries in 1993 continued at the same  volume as for the previous year -- 2,487 persons in 1992, and  2,319 persons in 1993. Emigration from Latvia to western  countries continues to be almost 8 times greater than  immigration from these.    The greatest effect of migration is the decline in the  number  of inhabitants of Latvia's largest cities of Riga, Liepaja, and  Daugavpils, which could be considered as a positive result, and  also in the rayons of Bauska, Cesis, Ogre and Preili. A positive  migration balance in 1993 was found in the city of Rezekne and  in the rayons of Rezekne, Kuldiga, Ludza and Balvi. But during  this time period, no positive migration balance from abroad was  registered for any of the cities or rayons of Latvia.    Statistical data show that the number of Latvians in cities  continues to decline as a result of migration: in 1992 by 4.5  thousand, while in 1993, by 1.4 thousand. This indicates that  Latvian families, for various reasons, are relocating to live in  rural areas.    Migration of Inhabitants in Latvia in 1993.

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Calm end to week Calm returned to both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday after the pound consolidated its position on the foreign exchanges and the Bank of England was accomodating with a large shortage. After a turbulent week in the cash markets, dominated by fears of an imminent rise in Germany's Lombard rate, money market operators had a relaxed day. Several of the German states released sharply reduced inflation figures, suggesting that next week's German cost-of-living figure for July will be down 1 per cent to 3.3 per cent. That eased fears of an interest rate increase when the Bundesbank council meets on August 6. Sterling also firmed on the foreign exchanges, rising more than 1 1/2 pfennigs. The Bank of England added to the cheer by being very accomodating in its money market intervention, forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn but inviting offers in the early round and having most of the shortage taken out at that stage. Period rates in the cash market, if not bullish, were at least a bit softer. At the end of the day, 1 month money was offered  1/8 per cent cheaper from its previous close, at 10 1/8 per cent. Three-month money was  1/16 per cent softer at 10 5/16 per cent. There was also a slight softening at the long end of the yield curve, with 1-year money dropping back to 10 1/4 per cent from 10 3/8 per cent the night before. Futures trading was easier. The September contract closed up 4 basis points from its previous finish at 89.76. However, this was far from bullish, bearing in mind that the September contract has been up at 90.25 since base rates dropped to 10 per cent. Both the futures and cash rates are still pricing in a  1/4 per cent rise in base rate, and the mood in the market remains tense. But the feeling is widespread that sterling may have a respite for the next few weeks. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 136m of Band 1 treasury bills, Pounds 423m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 344m of Band 2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 400m in a repo repayable on 11 and 12 August at 9 15/16 per cent. The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.5bn. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 30m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and provided late assistance of Pounds 90m.</p>

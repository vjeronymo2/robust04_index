			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannebsurg May 4 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] will resume issuing vote tallies within little  more than an hour -- about 7 PM -- IEC Chairman Justice Johann  Kriegler said on Wednesday [4 May] afternoon. He explained to  the media that results had been stopped after "pollution" of the  data was discovered shortly after 6 AM on Tuesday.    The results would now be issued from a second, slower,  manually-fed back-up system which he claimed was free of these  errors. Mr Kriegler said a team of computer experts had been  called in to investigate the problem and that it was not known  who was responsible for the computer interference.  Investigations were continuing.    All vote counting, barring that in Empangeni, had been  completed and the latter would be finished within hours. Judge  Kriegler was supported by his deputy, Mr Dikgang Moseneke, and  Commissioner Ben van der Ross. They said Natal results would  reach the IEC headquarters in a "usable format" no later than 7  PM on Wednesday.    "All disputes have been resolved at Durban Expo and we can  now deal with the final tallies," Mr van der Ross said. When  the result issue was resumed the manual tallies would take over  from those issued from the computerised system.    Judge Kriegler said the new totals would be "more or less  slightly higher" than those already issued with a slight  fluctuation in results for particular parties. In a lengthy  explanation of the "pollution", Judge Kriegler avoided using the  word mistake and became, as he put it, "disconcerted by the  implication (of questioners) that I am not being truthful."    On Tuesday the slow pace of results had prompted an attempt  to change systems to issue totals rather than batches. When  this proved very much slower, and after closing down the data  receiving system, "the suspicion arose that some of the  information may be polluted", he said.    Investigations started immediately while the manually fed  monitoring system became the main recording system. "None of  the suspect material was loaded onto the monitoring system. It  is not suspect, even now."    The judge did not tell the media what the euphemism "suspect  material" or "pollution" meant in real terms. The problem, he  said, had been discovered due to trivial differences which  continually occurred between two independent data control  systems which had specifically been set up to provide  independent verification of the results.    "Extraordinary measures are being taken to ensure the  integrity of results on the manual system is as trustworthy as  human precautions can make them," he said. He could not give a  definite time when the final results would be announced. "But  we in the commission are acutely aware, as you are, of the  inauguration and of the (preceeding) sessions of the provincial  and national assemblies.    "We will take as long as the law allows us to do the job as  thoroughly as we can. We are doing everything in our power to  ensure that there is no disruption and I am confident we will be  able to do so," Judge Kriegler said.</p>

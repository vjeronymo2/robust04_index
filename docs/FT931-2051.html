			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: KIO's top Briton resigns as treasurer THE KUWAIT Investment Office, Kuwait's foreign investment arm, is losing its most senior British manager, Mr Ian Black, who has resigned as the KIO's treasurer and is to leave in June. Mr Black has been a key figure in retaining the trust and confidence of the international banking community in the KIO since the Iraqis were ejected from Kuwait in early 1991. He played a leading role in organising a Dollars 5.5bn loan to help reconstruct the emirate after the Gulf war. He is also said to have helped calm nervous bankers in recent months after a public investigation was launched by the KIO's new management into alleged losses and fraud in investments made by their predecessors in Spain. The uproar surrounding this investigation, in which the KIO has refused to honour some debts incurred by former managers, has worried some large international banks. Mr Black's departure is likely to coincide with a reduction in the power of the KIO, headquartered in London. The Kuwaiti government is poised to approve plans to merge the KIO into its younger Kuwait-based parent, the Kuwait Investment Agency (KIA). According to proposals by the Kuwaiti finance ministry, the new merged body would be headed by Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, the new president of the KIO. The merger would mean concentrating most decision-making power over Kuwaiti investments back in Kuwait, a move some critics fear would open Kuwait's finances to much greater political intervention. Defenders of the plan say the KIA and the KIO already duplicate many of each other's functions. If the merger does take place, a number of non-Kuwaiti staff at the KIO in London are expected to be made redundant.</p>

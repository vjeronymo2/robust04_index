			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, </F> Yemeni planning and development minister and member of the  General Committee of the General People's Congress, by Hasin  al-Bunyan in Riyadh; date not given]    [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni planning and  development minister and member of the General Committee  (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC], has  declared that "Sanaa will continue the war until the mutiny  against legitimacy led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid is defeated."    He said: "We will continue the war even for 100 years  because  we see nothing wrong with fighting in defense of constitutional  legitimacy, until the mutiny falls."    He added: "We know that war is not easy and that the way to  Aden to put down the mutiny will not be easy but whoever imposed  that war must pay the price." He emphasized that "the only  condition for stopping the war is to recognize the legitimate  constitutional leadership and place all the armed forces under  the command of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the supreme  commander of the armed forces."    He said that Sanaa absolutely refuses to receive Arab forces  to disengage the warring forces in Yemen. "We cannot possibly  allow such interference because we are fighting an internal  mutiny, fighting to end and put down that mutiny. Do the Arabs  accept fragmentation of a homeland? Would any Arab country  accept interference to end a mutiny in it?"    He added: "We welcome Arab mediation if it is within the  context of fulfilling constititonal legitimacy and the context  of dealing with the state of unity." He also said that 'Ali  Salim al-Bid's rejection of the legitimate decisions dismissing  him, al-'Attas, and some ministers is not important because he  is, after all, a mutineer. He emphasized that the legitimate  forces will continue the war and the fighting "because we are  fighting for a cause. A mutineer has no cause. That is the  difference."    Dr. al-Iryani stressed that the northern forces "have not  retreated one inch on the Abyan front," and that "fighting is  now raging in al-'Anad base, the last stronghold of the rebel  forces." He said that the southern forces are now concentrated  in the area of al-'Alam, north of Aden, considered to be the  city's first and last line of defense. He confirmed "the  surrender to the legitimate forces of 550 officers and soldiers  from al-Labwazah Brigade on the Kirsh front with all their arms  equipment." Dr. al-Iryani also confirmed "the surrender of the  southern 30th Brigade three days ago. That brigade no longer  exists in the Abyan Governorate and al-'Urqub area." He added  that he contacted Sanaa yesterday and was assured that  "al-'Amaliqah Brigade has not retreated from its positions in  Zinjibar and Mudiyah and that it is there in full strength." He  emphasized that "not a single gun, tank, or piece of arms was  lost on the Abyan front. These forces are now advancing towards  al-'Alam area."    On the conflicting reports on how close the northern forces  are to Aden, al-Iryan affirmed that these reports did not come  from military sources, but he said that forces from Khalid Camp,  al-Wahdah Brigade, and the 125th Brigade are occupying the area  of Kharaz west of Aden.</p>

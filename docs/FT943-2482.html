			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): British Aerospace - Other Companies Half-year figures on Wednesday will show a dramatic turnround from last year. However, much of the headline improvement will come from the one-off profit on the sale of the Rover car group to BMW, estimated to be in the region of Pounds 250m. Underlying profits are likely to be in the region of Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 20m in the first half of last year. The dividend may be increased from an interim 3.3p last time to about 3.75p.</p>

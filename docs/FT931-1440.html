			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark recommends Berisford THE BATTLE over the future of C&amp;J Clark will now be fought by shareholders as the company, riven by a boardroom row for several months, yesterday announced it had chosen Berisford to be the recommended bidder for the shoe manufacturer owned by the Clark family since 1825. A main factor in the decision to recommend Berisford, the agribusiness and property group, appears to have been price. Berisford is thought to have offered marginally more than Pounds 2 a share, valuing Clark at between Pounds 157m and Pounds 160m. Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chairman, said he was delighted to have won the board's approval to proceed to the next stage of negotiations. 'I am convinced this represents a marvellous opportunity for both companies to grow internationally', he said. Clark will inform shareholders of the formal offer in about two weeks, when it announces its annual results. It is likely to call an extraordinary meeting before the annual meeting - now planned for the end of April - to put the proposals to shareholders. The sale is expected to be the subject of heated dispute among Clark's 500 family members who control 70 per cent of the group. At least four members of the 11-strong board - who claim to control more than 30 per cent of the shares - strenuously object to the loss of family control. However, a sale has been on the cards since shareholders agreed to find the best price for the company following a bid approach backed by Electra Investment Trust.</p>

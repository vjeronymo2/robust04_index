			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Gaza elections still undecided High-level talks in Gaza and Tel Aviv yesterday cleared the air between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators but did not yet open the door to elections in Gaza and the West Bank. An Israeli official reaffirmed after a special cabinet session that Israel would contiue to implement the declaration of principles of September 1993 which mapped out self-determination for the Palestinians. Any modifications would be made through negotiations. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, acknowledged 'the necessity of the Israelis for security.' He was speaking after a meeting with Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister. Mr Arafat, Mr Peres and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, are expected to consult during the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony this weekend.</p>

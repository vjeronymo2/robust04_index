			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARDINALS SIGN RB THOMPSON  </P> <P> The last holdout has signed with the Phoenix Cardinals, and that means there  will be competition between two rookie running backs.  </P> <P> Paul Jensen of the NFL team said Anthony Thompson, a second-round draft pick  from Indiana and the 1989 Heisman Trophy runner-up, signed today and was  expected in training camp on Thursday.  </P> <P> Pro Bowl safety Tim McDonald ended his 29-day holdout by signing a three-year  contract Tuesday and promptly reporting for training.  </P> <P> So far in preseason, ninth-round draft pick Johnny Johnson has been Phoenix's  starting running back and has a team-leading 121 yards on 23 carries.  </P> <P> "He's opening everybody's eyes," Coach Joe Bugel said of Johnson, who is one of  San Jose State's all-time leading rushers. Having both Thompson and Johnson  will "only help because it will be two rookies pushing each other for the job."  </P> <P> Details of the Thompson contract weren't disclosed, but he had been seeking a  two-year deal at $1.3 million, about $200,000 more than the team reportedly was  offering.  </P></p>

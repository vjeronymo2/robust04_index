			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of  Korean youth and students in Japan was held at the Shiba Park in  Tokyo on April 19 to denounce the nuclear war provocation moves  of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and  pave the way of peace of the country and its reunification on  the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the April 19 popular  uprising in South Korea.    Present were So Man-sul, vice-chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), and some 2,000 Korean youths and  students.    Pak Ku-ho, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the  League of Korean Youth in Japan, said in his report that the  April 19 popular uprising was a historical resistance which  demonstrated the indomitable fighting spirit of South Korean  youth, students and people who rose up for an independent and  national reunified country without flunkeyist traitors.    "The noble desire of the April 19 martyrs, youth and  students  and people has been ruthlessly trampled upon owing to the crimes  of the U.S. imperialists and the flunkeyist traitor Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique", he said, and evinced their resolve to make every  possible effort for the convocation of a national conference  proposed by the joint meeting of the government, political  parties and public organisations of the DPRK on April 11.    Representatives of youth and Japanese friends made speeches.    At the end of the meeting, the participants staged a  demonstration.</p>

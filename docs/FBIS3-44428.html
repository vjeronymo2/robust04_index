He said prisons and rehabilitation centers are not only  places where criminals are punished, but also places where they  are reformed and re-educated.    "They offer a special kind of education," said the minister  at a national conference of judicial officials, which opened  today.    The minister said that criminals should be taught both to be  law- abiding working people and people useful to the socialist  market economy.    There were 300,000 inmates in China's prisons and  reform-through- labor centers in 1993, he said.    Fewer than 0.12 percent of inmates escaped from prisons and  fewer than 1 percent from reform centers in the first 11 months  of last year, the minister said.    In recent years some major changes have occurred in the  composition of prisoners, he said. Prisoners involved in  criminal cases and economic cases are on the rise, and there are  more offenders who are juveniles or former public employees, he  said.    The minister asked that a network be set up within three to  five years to help to offer jobs to people who have finished  their sentences.    The prisons and reform-through-labor centers should be more  open in terms of management, he said. The inmates should have  more contacts with society, he added.</p>

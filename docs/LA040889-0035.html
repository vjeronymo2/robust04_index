			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND JAPAN REACH TENTATIVE FSX ACCORD  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and the Japanese government have agreed in principle on  a compromise in their dispute over the proposed joint development of an  advanced FSX fighter plane and hope to have details ironed out early next week,  U.S. officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The terms, which strategists say have been approved generally by President Bush  and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, include agreement for U.S. firms  to garner "about 40%" of the production work involved in the plane, rather than  merely sharing in the development phase.  </P> <P> The accord also calls for the United States to have access, free of charge, to  any new technology that Japan develops under the project as a result of U.S.  technology. Washington would also be able to buy any new technology that Japan  develops from scratch.  </P> <P> The deal on the fighter jet, which is to be patterned after the American F-16,  is unusual because it not only reflects traditional U.S. concerns about sharing  of sensitive American military technology, but also this country's interest in  making certain that Americans have access to any new technology developed by  its partner.  </P> <P> Even though Japan has not developed any major military aircraft on its own  since World War II, American officials recognize that Japanese technological  capability is so sophisticated that it could easily develop breakthroughs.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that the White House hopes to work out enough details this  weekend to make possible a formal exchange of letters confirming the terms  early next week, in time to present the deal to Congress before House hearings  scheduled for Wednesday.  </P> <P> If Congress agrees with the changes, it could mean an end to internal wrangling  that has surrounded the FSX issue and head off any souring of U.S.-Japanese  relations over the agreement, an eventuality some analysts feared could spread  to political issues as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modest Victory  </P> <P> U.S. officials described the compromise as a modest but important victory for  the Administration in its effort to tighten the guarantees in the original  accord.  </P> <P> The Ronald Reagan Administration had closed the FSX deal with Japan last  November after 18 months of negotiations between the Defense and State  departments and their counterpart ministries in Japan. Both sides declared the  resulting agreement fair.  </P> <P> However, almost immediately after the details were disclosed, Bush  Administration economic officials raised objections, arguing that it would  "give away" U.S. technology and hand Japan the wherewithal to start a civilian  aircraft industry.  </P> <P> Congress also entered the picture, with lawmakers threatening to block the  accord unless the Administration demanded that Japan guarantee the United  States a share of the production work on the plane and increased safeguards for  American technology.  </P> <P> Japan has been slow to respond to the U.S. demands, partly because Takeshita  and other high officials have been tied up coping with the Recruit financial  scandal in Japan.  </P></p>

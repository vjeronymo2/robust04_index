			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Watchdog seeks views on power pool proposals Offer, the electricity regulator, has started formal consultations on making what would be the most significant changes to the power trading system in England and Wales since privatisation four years ago. It is seeking the industry's views on changing the bidding mechanism by which prices are determined in the electricity pool, where virtually all electricity is traded. Offer also wants opinions on allowing electricity companies to trade outside the pool for the first time. Either change would have significant implications for power companies' profits and, to a lesser extent, for their customers. Some industrial users have suffered significant power price rises since privatisation, although the industry insists that they are a minority. Progress of the changes would be closely monitored by the dozens of other countries that are following the UK's example in privatising power, albeit in different ways in almost all cases. Consideration of change in the England and Wales trading system follows criticism that it is too complex and open to manipulation by National Power and PowerGen, the two largest generators. In a consultation document Offer says that in many respects the pool has worked well, ensuring that electricity demands have been met and bills paid. Yet it notes that if trading were allowed outside the pool, individual generators and customers could develop more efficient or less uncertain patterns of running plant and pricing electricity. Trading outside the pool could be less complex and time-consuming. Giving participants a choice of trading arrangements would also give the pool greater incentive to reform and cut costs to a minimum, Offer suggests. The document also notes that it could be argued that this change would make it easier for generators to influence prices. A thinner market might lead to greater uncertainty for the market as a whole, it adds. In the pool itself, Offer wants the market to consider a system by which generators would be paid the prices they bid for each generating plant. Under existing arrangements generators are paid the marginal price - the price bid for the most expensive plant needed to run the system. Supporters of the suggested bid system argue that prices would be less dependent on the bidding strategies of a few generators and less sensitive to the pool's price-setting software. Offer notes, however, that the suggested system could lead to flatter pool prices. This could reduce incentives to manage demand.</p>

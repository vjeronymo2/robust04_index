			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Incentives 'too small to boost training' YOUNG PEOPLE often are reluctant to pursue vocational training because the financial rewards are too small, according to a report published today by the London School of Economics, Lisa Wood writes. The report said pay differentials between unskilled workers and those with low-level vocational qualifications were slim, although people with degrees or high-level vocational qualifications could command more pay. 'If wages remain high for low and unskilled jobs, why should any one bother to obtain further training?' the report said. The authors said differentials were often insufficient to make training worthwhile, so reluctance to pursue training was often perfectly rational. The report, paid for by BP, implies that employers over time should hold down pay rates of the unqualified and raise those of skilled workers. It could also be interpreted as suggesting that low-level vocational qualifications are not of a sufficiently high standard to warrant higher pay. Learning Should Pay.

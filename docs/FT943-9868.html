			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Free Trade Hall poised to become hotel Manchester's Free Trade Hall, originally the headquarters of the Anti-Corn Law League and currently the home of the Halle Orchestra, is set to become a luxury hotel. The city council, which owns the listed building, said yesterday that it would be turned into a 290-bedroom hotel, with a four to five-star rating, in a Pounds 30m development. Mr Graham Stringer, the council's leader, said: 'This will help to confirm our status as a major European city.' Central Manchester Development Corporation has yet to receive a planning application for the scheme, but has indicated hotel use is acceptable. The proposed scheme would retain the Italian-style, stone building's famous facade, and incorporate the statues on the rear elevation. Construction is expected to start early in 1996 when the Halle moves home to the nearby Pounds 42m International Concert Hall. The city council said the Free Trade Hall, built in 1856 on the site of the Peterloo Massacre, has always been a symbol of Manchester's drive for enterprise and social reform. It has played a leading role in the city's cultural, social and political life. Famous people who have spoken there include Charles Dickens, the explorer HM Stanley, and politicians such as Disraeli, Gladstone and Winston Churchill. The council said it had agreed heads of terms with La Sande North West, the development company. La Sande is at an advanced stage of discussions with Scotts Hotels Management, the UK subsidiary of Scotts Hospitality, the leading franchise holder of the Marriott hotel brand in the UK. US-based Marriotts would run the hotel as part of its UK expansion programme. Mr Stringer said Manchester needed hotel accommodation of the quality proposed for the scheme. He said it would bring valuable investment and jobs, and support the city's bid for the Commonwealth Games to be staged in the year 2002.</p>

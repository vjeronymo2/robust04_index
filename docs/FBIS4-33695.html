			<p>BFN     [Text] The Capois-La-Mort Organization has accused the  president-in-exile of the crime of high treason and of  complicity with the enemy. The organization calls on the Senate  of the Republic to rigorously apply the Constitution to its  maximum against Jean-Bertrand Aristide, accusing him of having  asked, on several occasions, for the occupation of his own  country by a foreign Army.    The Capois-La-Mort Organization demands the government set  in  motion public action against the president-in-exile, guilty,  according to the organization, of high treason and complicity  with the enemy.    The National Christian Democratic Party, PDCH, reasserts its  opposition to the physical return of President Aristide to Haiti  and expresses indignation about the latest statements by the  priest/president. PDCH calls those statements murderous. PDCH of  the late Sylvio Claude, led by Joachin Pierre, asks the  concerned institutions, especially the Haitian parliament, to  assume their responsibilities lest the institutions be  questioned in the court of history.</p>

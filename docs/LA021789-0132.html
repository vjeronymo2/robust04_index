			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OKLAHOMA PRESS CALLS FOR SWITZER'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> The University of Oklahoma student newspaper and the state's three largest  publications are all saying it's time for football Coach Barry Switzer to  resign.  </P> <P> The Daily Oklahoman reiterated what it said in 1982, that Switzer should quit.  The Oklahoma City newspaper cited the recent arrests of five football players  on various felony charges, including rape and drug dealing, in its editorial.  </P> <P> "Other newspapers have recently called for Switzer's ouster. We didn't bother  this time," the Oklahoman said. "We called for that more than six years ago  before the football program's troubles turned to probation, shooting, alleged  rape and suspected drug dealing. . . .  </P> <P> "Switzer has never set the best of examples in his personal life."  </P> <P> The Oklahoma Daily, the university's student newspaper, directed an editorial  at Switzer: "Now that you've let any kind of positive attraction to your  program become a fading dream, you are helping no one. Take responsibility for  your department or resign."  </P> <P> The Tulsa World, the state's second-largest newspaper, called for both Switzer  and Athletic Director Donnie Duncan to resign. And the Tulsa Tribune earlier  called for Switzer's resignation.  </P></p>

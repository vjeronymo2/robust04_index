			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At a session chaired by Mirko Marjanovic, the  Government of the Republic of Serbia concluded that the stable  conditions for economic activity have been successfully  maintained in the three and a half months since the beginning of  the implementation of the economic program. The exchange rate  of the dinar is unchanged and is accompanied by a gradual  increase in foreign exchange reserves and industrial output,  which was up 2.7 percent in April.    The deficit in the republican budget is being reduced, as is  total public expenditure. Average wages and other earnings have  increased in real terms. In the first two weeks of May there  was a slight increase in retail prices and the prices of  agricultural products at vegetable markets.    Accepting the report on the results achieved in the  implementation of the program of reconstruction of the monetary  system and the strategy of economic recovery of Yugoslavia, the  government concluded that the faster adaptation of companies and  banks to the requirements of the market, the strengthening of  financial discipline and legal security, the elimination of  illegal financial transactions, and the rationalization in the  sphere of public spending are of key importance in the second  stage of the program's implementation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin article: "Moscow's Absurd Game with NATO </F> Will Open the Bloc's Doors to East Europe and the Baltic"]    [Text] The Partnership for Peace [PFP] program was an act  of courtesy to Russia on the part of the West. Why has this  been forgotten in Russia? "The process of drafting a joint  Russian-NATO document be dragged out for months or even years,"  a high-ranking Russian diplomat told IZVESTIYA.    If that happens, there is little chance of signing a  document: The closer the presidential elections come, the less  desire there will be to establish partnership relations with  NATO. Will Defense Minister Pavel Grachev drop a hint to the  NATO members about this? He is awaited in Brussels, where they  hope he will finally be able to explain to the North Americans  and West Europeans what it is Russia wants from NATO. Although  it does not seem that Moscow itself knows the answer to that  question.    "The signing of the Partnership for Peace program is  secondary to Moscow," the Russian diplomat explained to  IZVESTIYA. "The establishment of new relations with NATO in the  political sphere and the recognition of Russia's special role on  the continent and its right to influence decisionmaking are  primary. NATO appreciates what has caused the delay in signing  the Partnership for Peace document and is not putting pressure  on us...."    NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which has provoked a  storm of objections in the Russian political world, emerged as a  result of a request (not to say a demand) from Moscow that the  East European and Baltic states not be admitted to NATO. At the  end of last year this was a very important task for Russian  diplomacy on the European plane.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel invited Andrey Kozyrev  back to his own home in order to explain to him in an unofficial  setting that all Moscow's former satellites wanted to join NATO  and that NATO had no grounds whatsoever for refusing them. What  did Moscow want from the West?    Russia's vigorous diplomacy was crowned with the utter  humiliation of East Europe and the Baltic states: At the  top-level NATO forum in January the latter were not admitted to  the North Atlantic bloc. Mindful here of Russia's interests,  the Americans devised Partnership for Peace, a vacuous program  which binds no one to anything. The lofty words uttered at the  time about "the importance of the first move" were only going to  fool the greenhorns.    Only a few months have now passed, and Moscow, forgetting  this background, is making complaints to the Americans and West  Europeans: How dare you try to foist such a document on a great  military power, a document which has been signed by the likes of  Albania, Georgia, Lithuania, and other minor states?    The games being played over Partnership for Peace are the  result, first, of a knee-jerk desire on the part of the  opposition to reject anything proposed by the president and  government, and, second, an atavistic hatred and fear of NATO.    The opposition refuses to understand here that the United  States signed the same treaty establishing NATO in 1949 as  Belgium or the Netherlands. However, this formal parity changes  nothing as regards the correlation of real political weight and  is forgotten when decisions are made. The vagueness of the NATO  program is offensive to the East Europeans but convenient to  Russia: You can negotiate about whatever you like.    Cynically speaking, in the whole East European area NATO is  really interested only in building relations with Russia. Our  country's participation or nonparticipation in the Partnership  for Peace program changes nothing in that regard.    However, an ostentation reluctance to sign the program will  have one obvious consequence: East Europe and the Baltic states  will obtain yet another indisputable argument in their struggle  to gain a NATO membership card. The readiness of above all the  United States and Germany to oppose their pressure is in inverse  proportion to Moscow's anti-NATO game.</p>

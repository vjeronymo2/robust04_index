			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (2): Quiet grumbles among the partners - Politics: critics argue the nation has a stage-managed parliamentary democracy POLITICS, Singaporean style, is,most of the time, a well organised gentlemanly affair, based upon consensus anda tried and tested partnership between government, private sector and unions where meritocracy usually triumphs. Critics argue that Singapore is a stable, stage-managed parliamentary democracy. Although elections are held at least once every five years, and there are more than 20 registered political parties, the near total dominance of the ruling People's Action Party and its cadre of carefully screened and selected MPs provides little room for real opposition. It is, say its critics, effectively a one-party state and likely to remain so unless the next elections, due by the end of 1993, provide an unexpected upset. With a growing economy, full employment and relatively harmonious race relations there is little open evidence of discontent, although opposition figuresclaim there is much quiet grumbling - quiet because of 'fear of speaking out openly against the PAP.' One or two Singaporeans voice concern about 'excessive controls, rules and regulations' and the Singaporean government's paternalistic attitude towards its citizens, but for the most part criticism is muted. Mr Goh Chok Tong, succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister last November in a clockwork-like transition which epitomises Singaporean political efficiency. He knows the next elections and his government's and the economy's performance ahead of them, will be a crucial test for him and the PAP. 'My primary focus in the next two years is domestic politics. I want to win the next elections as prime minister. If I don't get that right, the rest doesn't follow,' he says. 'I can only do so by showing Singaporeans that I have made a difference to their lives, I've made their lives better.' Only at the ballot box will it be possible to gauge how successful his promised new style of more open, consultative and 'gentler' government has been. Mr Goh knows he faces some formidable challenges. Although his transitional team has been in place since the mid-1980s, he has inherited a party and political structure still largely controlled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew who, aside from being senior minister inside the Goh cabinet, remains secretary-general of the PAP. This is a party formed and molded by an older generation of leaders steeped in the battles of the 1950s and1960s against colonialism and the threat of communism. Even today, with communism in retreat throughout the region, PAP leaders still paint a picture ofa precariously vulnerable Singapore, a Singapore which is 'fighting for survival and trying to be a nation'. In the early days, Mr Goh likens Singapore to 'refugees on a small sampan', which needed 'a strong captain'. Now he says Singapore is 'more like perhaps a trawler or a hovercraft going at high speed. There's more room for the people to move around on board. At the same time, the boat can capsize if you don't control their movements because if there are fights on board, the boat can still capsize.' There is evidence that Mr Goh's second generation team is indeed cautiously accepting the inevitability of limited change. While rejecting the term liberalisation he has beguna gradual movement towards decentralisation and greater individual decision-making - provided basic core Singaporean values, recently laid out in a five-pointset of 'shared values', are still adhered too. Among recent actions hehas instituted town councils, chaired by local MPs who are empowered to run Singapore's numerous housing estates. This is a small step in power devolution, perhaps equally importantly it forces MPs with little or no feel for the grassroots, to talk with, rather than down to their constituents. While Mr Goh saysSingapore is emphatically not heading towards the creation of a western-style welfare state, he says 'we are looking for schemes which can add to this compassionate side of a competitive society.' There is a new emphasis on the arts, film censorship rules are also being eased, albeit cautiously, and it is likely that Singaporeans will be allowed greater access to the foreign media including television. The Goh team has, say western diplomats, actively encouraged more lively parliamentary debates and even constructive criticism. Such moves are largely dismissed by the Government's critics such as Mr Chiam See Tong, amember of the Singapore Democratic Party and the one elected opposition member of parliament, who allege that parliamentary debates still resemble boring orchestrated puppet shows. He argues the changes made so far are cosmetic rather than real. Mr Goh and his new team recognise that most Singaporeans are increasingly well educated and travel and they cannot be totally insulated from outside, often western, influences. He also appears to have taken on board that Singapore, chronically short of labour, cannot afford to lose those mostly well-qualified academics, professionals and others who vote with their feet each year and leave Singapore for new lives in Australia, Canada and elsewhere. As a recent Singapore Straits Times investigation showed, few are inclinedto return in the current political atmosphere. More fundamental political and social changes may therefore eventually be necessary. Singapore is however unlikely to become a western-style open democracy. Other factors mitigate against any rapid change. As the prime minister acknowledges, the PAP, as a mass party is relatively small. Nevertheless, in the last general elections in 1988 almost 40 per cent of the electorate did not vote for the PAP. Prime Minister Goh and others accept this was a protest vote to some extent by people who were unhappy with some of the governments more contentious decisions. Although the swing against the PAP in the last elections was much smaller than the 12.6 per cent swing against the party in the 1984 elections, PAP leaders, including Mr Goh recognise the slide in the popular vote must be halted. If the PAP's popular vote were to drop below 55 per cent Mr Goh admits the Singaporean politics could become unstable. The 1988 general election produced one single elected opposition MP in the 81-seat parliament, and two co-opted non-constituency members, both from the Workers' Party, Dr Lee Siew-Choh and thesince disqualified Mr J B Jeyaretnam. There is no real opposition in parliament. Mr Chiam, who has increased his share of the popular vote in each election he has contested, naturally expresses disappointment over his party's past electoral performances. In the next general elections he is hoping, probably against all odds, for 'between five and 10 seats'. That he says would give the opposition in parliament 'a viable base.' Like Dr Lee Siew-Choh he is a fierce critic of PAP tactics at election time. 'The opposition is not really given a fighting chance. In Singapore, anyone who comes out and opposes the PAP openly faces the use of all of the government apparatus against them,' he says. Every aspect of private life 'is put under the microscope.' That, he claims, makes it very difficult to find good opposition candidates. Such charges are denied by the PAP leadership which argues instead that the opposition parties lack any real viable alternative programmes. 'We don't think there will be a big role, (for an opposition party)' says Mr Goh, 'The fact they want to be outside, they want to question the government, that's all right. That is their role. We allow it. We are not trying to eliminate them entirely.' Some believe a more vigorous opposition may one day emerge within the PAP. Suggestions of a potential split are played down by Mr Goh and other PAPstalwarts. Even opposition MP Mr Chiam See Tong concedes, there is unlikely to be a PAP split while Mr Lee Kuan Yew, still seen even by his most ardent critics as the 'father of the nation' is 'on the scene.' Mr Lee Kuan Yew retains a powerful political voice - a voice that could be enhanced should he decide to stand for the newly created post of elected president, something he has only ruled out for the first elections. Asked whether the former prime minister is still pulling the real power strings Mr Goh replies: 'No he is an influential figure. To say that he pulls the strings would be unfair to him, would be unfair to me and to my colleagues. But to say he is an influential figure in the team, I would not deny it.' He is also more than willing to tackle the potentially equally thorny question of his succession. He makes no secret of his desire to step aside after 10 years, and that Mr BG Lee Hsien Loong, the former prime minister's son and now first deputy prime minister is one obvious successor. 'We are already looking for them (the new team now) I am trying to prepare a team that can take Singapore into the next century.'</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Officials strain at finance ministry leash: Bureaucrats at loggerheads over Japanese rules for investing public funds The Y1,374bn (Pounds 9bn) foreign exchange loss on Japan's postal ministry investments highlights the conflict between the finance ministry and other ministries over the management of investment funds. The postal ministry wants to hedge its foreign assets by using currency futures and options and blame their unrealised foreign exchange losses on legislation which prohibits the use of such financial instruments. Fund managers of the Y72,300bn postal insurance also want legal changes which will allow them to invest in property. They argue that current weak conditions in the property market make it suitable for investment. And the postal ministry wants to diversify investments into corporate lending aside from the conventional stocks, bonds and deposits. This has met loud opposition from the commercial banks, since it would hurt lending to companies which is already dwindling because of faltering demand stemming from the sluggish economy. The postal ministry is joined by the health and welfare ministry in fighting for more autonomy over investments of funds totalling more than Y350,000bn collected through the state pension system - over which the health and welfare ministry holds jurisdiction. The finance ministry lays down rules about how such funds are to be invested in order to maintain 'prudent' fund management. However, the two ministries claim that in order to maximise returns, the funds need to be managed more efficiently through diversified investments. The health and welfare ministry wants to raise investment returns ahead of the surge in state pension receipts at the turn of the century. It is demanding that limits on investments - 50 per cent of the funds must be invested into bonds, while stocks and foreign assets cannot exceed 30 per cent - be eased. Ministry officials also want to hire investment advisers, including European and US fund managers, to manage the funds. Currently, funds are allocated to 14 life assurers and 15 trust banks, with one institution managing as much as Y2,000bn. The US government has long been pushing for similar changes since it would mean greater opportunities for US fund managers. The finance ministry officials argue that high risk investments such as stocks, in which investment advisers hold high expertise, could lead to losses and hence hurt the policy holder. The health ministry wants to manage its funds directly instead of the current arrangement, whereby the bulk of the Y100,000bn state pension fund reserves are funnelled into low-interest loans for public works and the health ministry borrows Y20,000bn from the finance ministry to invest in financial instruments deemed suitable by law.</p>

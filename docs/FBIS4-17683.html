			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin: `Taxes Should </F> Not Be Detrimental to the Citizens.' Government Approves Basic  Spheres of Social Policy for 1994"]    [Text] The Russian Government has determined "the  stabilization of the living standard of Russian Federation  citizens, with its subsequent rise as the economy develops" as  the target of its social policy for 1994. This target has been  drawn up in a document adopted 21 April at a sitting of the  Russian Federation Government Presidium -- Main Guidelines of  the Russian Federation Government's Social Policy for 1994.    The document stresses that the "Russian Federation  Government  proceeds on the premise that a fruitful and considered social  policy is a vital condition for continuing reforms,  strengthening their social base, and improving the  sociopolitical situation in the country."    The following main guidelines of social policy for 1994 are  envisaged: the creation of economic and legal conditions to  give an incentive to the active, able-bodied section of society  to ensure its own prosperity through highly productive work;  support for optimum correlations between the income of the  active part of the population and disabled citizens; the  provision of basic social guarantees; and the prevention of mass  unemployment.    In order to put these aims into effect in 1994, the  government intends to concentrate its efforts on preventing a  reduction in the population's real monetary income, ensuring an  equitable balance of economic interests and material  possibilities of hired workers, entrepreneurs, and disabled  citizens...    Summing up the discussion, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that  the  reform of taxation, to which he attaches prime significance,  should be the key element in conducting policy in the social  sphere. According to him, taxes "should not be detrimental to  the citizens."    The government Presidium also examined the draft federal  program for assisting with job placements for the population in  1994, presented by the Federal Employment Service.    Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, chief of the  Federal Employment Service, noted that its activity will mainly  extend to able-bodied citizens who have work, but are at risk of  losing it, as well as to those who are unemployed and are  registered at the organs of the state employment service.    Potential "partial" unemployment during 1994 is put at  between 5 million and 8 million people. Fedor Prokopov also  predicts that the risk of citizens' losing their jobs will be  increased -- the total number of workers who will be released  from their jobs in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. The work force  supply on the labor market will also grow; the number of  citizens who do not have work or have lost it, and are seeking  work, will exceed 12 million people.    In the sphere of economic support for employment, the  government intends to curb the cutback of economically expedient  posts and those posts which are promising for the long term, and  promote the growth of investment activity which creates new  posts.    According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, job-placement measures for  graduates of schools and higher educational establishments have  been insufficiently thought through in the program, and  investment programs in whose implementation the unemployed could  be involved fully or partially have not been taken into  consideration. A government commission headed by Vice Premier  Yuriy Yarov has been created for further work on the federal  program.</p>

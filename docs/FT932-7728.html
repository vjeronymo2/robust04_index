			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: More pressure on the D-Mark THE weakening of the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism continued to occupy dealers' minds yesterday, with sterling and the French franc performing strongly against the German currency, writes James Blitz. Although the Bundesbank decided not to ease any of its official rates this week, the behaviour of market practitioners and central bankers might have led outsiders to believe that there had been a significant policy easing in Germany. Yesterday, Ireland and Italy joined the growing band of European countries who have lowered official interest rates in the wake of the Danish referendum result - and in spite of the unchanged Bundesbank discount rate. Their ability to ease policy was justified by the fact that no European currency has weakened against the D-Mark in the wake of these moves. Yesterday, the Italian lira closed at L910 to the D-Mark from a previous L914.9. The Irish punt stayed firmly at the top of the hard core of countries in the ERM grid. However, the two most significant movers in Europe yesterday were currencies whose central banks have left policy unchanged. The French franc closed little altered, but again broke down through the FFr3.37 per D-Mark barrier earlier in the day. The French currency's strength is that its central bank has replenished the reserves used when defending its position in the ERM. Sterling was also the beneficiary of powerful inflows of funds, convincingly breaking through the DM2.50 barrier and ending in London at DM2.5100, its highest finish since January 13. The pound benefited from the third consecutive drop in the UK unemployment figures, which took the market by surprise. The dollar weakened moderately against the D-Mark yesterday, following a powerful performance earlier in the week. It closed a pfennig down at DM1.6135 in London, but it improved a little in New York to end at DM1.6155. Although the D-Mark remains third from bottom of the ERM grid, a sharp fall in its EMS divergence indicator - from minus 3 percentage points to minus 17 percentage points in the last three days - testifies to its weakness. Thus far, the Italian lira has probably benefited more than most from that weakness. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, believes that the lira now looks tired, and that Scandinavian currencies may be the next beneficiaries of asset reallocation. He points out that the European Community's finance ministers are meeting in Denmark today and that a possible subject of discussion will be the repegging of the Swedish krone and Finnish markka to the D-Mark. The Swedish krone has been devalued by 20 per cent since its decoupling from the Ecu last year, and the markka by 19 per cent.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (19): Not so obscure objects of desire - Watches There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. WATCHES come in all shades of geometry - round, oval, square, oblong, even the Daliesque squashed ellipse of the Cartier 'crash' watch. Yet at the 250-year-old company of Blancpain, watches have always been round. The shape is the most obvious statement of Blancpain's claim to be perhaps the most traditional of all the great Swiss watch makers. Its timepieces are also always mechanical. 'Quartz' is a word never heard at their workshop in the Jura mountains. All this makes a Blancpain essential for the self-assured businessman who abhors designer labels but whose discreet brand of anonymity marks him out as surely as a screaming logo. But even the greatest traditionalist must reconcile himself to modern technology in the interest of accuracy. Even Blancpain's longest-serving craftsmen acquaint themselves with the latest methods and materials. A small factory makes, from the most high-tech materials, components for what passes at Blancpain as a mass-produced model - although even this is hand-assembled. This watch, costing more than Pounds 2,000, makes up most of the tiny annual output of 7,000 watches a year, but it is the company's recent mould-breaking horological masterpieces that have established its reputation and attracted clients such as former King Constantine of Greece. Blancpain's latest venture may seem out of character but it allies craft and tradition to a clever marketing ploy. The company has revived the lost art of the erotic watch. An erotic design is engraved or enamelled, with the mechanics for the - er - moving parts housed in the slim case with the watch movement. All this activity takes place on the watch's reverse. The face it presents to the world is Blancpain's usual discreet roundel.</p>

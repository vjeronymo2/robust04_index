			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Saab reduces losses to SKr138m SAAB Automobile, the Swedish car group jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Saab-Scania, showed the benefits of restructuring and cost-cutting when it announced a sharp reduction in first-quarter losses yesterday. The company's deficit fell to SKr138m (Dollars 18.6m) from SKr293m in the same 1992 period as revenues rose to SKr3.99bn from SKr3.9bn. The company said it was starting to see the effects of a drive to cut costs across all parts of its business. However, Saab noted that it would only begin to feel the benefits of last year's programme to cut 2,000 jobs to save SKr2bn in the second half of the year.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Man of destiny Given that the cost of the Channel Tunnel, Britain's biggest-ever private sector project, has overrun by more than 60 per cent and the opening date has already been put back twice, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel, may seem an odd choice to head up the new government working committee on private finance. Sir Alastair freely admits that if Eurotunnel were to start again in building the Channel Tunnel he would do it differently. Indeed, he says it is precisely because he has learnt a lot of lessons of what not to do that he argues he is so well suited to take on his latest job promoting private finance in public sector projects. Full marks for honesty.</p>

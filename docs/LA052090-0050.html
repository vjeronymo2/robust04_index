			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'PEAKS' AND VALLEYS  </P> <P> David Lynch has been quoted as saying that "Twin Peaks" is like "Peyton Place"  meets "Blue Velvet." On that, I have to agree, for like its apparent  progenitors, "Twin Peaks" is long, ponderous and pretentious.  </P> <P> But adventurous or unprecedented? Hardly. "Quantum Leap" already handled a  similar murder mystery -- complete with the clues-in-the-home-movie gimmick --  and told a much more interesting story along the way.  </P> <P> Of course, Lynch has always seemed more impressed with the sizzle than the  steak, which explains the showUs quirky photography, gratuitous morbidity and  music that sounds like cowboy junkies on Valium. Beyond all that, however,  "Twin Peaks" is nothing more than a garden-variety soap opera. And that, you  should pardon the expression, has been done to death.  </P> <P> Chris Peterson, Yorba Linda  </P></p>

According to People's Deputy Mykola Biloblotskyy, a  deficit-free budget reminds one of a book with a nice cover, but  without the equivalent content. People's Deputy Mykola Naumenko  proposed that the 14 trillion karbovantsi, which he predicts  will be the deficit of the pension fund in 1994, be transferred  to the budget. "It is about financing the superstructure of the  state, said people's deputy Ruslan Bodelan. Compared to 1993,  expenditure on defense is being increased by 5.82 times, on law  enforcement bodies by 6.88 times, on bodies of legislative  authority by 17 times, and executive authority by almost 6  times. However, it is planned to increase expenditure on social  protection only by 2.28 times."    Many deputies spoke about a concealed defecit, which is  being  transferred to local budgets, and about the reduction of  expenditure on the needs of Chernobyl sufferers. Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, called on  deputies "not to fear administrative measures."    The Supreme Council adopted a resolution "On the plan for  the  economic and social development of Ukraine for 1994," which  confirms the fundamental indicators of the plan, and establishes  the personal responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers and  other executive bodies for their implementation. The Cabinet of  Ministers is obliged to report to the Supreme Council every  quarter on the implementation of this plan.    The people's deputies voted on the law "On the state budget  of Ukraine for 1994" four times, but it did not get the required  number of votes. Amendments and additions to many legislative  acts were made, in particular to the Criminal Code and Code of  Criminal Practice of Ukraine, regarding economic crimes,  deliberate tax evasion, currency regulation, and currency  control, and also to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers on  issues of customs regulation, to the Customs Code of Ukraine,  and to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers "On the procedure  for imposing customs duty on objects being taken out of the  country." A resolution was adopted, "on a list of goods subject  to excise duty," and others.    Plenary sittings of the Supreme Council will continue on 1  February.</p>

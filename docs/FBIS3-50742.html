These statements were made following publication of an  edition of the U.S. newspaper THE NEW HERALD, in which an  official of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras warned investors about  the risks of investing in Honduras due to a disrespect for the  law. Chahin expressed his surprise over the publication since  U.S. authorities have spoken "highly" of Honduras following the  approval of the Copyright Law. However, Chahin said, the problem  now is that illegal expropriations "leave a lot to be desired  from the Honduran legal system, which makes me very sorry.  Therefore, I must tell the next legal authorities so that they  will be punctual and legalistic."    Chahin regretted that situations of this type tarnish the  level of competitiveness Honduras offers to foreign investors by  having the least expensive manual labor in Central America. In  Honduras, one minute of work only costs nine cents, while in  other countries, such as Costa Rica, it costs about 13.5 cents.  Chahin added, "We are efficient and competitive, our assembly  plants have the highest quality in the area, and we have the  cheapest food staples. The only aspect we do not handle very  well is bank interest rates because of the high legal cost."    Chahin noted that situations of this type jeopardize  Honduras' benefits in the Generalized System of Preferences,  under which over $100-million worth of products are exported  annually to the United States.</p>

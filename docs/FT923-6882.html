			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Closure of mines brought forward BRITISH COAL is to bring forward closure of two pits in south Wales, employing nearly 500 miners, leaving just one colliery in the area. Miners and union officials at Betws colliery near Ammanford, Dyfed, and Taff Merthyr pit at Trelewis, Mid Glamorgan, have been told their jobs will go in the next few months. Plans to develop coalfaces have been cancelled for commercial and geological reasons. Taff Merthyr, employing 370 men, had been expected to remain open until after next spring, but has been affected by severe underground problems. Betws drift mine, opened in 1978, has 95 miners. It is now scheduled to close early next year instead of in October next year. The two closures will leave Tower colliery at Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan, as the only working south Wales pit, employing 370 men.</p>

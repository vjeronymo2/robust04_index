			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Vaganov report under the Forum" rubric: "Chemical </F> Arms Should be Destroyed. The Whole Question Is How, Where,  When?"]    [Text] The International Conference on Chemical  Disarmament is winding up its work in Moscow today. Its  organizers are the Committee for Conventional Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation  president, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. This is the  second such international meeting since Russia signed the  convention banning chemical weapons in Paris a little more than  a year ago. As of today the convention has been ratified by  five states -- Sweden, Norway, Fiji, Mauritius, and the  Seychelles. In order to go into effect the convention should be  ratified by at least 65 states (this is expected to happen this  summer).    In the words of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who spoke  at  the conference and who until recently chaired the Committee for  Conventional Problems, it was clear right from the start that  implementation of the convention posed Russia a number of  difficulties, primarily economic ones. Russia, nevertheless,  intends precisely to act on its obligations. Our country's  withdrawal from the convention would in fact mean scrapping the  convention, with tragic consequences for all humanity.    Academician Kuntsevich also stated for the first time that  Russia, without waiting for the convention to go into force, had  already started unilaterally converting to other uses the  available technical potential for the production of chemical  weapons (this in particular true about the facilities in  Volgograd Oblast). The equipment has been partially destroyed  and scrapped at factories producing the saman and sorin toxic  agents.    The keynote of many reports at the conference was the need  to  reach a public and federal accord on the destruction of chemical  weapons in Russia.</p>

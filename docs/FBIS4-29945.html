			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ROK Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong by an </F> unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not  given]    [Text] Although the South Korean economy was in the  doldrums in recent years because of weak domestic demand,  increased capital investment and other factors are accelerating  the pace of economic recovery. South Korea's real gross  national product (GNP) increased to 8.8 percent in the  January-March 1994 period (compared to the corresponding period  of 1993), which is the highest growth since the April-June 1991  period. Now, some people express anxiety about the possibility  that the economy might overheat and inflation would surge. On  the other hand, South Korea is urged to open and liberalize its  markets in connection with its bid to become a member of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in  1996. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN recently interviewed ROK Finance  Minister Hong Chae-hyong on the current state of the South  Korean economy and its prospects.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the current state of the  economy?    [Hong] The South Korean economy hit the bottom in January  1993. Since then it has been reviving. It is continuing its  growth this year as well. Such sectors as production, exports,  and investment are all expanding. The annual economic growth in  1994 will be about 7.5 to 8 percent.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the economy is in  danger of overheating?    [Hong] An 8-percent economic growth may be too high for a  single year. But because we registered low growth in 1992 and  1993, I think the figure is appropriate. Although some are  worried about possible overheating of the economy because of a  high production- line operating rate in the manufacturing  industry, there are no signs of the economy overheating. It is  not time for the government to adopt a policy to slow down the  economic recovery. We will administer economic affairs in such  a way that the nation can maintain a stable economic growth.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about price behavior?    [Hong] I believe the government can achieve its goal of  pushing up consumer prices by 6 percent. But it has to steer  economic affairs while being mindful of next year's consumer  prices. We must observe price behavior with the greatest  interest.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Last year, your country earned a  surplus on the current account balance of payments for the first  time in four years. But because of increased imports in the  process of economic recovery, it has again shown a downward  trend.    [Hong] Although exports are steadily growing, an increase in  imports exceeds it due to the expanding import of capital goods.  Imports will continue to increase because of the economic  recovery. But if an increase in the import of capital goods  leads to an increase in exports, this year's current account  balance of payments will be in balance. Or it will close with a  small deficit of about $1 billion or $1.5 billion.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] South Korea plans to become an OECD  member in late 1996.    [Hong] The objective is for the country to play its role and  assume its responsibility in the international community, now  that the South Korean economy has grown. OECD membership will  help improve ROK's position in the international community and  enable the country to actively participate in creating a world's  economic order. Seoul has promoted the internationalization of  its economy and the opening up of its markets. In the financial  sector, it has been implementing the phased deregulation of  interest rates and the open market plan. I think conditions for  South Korea to become an OECD member have gradually been created.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that South Korean  financial institutions are less competitive compared to those in  developed nations. Do you not think they will face business  difficulties if the market is liberalized?    [Hong] That is possible. Even now, competition among South  Korean financial institutions is very severe. But if the market  is liberalized, customers will be offered better service. You  cannot stop moves toward opening the market. It is possible  that competition among banks will promote streamlining of  management and lead to lowered interest rates.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Expanding direct foreign investment  is also a major task for your country.    [Hong] On 10 June, the government compiled measures to  promote foreign capital inflow. They include easing regulations  concerning foreign affiliates' lending funds from foreign firms,  and simplifying investment procedures. I hope  technology-intensive industries will invest in our country.  These measures will be effective in facilitating industries'  structural reform and speeding up business ties between South  Korean enterprises and foreign companies. I strongly hope  Japanese parts makers will make inroads into the South Korean  markets.</p>

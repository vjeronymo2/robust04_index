			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- State-owned assets are  approaching 65 trillion won (89.6 billion U.S. dollars) in  value, according to a report by the Finance Ministry issued  Tuesday.    They were valued at 64.43 trillion won as of last year, up 4  percent or 2.47 trillion won from a year earlier.    Assets owned by the administrative agencies such as  government buildings, state-run or public schools and  corporations, increased 4.8 percent in value to 44.37 trillion  won.    Cultural assets, historic relics and other properties being  conserved amounted to 729.1 billion won (up 0.9 percent).    Land was valued at 32.73 trillion won, up 2.8 percent;  securities at 15.26 trillion won, up 2 percent; buildings at  7.04 trillion won, up 11.4 percent; and equipment at 6.21  trillion won, up 7.6 percent.    Trees stood at 1.96 trillion won, up 1.7 percent;  non-military ships and aircraft at 334.5 billion won, up 58  percent; and immaterial properties like patents at 51.5 billion  won, up 12.7 percent.    Machinery assets decreased 4.2 percent to 835.3 billion won  due to depreciation.    State assets and conserved properties are administered by 50  government agencies and miscellaneous assets by 15 cities and  districts, but the value of public assets such as cash, roads,  rivers and ports was not included as national assets as they are  difficult to estimate, the ministry said.</p>

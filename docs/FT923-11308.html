			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fail to rebuild confidence BOURSES failed to regain any confidence at the end of a troubled week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT took comfort from lower July inflation figures before being led down by the futures and options market. The DAX, which briefly advanced to 1,625, closed down 12.95 at 1,610.42, the lowest level since January and down 5.4 per cent on the week. At midsession the FAZ was 8.82 lower at 639.94 while turnover fell to DM4.9bn from DM6.1bn. BASF fell to DM211 before to closing down DM3.8 at DM216.9, following an analysts meeting at which the company gave a disappointing forecast for 1992 earnings. Other chemical stocks were also weaker with Hoechst losing DM3.9 to DM225.5. Elsewhere, Daimler shed DM5 to DM698 and Deutsche Bank lost DM7 to DM642.50. PARIS endured another volatile day before closing practically unchanged at the end of the July trading account. The CAC-40 index ended 0.06 higher at 1,734.62 in turnover of just under FFr2.4bn. The insurer Axa rose FFr28 or 3.7 per cent to FFr782 after saying that the provisions that its US subsidiary Equitable Life Assurance Society had made against its investment portfolio were adequate. Dealers detected some switching out of Total, down FFr2.70 to FFr227.60, into Elf, up FFr6.70 to FFr338.80. BSN eased fell FFr2 to FFr1,043 as first half sales came in line with expectations. Among smaller stocks, Hachette gained FFr6.8 or 6.5 per cent to FFr111.8 in light volume. MILAN closed lower as a half-hearted attempt to stage a recovery was overwhelmed by continued selling pressure. The Comit index fell 1.71 to 406.36, down 7.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at near Thursday's L99.2bn. Fiat closed L25 higher at L4,555 but news that the managing director of Fiat Ferroviaria Savigliano, its rolling stock subsidiary, had been arrested in connection with the Milan bribery scandal later knocked L100 off the share. Ifi, the Agnelli family's holding company, rose L270 to L9,930 in response to Thursday's earnings report, but then fell back to L9,650. AMSTERDAM awaited news of talks between the Dutch government and Dasa on the German group's purchase of a majority stake in Fokker. After the close the government announced that the takeover would go ahead. Fokker ended down 90 cents at Fl 28.60. The CBS Tendency index was off 0.9 at 115.3, for a 3.1 per cent fall on the week. One of the day's biggest losers was retailer KBB which declined Fl 6.80, or 8.9 per cent to Fl 64.20 after forecasting weaker first half earnings. VIENNA continued its downward trend with the 18-share ATX index falling 23.3 to 771.06, down 9 per cent on the week. Wienerberger remained active after Thursday's disappointing first half results.

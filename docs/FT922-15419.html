			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Stepping away from Whitehall: A bold and widely-criticised initiative to survive THE Transport Research Laboratory, the Planning Inspectorate and the Public Records Office are among 15 bodies which are today launched as executive agencies - free-standing organisations charged with delivering government services. They join 57 existing agencies which range from the Benefits Agency with 63,000 staff, responsible for paying social security benefits to more than 12m people, to the Wilton Park conference centre whose 30 employees organise high-level conferences for diplomats at Wiston House in West Sussex. At the same time, the Inland Revenue is reorganising its 62,000 staff into 34 'executive offices', each headed by a controller with considerable autonomy, with the aim of improving services to taxpayers. A similar reorganisation last year divided the 26,800-strong Customs and Excise into 30 'executive units'. With today's new recruits, about 290,000 civil servants will be employed in executive agencies or their equivalents - more than half the Civil Service. A further 27 agencies, employing more than 66,000 civil servants, are on the launch pad, including the Prison Service and the Ministry of Defence Police. Described by the prime minister as 'nothing less than a revolution in management in the Civil Service', the creation of agencies was recommended in 1988 by the government's efficiency adviser at the time, Sir Robin Ibbs. He said in his Next Steps report that the work of government departments should be focused much more on the job to be done if services were to be effectively delivered. He recommended that responsibility for specific government activities should be devolved to arms-length organisations headed by a chief executive responsible to a minister, but with considerable freedom of operation to achieve performance targets. Mrs Thatcher enthusiastically endorsed the Next Steps approach, and appointed as project manager the ebullient Sir Peter Kemp, a career civil servant with permanent-secretary status. The first agency - the Vehicle Inspectorate - was launched in August 1988 and a model rapidly evolved which could be applied to a wide variety of activities: Each agency is governed by a framework agreement, which spells out managerial responsibilities and sets targets for greater efficiency and improvements in customer service. A chief executive is appointed by open competition to be accountable for the agency to ministers and to parliament - more than a third have come from the private sector. Customers are offered new and improved services, ranging from better complaints procedures to new products, more convenient opening hours and 'value-added services,' which provide extras to those prepared to pay for them. The agency approach has gathered support from across the political spectrum, with the influential Treasury and Civil Service select committee providing all-party endorsement of Next Steps. And the effect has been considerable in some parts of Whitehall: the department of social security, for example, has hived off most of its functions to three agencies, leaving just 1,200 of the 76,000 staff in the policy-making rump department. There have also been some notable improvements in efficiency. Companies House has increased productivity by 17 per cent in two years, cutting from 25 days to seven the time taken to record new companies. The Passport Agency has reduced the average time to process correct applications from three and a half weeks to seven days. The Vehicle Inspectorate achieved efficiency savings of 8.8 per cent over two years, against the government's target of 3.7 per cent. Suspicion that agencies were a stage towards privatisation surfaced on the Labour benches. In May, however, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, committed Labour to keeping the approach. He said there was no merit in a policy which would 'uproot all the plants in the garden, rearrange their roots and then, having planted them, expect them to grow well'. Nevertheless there has been growing criticism of some aspects of the Next Steps initiative. The Commons Treasury committee, for example, has attacked the lack of an overall strategy for the reforms. Its seventh report on Next Steps published last July said that 'it would not be satisfactory if a major change in the structure of the Civil Service were to be introduced piecemeal, without proper opportunity for full public discussion'. A report in May by Sir Angus Fraser, the government's current efficiency adviser, criticised government departments for interfering excessively in their agencies. It recommended greater freedom for agency chiefs and cuts of at least 25 per cent in the Whitehall staff overseeing them. The limited scope for agencies to improve business performance has been highlighted by the National Audit Office, the government expenditure watchdog. In a report on the Vehicle Inspectorate, the office found that after significant efficiency savings in the early years, further improvements were constrained by government policy. Legislation forbade the inspectorate to close under-used testing stations, and Treasury rules limited the agency's freedom to compete with the private sector for additional work. Agency chiefs are also increasingly critical of Treasury reluctance to loosen its grip over pay and grading - many are keen to introduce structures more appropriate to their agencies' needs. However, the experience of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the first agency to break away from national pay scales, is not encouraging. Some HMSO staff are taking industrial action over this year's pay award, which was lower than that offered to the rest of the Civil Service. Supporters of agencies are not abashed by such setbacks. They point out that it is the creation of agencies which has brought such issues of efficiency and management effectiveness to the fore. And they are confident that with both government and Opposition committed to the Next Steps approach, agencies are here to stay.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       NEW EXECUTIVE AGENCIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AGENCY                                          DEPARTMENT      STAFF Agricultural Development and Advisory Service Agriculture       2,500 Central Science Laboratory                    Agriculture         370 Compensation Agency                           N Ireland Office    150 Driver &amp; Vehicle Testing Agency               Environment (NI)    250 Duke of York's Royal Military School          Defence             100 DVOIT                                         Transport           590 Fire Service College                          Home Office         160 Naval Aircraft Repair Organisation            Defence           1,510 Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland           Environment (NI)    210 Planning Inspectorate                         Environment         630 Public Record Office                          Lord Chancellor's   440 Queen Victoria School                         Defence              60 Scottish Agricultural Science Agency          Scottish Office     140 Teachers' Pension Agency                      Education &amp; Science 300 Transport Research Laboratory                 Transport           580 Inland Revenue (34 executive offices)                          62,100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (NI) denotes Northern Ireland  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Many insolvency practitioners may breach rules, report shows ONE QUARTER of insolvency practitioners may be failing to meet their obligations under the law, according to an inspection carried out over the past few months by the government's Insolvency Service. In monitoring visits to 147 of the UK's nearly 2,000 practitioners, 18 had 'significant compliance problems' which have triggered investigations by their self-regulatory bodies. A further 18 are believed to have exhibited less serious defaults which also breach regulations. The details are revealed in the 1992-93 annual report of the Insolvency Service, an executive agency within the Department of Trade and Industry, which was published yesterday. They will intensify calls to strengthen regulation within the insolvency profession, which has been subject to growing criticism over the past few months. Since the 1986 Insolvency Act, practitioners have been required to pass exams and join a self-regulatory organisation, but little effort has been made to screen those already practising. The problems described by the Insolvency Service include failure to maintain proper time records for their billings, misusing bank accounts and failure to keep adequate financial and administrative records. A senior insolvency service official said: 'The regulatory bodies still have some work to do to meet the requirements in legislation.' The report also shows that 11 insolvency practitioners and one manager were under investigation at the end of the year, and that two practitioners and two managers were convicted of criminal offences in the previous 12 months. During the year, the service recommended withdrawal of the right to practise from three of the insolvency practitioners which it regulates directly. Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse and president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading trade body, said: 'Regrettably the profession has a small number of black sheep but it has accomplished a lot to clean up its act.'

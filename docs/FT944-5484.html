			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Row over RJB price discount - Government under fire from failed bidders for British Coal The government was embroiled in a bitter row over coal privatisation yesterday after confirming that RJB Mining, its preferred bidder for the English regions, will pay Pounds 99m less than its offer price of Pounds 914m. Failed bidders complained about a deal which allows Pounds 116m of the Pounds 815m final price to be paid in instalments over three years, after an initial payment of Pounds 699m. The reduced price and deferment of some payments was viewed in the City as increasing the chances of RJB raising the Pounds 894m needed to finance its controversial bid for what it describes as English Coal. However Mr Christopher Stainforth, a managing director of Guinness Mahon, said his client, Coal Investments, had been told by government advisers that its bid would have been invalid if it had included an element of deferred consideration. Another failed bidder said he had not known deferred payments were possible. Mr Stainforth said that if his client had known such an arrangement was possible, it could have increased its offer. 'The rules have been changed to suit the bidder because he could not afford the price he offered. I do not see how the government can know it got the best price.' The Department of Trade and Industry said RJB was being treated no differently from other bidders. The bid rules had not excluded deferred payments. It is understood that at least one of the deals for the South Wales and Scottish regions could involve staged payments. Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, is part of the Mining Scotland consortium which is preferred bidder for Scotland. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told Parliament yesterday that Mining Scotland would acquire the Scottish mining assets of British Coal for Pounds 39.4m and up to Pounds 10m extra for increased levels of stock. As in the English regions, this was lower than the bid price. In the case of RJB the adjustments of Pounds 99m related to changes in expected levels of coal stocks and liabilities disclosed after bids were submitted. Mr Eggar said RJB's final bid price of Pounds 815m represented the 'best value for money' for the government. The government's statement coincided with publication by RJB Mining of its 'pathfinder prospectus' laying out the details of its bid and projections underpinning it. The company, capitalised at Pounds 157m, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m (Pounds 12.2m), above expectations, for its existing business this year, earnings per share of 23.6p (22.7p) and a net dividend of 12.5p (12p). Barclays de Zoete Wedd, advising RJB, expects to publish a final prospectus, including the price of shares to be sold to finance the bid, by Tuesday December 13. The share offer would close on December 20. RJB has scheduled an EGM for December 29 and expects to take control of the regions on that day. In the pathfinder, RJB says that of the deferred payments Pounds 80m will be paid in two instalments of Pounds 40m, with interest at 1 per cent per annum above bank base rate. A further Pounds 36m is payable in three instalments, together with 9 per cent interest, on the first three anniversaries after completion. RJB will raise about Pounds 400m through a share issue and Pounds 494m through bank debt. RJB said it would increase dividends progressively. However, until the level of post-acquisition debt reduced substantially, a higher level of dividend cover than for the current financial year would not be appropriate. RJB said the final price adjustments meant that the company would be taking on more liabilities and less coal stocks than it expected when it made its Pounds 914m bid.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Projections* for English Coal  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1995    1996    1997    1998    1999  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit and loss (Pounds m) Turnover                          1,242   1,275   1,258   1,218   1,238 Operating costs                 (1.075)         (1.024) (1.033) (1.038) Operating profit                    167     226     234     185     200 Net interest                       (48)    (34)    (15)       6      20 Profit before taxation              119     192     219     191     220 Profit after taxation                75     124     142     124     144 Cash available for debt repayment,  deferred consideration and  dividends                          137     215     230     210     222  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *These do not constitute a forecast.

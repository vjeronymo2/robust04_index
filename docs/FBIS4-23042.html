This  problem cannot be resolved simply by pre-treating the liquid,  owing to the presence of abrasives, chiefly in the form of  ferromagnetic particles. The latter cause wear and lower the  efficacy of the systems. Analysis of the principles involved in  the filtration of such liquids indicates that the most simple  and effective solution to this problem lies in the use of  fibrous filter materials which are also carriers of a magnetic  field. However, the mechanism of filtering liquids have not yet  been sufficiently studied. Similar materials have not been  widely disseminated owing to the lack of an economically  feasible technology for forming elastic fibers from magnetically  hard materials. In the present work data are presented on the  filtration characteristics of polymeric fibrous materials which  are also sources of a constant magnetic field. The materials  were formed from a polymer melt filled with a magnetic substance  by drawing out fibers with the aid of a gas stream, fastening  the fibers to a substrate with adhesive, and subsequently  treating it in a magnetic field. A well known extrusion-filler  technology for making sheet fibrous polymeric materials was  ineffective. The filters were tested with a model working liquid  consisting of a petroleum oil containing arizona dust (fine  grained powder of known particle size distribution) and barium  ferrite as artificial contaminants. Filtration characteristics  were assayed by photometric analysis of the liquids. The tests  showed that the filters cause only an insignificant drop in  filtration pressure while performing an almost uniform degree of  purification to the working liquid. Another area of effective  application of fibrous magnetic filter materials lies in the  treatment of industrial and municipal effluents. A feature of  these systems is the significant concentration of  iron-containing contaminants which cause direct and progressive  corrosion and wear to equipment, buildings, etc. Figures 2;  references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AREA RACING;  </P> <P> FAIRPLEX EVENTS SET STAGE FOR FUTURE  </P> <P> Two races at Fairplex Park this weekend promise to play important roles in  determining the shape of two six-figure races set for the following weekend.  </P> <P> Saturday's $50,000-added Derby Trial will probably point out contenders for the  $100,000 Pomona Derby seven days later.  </P> <P> And the winner of Sunday's $50,000-added C. B. Afflerbaugh Stakes will receive  an automatic invitation to the $150,000 Pomona Invitational on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> In addition, the richest race of the meeting will be decided Saturday, when  Fusion Illusion tops 10 2-year-old quarter horses set to meet in the estimated  $200,000 Pacific Coast Quarter Horse Racing Assn. Breeders Futurity.  </P> <P> Sunday's crowd at Fairplex Park, and those at the 10 Southern California  inter-track wagering sites taking the Fairplex races, can also wager on the  $1-million Super Derby from Louisiana Downs.  </P> <P> The Super Derby -- which matches Summer Squall, Unbridled and local heroes  Stalwart Charger and Cee's Tizzy -- will be run between early races Sunday.  </P> <P> TK's Skipper tops the field of seven Saturday night in the $35,000 third leg of  the American Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Also on tap Saturday night on the 12-event program is the $25,000 California  Gold Series Final for pacing colts and geldings. Spicy Shawn Joseph, a narrow  winner of the third leg of the series last Saturday, figures to be the  favorite.  </P></p>

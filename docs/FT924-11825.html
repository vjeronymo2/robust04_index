			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Actuaries body wants tighter rules THE Institute of Actuaries called on the government yesterday to tighten rules governing the way general insurance companies set reserves against future claims. The institute, one of two professional bodies of actuaries in the UK, said general insurance companies should be required to obtain actuarial certification of their reserves, especially against unpaid claims. Unpaid claims are incurred but not yet reported. The call comes in the wake of difficulties at Municipal Mutual, the UK's ninth largest insurer, which withdrew from the market earlier this month.</p>

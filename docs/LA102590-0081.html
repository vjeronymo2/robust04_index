			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GETTING THEIR KICKS;  </P> <P> NORTH COUNTY HOME TO NEW SOCCER TRENDS  </P> <P> Look around on any fall Saturday -- from Del Mar to Oceanside, Encinitas to  Escondido -- and you'll see soccer uniforms. All day long, children scurry  after black-and-white balls on every available field in the county.  </P> <P> Having successfully competed with other traditional youth activities like  Little League, soccer has firmly established itself in North County as  elsewhere. The area also finds itself home to some new trends, decried by some  and applauded by others.  </P> <P> "The population in North County is growing fast, but the numbers of kids  playing soccer are growing even faster," said Judith Wesling, a district  commissioner for the United States Youth Soccer Assn., one of two national  organizations overseeing soccer in the county.  </P> <P> As the number of children playing increases, so do the options available and  the confusion for many parents over the right choices for their own children.  </P> <P> In most communities, boys and girls can choose to play purely recreational  soccer in their own neighborhoods or try out for more competitive teams. For  instance, the Encinitas Soccer Club offers three levels of play: A or  recreational teams play locally; AA teams are more competitive and may travel  to other communities for their games; AAA teams are the most competitive and  travel far afield. Any child may sign up for a recreational team, but for the  two competitive levels, team members must actually try out and be chosen.  </P> <P> At the AAA level, soccer often becomes a 12-month commitment, especially when  combined with high school soccer. In fact, this region has acquired a  reputation as a hot bed for year-round soccer.  </P> <P> On any given weekend, AAA teams like Poway Vaqueros, Escondido Heat, La Jolla  Nomads and Rancho Bernardo Pegasus, may face each other or travel outside of  the county for distant tournaments. For instance, the San Dieguito Surf  under-17 boys team (and many of their family members) will spend Thanksgiving  in Tempe, Ariz.  </P> <P> Tryouts and traveling are not the only relatively new wrinkles in youth soccer.  In many cases, the coaches of the AAA teams are not volunteer dads and moms;  they're paid non-relatives who play soccer themselves.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, paid coaches were not the case, but now there's a definite  trend in that direction," Wesling said. "As the youth players get better and  now have national role models in the pro players, they're looking for a higher  level of coaching. The paid coaches have the expertise and skills that parents  who didn't grow up playing soccer don't have."  </P> <P> One of those coaches is Joseph Giacalone, who has played for a pro soccer team  in San Bernadino and is trying out for the San Diego Soccers.  </P> <P> This season he's coaching the Rancho Bernardo Hornets, a team of 10- and  11-year-old girls. He said income from coaching and giving private lessons  allows him the freedom to continue playing professional soccer.  </P> <P> "The kids and parents at the AAA level are more motivated," Giacalone said. "I  try to put as little pressure as possible on them and still try to teach them  to be good soccer players."  </P> <P> According to Robin Schultz, whose daughter, Jennifer, plays for the Hornets,  the trend toward paid coaches seems to be working: "The kids are playing  better, and, since this is the livelihood of these coaches, they have to be  good with the kids."  </P> <P> Paying coaches and traveling to distant tournaments do not come without a price  tag. One mother whose son decided to try out for a AAA team after having played  on recreational teams said she was ready to write a check for about $35 but  found out that a check for 10 times that amount wouldn't cover the cost for the  season.  </P> <P> The coaches' paychecks come out of the parents' checkbooks, as does the cost of  team travel and uniforms. Each league collects the money differently, but a fee  of several hundred dollars is not unusual.  </P> <P> The United States Youth Soccer Assn.'s counterpart is the American Youth Soccer  Organization, which emphasizes the recreational rather than competitive aspects  of the sport.  </P> <P> The American Youth Soccer Organization has leagues in Mira Mesa and the San  Marcos area and plans to open a new region in Carlsbad next year.  </P> <P> "Although we have some paid staff in the national office, every one else is a  volunteer in our organizations, from the coaches to the registrars," says Eric  Brummond, the national development coordinator for the organization. "We place  an emphasis on having fun, staying fit and teaching skills."  </P> <P> The organization's philosophy revolves around four principles, says Brummond:  every child should play at least half of each game; each team should be  balanced so children don't get discouraged; clubs should hold open reservations  with no tryouts so that there is no discrimination on the basis of skill, and  all coaches should practice positive coaching.  </P> <P> Actually, all teams in the county, regardless of national or state affiliation  start out at the recreational, nontraveling level. The competitive option kicks  in around the age of 9. In most leagues, organized play begins at the age of 5.  </P> <P> At the North County Soccer Park in Poway, many parents from surrounding  neighborhoods have decided to take advantage of the soccer park's organized  leagues for children as young as 4. The younger children play their games on a  new kind of indoor-outdoor field designed by co-owners Mark Bentley and Tom  Schwartz.  </P> <P> The soccer park's mini field measures about 85 feet by 50 feet and has been  built with sand-filled turf and smooth walls with injury prevention in mind.  The teams field four rather than the traditional 11 at one time, so each child  gets more contact with the ball.  </P> <P> Why sign up kids for organized sports before they even go to kindergarten?  </P> <P> According to Bentley and the parents whose children participate, this early  introduction to soccer will accelerate their development of skills. Besides, as  one dad says, "the kids get to associate with other kids and just have fun."  </P> <P> Although the adults involved in youth soccer may disagree about the right age  for children to start playing and other fine points, there is almost universal  agreement that soccer, on the whole, is a good sport for kids.  </P> <P> "Soccer is definitely one of the better sports," said Dr. Howard Taras, a  pediatrician at UC San Diego. "There are fewer injuries in soccer than there  are in football, and, unlike baseball, it's an aerobic sport."  </P> <P> The aerobic advantages of the sport come at a time when a number of studies  have concluded that American children have become couch potatoes and are at  risk of developing serious health problems because of their poor eating habits  and poorer exercise regimens.  </P> <P> When youth soccer was young it managed to avoid the scenario of adults reliving  past glory or re-inventing their playing careers through children. Most  Americans knew next to nothing about the game.  </P> <P> As a sport, soccer came to this country late. Although Americans assaulted each  other on the gridiron, the rest of the world played an entirely different kind  of "football." Ethnic teams began playing this new kind of football in the '60s  and, slowly, youth soccer teams sprang up around the United States.  </P> <P> As the sport became more popular and familiar, the archetypal "Little League"  parents -- the ones whose veins bulge as they shout abuse at players, coaches  and officials -- have taken their places on the sidelines.  </P> <P> Many soccer leagues have tried to set standards to encourage appropriate  conduct on the part of everyone involved. The American Youth Soccer  Organization, for instance, has a bill of rights for young athletes as well as  codes of conduct for coaches, referees, parents and players.  </P> <P> Pediatrician Taras stresses that children need to learn how healthy competition  differs from unhealthy competition, and that unhealthy competition should be  guarded against at all ages. He also offers these recommendations for parents  contemplating soccer for their children:  </P> <P> * The younger the child, the less structured the activity should be.  </P> <P> * Children should never be forced to play.  </P> <P> * Younger children especially should be viewed as competing against themselves  instead of other children.  </P> <P> * Activities should be increased gradually to avoid injuries.  </P> <P> * In hot, humid weather children, especially younger children, need to be  encouraged to drink lots of water.  </P> <P> * Children should never be told to continue playing if they say they are hurt.  "If a child is hurt, he or she shouldn't stay in the game," Taras said. "If  pretending to be hurt, the child really doesn't want to be playing at all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOCCER SOURCES  </P> <P> U.S. Youth Soccer Assn.:  </P> <P> 488-1359  </P> <P> Cardiff Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 436-9356  </P> <P> Carlsbad Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 434-5600  </P> <P> Del Mar Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 755-3255  </P> <P> Encinitas Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 632-0138  </P> <P> Leucadia Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 436-9356  </P> <P> Mira Mesa Soccer Club:  </P> <P> 549-2938  </P> <P> North County Youth Soccer Assn.

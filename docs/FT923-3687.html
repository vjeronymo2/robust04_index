			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Union Bank of Finland in merger talks Correction (published 14 September 1992) appended to this article. THE UNION Bank of Finland, one of the country's leading private commercial banks, is in discussions over a merger with the new state-owned Savings Bank of Finland. The proposed financial conglomerate is seen as part of a much wider restructuring of Finnish banking taking place against of mounting debt losses and weak operating performance. A merger would be welcomed by Finland's hard-pressed centre-right government which has already provided about FM28bn (Dollars 6.31m) in loans and guarantees to prop up the banking system. Government sources believe further support will be needed soon. Last autumn the Central Bank had to take control of Skopbank, then the country's fourth largest bank and the clearing bank for the savings banks to rescue it from collapse. The Central Bank sold its holding in Skopbank to the government's guarantee fund in June. As a result of the rescue the Central Bank has already lost about FM6.9bn. But the Union Bank is believed to be laying down strong conditions for any merger or other arrangement with the Savings Bank which has emerged from a merger of 41 Finnish savings banks, including Skopbank. CORRECTION UNION Bank of Finland is negotiating with the Finnish government's bank guarantee fund to buy Skopbank and not Savings Bank of Finland as reported in the FT on September 10. Other parties are also negotiating to acquire Skopbank.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bullough in Pounds 10m heating expansion Bullough, the diversified engineering and office products group, yesterday said it was expanding its core heating business with the Pounds 9.89m acquisition of Trianco Group, the privately-owned boiler manufacturer. It is the first acquisition since Mr Gordon Bond took over as chief executive in January and refocused the company on four key areas: refrigeration, engineering, office products and heating. 'Trianco fits in with our strategy of building competitive advantage and market share in our core business-es.' Bullough is issuing Pounds 9.74m of six year loan notes and paying Pounds 150,000 cash for the Sheffield-based company. Mr Bond said the group also planned to redeem Pounds 1.9m of Trianco cumulative preference shares and would assume its Pounds 2.2m net borrowings. Trianco, which manufactures and sells oil and gas boilers, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.08m after exceptional provisions of Pounds 1.8m for the year to December 31. At the operating level, profits were Pounds 778,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.6m. Bullough's heating division made operating profits of Pounds 4.1m on sales of Pounds 35.1m in the 12 months to October 31.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Foreigners keep their cool on US tax threat US President-elect Bill Clinton's promise to crack down on the tax practices of foreign companies has so far failed to cause much consternation in corporate boardrooms overseas. Most are waiting to see how far campaign threats will translate into realities once the new president settles into negotiations and sees the difficulties of implementation. Mr Michael Garner, finance director of TI, the UK-headquartered engineering group, said: 'Without sounding too cavalier, we have seen these things come and go before. If the proposals get too Draconian, sanity usually prevails.' The threat to TI from new transfer-pricing rules would not be significant, because the company manufactured in the US rather than importing goods for the US market. However, Mr Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the securities house, said: 'At the very best, the US Internal Revenue Service is going to get tougher. At worst, they will introduce arbitary unitary taxation under which foreign companies would be hammered.' Mr Cunningham has made tentative calculations for seven UK companies with substantial US operations which show that all but one are paying below full US corporate tax, and would have reported earnings per share more than 20 per cent lower if they were subject to unitary tax. One of the principal mechanisms companies were likely to lose was the ability to use 'debt arbitrage,' he said. This involves taking out borrowings in the US which are deductible against US tax, and investing them at higher interest rates in the UK, where the taxable interest can be offset against advance corporation tax payable on dividends. Tax experts yesterday were busy providing advice on strategies which companies should adopt in response to the election of Mr Clinton. Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, stressed a number of actions which would save tax. Transfer pricing: Companies should examine transfer pricing methods and gather documentary support to help justify the system in future negotiations with the IRS. Foreign investors' capital gains tax: sales of US subsidiaries now would protect them from possible future capital gains taxes. 'Earnings strippings': pre-paying rents, royalties, management charges and other payments should protect companies from future legislation which limits 'excessive' tax relief on payments paid to foreign companies. Lobbying expenses: lobbying may be disallowed for tax deductions, so companies should lobby against the legislation and enter binding lobbying contracts before any change. Worker training: pre-paying salaries and bonuses before any changes, such as Mr Clinton's proposal requiring all employers to contribute 1.5 per cent of payroll to worker retraining, is recommended. Investment tax credit: delaying capital expenditure to take advantage of a Clinton-proposed 10 per cent credit on new capital investment.</p>

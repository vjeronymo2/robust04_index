			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE N BACKERS TO CLARIFY ROLE OF SHELDON  </P> <P> Leaders of the victorious campaign for Measure N, an anti-homosexual rights  initiative, have called a news conference on Monday to clear up issues  surrounding the involvement of the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon in their campaign and  organization.  </P> <P> Irvine Values Coalition members are discounting statements from Sheldon  indicating that he was responsible for their success.  </P> <P> "Sheldon seems to be taking credit for our hard labor. It couldn't be further  from the truth," coalition President Scott Peotter said after the election. The  Irvine Values Coalition is not officially affiliated with Sheldon's statewide  Traditional Values Coalition.  </P> <P> Measure N, which excludes homosexuals from protection under the city's  anti-discrimination law, passed 53% to 47%.  </P> <P> Measure N opponents frequently complained of "outside forces" -- referring to  Sheldon -- influencing the campaign.  </P> <P> At a post-election victory party, Sheldon told the Irvine World News: "I've  been in it up to here," gesturing to his chin. "We just couldn't let the other  side know it until now."  </P> <P> The day after the election, Sheldon held a press conference claiming that he  helped plan strategy for the Irvine Values Coalition.  </P> <P> Christina Shea, campaign manager for Yes on N, said on Thursday that Sheldon's  only involvement was to walk precincts with his son and attend the victory  party. "We won it as a grass-roots effort. We owe more to (Republican Rep.  William) Dannemeyer than to Lou Sheldon."  </P> <P> Sheldon blamed a "misunderstanding in the press" for the apparent  discrepancies. "We were enthusiastically supporting it with our personal  feelings and emotions," he said Saturday night. "I said all along I was not at  all responsible for the activity. I did not take credit for the victory.  </P> <P> "The only thing we did was send a mailing out to our people to get behind Scott  Peotter in the last week or two of the campaign," he said.  </P> <P> That mailing was not listed on the most recent campaign financial disclosure  reports. State law requires campaign donations and in-kind contributions to be  disclosed.  </P></p>

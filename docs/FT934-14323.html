			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Separatists put faith in Canada poll THE presence of more than 50 Quebec separatists in Canada's House of Commons after the October 25 general election will give the independence movement an important lever to sway public opinion in the francophone province, according to the leader of the pro-sovereignty Bloc Quebecois. Mr Lucien Bouchard said in an interview with the Financial Times that a referendum on independence would not be held in Quebec for at least two years. But he predicted the BQ's expected success in next week's election would give the separatist cause an advantage which it did not enjoy at the time of the last referendum, in 1980. 'It's quite a difference in a referendum campaign to see 75 Quebec members of the House of Commons come down and fight for federalism, and to have 50 to 55 members coming back to Quebec to fight for sovereignty,' he said. An opinion poll published over the weekend indicated the BQ remains far ahead of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives in the province, with the support of 52 per cent of decided voters. In the country as a whole the Liberals, who are now in opposition, have widened their lead over the Conservatives, with 40 per cent and 22 per cent of the vote respectively. The Tories' sputtering campaign received another setback on Friday when a torrent of complaints forced Prime Minister Kim Campbell to withdraw a TV advertisement which played on the partial facial paralysis of Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader. The BQ is the federal equivalent of the Parti Quebecois, which has campaigned within Quebec since the late 1960s for a loose form of sovereignty. The Bloc was formed in 1988 by a small group of breakaway Liberal and Conservative MPs angered by the unwillingness of their colleagues to make more concessions to Quebec during one of Canada's periodic constitutional wrangles. The success of the party since then owes much to Mr Bouchard, who was a lawyer in the eastern Quebec town of Chicoutimi before entering politics. Prior to forming the BQ he was Canada's ambassador to France and a member of former prime minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet. Responding to a suggestion that much of the BQ's support reflects voters' desire for a change after three years of tough economic times, Mr Bouchard acknowledged there was 'no definitive evidence' that most Quebeckers supported sovereignty at this stage. But he outlined a two-pronged strategy to win them over. First, the BQ would show 'that sovereignists can be very responsible even in the federal parliament'. Second, Mr Bouchard said Quebeckers would come to realise that they would never gain more constitutional powers within the federal system. 'The door has slammed on all reasonable possibility of renewing the constitution,' he said. Mr Bouchard said the separatist movement did not threaten democracy or foreign investors' confidence in Quebec. 'Everything will have to be done through the democratic process.' He noted Quebec was heading support for the 1989 free trade agreement between Canada and the US. 'One of the motivations of the thrust towards sovereignty is the desire to open Quebec to the world.'</p>

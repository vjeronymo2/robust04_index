			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Behind The ERM Crisis: The day Germany planted a currency time bomb - In an austere Frankfurt building on September 11, German officials adopted a course that could change the monetary future of Europe. Peter Norman concludes his two-part investigation IT WAS the Bundesbank that brought the phoney war surrounding Europe's monetary future to an end. At a secret meeting in its austere headquarters in northern Frankfurt on Friday September 11, Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's 68-year-old president, gave Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl the figures that threatened the end ofGermany's counter-inflation policy. They also put an explosive charge under Europe's exchange rate mechanism - a time bomb which is still ticking in spite of three re-alignments during the last three months. As a nearby clock struck 6pm, the mood in Mr Schlesinger's 12th floor room was as sombre as the all-black office furniture. Theo Waigel, German finance minister, Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice-president, and Horst Kohler, the energetic Finance Ministry state secretary, listened as Mr Schlesinger told Germany's leader how the central bank had been forced to buy a record DM24bn worth of Italian lire in the days before the meeting. The Bundesbank president said the lire purchases, obligatory under the rules of the European Monetary System, were swamping the bank's efforts to control Germany's fast-expanding money supply. He asked the chancellor to approve negotiations to realign currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. The move was to end nearly six years of exchange rate stability in the ERM. That weekend, the Italian lira was devalued by 7 per cent and the Bundesbank decided on modest cuts in its interest rates in an attempt to calm financial markets. The package failed. Only days later, after unprecedented upheavals on currency markets, came Black Wednesday: the Italian lira and sterling were suspended from ERM membership, and the cause of European integration was dealt a blow from which it still has to recover. Since Black Wednesday, it has become clear that the crisis in the EMS goes to the heart of the EC's future plans. Disarray in the ERM could at best delay, and at worst destroy, the EC's hopes for economic and monetary union by the end of this century. Even if it is ratified by all EC member states, the Maastricht Treaty looks more like a formula for establishing a two- or multi-speed Europe than a blueprint for union. The EC's response to the monetary crisis has been slow. Its secretive monetary committee - charged with finding ways of correcting 'fault lines' in the system - has made scant progress in three meetings on the subject. Its chairman, Jean-Claude Trichet, the director of the French Treasury, had no conclusions to report to EC leaders during their summit in Edinburgh which continues today. However, while others have dallied, one institution has emerged with a clear idea of what it wants from the wreckage. The Bundesbank sees a monetary future for Europe: it will be designed and largely made in Germany. In a series of speeches over the past two months, Mr Schlesinger, Mr Tietmeyer, and Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, have spelled out a vision of Europe's future that amounts to monetary Darwinism, or survival of the fittest. Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues give public support to the Maastricht Treaty goals of economic and monetary union. But at the same time, they express doubt about the effectiveness of the economic convergence criteria in the treaty and its lack of clarity about a political union to provide democratic support for the goals of a single European currency and central bank. The Bundesbank's top decision makers insist that there can be no compromise in Europe with their objective of achieving price stability. Countries are welcome to try to fix their currencies to the D-Mark, but it is up to them to ensure that their economic fundamentals - such as inflation, international competitiveness and public finances - are in order. This rigorous approach to monetary union was spelt out most explicitly by Mr Tietmeyer in early November when he spoke to a conference of bankers in the German Alpine resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The speech, which contrary to usual practice was not given wide distribution by the Bundesbank, underlined the view that successful monetary union in Europe would depend on the 'right choice of participating countries'. He explicitly rejected the myth that all EC nations could proceed together to union. The Bundesbank's Darwinian approach to Emu has become more pronounced since September. During the weekend of September 12 and 13 Mr Schlesinger had rallied his colleagues in the Bundesbank central council to agree to a  1/4 percentage point drop in Germany's Lombard rate, plus  1/2 point cuts in its discount and money market rates, in support of the 7 per cent lira devaluation. When the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo were devalued by 6 per cent on November 22, by contrast, the Bundesbank set its face against compromising its strict anti-inflationary monetary policy any further. It made no move to cut interest rates. The tough line has continued. On December 1, in a speech at Cologne university, Mr Schlesinger sharply criticised those who sought to put Germany under moral pressure to ease its monetary policy while it was still struggling to bring its inflation problem under control. The Bundesbank president has also attacked aspects of the ERM's operations, notably the obligation on strong currency countries to provide unlimited support for weak currencies at their lower intervention points. Such intervention, he said, encouraged speculation. Mr Schlesinger's remarks have created the impression that the Bundesbank is hostile to the ERM. The truth is more subtle. The Bundesbank aim is to move forward by way of the past: it wants the ERM to revert to the original concept of fixed but adjustable parities, instead of the quasi-fixed exchange rate system that evolved between the last significant realignment in January 1987 and the tensions of this year. An important element of the Bundesbank's strategy is to breathe new life into the so-called Basle-Nyborg agreement of autumn 1987, in which EC central bankers and finance ministers revised the rules of the ERM for dealing with currency crises. That agreement decided that currency weakness should be tackled at first by intervention which should be 'intra-marginal' or above the level at which central banks are obliged to support weak currencies in the ERM. This has the effect under EMS rules of placing the risk of losses from intervention with the central bank of the weak currency country. If selling pressure continued, the country with a weak currency should raise interest rates. The third step would be a realignment of EMS parities that, ideally, would be timely enough to avoid a currency crisis. These principles have underpinned the Bundesbank's approach to the ERM since September. They have support in the ERM's hard currency 'core' countries, which have staked their whole credibility in economic policy on keeping their currencies in line with the D-Mark. So far the core nations have been successful in this effort, in spite of the continuing strains in the system. Indeed, monetary officials interviewed recently in several continental countries appeared quietly confident that Germany, France, the Benelux countries and most probably Ireland and Denmark would soon be able to form a bloc in which parities stay unchanged. These could be joined by Austria, which has religiously linked its currency to the D-Mark for many years in spite of not being a member of the EC. That the Bundesbank is now setting the agenda for Europe's monetary future shows how far this autumn's troubles have destroyed the assumption that the EMS could function smoothly as a 'glide path' for monetary union in Europe. The ERM acts as the first phase of the three-phase Maastricht plan to create a single European currency, monetary policy and central bank by 1999 at the latest. But as the Bundesbank's influence has grown, so have the doubts. Developments since Black Wednesday suggest that even the core countries of the ERM may have difficulties in future living with the D-mark as Europe's anchor currency. And that possibility has serious implications for the Community's whole effort to move from the EMS to economic and monetary union. The EMS was conceived by then West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing as an antidote to the currency instability and dollar weakness of the late 1970s. At its heart is the ERM, a grid of exchange rate parities for EC member states, which limits the movement of most against each other to 2.25 per cent either side of agreed bilateral central rates. Since the system started operating with eight currencies (the D-Mark, French franc, the Dutch guilder, the Belgian and Luxembourg francs, the Danish krone, Irish punt and Italian lira) in March 1979, its most important exchange rate relationship has been between the French franc and D-Mark. This was accentuated by the special arrangement for the Italian lira to fluctuate up to six per cent either side of its central rates until January 1990 and the UK's decision to stay out of the ERM until October 1990. Initially, the EMS was linked only tenuously to the idea of European union. Its objective was the more modest one of creating a 'zone of monetary stability in Europe' and it took several years - until 1983 - before it began to fulfil this role. It is not surprising that the Bundesbank wants to recapture the spirit of the system's most successful period between 1983 and 1987. The Bundesbank called the shots in the ERM for most of the 1980s. Although those years were marked by occasional convulsions on currency markets and the odd acrimonious realignment, they were also a period of steady economic growth and convergence to lower inflation among the ERM member states. After 1987, however, the environment in which the ERM operates changed in several ways: In the summer of 1988, EC leaders decided in Hanover to push ahead for economic and monetary union. It was then, according to one long-serving senior monetary official, that the system was 'hi-jacked' and those officials who voiced scepticism about the goal of Emu were subjected to 'intellectual terrorism' by supporters of union grouped around Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president. The ERM itself became a club that others wanted to join. The Euro-pessimism of the early 1980s gave way to Euro-phoria. The success of the ERM countries in achieving steady growth and, more especially, low inflation prompted Spain to join in June 1989, followed by Britain in October 1990 and Portugal in April this year. The world was changing beyond the boundaries of the European Community. The collapse of communism and the breaching of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 paved the way for German union and the eventual emergence of inflation as a problem for the D-Mark, the ERM's anchor currency. The potential for instability in the system was greatly increased by the dismantling of exchange controls in the EC in line with the Community's programme for creating a barrier-free internal market by the end of 1992. By January this year, finance ministers and central bankers throughout the EC were quietly congratulating themselves on five years of ERM tranquility. 'But there was an element of discomfort in those celebrations,' recalls one senior monetary official. 'If you looked at all the indicators, there was one group of countries (the original members minus Italy) which stayed close to each other and another group (the newcomers with Italy) that was diverging significantly in a lasting way.' At the time, however, the financial markets ignored such discordant developments as Germany's rising interest rates, Britain's continuing recession, and Italy's ever-increasing debt burden. They remained mesmerised by the drive towards Emu that reached its peak at last December's Maastricht summit. There, EC heads of government had settled on a treaty envisaging the creation of Emu by 1997 at the earliest and certainly no later than 1999. In consequence, the ERM had for some time been operating in a perverse fashion, with high inflation currencies, such as the Spanish peseta, emerging as the strongest in the system because they were supported by high interest rates and a belief that parities would not change. It took the narrow Danish vote against Maastricht in the June 2 referendum to shatter this uneasy equilibrium. In spite of a pro-Maastricht vote in the Irish referendum a few weeks later, pressure began to build against the existing currency relationships in the ERM. It all came to a head in the September currency crisis, compounded by political conflict and institutional and individual failures at all levels among the EC member states. It has become increasingly clear in the intervening weeks that Black Wednesday was not just a debacle for the UK and Italy; the ejection of sterling and the lira exposed a structural problem at the heart of the EMS. John Major, the British prime minister, was mocked elsewhere in Europe when he suggested at the time that the Community should seek to correct 'fault lines' in the ERM. Now monetary officials are no longer so willing to suggest that the UK and Italy were themselves largely to blame. To be sure, both Italy and the UK had their weaknesses. Italy was losing the battle to bring its bloated state deficits under control and was losing competiveness against its EC trading partners. Some continental officials, including Mr Schlesinger, thought that Britain had a competitiveness problem that was highlighted by its continued large current account deficit in a recession; they reckoned it had entered the ERM at too ambitious a parity of DM2.95. Others believed that Britain failed to anticipate the extent to which markets would test sterling in the system. This fear was alive even before the UK joined the ERM. In 1989 Andre Szasz, executive director of the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, warned that Britain 'should be prepared - at least in the short run - to give priority to the exchange rate objective' after ERM entry, implying the need to raise interest rates even at times when this would be politically unpopular and, in domestic terms, economically unjustified. In August, the UK's failure to follow this advice helped prepare the ground for sterling's eventual exit from the ERM. Although the pound had weakened - passing at one point through the level that was supposed to trigger efforts to defend the currency - Norman Lamont, the chancellor, refused to raise interest rates. Indeed, in early August the government cut the returns on its National Savings products to head off a rise in mortgage rates by UK building societies, effectively telling financial markets that the UK could not afford a politically damaging rise in bank base rates from 10 per cent when the country was deep in recession. Black Wednesday may have been climactic, but it was far from marking the end of the EMS's troubles. Since September 16, the doubts about the system's continuing viability - let alone the prospect of its paving the way for Emu  -have stubbornly refused to go away. The first warning sign was the intense speculative attack on the French franc in September following the petit oui in favour of the Maastricht Treaty in the September 20 referendum. In spite of sound economic fundamentals, such as low inflation, stronger growth and healthier government finances than those of Germany, the Bundesbank and Bank of France had to buy FFr160bn in concerted intervention before the speculative wave subsided. That victory had required strong verbal support for the franc from the German and French finance ministries and the two countries' central banks. It is also thought that the Bundesbank provided a generous swap line to the French central bank. Once the dust settled, the Bank of France had made an estimated FFr1.2bn in profit at the speculators' expense. But victory was not without its costs. It had entailed a temporary, but disruptive, increase in French interest rates and spelled further problems for the system. The French franc was again under pressure last month after the 6 per cent devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo on November 22. ERM central banks have also been obliged to support the Irish punt and Danish krone on a large scale. The Belgian National Bank, for example, had to buy Dollars 1bn worth of Irish pounds in three hours one recent Friday morning. At various times in the past three months, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have been forced to push interest rates to usurious levels in the hope of maintaining their parities. These moves have had only limited success. Norway was forced on Thursday to float its krone, rather than lose all its currency reserves in a vain struggle to keep the currency pegged to the Ecu, the weighted basket of EC currencies that some hope will develop into a money for Europe. 'It became too hard to fight,' said central bank director Leif Eide. Three weeks before, Sweden abandoned its attempt to keep the krona tied to the ERM after a huge outflow of capital from the country. The setback experienced by Carl Bildt, the prime minister, was, if anything, greater than that suffered by Mr Major on Black Wednesday. He was given just 10 minutes' notice of the move by central bank governor Bengt Dennis. Sweden, like Britain two months earlier, was forced to float its currency because a fixed exchange rate policy was no longer compatible with domestic economic or political priorities. In Sweden's case, the final straw was the failure of the opposition Social Democratic party to back government public spending cuts in support of the krona. In Britain, the crucial moment had come at 11am on Black Wednesday when Mr Lamont raised bank base rates to a politically unacceptable and economically untenable 12 per cent only to be met with continued selling of sterling. But it is the link between the French franc and the D-mark - under pressure again yesterday, with the Bundesbank having to support the franc in the currency markets - that remains crucial to the survival of the ERM. If the franc were forced to devalue it would be more than a savage blow to the political prestige of President Mitterrand and his prime minister Pierre Beregovoy, who has made the franc fort the centre of his economic policy. It would demonstrate that the ERM was operating perversely by creating the conditions for the depreciation of a currency - the franc - which in terms of economic fundamentals deserves to be stronger than the D-Mark. So far the core countries of the ERM have stayed loyal to the D-Mark with senior officials confident that Germany will in time overcome its problems of relatively high inflation and deficit financing in eastern Germany. It is unlikely, however, that the system could survive a franc devaluation. It would also be seriously weakened by the forced devaluation of either the Danish krone or Irish punt. The ERM faces a tense three months ahead of France's national assembly election in March. So far bipartisan support for the franc fort policy has held remarkably firm, in spite of economic slowdown in France and 3m unemployed. But that united front may be cracking. This week Alain Madelin, a senior member of ex-President Giscard d'Estaing's centrist UDF party, said France should sever the franc's ties to the mark because of Germany's economic problems. Little wonder that senior French monetary officials would like to take the franc out of the firing line by moving rapidly to Emu. This desire does not necessarily conflict with the Bundesbank's agenda, calling for Emu on condition that Maastricht's strict economic convergence conditions are met. One way of reconciling their viewpoints would be for the core countries of the ERM to forge ever closer ties - culminating, perhaps, in a de facto monetary union among themselves. In that case, the secret meeting in the Bundesbank three months ago that triggered the ERM crisis would also have prepared the ground for a Europe moving at two speeds, or more.

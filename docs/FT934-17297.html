			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Markheath losses at Pounds 69m after provisions MARKHEATH, the property group controlled in effect by Adelaide Steamship, the Australian company, and its associates, incurred an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.8m for the year ended March 31, against Pounds 22.7m. During March Markheath entered a standstill agreement with its banks, which are continuing to provide credit facilities. Mr Michael Rendle, chairman, said yesterday that the group was still talking with the banks about a financial restructuring, which he hoped would take place 'as soon as possible'. The loss was after charging Pounds 57.9m (Pounds 15.5m) for provisions against the carrying value of properties and a provision of Pounds 5m (nil) against the amount owed by an associate. Turnover was Pounds 4.17m (Pounds 4.25m). Losses per share came out at 55.29p, compared with 18.66p. There is no dividend. Markheath, which cut its staff from 40 to 10 over the year, said its priorities were the reduction of borrowings and overheads and the securing of pre-lets at its main development sites in Stevenage and Brentford. These accounted for Pounds 43.3m of the total property provisions. Net liabilities at the end of the period totalled Pounds 12.5m or 10.2p a share, compared with net assets of Pounds 55m or 45.1p a share at the beginning of the year. Net borrowings were Pounds 67m (Pounds 72.9m). Interest payable advanced to Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 2.37m). The shares closed unchanged at 6p.</p>

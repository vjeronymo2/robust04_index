			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / First estate agent fined over house description THE FIRST estate agent to be prosecuted under the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) was fined Pounds 500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 570 by magistrates in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, yesterday. The act is aimed at eliminating misleading descriptions of properties. Mr Ian Sinclair, a chartered surveyor who runs his own estate agency in the Great Yarmouth area, had failed for five days to amend a newspaper advertisement and a captioned photograph in his office window to say that the asking price of a house in Gorleston had risen from Pounds 22,500 to Pounds 25,000. A member of the public interested in the property found that the price did not tally with the advertisement and alerted the local trading standards department which brought the prosecution. Mr Sinclair pleaded guilty and elected not to be tried at a crown court. He said the offence had happened through an administrative error because a new member of staff had failed to alter the details of the sale. The magistrates court has the power to impose a maximum fine of Pounds 5,000. After the hearing Mr Sinclair said: 'I am obviously very disappointed. The fine is not punitive but it is not token either. I had made a mistake and felt that I should have merely been cautioned.' Mr Malcolm Patridge, Mr Sinclair's solicitor, said: 'The fine was much higher than I expected but we will not be appealing.' Mr Steve Holland, prosecuting solicitor, said he felt vindicated in bringing the prosecution. 'There has been a substantial fine and I have been awarded all my costs.'</p>

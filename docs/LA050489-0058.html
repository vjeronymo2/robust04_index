			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SEABROOK NUCLEAR PLANT MOVES STEP CLOSER TO LICENSE  </P> <P> Federal regulators on Wednesday removed a major obstacle to a low-power testing  license for the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant, perhaps the biggest milestone in  the 20-year history of the financially fragile reactor that is a decade behind  schedule and billions over budget.  </P> <P> Seabrook could receive the long-sought permit, which allows testing at up to 5%  of capacity, as early as late next week if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  does not impose a stay on the license pending court appeals.  </P> <P> In the announcement on the decision, the commission's staff said it was  satisfied the plant owners have properly guaranteed they could raise $72.1  million to cover dismantling costs in case the reactor is tested with  radioactive fuel but never operates commercially.  </P> <P> The commission has said the financial decommissioning issue was the last in a  long series of regulatory obstacles that has prevented Seabrook from getting  its low-power license for 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The decision came just hours after the NRC voted 5 to 0 to reject a request by  Massachusetts officials to hold new hearings on the license because New  Hampshire does not have a place to dump low-level radioactive waste from the  plant.  </P> <P> The NRC said in a March ruling that it would give opponents five days to file  requests for a stay and another four days for Seabrook officials to respond.  The order said the commissioners would rule on stay motions "expeditiously" and  the license would not be issued until the commission has ruled on the requests.  </P> <P> Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is expected to challenge the license in  federal appeals court.  </P> <P> But any legal challenge will become moot without an emergency stay from either  the NRC or the court because Seabrook officials are ready to act swiftly on  low-power tests.  </P></p>

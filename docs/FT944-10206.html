			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Power generation helps surge at Veba Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate which recently announced a push into telecommunications, hoisted net profits by 49 per cent to DM677m (Dollars 442.5m) in the first nine months of this year, up from DM453m. It was helped by strong sales at PreussenElektra, which is Germany's second-biggest provider of electricity. The increase was in line with forecasts, and the company said net profits for the full year would be 'significantly' higher than last year's DM825m. Earnings were also bolstered by the sale of coal trading interests at the Raab Karcher unit, which raised DM132m. Turnover for the nine months rose 6.6 per cent to DM52.4bn, up from DM49.1bn. The sharpest rise, of 28.9 per cent, came at PreussenElektra, which incorporated for the first time the results of five east German regional generators bought at the beginning of this year. The company said its troubled chemicals division was making an operating profit, but there would be a loss for the whole year because of further restructuring costs of DM180m. Sales rose 1.5 per cent to DM7.6bn. The results do not include Vebacom, the company's newest division, created earlier this year. An international partner for Vebacom is expected to be announced shortly. Mr Ulrich Hartmann, chief executive, recently announced a planned DM6bn investment in telecommunications over the next 10 years.</p>

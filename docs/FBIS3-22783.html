Shebalkin under "There Is Such a Service" </F> rubric: "`Small Forces' for Radiation"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Recently, a vessel was  detained in Kaliningrad trade port a few hours before departure.  It turned out that the cargo of the motor ship "Composer  Musorgskiy" was posing a radioactive danger. This means that  the lives of the people working there were threatened to a  certain extent. Moreover, exports of radioactive substances  (uranium) without relative documentation are forbidden.  Eventually, the motor ship was sent to the place of its  destination -- St. Petersburg.    Here is another criminal fact. The Kaliningrad asphalt  cement plant has devices which control the production of the  mixture with sensors operating on radioisotopes. Some local  dodgers kept an eye on those colorful "castings" and took the  devices away despite the warning signs. The militia ran their  feet off to find the culprits. Finally, the stolen devices were  found. The thieves, most probably, had not found a customer,  while someone must have stored, carried, and transported  personal death for a long time. It is regrettable that the  plant failed to ensure proper security for the radioactive  devices.    Let us remember Chernobyl. We live thousands of kilometers  away from the site of the tragedy, but we felt its effects. We  will, probably, feel them for a long time.    That is why the Russian president issued a decree approving  the resolution "On Federal Control Over Nuclear and Radioactive  Security." This is a joint document of the president, the  legislature, and the government. By the way, I will remind  everyone that even Gorbachev tried to introduce such control  back in 1985, because the former USSR is a member of the  International Atomic Energy Agency. Unfortunately, the project  remained only a collection of good proposals for offices and  officials. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, the key and supreme  principle of control in any civilized country is its  nondepartmental character, as well as responsibility before the  coming generations. Until now, we have had administrative  control -- from the Atomic Ministry and the Ministries of Atomic  Energy, Construction, and Defense. No one washes one's dirty  linen in public, as a rule. That is why the establishment of  independent subunits in oblasts was an important event.    "The inspection supervises how organizations, enterprises,  and military units of the garrison and the fleet observe the  rules of storing and utilizing radioactive substances," says  Dmitriy Gennadyevich Sorokin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast  inspection. "Our staff is small, there are three more people  besides me, while the work load is quite impressive. Dozens of  enterprises in the oblast use devices with radioactive  substances. Furthermore, there is a large number of military  units where there is more equipment with radioisotopes than one  knows what to do with them."    "There are several problems that hamper the activities of  our  inspection. As any budget organization, it is experiencing  financial difficulties today. We have no means of transport or  the necessary equipment for qualitative analysis of radioactive  materials. In the case of the motor ship "Composer Musorgskiy,"  by the way, we failed to establish the exact effect of the  "evil" cargo on the environment." [passage omitted]    "I will dwell on the discussion concerning the possible  construction of a nuclear power plant in our oblast."    "The rate of construction of atomic power stations is  increasing around the world. Incidentally, our neighbors are  also building them. Lithuania is the leader in terms of energy  production at a nuclear station. Poland has its own stations,  while Belarus has ordered a project for itself from Canada."    "My opinion is likely to be viewed as subjective, but it is  the assessment of a competent specialist. A nuclear power  station is less polluting than any coal station, while the  energy produced there is the cheapest. However, the issue of  constructing an atomic station in our region is a matter for  energy specialists." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Parliament Days"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday's business of the Supreme Soviet 19th  session began with the perfectly composed approval of the  account of administration of the budget for 1993. The acute  critical charge of the speeches on the previous two days was not  reflected in the results of the voting at all.    The bill on the budget system for 1994 was taken as read  just  as calmly. The Planning and Budget Commission embarked on its  modification, and everyone else embarked on the "resort" act  submitted by the trade unions.    The essence of the problem here is as follows. The passes  that are sold by the unions at preferential prices or provided  altogether without charge and paid for from the social insurance  fund are regarded by the tax inspectorate, apparently, as  citizens' supplementary income. Accordingly, income tax,  according to currency legislation, has to be collected from this  income.    An example: The full cost of a pass is R700,000; the  preferential 10 percent cost, R70,000; the income of the  vacationer (or patient), R630,000; income tax, R75,600. And even  if the pass is free, the tax forces a person to pay the treasury  R84,000. Yet the social insurance fund is formed from enterprise  deductions, that is, from wages, essentially.    At first sight the matter is clear: People need to be  exempted from this tax. But an attendant question arose at the  session also: Should this privilege be accorded to all in  succession or should its use be confined merely to needy  citizens? The latter proposal of Deputy M. Khafizov was  supported by President M. Shaymiyev also. As a result, the  Legislation Commission received the assignment of urgent  modification of the bill. Then Deputy K. Iskhakov presented a  draft decree on the procedure of implementation of the Public  Service Act. The act itself was adopted at the previous session,  and VEDOMOSTI has already written about its content. It remains  to add that the law will be introduced gradually and that  government officials will start their free leave travel in 1995.    Serious problems arose over the law on off-budget funds.  Things had gone well at the morning sitting, seemingly, and the  first two articles were, albeit not without difficulty, adopted.  In the break something [line missing] began to kill article  after article. One clearly had the feeling that some people had  done some active work with them. Who might this have been?    If it is considered that from the very start of business of  the present Supreme Soviet the government has carefully been  withdrawing the off-budget funds from the deputies' control, the  first suspicion is clear. It is, in fact, the last one also  inasmuch as no one other than the government has such a level of  influence on the corps of deputies. Ultimately the bill was sent  for modification.    After an early lunch, which came about on account of  problems  over modification of the budget act, the session adopted quite  rapidly the "resort" act, after which came one further  unscheduled break, and for the same reason. The intensive  bargaining in the Planning and Budget Commission with the  participation of the government produced no result.    Ultimately the deputies were offered a draft budget with  expenditure approximately one-fourth in excess of revenue. How,  we would like to know, is this difference to be covered?    In the February budget this question was solved simply--by  money issue. But Tatarstan does not have its own printing press,  and it will be necessary, consequently, to look for some other  ways.    The budget was not adopted, and the deputies will,  therefore,  work tomorrow also.</p>

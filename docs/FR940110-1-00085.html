			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.21(a)(5) of the proposed rule provides that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council member who, subsequent to appointment, is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer employed by or associated with a community or nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization actively involved in providing or promoting low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income housing in the Bank's District may continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve on the Advisory Council until the end of his or her term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowing the Advisory Council member to serve out the remainder of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her term promotes continuity in the collective experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Advisory Council. Further, the member may still have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant experience related to low-income housing needs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District, which may continue to benefit the Advisory Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Board recognizes that the Advisory Council member may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer represent the interests of the community and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sector. Therefore, the Board specifically requests comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision of the proposed rule. The Board also specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on whether a member who is no longer employed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or associated with a community or nonprofit organization should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled to vote on the Advisory Council if he or she becomes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state or local housing finance agency official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(b) of the proposed rule provides that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council shall elect from among its voting members a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chairperson and a vice chairperson.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(c) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of the Board's existing AHP regulation that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council shall designate a member, or request that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member of the Bank's staff be designated, to act as secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Advisory Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(g). The secretary shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record and maintain the minutes of the meetings of the Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council, which shall contain, among other things, a record of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons present, a description of the matters discussed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations made. The person acting as secretary at a meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall certify to the accuracy of the minutes of that meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(d)(1) of the proposed rule adds a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that, prior to the approval of the Bank's proposed AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan by the Bank's board of directors, the Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council shall review the proposed AHP implementation plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provide its recommendations to the Bank's board of directors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the requirements of &sect;960.2(c) discussed above under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section on the adoption of the AHP implementation plan. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is intended to give the Advisory Councils a greater role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in advising the Banks on how AHP funds should be allocated to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the low-income housing needs in their Districts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(d)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that upon request of the Advisory Council, the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide the Advisory Council with copies of any AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications from prior AHP funding cycles. The Board is aware  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some Banks have already adopted this practice. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is intended to aid the Advisory Council members in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating how the AHP application priorities and scoring criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation of AHP funds among different types of housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, this requirement is subject to any limitations of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laws that may require the Bank to keep information in an AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application confidential. The Bank may require Advisory Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members to agree to keep all or parts of AHP applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidential. The Board specifically requests comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages and disadvantages of allowing Advisory Council members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to examine AHP applications received by the Bank in prior AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding cycles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(e) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council shall meet with representatives of the board of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directors of the Bank at least quarterly to advise the Bank on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low- and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District and on the utilization of AHP subsidized advances and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidies for these purposes. See 12 CFR 960.14(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(f) of the proposed rule requires each Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council to submit to the Board annually by March 1 its analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the low-income housing activity of its Bank. This is a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the January 31 date in the Board's existing AHP regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is intended to give the Advisory Councils sufficient time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the end of the year to compile and evaluate year-end data in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to prepare their reports to the Board. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.14(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

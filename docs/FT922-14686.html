			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Labour tax plans may deter expatriates LABOUR'S TAX proposals would make London a less attractive location for expatriates than other European cities, according to an analysis by a consultancy group, Andrew Jack writes. The International Employer, part of Sedgwick Financial Services, said yesterday London would become the most costly of a selection of European cities after Brussels for an expatriate upper middle manager with two children on a three-year contract at Dollars 1.38m (Pounds 790,000). London is currently the fourth most costly, at Dollars 1.04m, after Brussels, Paris and Geneva, assuming a basic annual salary of Dollars 84,000 plus school fees and housing allowances. The analysis does not include the effect of tax changes that might take place in any other countries.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Interactive TV move for Dutch group KPN, the Dutch telecommunications company which is due to be privatised before the end of June, has made its first move into interactive television by agreeing to take a 50 per cent stake in Teleworld, a fast-growing Dutch company with teletext activities in 10 countries. The investment will also mean that KPN will be joining forces in interactive television with Philips, Europe's largest television manufacturer, which already owns 43.7 per cent of the company and is poised to raise this to 50 per cent. KPN will be buying its shares in Teleworld from the company's founder Mr Peter Schouten, who currently owns 54 per cent of the capital. The transformation of Teleworld into a 50/50 joint venture between KPN's telecommunications arm PTT Telecom and Philips will also involve the buy-out of a few smaller shareholders. Teleworld, which was established in 1990 and now has turnover of Fl 40m (Dollars 20.5m) and a workforce of 130, is active in nine countries in north western Europe, including the UK, and in Malaysia. Its activities include the provision of interactive games and information services on a teletext basis for commercial television operators.</p>

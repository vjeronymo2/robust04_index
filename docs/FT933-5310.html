			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer disappoints The worst individual performance from any of the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Sun Alliance, the composite insurance company, which closed 20, or 5.2 per cent, down at 367p, having touched 361p at one point, after the group announced a disappointing net asset value figure for the half year along with its interim results. Sun Alliance shares approached their all-time high of 398p, reached in March 1991, last week, shrugging aside recent market rumours that the insurer's interims could be accompanied by a sizeable rights issue. However, dealers said the slide in the share price was not accompanied by any great volume of selling pressure. Turnover in Sun Alliance was 3.1m. The company's profits figures were above most market expectations, but dealers expressed concern about the reduction in the group's solvency ratio, from 54 per cent to 50 per cent. The proposed Pounds 300m preference share issue 'removes the threat of a big cash call on shareholders', said an analyst.</p>

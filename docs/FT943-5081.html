			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Putting the marital home on the line - In a nutshell Before you put your house on the line to obtain finance for the business, tell your spouse. According to chartered accountants Moores Rowland, banks are increasingly likely to insist that partners know the full extent of their other half's commitments before agreeing overdrafts. The concern follows the case of Barclays Bank v O'Brien. The House of Lords has ruled that a charge the bank had on the marital home should be set aside because it was felt the bank had failed to bring home to Mrs O'Brien the risk which she ran by signing the documents. Mrs O'Brien's husband had led her to believe the security was limited to Pounds 60,000 and would be in place for only three weeks, says David Rogers, Moores Rowland partner. When the overdraft reached Pounds 150,000 the bank brought proceedings to enforce the charge. The charge was set aside because the document Mrs O'Brien signed secured finance to her husband's company in which she did not have an interest.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION  </P> <P> I read with interest your July 19 story on how the "battle over the teaching of  evolution" is heating up again. I spend some time on that issue in my course in  science and modern culture at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Ever since Darwin, the creation-evolution issue has been like an underground  fire that erupts every so often. Could the problem really be that people are  trying to resolve things by arguing them out within the arena of science  itself?  </P> <P> When you dig down to the roots, don't you find the philosophical issue of  whether or not a God somehow superintended whatever processes brought life into  existence on this planet? What if I won the California lottery, or had an  amazing recovery from some catastrophic illness, and then asked science to tell  me whether or not divine providence was involved? Do you really think it could?  </P> <P> The problem with evolution is that, at least in the minds of a great many  people, it seems to carry so much philosophical baggage along with it. If the  word "evolution" is taken to embrace a satisfying explanation for the existence  of all life on this planet, then the philosophical implications are absolutely  enormous!  </P> <P> I sometimes fantasize of a time when we could simply just stop using the word  evolution in scientific contexts. We could create other terms with more  precisely defined scientific meanings. The reason this is unacceptable to so  many scientists is that they like the philosophical baggage carried by the term  evolution. Why not find a way to teach just science in the K-12 science  classroom and leave the philosophical baggage out!  </P> <P> MARK C. BIEDEBACH  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

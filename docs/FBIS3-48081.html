A newspaper reporter in Seoul, while having a conversation  with his colleagues about the situation, said: European and  American big powers are conspiring with each other in putting  pressure upon North Korea under the pretext of the fictitious  "nuclear issue" in an attempt to stifle the socialist system of  the North, but the North is braving it.    The North is demonstrating the might of the Republic  entirely  thanks to the outstanding guidance of the leader Kim Chong-il,  the great statesman, he noted, adding:    The leader Kim Chong-il who has literary and military  accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander with firm  faith, a distinguished great politician with correct judgment  and outstanding leadership ability and a prominent leader of the  international socialist movement who is guiding the movement for  rebuilding socialism, standing in the centre of world politics.    A university professor in Seoul told his students: Mr. Kim  Chong-il is a man with gifted qualification. He is not only a  great man of learning, a great master of idea and theory but a  master of political art who is leading people to social progress  by applying knowledge and theory. This is eloquently proved by  the course of dramatic changes in political, economic and  cultural domains of the North.    It is good luck of our fellow countrymen to have held such a  peerless great man as Mr. Kim Chong-il in high esteem as the  lodestar of the nation.    A certain Yi in Kangso District, Seoul, told his villagers:  I firmly believe that as Mr. Kim Chong-il looks after our  people, the country would be reunified before long and people  would be well off under his leadership. It is General Kim  Il-song and Mr. Kim Chong-il who we should believe and follow.</p>

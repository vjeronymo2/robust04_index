			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Flat quarter at Waste Management WASTE Management, the multi-national environmental and sanitation services company, yesterday reported fourth-quarter operating results of Dollars 206.2m, or 42 cents a share, virtually unchanged from the 1991 fourth quarter of Dollars 207m, or 42 cents. The 1992 figures exclude a 5 cent per share charge for restructuring at Brand Companies and Chemical Waste Management subsidiaries, while the 1991 results exclude a 37 cents a share one-time charge for environmental liabilities. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 2bn. Mr Jim McDonald, securities analyst with the Chicago Corporation, said the results were slightly below Wall Street estimates because of an earnings shortfall at Chemical Waste Management, expenses related to an expansion in North American sales staff and unfavourable foreign exchange conversions. For the year, operating earnings advanced to Dollars 828.8m, or Dollars 1.68 a share, from Dollars 773.4m, or Dollars 1.57, in 1991, excluding extraordinary charges and gains in both periods. Sales were Dollars 8.7bn, up from Dollars 7.6bn.</p>

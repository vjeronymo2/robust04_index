			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Retail sales show patchy increase Retail sales grew last month at their fastest annual rate since December last year, the Confederation of British Industry says today. The CBI's distributive trades survey of 15,000 outlets in the retail, wholesale and motor trades shows that retailers last month reported growth in sales volumes at a much higher level than in the previous two months. The buoyancy of retail sales runs counter to anecdotal and survey evidence of a slowdown in consumer demand. However, the CBI results may be related to the sharp jump in September of the annual growth rate of M0, the narrow measure of money supply. M0 has traditionally been closely linked with retail sales. Official figures for retail sales growth in September will be published tomorrow. A total of 49 per cent of retailers reported higher sales volumes in the year to September while 21 per cent said they were lower. The difference between the two, a positive balance of 28 per cent, was up from a 2 per cent balance in August. Sales were also higher than retailers had expected. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel, said: 'The pick-up in high-street trade reported in September confirms that the trend in retail sales remains firmly upward.' He added, however, that the underlying annual growth in volumes had levelled out in the past few months and followed 'quite an uneven path over most of the year so far'. The survey shows that nearly all retailers reported strong volume growth in the year to September. The biggest increases were in the footwear and leather sector, where the improvement was the strongest since September last year. Chemists and specialist food retailers such as butchers, bakers and greengrocers reported a decline in annual sales volume growth. The bulk of the growth in retailing came from mail order groups and big multiple stores. Single outlets reported a modest increase in volume of sales. Wholesalers reported sharp annual growth rates for sales volumes last month, showing a positive balance of 55 percentage points, the strongest annual rate since June. Motor traders reported a fall in sales volumes in the year to September, with a negative balance of 4 per cent. This was the lowest balance since December 1993, and much lower than expected. Both retailers and wholesalers believe sales volumes will rise in October while motor traders expect a further fall. The CBI warned, however, that expectations of retail sales had been fulfilled in only three surveys this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     ANNUAL GROWTH IN SALES VOLUMES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Jan   Feb  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retailing                    +25   +26   +23   +34   +15   +10 Grocers                       +5   +25   +62   +60   +39   +40 Specialist food              -14   -15   +10   +25   -26   -36 Off licences                 +23   -41   -61   -42   +15   +19 Clothing                     +14   +51   +32   +29   +19   +17 Footwear and leather         +84   +59   +12   +48   +38     0 Durable household goods      -16   +13   -21   +17   +20    +6 Furniture and carpets        +17   +69   -29    +8   +18   +36 Hardware, china &amp; DIY        +23    +5   +10   +29    -5   +12 Confectionery                  0    -8   +36   +22   -10    -1 Booksellers &amp; stationers     +20   +50   +18   +48   +48   +17 Chemists                     +61   +16   +74   +83   +18    -8 Other retail                 +14   +19   +13   +25   -10   -38 Motor trade                  +15   +16   +14    -5   +50   +45  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug    Sep  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retailing                    +12   +22   +12   +27   +12    +2    +28 Grocers                      +37   +33   +26   +38   +39    +9     +1 Specialist food               +4    +9   -44   +15   -12   -40    -25 Off licences                  +4   +32   +36   +43   +50   +36    +22 Clothing                     +19   +40   +28   +35    +6   +25    +59 Footwear and leather          11   +42   +75   +43   +18   +11    +81 Durable household goods      +29    +6   +17   +29   +20   +35    +49 Furniture and carpets        -38   +27    -2   +31   -34   -48    +60 Hardware, china &amp; DIY        -13    -1   +29   -15    +5    +2    +48 Confectionery                +36   +39   +18    +4   +23    +8    +10 Booksellers &amp; stationers     +47    +2    -5   +42   +23   -19    +52 Chemists                     -31   -53   -39    -5   +38   +12     -8 Other retail                  -4    +7   +13   +28   +15    +2    +21 Motor trade                  +22   +24   +16   +12    -2    +9     -4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- balance = % of respondents reporting up/good minus % reporting           down/poor.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Foreign policy step up for Clinton friend Mr Strobe Talbott, the Clinton administration's most prominent Russian expert, was yesterday named deputy secretary of state, replacing Mr Clifton Wharton, who was in effect fired last month. The 47-year-old former journalist with Time magazine was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and a room-mate of President Bill Clinton, with whom he has retained a close personal relationship. Mr Talbott is a newcomer to government but, over the last year, he has won the confidence of Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, in the specially created portfolio of ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet republics. He will continue to exercise responsibility in this critical area of US foreign policy, with his current deputy, Mr James Collins, former number two at the Moscow embassy, becoming acting ambassador-at-large. The elevation suggests that the newly modified US approach to reform in Russia - in Mr Talbott's words, 'less shock, more therapy' - will remain in place for the foreseeable future. Mr Talbott was picked by Mr Christopher from a changing short list that included several diplomats with more formal bureaucratic experience, among them Mr Tom Pickering, ambassador to Russia, Mr Winston Lord, under-secretary for Asian affairs, and Mr Morton Abramowitz, head of the Carnegie Endowment, a Washington think-tank, but a critic of US policies on Bosnia. His appointment is expected to presage a further shake-up in the upper reaches of the widely criticised State Department. Among the candidates for early departure are Mr Samuel Lewis, head of the policy planning staff. There was even speculation yesterday that Mr Talbott had emerged as a prospective secretary of state in case Mr Christopher leaves during Mr Clinton's first term. Mr Talbott, partly because of his journalistic career and his familiarity with Washington ways, is reckoned good at those aspects of the public presentation of foreign policy in which the often dour Mr Christopher is considered deficient.</p>

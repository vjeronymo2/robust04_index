			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Chambers attack insolvency laws Conflicts of interest which could arise when accountants investigating companies are then appointed as its receivers should be examined by the government, says the British Chambers of Commerce. The government should also consider the scope for establishing an independent watchdog to protect creditors' rights and oversee the sale of any assets by receivers back to the directors of an insolvent company. A document prepared by the Mid-Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which is to be circulated to other member bodies across the country today, is the latest in a series of attacks on insolvency law. It substantially extends the scope of reform proposed in a consultative report issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last year. The DTI suggested reforms to Company Voluntary Arrangements, an insolvency procedure introduced in 1986 and widely criticised for its lack of effectiveness. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British chambers, said: 'Insolvency law is not something people lie dreaming about, but we have identified what we believe to be some quite serious flaws in legislation.' The chambers' document is expected to call for discussion of whether there should be a clearer division of roles when banks which appoint accountants to investigate the affairs of a company also appoint that firm as receivers. It stresses that it has not discovered any evidence of accountants recommending that a business be put into insolvency to generate more work. It argues, however, that there is conflict between the interests of the bank or other secured creditors and the interests of other creditors and management. It says there is concern among creditors about the sale of assets back to directors of insolvent companies. There is also concern for greater vigilance of fraud. The document argues for greater flexibility by government collection agencies such as the Inland Revenue, which are often the creditors that trigger company insolvencies because they have little discretion to make com-mercial judgments about a company. In line with a highly critical report from the National Audit Office last year, it urges the DTI to actively prosecute, disqualify and debar directors where there are concerns about their conduct. It calls for simplification of administration, another procedure introduced in 1986. It says the courts should be bypassed and the decision of whether to grant an administration order handed to insolvency practitioners. It also argues for modifications to company voluntary arrangements so that they are no longer linked to administration orders.</p>

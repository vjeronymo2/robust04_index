			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON WINE: 'DANCING STARS'  </P> <P> "TO GIVE BIRTH to a dancing star, one must have chaos within," the German  philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote. And stellar wines are what Sebastiani  Vineyards is producing now, four years after a highly publicized schism in the  Sebastiani family.  </P> <P> Under the aggressive direction of Don Sebastiani, who took over the management  after his elder brother, Sam, was fired by their mother in 1986, the nation's  sixth-largest winery and No. 1 producer of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon  has doubled its case production and sales, from 2.2 million cases in 1986 to  4.4 million cases at the close of the decade.  </P> <P> With Jim Knapp, the winery's director of communications, I recently tasted  Sebastiani's "dancing stars" from the Sebastiani Estates Group. The collection  of vineyard-designated Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon was made by wine maker  Mary Sullivan with grapes from five Sonoma Valley locations.  </P> <P> All were beguiling. Some brief descriptions:  </P> <P> KINNEYBROOK 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). From non-irrigated Sonoma  Valley slopes, this wine is round and rich.  </P> <P> WILDWOOD HILL 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). A vanilla-cream taste, from  the full malolactic fermentation and from fully ripe grapes of September  harvest. Delicate in style.  </P> <P> WILSON RANCH 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). Bouquet suggestions of ripe  pear, refined oak hints from eight months in Limousin and Nevers barrels. Needs  time to reach its potential richness.  </P> <P> CLARK RANCH 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). The most complex in taste of  these wines, with anise-like fragrance beyond the butterscotch and pear  bouquet. A wine of striking elegance; satin-smooth.  </P> <P> CHERRYBLOCK 1986 Sonoma Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($17.50). No harsh edges,  fine varietal character exemplified by ripe cherry tastes, tobacco-leaf scents,  chocolate-smooth texture. Ready to enjoy, but has good aging potentials.

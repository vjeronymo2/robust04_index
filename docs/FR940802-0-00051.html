			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Air Quality Impacts Under the Simple Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air quality effects of today's rule under the Simple Model are, for the most part, expected to be similar to those under the Complex Model, since the effects on fuel composition are expected to be similar with two main exceptions. First, significant ETBE use is not expected to be possible before the summer of 1996. Second, EPA anticipates that in order to meet the requirements of today's program and the existing RFG program, refiners may find it necessary for the first few years to blend additional oxygenates into their RFG beyond the level necessary to meet the 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement. In particular, refiners may find it necessary to blend up to 10 percent ethanol by volume during the winter months in RFG markets with the supply, distribution, and blending capacity to do so. Until the distribution and blending infrastructure for ethanol use is expanded, it is unlikely that this increase in ethanol use will be offset through oxygenate trading given the limitations of the RFG program. Since ETBE use will be limited, and since the volume of ethanol used will be similar to the volume of MTBE displaced during the winter (10 vs. 11 volume percent), dilution effects may be small during the first few years of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the effects of dilution on emission performance may not be reflected fully in Simple Model compliance calculations since it does not account for all the fuel effects included in the Complex Model, EPA would expect any resulting air quality effects to be minimal for several reasons. First, as discussed above, EPA expects the dilution effects to be minimal during the first years of the program. Second, RFG producers are required under the Simple Model to not exceed their 1990 baseline levels of sulfur, T90, and olefins. These caps limit the risk of any detrimental air quality effects related to differences in dilution. Furthermore, the economic incentives of gasoline production may result in refiners producing at or near these caps, regardless of the type or volume of oxygenate used. Third, refiners are unlikely to invest in processing equipment to produce gasoline during 1995&hyph;1997 which will make it more difficult for them to comply with the 1998 requirements under the Complex Model. Fourth, any remaining risks are limited to the three-year period during which the Simple Model is in effect. Fifth, some refiners may opt to use the Complex Model prior to 1998, which would have the effect of controlling any detrimental environmental effects related to changes in dilution or oxygenate type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above with regard to the impacts on air toxics emissions resulting from changes in oxygenate type, today's rule does not alter the performance standards under the Simple Model. Nevertheless, EPA does recognize that the reduced toxics emission benefits of ethanol and ETBE relative to MTBE under the Simple Model (as under the Complex Model) may increase toxics compliance costs, as discussed in section III.C. In addition, depending on how refiners chose to adjust their fuels to offset the loss in air toxics performance, the complex model may suggest some degradation in in-use (as opposed to certification) air toxics emissions performance with the use of ethanol or ETBE instead of MTBE which is not accounted for by the Simple Model. As explained in more detail in the RIA, this situation arises due to differences between how the Simple Model and Complex model predict air toxics emission performance. If some refiners choose to maintain air toxics emission performance by reducing aromatics instead of benzene, then the complex model suggests less in-use emission performance is achieved in-use with ethanol or ETBE than with MTBE. However, EPA expects few refiners to choose to maintain air toxics emission performance by reducing aromatics for two reasons. First, aromatics control is, in general, believed to be the more costly of the two approaches. Second, refiners are unlikely to invest in processing equipment to comply with the simple model for 1995&hyph;1997 which will not also provide compliance under the complex model in 1998. Regardless of which approach refiners take, however, this issue does not exist for that fuel certified under early use of the complex model, and disappears entirely in 1998 with mandatory use of the complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

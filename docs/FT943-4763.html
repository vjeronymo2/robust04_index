			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Medeva shares rise on 70% advance Shares in Medeva rose 23p to 151p yesterday after the acquisitive pharmaceuticals company announced a 70 per cent increased in first half profits. The improvement was fuelled mainly by increased US demand for methylphenidate, its treatment for hyperactivity in children and young adults, which helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 13m to Pounds 22.1m. Sales of the drug more than doubled and accounted for 60 per cent of the increase in turnover from Pounds 80.1m to Pounds 107m in the six months to June 30. Mr Bill Bogie, chief executive, declined to reveal the proportion of profits derived from methylphenidate, but he warned that its recent growth was unlikely to be sustained in the second half. Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said the rising sales and share price showed the group had recovered from its problems last year, when a profits warning sent the shares tumbling from 216p to 116p. The company also announced that Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the co-founder and former managing director, was standing down as a non-executive director. Mr Gowrie-Smith said he had decided to resign because of possible conflicts of interests with his activities at Brightstone, the consultancy firm formed with Mr David Lees, his long-time business partner, who resigned as Medeva's finance director in March. Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to 4.9p (3.8p) and the interim dividend has been increased to 1.1p (0.9p) with a scrip alternative. COMMENT Medeva is in danger of developing a dependency. Methylphenidate is thought to have accounted for the bulk of profit increase, and it already has a rival in the US, its main market. Having made a partial recovery from last year's profits warning debacle, further acquisitions could also be a little hasty as it has not yet fully bedded down its existing products and infiltrated important markets such as Italy. Nevertheless, seasonal sales of its respiratory and asthma products should lift full-year profits to about Pounds 58m. The shares are pretty inexpensive on a forward multiple of about 11, but Medeva has lot to prove.</p>

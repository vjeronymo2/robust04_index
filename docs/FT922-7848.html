			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Test of wills soon over Jubilee extension GOOD TRANSPORT links have always been seen as crucial to the future of Canary Wharf and London's Docklands. But with the final shape of Canary Wharf now in doubt, one question to be answered is whether those transport plans will be scaled back. Projected government spending on Docklands transport is colossal. Over the next five years, the bill for upgrading the Docklands Light Railway, extending London Underground's Jubilee Line and completing the road links is expected to reach Pounds 3.5bn - many times more than is being spent on transport in the rest of the badly congested capital. The government's commitment to the regeneration of Docklands means most of that spending will still go ahead. Road construction and the upgrading of the Docklands Light Railway are in any case too far advanced to be halted. Where doubts do arise, however, is over the two transport links in which Olympia &amp; York is financially involved - the RiverBus and the Jubilee Line extension. The RiverBus, a high-speed ferry service running every 20 minutes along the Thames from Chelsea Harbour to Canary Wharf and Greenwich, is in danger of becoming an early casualty if O&amp;Y collapses. Heavily loss-making, it has only survived this long because O&amp;Y was prepared to finance it as a stop-gap service pending the completion of other transport links. It only seems likely to continue if any successors to O&amp;Y decide the losses are outweighed by the value of the direct links provided by the ferry between Canary Wharf and British Rail's London Bridge, Charing Cross and Waterloo stations. The Jubilee Line extension from central London to Canary Wharf and Stratford, in east London - the most important link of all - also faces uncertainty. At Pounds 1.7bn it accounts for nearly half the projected Docklands transport spending. In recognition of the fact that the value of the Canary Wharf development would be greatly enhanced by the Jubilee Line extension, O&amp;Y had agreed to put Pounds 400m towards the construction cost. But only Pounds 100m was to be paid during the construction period: the remaining Pounds 300m was due in staged payments long into the future, so its effective present value was small. O&amp;Y and the Department of Transport had yet to sign a legal agreement covering the details of the deal. But the department has a letter from O&amp;Y committing the company to the financial contribution, and ministers regard this as binding on the company and its successors. What remains to be seen, however, is whether O&amp;Y's banks see it this way, or whether they would try calling the government's bluff and default, in the expectation that the government would pick up the tab. The government's view is that whoever takes control of Canary Wharf would accept that Pounds 100m is a small price to pay to secure the Underground line, given the fact that the investment will be recouped many times over through the enhancement of Canary Wharf's value. Conversely, without the line, Canary Wharf could become next to worthless. But O&amp;Y's banks are also aware that the extension of the Jubilee Line is crucial not just to Canary Wharf, but to Docklands in general; they may gamble that the political price of not proceeding with the project would be far greater than the missing Pounds 100m. Whichever way, it seems likely that the line will be built. But the bigger question is over the timing. London Transport warned yesterday that it could not hold its project team together indefinitely. If the uncertainty lasts much longer, and the project team is disbanded, the Jubilee Line could be badly delayed - with all that implies for Canary Wharf and Docklands as a whole.</p>

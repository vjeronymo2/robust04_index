			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" was a very well done but disturbing documentary. A  better title for it would have been "Why Vincent Chin Was Killed," as it  brought out that racial prejudice is still very strong and rampant in our  society, and was a motivating factor behind the killing. The only question I  have is: How can someone who robs a bank get a 15-year sentence, while another  who stalks and savagely beats a person to death with a baseball bat only gets  three years probation?  </P> <P> No wonder people get frustrated by our criminal justice system, as it seems  like those who are rich or who have had no prior criminal record can literally  get away with murder. Thanks goodness for public television, as it seems they  are about the only ones who are willing to show programs such as "Chin."  </P> <P> Kenneth L. Zimmerman, Cypress  </P></p>

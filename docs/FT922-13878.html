			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (10): The attraction of ethics / Finding a new subject on the syllabus FROM THE country that fostered Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken is a subject coming to a management education syllabus near you soon: business ethics. Under the surface of the profit motive, many executives of the future are beginning to call for classes preparing them for wider responsibilities. While the 1980s in the UK have been associated by many with a selfish individualism driven by the spirit of private enterprise, an undercurrent of corporate responsibility has also been on the rise. Since the late 1970s in the US, business schools have been introducing courses reflecting students' concerns with the ethical decisions they may face day-by-day in corporations. Commentators say demand has been driven by growing concern over a succession of corporate and political scandals which emerged during the decade. Now the same concerns are infiltrating courses in the UK and Europe. At a conference in London last September, more than 100 academics and business executives gathered to discuss subjects as diverse as ethics during a recession, the slot machine and gambling industry, and Czechoslovak attitudes to privatisation. These initiatives have been foreshadowed by the growing interest in areas such as ethical investment, better environmental practices and good employment policies, which have given rise to a number of organisations and an expanding literature over the past few years. Professor Andrew Likierman at the London Business School recalls a group of students approaching him in the early 1980s with an interest in discussing ethical issues in the workplace as well as the more 'mechanical' skills generally on offer in the curriculum. The school responded with an optional course in 1987 which has run several times since and has been consistently well attended. Mr Brian Harvey, from the education department at Nottingham University and secretary of the European Business Ethics Network and author of a study of corporate social policy for managers, says: 'I definitely have the impression that more business schools are offering courses now.' Last year he ran a course in the university's school of management and finance attended by 30 students. Now through the network he is involved in the production of a number of case studies on European business ethics for class teaching, to supplement the existing widely-used material which comes from the US. These include a study of the issues surrounding the marketing of RU 486, the 'morning-after' contraceptive developed in France, the tensions between a chemical company and an environmental pressure group, and the difficulties facing IBM managers in Germany trying to reconcile the need to make redundancies at a plant which is no longer required with the company's traditional commitment to employees and the local community. He says much of the development of ethics in the US has been driven by the strong sense of community involvement by business, in turn reflecting a traditionally less active belief in the role of the state. Prof Likierman argues that not only is business more central to society in the US, but also people are more willing to be frank about the dilemmas they may face at work. He says the subject is an important one, and beginning to spread to the UK and elsewhere, but he adds: 'To be frank, it is not absolutely the thing of the 1990s. It is not just a fashion, but neither has it been very seriously tackled yet.' Mr Kirk Hanson, senior lecturer at the Stanford business school in California, says there is a great deal of interest from US corporations  - many of which have now launched codes of ethics governing their operations. He sees the biggest problem not as raising money to teach and research the subject, but in finding people to teach it. Business ethics is still a relatively unstructured academic specialism, and is often more controlled by philosophers and theologians who have turned their attention to business than by business school lecturers themselves. Prof Likierman says there are also difficulties in deciding how to introduce ethics into the curriculum. Theoretically, there are ethical issues which ought to be discussed in every course on offer. 'But n o t everyone finds it easy to teach, or is willing to find room by pushing out what they regard as a central part of their course,' he says. In fact, most of the courses on offer are not only demarcated rather than integrated, but also optional. He is keen to dispel the notion that business ethics is about insider dealing, however. 'That is a clear criminal act, not an ethical issue,' he says. By contrast, he points to trading with South Africa - or, perhaps more difficult, a right-wing dictatorship. There may be sensible business reasons for not conducting such trade, such as the higher risks involved. But will business with the regime help prop it up, or will good practices help bring about reform more quickly? Similarly, where does corporate hospitality cease and bribery begin? 'Morality and business do not always conflict,' he says. Mr Hanson agrees. 'Ethics is extremely complex. You very quickly get away from a definition about law-breaking. It's primarily a question of balance rather than about black and white,' he says. Most academics introducing ethics into business school curricula stress that they are not intending to provide students with rights and wrongs. What they hope to do is offer students a chance to recognise and discuss the ethical dimensions of the environment in which they work, and have the critical ability to make better decisions as a result. But in true business school style, ought they not now to be able to evaluate and quantify the scale of their success? Are there any signs yet that the new breed of ethically-trained managers are cleaning up business? 'It's hard to tell. We can't say there have been 43 per cent fewer indictments among our graduates,' says Mr Hanson. But if interest from both companies and students is anything to go by, the companies of the future should be better equipped to address the most ancient of issues.</p>

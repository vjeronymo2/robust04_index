			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DAMS SUFFER LITTLE EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE  </P> <P> The earthquake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17 caused little or no  damage to most of the 102 dams within 50 miles of its epicenter, state  engineers reported. The most severe cracking was to the Austrian Dam on Lake  Elsman, owned by the San Jose Water Co., seven miles south-southeast of Los  Gatos and about eight miles from the epicenter, they said. Engineers conducted  the survey for the Division of Safety of Dams, which is in the Department of  Water Resources. Repairs are in progress at the Austrian Dam and will begin  shortly at several other dams in the area owned by the Santa Clara Valley Water  District. They are Lexington Dam, two miles south of Los Gatos; Vasona Dam, two  miles north of Los Gatos, and Guadalupe Dam, five miles southeast of Los Gatos.  Minor longitudinal cracking was discovered at Newell Dam, owned by the city of  Santa Cruz, nine miles southwest of Los Gatos.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpen: "What One Can See and What One </F> Cannot See on the Television Screen"]    [Text] Frankly, we did not want to return to this subject.  VECHIRNIY KYYIV has often criticized the provincialism, low  artistic and professional level of television programs,  undemocratic atmosphere, and the introduction of internal  political censorship at the state television and radio company.  Naturally, in doing so, it was not our intention to insult the  directors of the company and, least of all, our fellow  journalists, who have very little influence over what is  happening under the existing system. The purpose of our  criticism -- and various people have expressed themselves on  this subject -- was to help eliminate the shortcomings listed  above. Like the majority of television viewers and radio  listeners, we are sincerely concerned about national television  and radio broadcasting, and it pains us to see its backwoods  [sharovarnu --from "sharovary" -- the baggy pantaloons  originally worn by the Cossacks, now symbolizing the folkloric  traditions promoted by Soviet authorities in place of normal  cultural development] ineptness. To be sure, standing out  against the general backdrop of drabness, we find some  successful programs and brilliant journalists, but these are not  able to reveal their full potential and evolve into a system  that would allow us to give a sigh of relief that here, at last,  we are witnessing the emergence of our own national television.    Naively, one might have expected that the serious criticism  (which appeared in many newspapers, not just the VECHIRKA) would  produce serious changes in the television and radio company  itself. But this did not happen; a few cosmetic changes and a  reshuffling among the top management did not result in any  improvements. There are two reasons for this: first, the state  television and radio company is fully financed by the state and  has no serious competition, and, second, the small group of top  managers, headed by Mr. Okhmakevych and Mr. Pasak, have  established a strong defensive position on this state-protected  high ground out of range of cannon fire. As for any competitors  that emerge on the inside, the company has learned to make short  work of them very quickly.    Thus this particular piece has been provoked by an article  by  Vitaliy Ablitsov, director of the Kultura Creative Association  of Ukrainian Television [UT], that appeared in the newspaper  HOLOS UKRAYINY on 5 February 1994 under the title: "UT: A Symbol  of Provincialism or the Rebirth of Hope?" Understandably, Mr.  Ablitsov assumes the role of advocate of the management, but  even he cannot help but admit that "Ukrainian television  as an integral system of the electronic medium of communication  simply does not exist. What we have today is merely an aggregate  of television broadcasts and programs gasping for breath in the  vise of foreign-language television networks. The authors of  these programs, because of our technical backwardness, and  frequently due to their own creative ineptness, are incapable of  handling the swelling flood of information."    The author then proceeds to portray the criticism of the UT  management that had appeared in the newspapers NEZAVISIMOST,  VECHIRNIY KYYIV, and LIBERALNA HAZETA as a "noisy campaign on  the theme `Help! They are introducing censorship in television  and radio'." Yet he produces not a single argument to refute the  criticism published in the press. Instead, we find accusations  levelled in the usual Pasak style that the journalists from the  newspapers named above are, at best, creatively inept. Let these  charges remain on Mr. Ablitsov's conscience, while I cite an  example of how the internal climate at the television and radio  company is viewed by the company's own journalists.    "Let me name the employees of the state television and  radio company who at different times were forced to leave their  jobs either because they were hounded from their positions or  because they became totally disillusioned about the ability of  Mykola Okhmakevych's company to provide viewers with truthful  and honest information: Vasyl Yurychko -- vice-president of the  company (his ouster was masterminded by Viktor Pasak, who has  taken over his post); Mykola Orlovskyy -- former editor in chief  of UT's Main Information Department (he was ousted from his job  on Okhmakevych's orders by Yarema Frydrak, the former  vice-president of the company, who was later himself ousted by  Okhmakevych); Mykola Knyazhytskyy -- pushed out because of his  courageous political commentaries; Mykola Kanishevskyy -- could  no longer tolerate the atmosphere of lies that reigns at the  television company; Natalka Hryhorchuk -- correspondent of the  Main Information Department (the case against her was fabricated  by Ivan Kukhar, who, following a certain fiasco, was transferred  from his post as editor in chief of UT's Main Information  Department to his old position of director of the  correspondents' network).    "Stepan Demyanchuk, the general director of UT  programming, was harrassed for a prolonged period of time under  the personal direction of Okhmakevych, and only his death  "saved" him from being dismissed in disgrace.    "At Ukrainian Radio, persecution shortened the lives of  Mynko, Kulakivskyy, Bil. The person responsible for this was  Volodymyr Reznikov, who now heads the Main Directorate of  Programs at UT.    "This list is incomplete -- there is not enough time.  Let me just say that Kuzmenko is next on the hit list..."    I have not named the author for understandable reasons. Nor  have I provided the names of other journalists at the television  and radio company who are being persecuted by the management --  they are still employed by the company. But let me describe what  happened to the Hart Youth Program and its director, Viktor  Pavlyuk. Because the program criticized the governing  structures, it was not permitted to air and Viktor Pavlyuk was  threatened with dismissal. The incident became widely known.  Pavlyuk filed a suit in court, and Okhmakevych and Co. are doing  their best to hush up the conflict.    Having brought up the Hart Studio, we should mention that  the  stifling conservative atmosphere at the television and radio  company recently forced such talented journalists as Vasyl  Yatsura, Volodymyr Nechyporuk, and Serhiy Sotnychenko to leave  the company. They are now working for UNIAN. And what about the  many highly qualified television camera operators and video  engineers who found themselves jobs outside UT--at least half of  the entire staff has done so in recent years. Quite a few of  them have gone to Moscow. Given these facts, is it any wonder  that the level of our television programming is as low as it is?    Do the people in the government structures to whom the State  Television and Radio Company is answerable know all this? Of  course, they do: they received letters from the people who were  persecuted at this company. Then why do they not apply the  necessary measures? We can only assume that they think that it  is better to have this kind of management as long as it is  loyal, that it is better to have an inept television and radio  as long as it is biddable. The question of Mr. Okhmakevych's  directorship of the company has been raised several times in the  Supreme Council, but each time he has managed to get out of the  water without getting wet. It means a great deal to have  powerful patrons.    The handling of the election campaign -- perhaps the most  important event in the life of Ukraine today -- is a separate  topic that deserves mention. In this extremely important sphere,  national television and radio could do a great deal to provide  objective coverage of the process of putting forward candidates,  the registration of candidates for the office of deputy, the  candidates' ideas and programs. They could help citizens to find  their way around the myriad of names that have emerged on the  electoral horizon. They could -- if they wanted to. Not only are  our television and radio, which have been leased out to Messrs.  Kulyk and Pasak, not portraying the campaign objectively, but  they are failing to comply with the letter and spirit of the  Election Law. For example, candidates have absolutely no access  to UT-1 [Ukrainian Television's Channel 1]. Mr. Kulyk is of the  opinion that it is enough for political parties to present their  platforms. There is nothing wrong in that -- the people ought to  know what the parties stand for. But, first, the Election Law  gives the right of access to television and radio not only to  parties but also to candidates, associations of citizens, labor  collectives who put forward candidates, and other  representatives, and, second, what about the independent  candidates who do not belong to any party? Mr. Kulyk could not  care less.    Thus, UT-1 is virtually closed to candidates. UT's attitude  is: let them appear on regional programs. Meanwhile, UT-1 is  itself covertly taking part in the preelection struggle. For  instance, our readers have noted that for some reason attention  has recently been focused on the Popilnya Rayon of Zhytomyr  Oblast. If it isn't the presidential representative, then it's  the collective farm chairman on our television screens. Popilnya  has been receiving more television coverage in the last few  weeks than during the entire past year. The reason for all this  attention is very simple: that is where Mr. Okhmakevych himself  is running for the office of deputy. He has the right to do so  under the Election Law, but what has state television to do with  this?    Thus, contrary to the Election Law and common sense, the  management of the television and radio company has banished  candidates for the office of deputy from UT-1 and forced them to  go to regional television programs. Moreover, on instructions  from the management of the company, the Kiev program (on UT-2)  is now airing candidates' appearances from 1600 to 1800. Can  conscientous citizens who work in production and in institutions  benefit from television's role as an intermediary? It seems that  the television management has done everything in its power to  torpedo the election in the informational sphere. Whether it has  done so on its own initiative or at the behest of the government  -- I do not pretend to know. But facts are facts.    The last thing I want the management of the television and  radio company to think is that this article is in response to  the unceremonious interference in the form of a preelection  propaganda campaign waged against me by state radio on their  initiative. One would be hard put to find an incident of this  sort in a democratic country. No other state permits this kind  of pressure on voters. But this has no bearing on the subject  under discussion -- a subject that has long caused great concern  to all who care about the fate of national television and radio.    As to the direct participation of state television and radio  in the preelection propaganda campaign against me, why do so  covertly, anonymously, making use of the Kiev radio program,  whose journalists have no connection to this matter whatsoever?  I would like to suggest a simple but honest move to the esteemed  directors of the company: let us go public and hold a discussion  on live radio or television. I am willing to meet with either  Mr. Okhmakevych, or Mr. Pasak, or Mr. Kulyk, or all three. A  frank and open discussion which would allow both sides to have  their say and would be a democratic [word illegible], inasmuch  as people would have an opportunity to judge for themselves the  truth and [word illegible] of the arguments put forward by both  sides and draw their own conclusions.    I am at your service, gentlemen,    [Signed] Vitaliy Karpen</p>

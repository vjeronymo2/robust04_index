			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Swissair shares surge as group returns to profit SWISSAIR took analysts by surprise yesterday, reporting a return to profit in 1991 after a consolidated SFr22m (Dollars 14.70m) loss in 1990, and proposing a partial restoration of the dividend to SFr20 per share. Bearer shares of the Swiss international airline group rose SFr22 to SFr760 on the Zurich Stock Exchange following the news. Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said the SFr83m consolidated net profit was 'very gratifying', although the group was 'not satisfied with the result we recorded in 1991 as an airline'. The airline itself remained in loss, and the group profit was made possible only by an exceptionally large gain, SFr140m, from sales of old aircraft. In the previous year, only SFr85m had been raised from this source. Mr Loepfe said traffic volume declined 2.6 per cent as movements of passengers, cargo and mail all slumped during and after the Gulf war. The overall load factor was 63 per cent, compared with 65.8 per cent in 1990. However, the group's efforts to enhance revenues and cut costs bore some fruit. Airline revenues rose 5.2 per cent to SFr5.3bn, while expenses rose only 4 per cent to SFr4.9bn. Mr Loepfe said the break-even point for the airline had been lowered by 4.3 percentage points. Revenues from flight operations were up 4.4 per cent to SFr3.8bn, while services sold to other airlines gained 5.2 per cent to SFr914.8m. Mr Loepfe said directors decided to recommend that a dividend be paid partly because final profits showed an improvement in real terms. There was no payout in 1990. He said demand was likely to be slow this year, with a recovery foreseen in the second half. 'We must assume that the strong growth witnessed in the 1970s and 1980s is a thing of the past,' he said. However, Swissair had a strong financial base and was attempting to capitalise on its modern fleet, a new frequent flier programme, and on alliances with other airlines to improve its revenues and cut costs. Mr Loepfe reported that progress in implementing the group's Global Excellence alliance with Singapore Airlines and Delta Air Lines of the US had been delayed because of Delta's preoccupation with acquiring the European routes of Pan American. However, reservations systems would be linked from May 1, and 550 ticket offices worldwide were now issuing tickets for the three airlines.</p>

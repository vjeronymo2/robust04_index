			<p>BFN     [Text] A RID reporter has learned that the Republican and  Minsk City Councils [as heard] and the Movement for Democracy,  Social Progress, and Justice have issued appeals to presidential  candidates Dubko, Kebich, Lukashenka, and Novikaw.    The statements, in particular, urge the candidates to annul  the Viskuli agreements [leading to the dissolution of USSR], to  halt the (?capitalist) path of development of the Republic, to  strengthen and develop the soviets as organs of genuine power of  the people, to abolish the presidency, to terminate the  privatization of the all-people ownership, to liquidate the  existing state symbols by 3 July 1994, to recognize the equal  rights of the Belarusian and Russian languages, and to restore  the holiday on 7 November [the day when the socialist revolution  was held] in their election programs.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dairy farmers urged to capitalise on price rises UK dairy farmers must use the short-term increase in milk prices that will accompany market deregulation to invest for a secure future in an increasingly competitive European market, according to a report published today. The report by Adas, the government's farm advisory service, predicts a heavy concentration of ownership in the dairy sector in England and Wales by 2000. 'We estimate that 22 per cent of dairy farmers, equivalent to 6,500 producers, will leave the industry,' says the report, Options for Growth. The number of herds is expected to fall by 20 per cent and average herd size to grow by 4 per cent. 'If you want to stay in business, you will have to acquire more quota. . . It is vital that businesses plan now to ensure they will be in a position to purchase or lease when quota prices are more favourable.' The UK is expected to rise to the top of the EU price league when the market is liberalised in November and farmers are free to sell milk direct to dairy companies or to Milk Marque, a voluntary producers' co-operative that will act as a broker. But the Adas report says that competition from imported milk products will ultimately form a price ceiling for UK milk destined for manufacture into butter, cheese or yoghurt. The UK market reorganisation is proving highly controversial, with dairy companies unhappy at Milk Marque's control of at least 65 per cent of supplies in England and Wales. The Dairy Trade Federation begins legal action this week to try to overturn government approval of the new arrangements. It says Milk Marque's planned rise in prices will bring a flood of imports and damage the UK processing industry. The Adas report advises farmers to maximise milk yields. Britain has larger dairy farms and herd sizes on average than its main EU competitors, but lower production of milk per cow than Denmark, the Netherlands and France. Production costs are among the lowest in the EU but not as low as they might be given the UK's economies of scale, it says. 'The outlook for dairy farmers will depend on their ability to capitalise on the advantages of the UK industry and improve the relationship between output and costs.'

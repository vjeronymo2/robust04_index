			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / US-German link stressed by Clinton President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged themselves to close co-ordination of their efforts to bring the countries of central and eastern Europe into a common security system with the west, and to provide better trade access to western markets. On the first day of a two-day official visit, Mr Clinton underlined the special relationship which has developed between the US and Germany, and which has become stronger because of their common focus on the stabilisation of eastern Europe. 'There's a way in which the US and Germany have a more immediate and tangible concern with these issues, even than our other friends in Europe,' he said at a joint press conference after his first round of talks with Mr Kohl. He described their 'common partnership' as unique, precisely because 'so many of our challenges are just to Germany's east'. Mr Clinton is expected to make the integration of eastern and western Europe the centrepiece of his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin today, billed by senior US officials as an important statement of US policy towards Europe. In Berlin, Mr Clinton and Mr Kohl will also meet Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, when a US-European Union working group on co-ordination of policy towards eastern Europe is expected to be set up. The aim is to strengthen direct lines of communication between the US and the EU, which officials on both sides admit have become a relatively weak link in transatlantic relations. In his welcome to the US president, Mr Kohl recalled with emotion that 'American soldiers brought freedom to Germany' and then 'defended freedom and peace and security for us here' for 40 years. He underscored the importance of maintaining a US military presence as a pillar of Germany's future security, reminding Mr Clinton of his promise to keep 100,000 troops in Europe. He also paid particular tribute to the US for its support for the German unification process in 1989 and 1990. 'This would not have been brought about without the assistance and help of our American friends,' he said. Mr Clinton stressed that military and security links with eastern Europe, such as Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, should be complemented by better trade access for the emerging democracies. 'We recognise that trade, as much as troops, will increasingly define the ties that bind nations in the 21st century.' Asked whether his 'truly unique' relationship with Germany had displaced his country's 'special relationship' with the UK, Mr Clinton side-stepped the issue with a laugh. 'That's like asking me to pick a team in the World Cup. Once we were eliminated, I declined to do that,' he said - politely forbearing to remind Mr Kohl that Germany had lasted only one round longer than US. He described the US-UK relationship as 'unique in ways that nothing can ever replace because we grew out of them'. As for Germany, he said, 'What we have shared since World War Two. . . is astonishing. . . The future we dream of cannot be achieved without the strong, unified efforts of Germany and the US.' Mr Clinton said his special relationship was not only with Germany in general but with Mr Kohl in particular. When called upon to speak at meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations or of Nato, Mr Clinton said, his usual response was: 'I agree with Helmut.'</p>

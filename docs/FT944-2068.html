			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): When charities pay - Briefcase I have been been asked to help in raising funds for the benefit of my local church and we will be arranging a number of functions for which admission will be charged. One event, also involving admission charges, is going to be organised by people not connected with the church. What are the VAT consequences? The views of the Customs and Excise are set out in VAT leaflet 701/1/92 and we suggest you get a copy. In any case, we suggest you take independent professional advice before starting your fund-raising. If a charity carries on a business, it must be registered for VAT if its turnover exceeds the limits for registration. It could help for a charity to be registered even if its turnover is less than the registration limit. The potential advantage is the recovery of input tax on charges which it incurs. One activity which is always treated as a business is charging for admission to premises. There is, however, a VAT exemption for 'one-off' fund-raising events. The detailed rules are set out in the leaflet. The VAT consequences of the funds raised by the other organisation may be more difficult to determine. If it is acting as the church's agent, then its activities will be treated as being carried on by the church and normal VAT rules will follow. If not, then the organisation itself will have to pay VAT if its turnover is high enough. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

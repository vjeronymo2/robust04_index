			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Hosts with the most - Chrystia Freeland offers advice for a trip to Kiev, and says you'll need stamina to cope with Ukrainian hospitality Travellers to Kiev need not be too disheartened by Ukraine's dismal international image. In spite of the dire economic data, you will not starve in the country that was once the bread-basket of Europe. Neither is there any need to buy chocolates, cigarettes or perfumes in duty free before you leave - they are plentiful, and cheaper, in the kiosks lining Kiev's main streets. Nor, however, should you expect all the comforts of home. Bring wads of cash in small, unmarked notes (but beware of keeping it in a money belt, which is more likely to bring you to the attention of local hoods than offer protection) and all the toiletries you need, and be prepared for intermittent hot water. Arrival at Borispil, Kiev's international airport, offers the business traveller a useful lesson about Ukraine: the Soviet system is gone, but no effective mechanism has emerged to take its place. There is the odd improvement. Entry visas, which once meant standing in long queues outside Soviet embassies abroad, can now be purchased with relative ease and often less expense (Dollars 50) at the Ukrainian border (unlike in neighbouring Russia). However, be prepared to spend a long time waiting in Kiev's dingy airport. A letter of invitation from a Ukrainian organisation, while not necessary, often expedites the process. Foreigners who do not speak fluent Ukrainian or Russian should expect to pay Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 for a taxi ride to the centre of town. Once a deal has been struck, Ukrainian cabbies tend to be honest and safe. But you may find it reassuring to arrange to be met by your hosts at the airport - this, in any case, is the Ukrainian custom. The worst part of your visit to Kiev will probably be the accommodation: the Dnipro and Khreshchatik hotels, on the city's main street, are centrally located and fairly inexpensive (about Dollars 120 a night), but the rooms can be dreadful - small, with uncomfortable beds and disintegrating bathrooms. The Intourist-Rus, on a hill near the centre of the city, is a bit more comfortable and has fax machines and photocopiers, but the bill is more than Dollars 200 a night. If your visit has any connection with a government institution, try to wangle a room at the National Hotel. Once reserved for high-ranking communist officials (before independence it was known as the October Hotel, as in the October Revolution), the National offers a glimpse of the lifestyle of the ancien regime. The hotel boasts more marble than the European Bank for Resconstruction and Development in London, and an abundance of chandeliers. It is safe, comfortable and centrally located. Unless you have travelled widely in the former Soviet Union or are visiting Kiev for pleasure, it is best to hire both an interpreter and a driver. Find the interpreter first (best of all, do so before you arrive), and ask her or him to negotiate with one of the municipal cab drivers. The interpreter should cost Dollars 50 to Dollars 70 a day, and the car about Dollars 40 a day. Businessmen with Moscow offices sometimes bring their Russian interpreters to Kiev; if possible, it is better to hire someone local. While almost all Ukrainians speak Russian, most official functions are conducted in Ukrainian, a language your Russian translator will only hazily understand. Ukrainian business etiquette is mysterious, but vital to master. Contracts are often awarded not to the company which promises a slightly better deal, but to the people who convince their Ukrainian contacts that they are basically good guys. To demonstrate your affable and trustworthy nature, expect to spend a long time with your Ukrainian counterparts while consuming large quantities of alcohol and food. The ritual routinely begins at 7 o'clock in the morning and goes on past midnight. Your reward for holding out on the first day is to begin the whole process again at sunrise. Women, who should expect flamboyant hand-kissing and regular comments on their physical charms, enjoy a rare advantage in this regard. Pleading feminine delicacy, they can generally avoid the worst of the bacchanalia. If you are left to fend for yourself, or manage to prise yourself away from the overwhelming hospitality of your hosts, Kiev has a small but growing number of fairly decent restaurants. The best pizza is at Arlechino, the pizzeria in the Nika supermarket-restaurant complex in front of Kiev's main market. For a more formal, but fairly expensive, meal (about Dollars 40 a person) try the Apollo, just off Khreshchatyk, the city's main street, or Del Mario, an Italian restaurant on vulytsia (Ukrainian for street) Saksahanskoho, not far from the train station. Tsian Deng, a new and remarkably good Chinese restaurant on Gorky street about 10 minutes from the centre of town, offers a respite from heavy Ukrainian food and the homogenised Italian dishes which are the main fare in Kiev's hard-currency restaurants. A word of warning - leave your Ukrainian friends at home, since only the most cosmopolitan Kiev palates have discovered the pleasures of oriental cuisine. A charming, and surprisingly affordable, way to entertain Ukrainian partners is by renting one of the boats that cruise the Dnieper, the big river which bisects Kiev and has been one of Ukraine's main trade arteries for more than a millennium. To rent a boat for an evening should cost no more than Dollars 500 and groups often take 36-hour cruises up and down the river at about Dollars 60 a head. As the moon rises over the river and Kiev's desolate industrial suburbs give way to a verdant country-side, you might forget about the endless bureaucracy and unpleasant bathrooms. Don't bring up the contracts, though, until your party disembarks in Kiev.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sales rise expected to lift Ahold profit Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailer, has forecast an improvement in first-quarter net profits against last year's result. The prediction follows the release of figures yesterday showing that sales, excluding value added tax, rose by 8 per cent, to Fl 8.6bn (Dollars 4.6bn), in the first 16 weeks of the year. The company, which is due to publish quarterly figures on June 16, said its supermarket operations in the US, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe were expected to post higher operating profit. Sales in the US, which accounts for about half of turnover, rose by 5.5 per cent in the quarter. In the Netherlands, turnover was up 3 per cent, while sales in the rest of Europe, which are small compared with US and Dutch turnover, jumped by 48.3 per cent, reflecting recent acquisitions in Portugal. Mr Cees van der Hoeven, president, speaking ahead of yesterday's annual shareholders' meeting, said two of the group's five US chains, Finast Ohio and Edwards, were expected to return to profit in 1994 after losses in 1993. Ahold's three other chains, Bi-Lo, Tops and Giant, were profitable last year. The company recently acquired a sixth chain, Tennessee-based Red Food Stores, for Dollars 124m plus Dollars 5m in debt. Red Food will not contribute to Ahold's 1994 profits.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Wheelock posts 61% interim profit rise Wheelock and Co, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong Pao's listed empire, reported a 61.1 per cent rise in profits after tax and minority interests to HKDollars 940.3m (USDollars 121.7m) from HKDollars 583.7m for the six months to September 30. Wheelock, formerly World International, has interests ranging from trams to property to cable TV. Wharf Holdings, a diversified conglomerate and the company's main subsidiary, contributed some 70 per cent of profits; Wharf itself previously announced a 44 per cent increase in first-half net earnings to HKDollars 1.38bn. Mr Peter Woo, Wheelock's chairman, said profits improved on the back of largely healthy performances from all associates. Analysts said much of the growth in earnings was made from treasury operations. Income from this source rose by around 40 to 45 per cent; stripping out these earnings, brokers reckoned underlying profits growth was closer to 30 per cent. Mr Woo said the group would pursue its strategy of buying stakes in companies manufacturing in both Hong Kong and China, which sell to western industrialised countries but which may have potential markets in China. Since the name change two weeks ago, Wheelock Pacific, the company's investments, retail and trading arm, has made its first investment by taking a 25 per cent stake in Climax International, a Hong Kong-listed paper products company. Wheelock's stated policy is to invest up to 20 per cent of its balance sheet  -or HKDollars 20bn - in China. The group's investments in China are currently less than 10 per cent of assets; however, Mr Woo said it wouldembark on many projects over the next two years that would increase exposure to China by a further 5 to 10 per cent of assets. Earnings per share over the six months rose to 46.1 cents, compared with 28.5 cents in the same period last year. Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 9.5 cents a share, up from 7.5 cents last year.</p>

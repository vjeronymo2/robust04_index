			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel d'Ornellas: "How Long Will This </F> Constitution Last?"]    [Text] The view is held by different sectors of the  opposition that the Constitution promulgated yesterday will last  only as long as the Fujimori administration. But that cannot be  considered an infallible forecast.    In truth, it will all depend on who succeeds Fujimori in the  government. Obviously, if a leader from the so-called  "maximalist" opposition takes office in 1995, he will  immediately endeavor to revoke the new Magna Carta, going back  to the one of 1979. No chief of state, either "aprista" [of the  APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]], or  "acciopupulista" [of the AP [Popular Action Party]], or of the  classic Marxist left, or of Mario Vargas Llosa's movement, will  coexist with the 1993 Constitution. That is sure.    Things change, however, if the winner of the elections to be  held 15 months from now comes from one of the less radical  organizations. What is more, if he is a "pepecista" [PPC  [Popular Christian Party]] who is not enrolled in the ranks of  self-exiled Alberto Borea, he will most probably accept the text  of the Constitution approved by the referendum of 31 October  last, even though he will try to introduce some amendments.    The same goes for possible independent candidates like  Carlos  Bolona or Ricardo Belmont, any member of Renovation and, of  course, Fujimori's possible dauphins in the event the president  decides not to seek reelection. Moreover, Javier Perez de  Cuellar has accepted the validity of the Constitution  promulgated yesterday, although with reservations on  unicameralism and the death penalty--which we share--and on  immediate reelection. In his case, of course, everything will  depend on the terms of whatever agreement he may have reached  with the conglomerate that catapults him into the presidency, in  the hypothetical case that this were to happen....    So, the chances that the 1993 Constitution will outlast  Fujimori's tenure are greater than that they will not. Those  whose opposition to its survival is inflexible are the country's  political minority. The rest accept its validity, in varying  degrees, with reservations ranging from total intangibility of  its text to the inclusion of substantial amendments in it.    The hypothesis that the new Fundamental Law will meet the  same fate as Leguia's last Constitution, which was thrown out  the window together with him, is, in the final analysis, rather  remote. Particularly, if the new Constitution demonstrates, in  terms of effective performance on the road between now and July  1995, that it is better than the preceding ones. Or that public  opinion thinks that it is. The measuring stick will be the  performance of the government, particularly in terms of the  relations among its branches, and how well the unicameral  Congress works.    If it passes this efficiency test, a return to the past and  its 1979 Constitution will be difficult, not to say impossible.</p>

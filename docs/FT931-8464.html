			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Inflation rises as output advances - January Indicators US CONSUMER prices jumped by 0.5 per cent last month, well above the revised 0.2 per cent advance of December and the steepest monthly increase in the last two years. Other statistics released yesterday showed continuing strength in industrial production, up 0.4 per cent in January, another decline in the weekly claims for unemployment benefits and a small reduction in the December trade deficit. Principal factors behind the rise in retail prices were more expensive vegetables, petrol, tobacco and clothing. But even excluding food and energy, whose prices tend to be more volatile, the so-called core consumer inflation rate also rose by 0.5 per cent. Although the increase exceeded the expectations of analysts, January itself is often a statistically unreliable month and there was no immediate inclination to see in these figures a resurgence of general inflation. Last year consumer prices rose by a modest 2.9 per cent and President Bill Clinton's new economic proposals assume no additional inflationary pressures. The 0.4 per cent increase in industrial production, following revised gains of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent in December and November respectively, is more consistent with the general picture of an economy modestly on the mend. Increased output of cars and car parts accounted for about a half of the advance in the index, but production of consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies also recorded advances. Total industrial capacity usage in January rose by 0.2 percentage points to 79.5 per cent, the highest since October, 1991. The US trade deficit in December fell to Dollars 6.95bn (Pounds 4.81bn) from the revised Dollars 7.35bn of the previous month. This brings the cumulative deficit for the full year to Dollars 84.34bn, up from Dollars 65.40bn in 1991. The weakened economies of the main US trading partners and the domestic recovery presage a wider deficit in 1993. In the year, the sensitive US trade deficit with Japan rose to Dollars 49.4bn from Dollars 43.4bn in 1991. It thus accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the worldwide deficit. The US surplus with the European Community also dropped sharply last year to Dollars 6.19bn from the Dollars 16.42bn of 1991. In December the US ran a deficit with the EC of Dollars 308m, half that of November.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (5): Market dictates a fast pace - Andrew Fisher visits Esec, the semiconductors company Sales are rising so fast at Esec - a maker of specialised equipment for the semiconductor industry - that the small Swiss company has to be agile to keep up with growth in demand, especially from Asia. 'Every two years, there's a new generation of machines,' says Mr Hans-Ulrich Muller, chief operating officer. In between, there are numerous modifications. 'We would like to have a slower pace,' adds Mr Peter Kilgus, chief financial officer, 'but the market will not allow this.' Esec (European Semiconductor Equipment Centre) is based in Cham in the canton of Zug. It has no domestic market and sells most of its die bonding and wire bonding equipment - used to move and connect chips - to manufacturers in south-east Asia and South Korea. Revenues last year shot up by 43 per cent to about SFr90m. It expects this to more than double by 1996. Formed 25 years ago, the private company is the leading world supplier of this type of equipment; it is adding its Autoline assembly system to link the stages of the bonding process in computerised manufacturing cells. Esec has to spend heavily to maintain the lead in its chosen market niche. About 20 per cent of its revenues go on research and development, which occupies some 40 per cent of its workforce of 260. R&amp;D is carried out in Switzerland. Esec's customers are the big names in the chip and computer industries. They include Intel, Microsoft, IBM, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and National Semiconductor of the US, as well as Hyundai and Samsung in Korea. Much of the equipment sold to the US groups is used for their production in Asian countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and China. It is from Asia that the main impetus for growth now comes. Last year, sales in south-east Asia totalled 62 per cent of the total (a jump from 48 per cent the previous year); this excludes Korea, which accounted for a further 4 per cent. Sales to Europe - where customers include Siemens and SGS-Thomson - dropped to 19 per cent of the total from 27 per cent, with those in the US accounting for 15 per cent (25 per cent). 'Asia is still booming and we expect quite a substantial increase in business there,' adds Mr Kilgus. Its success in Asia does not, however, extend to the Japanese market. Nearly half of the world's semiconductor industry is in Japan, notes Mr Kilgus. 'But it's very tough for foreign companies to get in, especially in our sector.' Esec's main product is the die bonder, for which it claims to be the biggest world producer with 35 per cent of the world market. It has 6 per cent In the newer wire bonding sector, but plans to reach 25 per cent (and top market position) in two years. Esec has no intention of moving from Switzerland. 'Salaries are high but there is good education and motivation,' says Mr Muller. Esec recruits people from Swiss technical universities and trains them itself.</p>

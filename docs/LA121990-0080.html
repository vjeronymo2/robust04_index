			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM OKS $500,000 STUDY OF NEW DISNEY PARK'S IMPACT;  </P> <P> PLANNING: MAYOR CONTENDS THERE'S LESS RED TAPE IN HIS CITY THAN IN LONG BEACH,  WHICH IS A COMPETITOR FOR THE PROJECT.  </P> <P> The City Council took a step toward building a second Walt Disney Co.  attraction in Anaheim by voting Tuesday to spend about $500,000 to study how  another theme park would affect traffic, housing, jobs and other facets of the  city.  </P> <P> "It's a strong commitment, it's a very significant step forward," said City  Manager James Ruth.  </P> <P> Since last year, the cities of Anaheim and Long Beach have been vying to become  the site of Disney's next theme park in Southern California. The company's  interest in Long Beach has been viewed as more serious because Disney  executives have already presented Long Beach officials with plans for a  $2-billion water-themed park in the Queen Mary area.  </P> <P> Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter on Tuesday tried to downplay that perception, noting  that building an attraction on the water in Long Beach would be more  complicated for Disney.  </P> <P> "We're in good shape here," Hunter said. "There is less red tape here (than in  Long Beach.) They only have to deal with the City Council (in Anaheim.) In Long  Beach, they have to deal with coastal agencies, the city redevelopment agency  and the City Council." Disney officials were not available for comment on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The City Council voted to hire Michael Brandman Associates to conduct the  environmental study of the 1,040-acre Disneyland area, a project that is  expected to take about a year. The city paid the same firm $30,000 in November  to prepare a preliminary environmental study.  </P> <P> As early as next month, Disney will give the consultant seven development  options for a second theme park in Anaheim, including site plans, land-use  plans and drawings of the proposed projects. The consultant will also study  whether the city should permit another Disney development at all.  </P> <P> Michael Brandman Associates will consider how the various options would affect  air and water quality, noise, traffic, jobs, housing, public utilities and  other environmental concerns. For example, each city department will be advised  of Disney's plans and will meet with the consultant to discuss the impact of  the project. The city may also hold up to six public hearings late next year to  discuss the study.  </P> <P> "We're going to give a complete look at every aspect of every possible  environmental impact," said Joel Fick, city planning director.  </P> <P> The report will survey the area around Disneyland bounded by the Santa Ana  Freeway, Ball Road, Walnut Street and Orangewood Avenue. Disney owns about 70%  of the property in this area, which is under a building moratorium until  September. The freeze was imposed in May.  </P> <P> A new city fund has been established to pay for expenses related to the Disney  expansion. Disney reimbursed the city for the $30,000 study and will contribute  to the fund on a regular basis. The consultant will submit monthly reports to  the city on the costs of the city, and Disney will then repay the city.  Eventually, Disney will pay for the entire $500,000 study.  </P> <P> Disney officials have released no details about their plans in Anaheim, except  to say that a new attraction might resemble the EPCOT center at Walt Disney  World and could be built on strawberry fields just west of Disneyland, the  current Disneyland parking lot or property next to the Disneyland Hotel.  </P></p>

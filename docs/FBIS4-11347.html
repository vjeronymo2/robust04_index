			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, Apr 25 (AFP) -- The controversial  Nicaraguan Army Commander General Humberto Ortega, who has held  on to military power for more than 14 years, announced this  Monday that he has reached an agreement with President Violeta  de Chamorro for his separation from his post.    Although he did not give any date for his departure, Ortega  made it clear that there is an agreement with the government for  his separation, which will be defined in a Military Organization  law to be sent to Congress for approval in the coming days.    Ortega, whose separation is demanded by Nicaraguan sectors  and the U.S. Government, had up to now been opposed to this  "unilateral" decision by President Chamorro, who announced last  year that Gen. Ortega would be removed in 1994.</p>

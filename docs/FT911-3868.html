			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Management: The Growing Business - Capitalists go public BRITISH venture capital companies are increasingly willing to consider making direct investments in small publicly-listed companies, according to UK Venture Capital Journal*. This would mark a significant shift in the industry's traditional role and could confuse investor perceptions of venture capital. The journal signals three reasons for this development: The increasing size of venture capital investments in recent years, in particular the industry's involvement in financing buy-outs, means there would be little difference in scale between the funding needs of quoted and unquoted companies. Thirty four per cent of the 1,700 companies with a full stock market listing are capitalised at less than Pounds 20m while 70 per cent are valued at less than Pounds 100m. There is little difference between the management style of smaller quoted companies and those remaining private. As their portfolios mature more venture capital com-panies have holdings in com-panies which have obtained a listing. Investments in listed companies are potentially attractive because they are more easily disposed of while smaller quoted companies have traditionally outperformed large companies, the journal notes. On the downside venture capitalists might be hard put to explain to their own backers why they should invest in quoted companies by means of a venture capital company when they could invest directly in the stock exchange. The venture capitalist would also have difficulties gaining the same detailed information from a listed company that he demands when making a private company investment. Despite these drawbacks more venture capitalists are inserting discreet clauses in their fund-raising prospectus which would allow them to make direct investments in listed companies, the journal notes. Among recent listed company deals it identifies a Pounds 14.2m investment in Hunter Saphir, a food group, in the form of convertible preference shares, by 3i, County NatWest Ventures and CIN Venture Managers. *12 Barley Mow Passage, London W4 4PH.

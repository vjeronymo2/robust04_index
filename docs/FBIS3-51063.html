He told PRENSA LATINA: We are not starting from zero. He  acknowledged the last two years of work by the consular office  in Havana. He said: The road is open; this contributes to  today's mature and solid relations.    Regarding the outlook for relations, he said that there are  good possibilities of further strengthening existing ties. In  this regard he mentioned public health, tourism, technology, and  the agricultural and livestock sector.    Right now our responsibility is to open those roads and to  include new sectors, Santamaria said. He recalled that during  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's trip to Colombia, some  ideas were discussed that could be consolidated by visits from  Colombian businessmen to the island.    Santamaria noted the pleasant impression that the Cuban  minister produced in his country. He said: He is an honest and  open person who knows how to touch the heart of the people. I  can assure you that all those who spoke with him think highly of  him.    Santamaria trusts that with the renewal of bilateral  relations, Cuba will be seen in the framework in which his  country has developed its ties with Central America and the  Caribbean.    First, the two economies and commercial possibilities must  be  studied, he said. He added: Colombia wants, and has played, an  important role in this type of agreement in the Caribbean.    Santamaria said that in the past two or three years, the  government of Cesar Gaviria has implemented an aggressive  economic opening up policy that has led to important agreements  with Mexico and Venezuela and to negotiations with Central  American countries. Some of these negotiations, like those with  Guatemala and Costa Rica, are well under way, the ambassador  noted.    Regarding the Fourth Ibero-American Summit scheduled for  14-15 June 1994 in Cartagena, Colombia, the ambassador said that  his country is working hard to prepare for a smooth meeting.    All Ibero-American countries have confirmed their  participation in the meeting, he said. They can be sure, he  added, that Colombia will offer the necessary guarantees.    Santamaria recalled that Cartagena has hosted presidential  meetings and thus will be able to offer the most suitable  conditions for a meeting of this nature.    Regarding the Colombian electoral process, Santamaria  discussed changes that will supply new ingredients to the  upcoming elections.    In this regard he mentioned a two-round presidential  election; an increased number of presidential hopefuls, with  each party choosing its candidates through internal  consultations; and the incorporation of new movements, such as  the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, which is carve out a  role in Colombia's political life as an option to traditional  parties.    Referring to the capture of notorious drug trafficker Pablo  Escobar Gaviria, the diplomat said that such events close a  tragic chapter in Colombia's history.    He pointed out: Nevertheless, this taught Colombians an  important lesson -- no one, no matter how powerful, can oppose  the will of a country, defeat the state's legitimacy, and place  themselves above the law and institutions.    With Escobar's death a chapter on narcoterrorism closes,  which gave back to Colombians their faith in justice, stressed  Santamaria, even though he admitted that this does not mean an  end to drug trafficking.    Santamaria repeated: Colombia continues its struggle against  this scourge with the same intensity and spirit.    Regarding the government-guerrilla dialogue, Santamaria  explained that the Colombian authorities maintain contact with a  dissident faction of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a group  called the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS].    The CRS unilaterally decreed an end to hostilities more than  a year ago. This created a favorable climate for detente at the  start of the dialogue with the government.    An eight-point agenda is under discussion with good  prospects  that by February or March it will end in the demobilization of  its members and their full incorporation into Colombian  political activities, Santamaria said.    The Colombian ambassador in Havana was in charge of the  presidential peace council for a year and coordinated  preparations for a constituent assembly. In addition, he had a  role in the peace process that ended with the demobilization of  the M-19 [19 April Movement], Quintin Lame, PRT [Revolutionary  Workers Party], and EPL [Popular Liberation Army] guerrilla  groups.</p>

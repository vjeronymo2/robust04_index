			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Land Disposal Restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The LDRs are HSWA rules initially implemented by EPA. Moreover, EPA has established that it will not delegate its authority to set treatment standards to states. EPA views determinations linked to the need for and scope of treatment standards as similarly nondelegable. This includes today's interpretation that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is a newly identified waste under section 3004(g)(4). This interpretation is effective in all states, including those authorized to implement the delegable portions of the land disposal restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Good Cause Finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 270.10(e)(2) does not require notice and comment rulemaking for substantial confusion notices. Rather, it simply requires EPA to publish a ``notice'' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . To the extent that this notice is a rulemaking for the purposes of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), EPA believes that it has ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA to extend the permit application deadline without prior notice and opportunity for comment. First, EPA believes that its determination regarding the existence of regulatory confusion is an ``interpretative rule'' for which notice and comment is not required under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. It clarifies and explains existing law rather than creating new duties. Moreover, the establishment of a due date for Part A permit applications is a procedural rule also exempt from notice and comment under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. The effect of establishing this new date is that EPA will not take enforcement action for operation without a RCRA permit against a facility that submits its application in compliance with this notice and that meets the other conditions of RCRA section 3005(e). Finally, EPA views the issues of whether confusion existed and whether it was ``substantial'' as subjects on which comment would not be useful and would not serve the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's findings concerning the land disposal restrictions are also ``interpretative rules'' exempt from notice and comment requirements. They provide EPA's views on the scope of section 3004(g)(4) of RCRA. Moreover, EPA would have good cause to eliminate notice and comment even if these determinations are regarded as legislative rules. The land disposal restrictions would take effect for ash approximately 25 days after the Court issued its opinion. It would be impossible for facilities managing ash to come into compliance with the restrictions in that short time. See 55 FR 22521 (June 1, 1990) (Third Third LDR rule_EPA provides 90 days for persons managing wastes subject to new treatment standards to come into compliance.) The Court's decision thus creates an emergency justifying use of the ``good cause'' exemption under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Regulatory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it involves novel policy issues arising out of legal mandates. However, OMB waived review of this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires the Agency to prepare and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of a proposed or final rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ruling of the Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Chicago  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Defense Fund, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> will result in additional costs for waste management facilities and some of those costs will be borne by small entities. The Agency does not have estimates of those costs. Today's rule extends the date by which affected facilities must submit a Part A permit application. This action will lower the costs to small entities that will have to comply with the Court's ruling. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605b, I certify that this regulation will not have a substantial impact on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in this rule under the provisions of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and has assigned OMB control numbers 2050&hyph;0009; 2050&hyph;0120; 2050&hyph;0028; 2050&hyph;0034; 2050&hyph;0039; 2050&hyph;0035 ; 2050&hyph;0024.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

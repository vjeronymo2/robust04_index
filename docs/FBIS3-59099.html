			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The situation in the former Yugoslavia was  discussed today at the Nordic foreign ministers' meeting in  Stockholm, and it became clear that Croatia risks losing some of  its cooperation with the European Union [EU].    [Correspondent] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen  said today at the news conference of the Nordic foreign  ministers' meeting in snow-covered Haga Castle that the EU is  now seriously discussing its relations with Croatia. The reason  is the alliance Croatia has formed with Serbia. There are UN  sanctions against Serbia, while Croatia has so far been treated  more or less uncritically in the international community.  [passage omitted]    Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas repeated the  threat which exists against the Croatian Government.    [Begin af Ugglas recording] There is permanently a latent  threat against Croatia, much depends on Croatia's conduct, to  tell the truth, to what extent the Croatian regular units are  active in Bosnia, to what extent new massacres can be  discovered; and I am of the opinion that it was useful that the  Danish foreign minister pointed out that the European Union  itself has possibilities because Croatia is very dependent on  trade opportunities and so on. And that shows that what we in  Sweden hope for, a stronger European cooperation, also gives  direct forcible means against aggressive warlords. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] With closer links with the EU, Sweden would  have better possibilities to act against Croatia, that seemed to  be Margaretha af Ugglas' conclusion. The good relations Germany  has with the Croatian government work against any talk about a  harder attitude toward Croatia.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Franc dips amid market suspicions THE French franc remained weak on foreign exchange markets yesterday, amid investor fears that the Bank of France would keep interest rates high and that the French government was considering imposing limits on capital movements. The franc fell almost a centime against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.5440. It has lost more than 10 centimes against the German currency since the franc was effectively floated at the beginning of the month after the European currency crisis. Most currency analysts said they expected the franc would fall to about FFr3.60 to the D-Mark over coming weeks as the Bank of France maintained high interest rates to help rebuild its reserves. 'The markets are impatient for interest rate cuts,' said one economist in London. 'They believe that maintaining high borrowing rates will prolong the recession in France and further damage investor sentiment.' Investors also expressed anxiety about hints from the French government that it wants to impose capital controls as a means of protecting the franc. Last week prime minister Edouard Balladur said that France would not tolerate a situation where speculators could threaten economic security and that he was considering ways to curb speculation. Economists stressed the difficulties involved in such a move. 'It is unlikely at the unilateral level and it would be hard to get agreement at an EC level for such a move,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers. He argues that limits on capital movements would drive capital from France, weakening the franc and putting upward pressure on interest rates.</p>

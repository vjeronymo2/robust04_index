			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Noriega trial admission FORCES under the command of former Panamanian strongman General Manuel Antonio Noriega investigated and arrested a key figure in Colombia's Medelln cocaine cartel, a US Drug Enforcement Administration agent admitted yesterday, writes Henry Hamman in Miami. The acknowledgement by the agent, Mr Thomas Telles, is significant as the government has alleged during Gen Noriega's Miami drug trafficking trial that the general protected the operations of the Medelln cartel in Panama. Mr Telles had at first denied knowing with whom the Medelln 'lieutenant,' Mr Jose Eduardo Zembrano Caicedo, was affiliated. Defence attorney Mr Frank Rubino sought to introduce several documents dealing with the investigation and arrest of Mr Zembrano.</p>

He added that  following this the pro-communist forces would annul the Belovezh  agreements and restore the USSR.    Commenting on the political situation in Ukraine, Kravchuk  stated that the decision that the presidential and local  elections take place this June could completely destroy  executive power in the country.    Kravchuk said he could have decided not to run for  presidency. However, he suggested that those who will take part  in the presidential race could in two days eliminate everything  which had been created, if one of the present candidates is  elected president.</p>

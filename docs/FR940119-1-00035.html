			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most hazardous liquid pipeline operators opposed setting a maximum spill criterion. They indicated a maximum acceptable spill would vary widely along the length of any pipeline depending on spill location. Establishing one criterion for all pipelines would not account for the variables at each spill location. Commenters indicated that more important than establishing an arbitrary spill limit is the need to consider the line profile, drainage gradient, length, and diameter of the hazardous liquid pipeline, susceptibility to outside force damage, population density, and potential hazards to public safety and the environment. Commenters indicated a spill limit would require more valves, particularly on large diameter hazardous liquid pipelines. This would increase the opportunity for inadvertent valve closure, leakage from the valve itself, and vandalism. One commenter stated that protection of the public and environment is related more to exposure of the hazardous liquid pipeline to the public and response time in detecting and responding to a failure, than to setting a limit on the volume of product released. This commenter stated: ``The most effective means for mitigating potential pipeline failure hazards is prompt leak identification, rapid pipeline shutdown, and immediate dispatch of response crews to the failure site.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were asked if the spacing of RCVs and ACVs is determined by a maximum spill from the hazardous liquid pipeline, what should that maximum spill value be? None of the commenters provided a maximum spill value. Hazardous liquid pipeline operators reiterated that the information provided in the responses to the valve spacing question should be used in the context of spill mitigation rather than to establish a single maximum spill criterion. One commenter stated that, in addition to pipe diameter, terrain, and the pipeline's route near or in urban areas, the RSPA should consider the probability of failure, magnitude of the leak, and consequences of the leak in establishing a maximum spill criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> December 24, 1988, Failure in Maries County, Missouri <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history for the 1992 Act cites a December 24, 1988, failure in Maries County, Missouri to demonstrate the need of adequate leak detection equipment. The failure resulted in a crude oil spill of approximately 20,554 barrels (863,268 gallons). The cause was the abrupt change in pressure and fluid flow from the switching of flowing, low density crude oil from one pipeline into another containing a substantially heavier oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crude oil released entered a tributary of the Gasconade River, the Gasconade River, the Missouri River, and eventually the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. In order to control the contamination from the large volume of crude oil released, it was necessary to shut down several water companies along these rivers and a brewery in St. Louis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure of pipeline personnel at the dispatching station to recognize that a rupture had occurred and to shut down the pipeline greatly increased the volume of crude oil spilled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gasconade River and its tributary, into which the crude oil spill first entered, were bracketed by manually operated block valves. The RSPA estimates that the installation of a check valve would have prevented drainage from the 5 mile of pipe on either side of the river, thereby substantially reducing the size of the spill. Also, the installation of a leak detection subsystem on the SCADA system would probably have substantially reduced the size of the spill. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

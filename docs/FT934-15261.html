			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / China missile total is revised upwards CHINA has more than 100 land-based nuclear ballistic missiles, some 50 per cent more than previously estimated, according to figures published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies today. The IISS says its revised estimate does not imply any recent dramatic increase in the Chinese nuclear arsenal, which has always been 'shrouded in secrecy'. China is now believed to possess about 14 intercontinental missiles and at least 90 intermediate-range missiles. It also deploys a nuclear-armed submarine. In the 1993-94 edition of its Military Balance, the IISS cites fears that a new spate of nuclear testing could jeopardise renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), due in 1995. The IISS points to the build-up in conventional arms by most nations in east Asia. It describes as 'worrying' the emphasis on improved capability for naval and air forces. The IISS highlights Iran's efforts to rebuild its forces with modern aircraft, including Russian MiG-29 fighters, submarines and medium-range ballistic missiles. Iran, like North Korea, is strongly suspected of working towards a nuclear arsenal, but the IISS says no proof exists as yet; 'In all probability Iran cannot hope to produce its own nuclear weapons before 2000 at the earliest.' But it notes that Iran 'is actively procuring weapons systems (aircraft and missiles) capable of delivering nuclear weapons'. IISS, The Military Balance 1993-94, Brassey's, Pounds 36.</p>

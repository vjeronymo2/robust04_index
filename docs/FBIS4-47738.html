			<p>BFN     [Text] A week after taking office, the new Togolese prime  minister, Edem Kodjo, has still not formed his government.  There are internal squabbles within the opposition majority.  Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], which holds the  majority in the assembly, refuses to participate in the Edem  Kodjo cabinet. Consultations seem to be going on between CAR and  Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy. After assuming his  position, Edem Kodjo declared his intentions. Here is Edem  Kodjo talking to Olabire da Cruz.    [Begin recording] We are anxious to act in a manner that  will  permit our country to swiftly regain its rightful place within  the community of nations as a vanguard African country. To  achieve this, we need to quickly normalize our relations with  financial institutions and begin national reconstruction and  economic recovery. Social stability and security are also  priorities. They constitute an essential aspect of the program  which the parliamentary majority parties seek to pursue and  thereby ensure success. [end recording]</p>

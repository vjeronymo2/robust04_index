			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Watchdog to probe sale of PSA unit THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, is to investigate the sale of the Property Services Agency's projects division to Tarmac, Britain's largest construction and building materials company. The investigation is to start within weeks of the completion of the deal at the end of November. The government agreed this month to pay Tarmac almost Pounds 50m to take over responsibility for the division, one of the country's biggest construction organisations, employing 1,800 people. About half those jobs are now at risk. The NAO investigation will be followed by an inquiry by the all-party Commons public accounts committee. The terms of the sale were challenged yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, who urged the European Commission to investigate it. 'This is one of the most bizarre privatisations ever. It represents a triumph of arid dogma over the public interest and over the probity of public finance,' he said. Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, vigorously denied that there was any impropriety in the deal.</p>

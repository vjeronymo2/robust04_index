			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Move into eastern Europe helps Oriflame leap 79% A LUCRATIVE eastern European market and the acquisition of Sweden's leading pharmaceutical cosmetic brand helped to boost interim pre-tax profits at Oriflame International, the direct sales cosmetics company, by 79 per cent to Pounds 4.2m. Sales for the six months to September 30 rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 37m. Mr Robert af Jochnick, the chairman and one of two Swedish brothers who set up the company 25 years ago, said the move into eastern Europe had been 'going like an absolute rocket'. Oriflame set up a group called Oresa as a separate company in 1990 and holds a 25 per cent stake. Oresa, which sells Oriflame products, contributed some Pounds 1m to the overall operating return of Pounds 4.6m, compared with Pounds 1.4m. The acquisition of Aco, the leading cosmetic brand with 75 per cent of cosmetic sales in Swedish pharmacies, boosted the operating return by between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m. Purchased for about Pounds 10m in January, Aco had 'developed . . . beyond our expectations,' said Mr af Jochnick. Oriflame planned to introduce the brand into pharmacies in the rest of Europe with special emphasis on the east. In the direct sales division, Oriflame's core business, the main Scandinavian market had remained 'very solid'. However, trading in the UK, the group's second largest market, had been more difficult. Mr af Jochnick said the group planned a shift in emphasis from a middle to up-market range to a middle to lower market. The mail order divisions in France and the UK had incurred minor losses and were likely to be discontinued. Mr af Jochnick said that in western Europe, the group still faced the challenge of 'showing a continuing improvement in sales and profits' of the core business. However, he was optimistic that Oriflame would show a 'very healthy increase in sales and profits' this year, given the inclusion of both Aco and eastern Europe. The dividend was maintained at 4p, reflecting 'our determination to maintain a strong balance sheet'. Earnings per share rose by 66 per cent to 6.8p.</p>

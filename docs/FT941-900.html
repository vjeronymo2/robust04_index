			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Business leaders' dilemma Sir, Mr P V Zealander (Letters, March 17) is right about the dearth of biographies of modern business leaders. In our view, modesty may well explain the situation, but certainly not lack of interest. Some interviews we recently conducted with business leaders suggest, however, that biographies of top men and women would not (unless they were just publicising themselves) offer one single formula for creating wealth and achieving power. What they could do, on the other hand, is to throw light on some of the real dilemmas these people face. For example, how do they resist interfering when they think they already have the answer? And how do they reconcile listening with being and appearing decisive? It seems to be a lot more complicated than a simple list of dos and don'ts.

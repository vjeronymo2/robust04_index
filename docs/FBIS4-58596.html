			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "source" at the Ministry of Defense and the </F> General Staff Command on the "reckless and adventurous acts  carried out by those who call for secession and apostasy in the  cities of Dhamar and Aden yesterday;" date and place not  given--read by announcer]    [Text] O sons of our proud Yemeni people, o heroes in the  valiant armed and security forces: The forces of apostasy,  secession, treachery, and treason are fiercely revealing their  rancor and conspiratorial acts against both the homeland's fate  and the people's life and achievements by inflaming a  comprehensive war targeting the pioneering national  establishment, namely, the armed and security forces, with the  aim of turning both their destruction and the blood of their  sons into a bridge which these forces would cross en route to  their lowly and treacherous ambitions and also en route to the  ambitions of their masters, who are waylaying the homeland's  unity, democracy, pride, and dignity.    These forces have ignited an infernal fire wherever they  can.  Their hegemony went to the point of issuing the utmost  instructions they could give. However, this bridge soon  collapsed at the hands of those who chose the trench of  defending the homeland, the revolution, unity, and the new life  in the Yemen of 22 May. These are the faithful men among the  sons of our people and among their valiant Armed Forces, who  fulfilled their pledge to God and valiantly sacrificed  themselves, so unity would remain brilliant in the homeland, and  so democracy would illuminate the darkness of the totalitarian  and dictatorial one-party system, and so the people would have  the final say because it is derived from God's sayings, and so  the dreams of devils would be shattered. These devils sold  themselves, their fate, and everything that is dear and sacred  in the market of ill wagers, in the face of the will of life, of  maintaining democracy, and of raising high the flags of the  Republic of Yemen.    To these heroes of our Armed Forces, we say: May you rejoice  in the new chapter of pride and glory you are writing everywhere  as a great victory. May you rejoice in the homeland and unity.  To all those who fell victim to their disease and rancor, we  say: History is pouring on you the dust of shame and disgrace,  exactly as it poured dust on similar traitors and agents.  History is also closing the doors to what you planned and to  what your minds and acts sought to achieve. You may face a dark  and bad fate.    We tell the deceived ones whose loyalty is still to God,  the homeland, and the revolution, and who offered dear  sacrifices to protect the achievements of the September and  October revolutions: Disregard the instructions of the  murderers and executioners and the advocates of secession. Join  the honorable trench, the trench of all valiant men and the  trench of protecting legitimacy and preserving unity and  democracy. This is our inevitable path to achieve all  aspirations and hopes. It is our path to heal the wounds of the  hearts through the beginning of a new life, in which there is no  room for crises and fabricators of crises or those who tried to  take dirty money to foil unity and democracy by fabricating  crises and igniting the crime of war and fratricide among the  children of the one Yemeni homeland.    We also hail the brave heroes in the army of the revolution,  unity, and democracy who are now foiling the conspiracy of  secession and raising high the banners of unity. We also hail  all officers, NCO's, and soldiers who refused to fall in the  quagmire of the conspiracy against unity and democracy and  proved that they have cleansed themselves of the filth of the  era of the class vindictiveness and the dictatorship of the one  party and sided with the people, unity, and constitutional  legitimacy. We stress to the people and history that the crime  of the ugly war ignited by the malicious persons in the Yemeni  Socialist Party, particularly traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his  secessionist gang, has clearly exposed the nature of the enemies  of the people, revolution, unity, and democracy.    The chance is now available once again to all heroes in our  Armed Forces and security agencies in Sa'dah, al-Mahrah,  Hadhramaut, Ta'izz, and all parts of the united homeland to join  the ranks of all those who hold unity dear in their hearts.  They now have the chance to prove once again -- with valor,  heroism, and with their warm, pure blood -- that they can defend  the most hallowed value of the people, and to confirm their  readiness to offer the dearest sacrifices to ensure that this  homeland will remain united and its will unbreakable. They have  the chance to confirm the people's democratic choice, upon which  the enemies of the people tried to encroach through all devious  means for the sake of filthy money and a mad attachment to power.    Here they are today digging their own graves so that they  will not remain a source of shame for the homeland and a heavy  burden on the new Yemeni life; so that our people will not live  again in the eras of suppression, terrorism, and bloodbaths, and  the rule of terrorism, suppression, and mass murders of the  cream of the Yemeni society; and so that the future of the  people and country will not be controlled by that gang of  tyrants, murderers, thieves, and criminals, and the madmen of  the blind, vindictive theories and false slogans, which will  only bring to the people death and suppression and to the  homeland fire, destruction, and damage, which they wanted to  afflict on everything beautiful in it.</p>

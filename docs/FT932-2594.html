			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Hurd says UN's hands are tied MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said yesterday that United Nations peacekeeping abilities were hampered by governments failing to supply enough troops, or not paying their share of the costs on time, Reuter reports from London. Mr Hurd, in a speech at a diplomatic banquet in Britain, said the shifting post-Cold War world had put a heavy burden on the United Nations and generated increasing calls for it to play a more decisive part in quelling conflicts. 'It is no use countries arguing for the UN to take an active, interventionist role and then not putting forward the skilled manpower and hardware to implement it,' he said. The UN itself should strengthen its command structure by creating a general staff of ''highly professional military and civilian experts' to deal with crises, he said. 'Britain pays her bills on time. So do most of our EC partners, the Nordics and the countries with a long tradition of peacekeeping such as Australia and Canada. But some others, who share the heavy burden of international responsibility, do not,' he said. For operations in Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and Cambodia, the US owed Dollars 234m, (Pounds 156m), the Russian Federation Dollars 166m and Germany Dollars 57m, he said. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has called for an extra 7,500 troops to add to the 23,000 already deployed in Bosnia.</p>

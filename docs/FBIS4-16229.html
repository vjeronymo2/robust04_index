			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS Observer Tatyana Zamyatina "especially </F> for IZVESTIYA": "Ivan Rybkin: Magnanimity Discourages  Opponents"]    [Text] Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, considers  the latter's inclination to seek accord among all the branches  of power to be the main result of the first 100 days of the  lower chamber of the Russian parliament's activity. At a  meeting with chief editors of the Russian mass media at the  ITAR-TASS news agency on 12 April he came across as a person who  is open for discussion, independent, but complex.    Ivan Rybkin acknowledged that he still has differences of  opinion with Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's  Aministration, on the question of social guarantees for former  Russian Federation people's deputies. "Filatov and I spent four  hours discussing this problem until midnight last night," Ivan  Rybkin said.    As is well known, in accordance with the president's edict  of  6 October 1993, Sergey Filatov and the commission headed by  former Russian Federation deputy Aleksey Surkov drew up a list  of 151 people's elected representatives of the previous  parliament who have been denied the one-off monetary grant  equivalent to a year's salary based on their monthly salary at  the time their deputies' powers ceased. This is equivalent to  approximately 3-4 million rubles per person, to be allocated, of  course, from the state budget. The question of transferring to  the ownership of those deputies Moscow apartments previously  allocated to them for the duration of their term in the former  Supreme Soviet remains in dispute. In an interview with your  ITAR-TASS observer, Sergey Filatov noted that the housing  question will be resolved on an individual basis. Meanwhile, as  Filatov said, "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not the kind of man  who would give municipal apartments away to anyone free of  charge," apartments worth $60,000-$70,000 each at market rates.  "Otherwise it will be hard to explain to Muscovites why we are  retaining housing in the capital for people who instigated civil  war," Sergey Filatov believes.    Unlike Filatov, Ivan Rybkin believes that "magnanimity  discourages one's opponents." In his opinion, the transfer of  Moscow apartments to the former Russian Federation deputies  "will not result in great losses, and if we are concerned about  civil peace this measure must be taken."    Moving on to an assessment of the past three months of the  Duma's activity, Ivan Rybkin noted that "the chamber has not  accepted the implementation of the principle of a formal  majority in decisionmaking," and added that in Russian history  it was often the minority which was in the right. In  establishing the structure of the chamber the deputies have  managed to give the Duma the status of a mini-parliament in  which every draft law is "tested out first," which significantly  eases the voting procedure, the speaker noted.    As an illustration he cited the voting on the set of amnesty  decisions and put forward the paradoxical thought with regard to  the events of August 1991 and 3-4 October 1993 that "the idea of  consigning things to oblivion is very important because without  it there can be no progress toward the conclusion of the  Agreement on Civil Peace."</p>

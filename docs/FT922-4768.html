			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (5): After the festival is over - Garden site will bloom with homes and industry THE VISITORS who have been pouring into the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival every day since the start of May could be forgiven for thinking that what they were enjoying was just another, if more colourful, entertainment centre. The valley of the Ebbw, once a vital part of Britain's industrial greatness, with steelworks and coal pits, is now a place of greenery and colour. The industrial dereliction has gone and flowers and amusements within the festival site compete for the attention of the visitors. But the festival, of which Ebbw Vale is the fifth to be held in Britain, was from the start planned to have a more serious purpose than as a mere five-month entertainment centre. It was seen as a vehicle for rehabilitating a part of the country which had been badly hit by the structural decline of heavy industry and the concentration of newer forms of industry elsewhere. Although garden festivals originated in Germany, where they were intended to help rebuild the country economically after the second world war, they were a British idea. The first was held in Hamburg in 1951. Since then, they have become major events not only in the German entertainment calendar but also elsewhere, as in Holland. Their arrival in Britain a decade ago owed much to Mr Michael Heseltine's search for an alternative, Conservative, approach to regional policy following the inner-city riots in London's Brixton and Liverpool's Toxteth. The first was held in Liverpool itself, to be followed by Stoke-on-Trent, Glasgow and Gateshead. After Ebbw Vale, there are no plans for any more. While the festival itself is of great importance - with 2m visitors expected by the close in October it is expected to be the largest holiday attraction in Britain this year - what happens after the gates finally close is of even more importance. Mr David Farnsworth, an executive director of the Welsh Development Agency, says that the way in which the site is subsequently developed will help to rebuild the economy not just of Ebbw Vale itself but of south Wales too. 'What will happen is not just an exercise in building houses and factories and offices,' he says, 'it is about changing the commonly accepted perception of the valleys of south Wales and of Wales itself.' The future of Ebbw Vale, he adds, lies in the hands of a partnership between the agency, Gwent County Council and Blaenau Gwent borough council. The three entered into partnership to prepare the site five years ago and by the turn of the century expect to see a thriving new community of some 2,500 people, with 500 houses and 1,000 jobs on the site. This confidence in the future is based not just on the fact that some investors, such as Welsh Brewers, relocated a distribution depot to Ebbw Vale more than a year before the festival opened, but by the number of inquiries about after-use facilities being received every day. The WDA's own 8,000 sq ft office at the entrance to the festival has already been the subject of an offer from a data processing company that would have employed 25 people. 'We are taking inquiries all the time,' says Mr Bob Croy- don of agents J P Sturge. 'The visitors can see what is going on and many of them are suff- iciently interested in the way the valley has been greened to want to return as employers. 'House building has already started on the site, with the Bailey group, of Cardiff, having put up homes. The first phase of our development plans envisages immediately building 25 for rent with another 15 to follow straight on behind. A similar number will be built for sale. A national housebuilder is to put up 50 detached houses and, with 30 self-build plots allocated, a quarter of the 500 houses expected on the site have already been committed. That is encouraging progress.' It is not just houses that will be built. The after-use plan envisages 23.5 acres being set aside for technology areas and 12.5 acres for business use. A business park is expected to create 400 jobs, according to Mr Alan Nichol, the WDA's man in charge of the after-use project. 'Areas now being used as car parks will be turned into high-technology sites,' he says, 'which will create another 700 jobs. The festival site is probably the best in south Wales and we shall create some 1,100 jobs in all on it over the coming years.' 'This is a development,' says Mr Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent borough council, 'that will deliver the long-term regeneration we seek in the area and make us a showpiece for urban regeneration in Britain.' 'We are talking about the second transformation of the Ebbw valley,' adds Mr Nichol. 'The industrial revolution that brought heavy industry here over a century ago was the first; this is the second.' The WDA's Mr Farnsworth carefully puts the development in perspective, though. This is not a plan for tomorrow. Investment may be in the pipeline immediately after the festival closes on October but what the three partners are looking to is a development over the next eight years. He sees completion by the turn of the century rather than the turn of the year. 'Enormous changes have certainly taken place,' he says. 'We had to move 250m cubic metres of derelict land before we could start. That is equivalent to filling 125,000 lorries. What we had to do was to move the spoil of 100 years and more of industrial activity. We did it in three years and it cost the agency Pounds 20m. 'Even with the infrastructure largely in place it will take 10 years to complete the job. But it is a job that will be completed. The site is superb and the location is excellent - just half an hour from the M4 and only 1 1/2 hours from Birmingham. 'We have the right product and through our co-operation we are tackling the development in the right way. The secret is to work at a steady pace and to take the developers along with us at every step. We already have Pounds 10m of investment committed and by the end we shall have over Pounds 100m.' Blaenau Gwent's Mr Assinder sums it up by saying that the garden festival has acted as the catalyst for a development that will radically alter the character of the valley. 'We would not have been able to do this in such an imaginative way nor at such speed without a festival.' For a Labour leader to agree in practice with the principles laid down by a Conservative minister - Mr Michael Heseltine - a decade ago indicates the consensus that the garden festival has created.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen by </F> Milos Sklenka; place and date not given: "The Liberalization of  Trade Is the European Union's Best Contribution to the Success  of the Reforms"]    [Text] Denmark is one of the most enthusiastic supporters  of the gradual incorporation of the Central and East European  states into the integrative structures. It is no coincidence  that it was under this country's presidency of the European  Union [EU] during the first half of last year that the Twelve  announced publicly for the first time that they are prepared to  accept states from this region in the future. At the same time,  it liberalized to a greater extent its internal market for East  European exports. One of the men who deserved much of the  credit for the progress in rapprochement between East and West  on the old continent was Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen. He granted our newspaper an exclusive interview in  connection with his visit to the Czech Republic.    [Sklenka] The NATO member countries approved the Partnership  for Peace [PFP] initiative at their recent summit. In what  specific way should the Alliance's plan improve security and  stability in Europe?    [Petersen] The approval of the PFP initiative can be  described as the most important decision made at the NATO summit  in January, because its aim is to unite the whole of Europe.  The essence of the plan embraces support for practical military  and political cooperation, cooperation that reflects the various  endeavors and abilities of each signatory country, while  involvement in the initiative is open to any country interested  in it. In this regard, the PFP eliminates in advance the  possibility of Europe being divided and helps to increase  stability, confidence, and security. The North Atlantic  Alliance's initiative, however, should not be viewed  independently, but as an element of the West's broader concept  for bolstering peace and improving cooperation and security in  Europe. For example, the EU recently came up with a plan for a  so-called Stability Pact, whose ultimate aim is the same.    [Sklenka] Some of the most senior representatives of the  countries of Central and East Europe, nevertheless, point out  that, although the initiative de facto brings the postwar  division of Europe to an end, NATO could have offered something  more than just consultations and joint exercises.    [Petersen] The PFP plan is based on the real requirements of  the current era in Europe. It would be erroneous to think that  this initiative offers only formal consultations, joint  exercises, and so on. It is necessary, first and foremost, to  be aware of the very crux of the plan, that is, that the PFP  represents an important element in filling the security vacuum  for the countries of Central and East Europe. The mechanism for  consultations -- which enables any participating country to  discuss with NATO issues that present a threat to it,  infringements of territorial integrity, and political  independence -- forms an important part of their security  system. As far as guaranteeing their security is concerned, the  East European countries may, apart from this, also count on  close political and economic cooperation with the EU by means of  the association agreements.    [Sklenka] In your opinion, when will the time be right to  expand the Alliance?    [Petersen] The heads of state and government of the NATO  member countries declared quite unequivocally at the January  summit that the Alliance is open to all European countries. It  says in the final declaration, among other things, that "we  expect and welcome the opportunity to expand NATO." Denmark  supports the attempts by the countries of Central and East  Europe to join the Alliance. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion  that this process must be gradual, while we consider involvement  in the PFP initiative to be an intermediate stage toward full  membership in NATO. In no way, however, do we view it as a  guarantee of their membership.    [Sklenka] Apart from the expansion of political and security  cooperation, the Central and East European states are also  seeking cooperation in trade. They are demanding greater access  to the common EU market.    [Petersen] I fully agree with the view that favorable  economic development in Central and East Europe is one of the  conditions for boosting security and stability in this region.  In this regard, Denmark is trying to help to increase as much  as possible the access of Central and East European exporters to  the EU market. We are absolutely convinced that the  liberalization of trade is the best contribution to the success  of local political and economic reforms. Our government put  forward certain specific measures at the Copenhagen conference  last April, the aim of which was to increase their closer trade  cooperation with the EU. The results of the conference became a  springboard for the Copenhagen summit in June where the Twelve  further liberalized their market for imports from the countries  of this region.    [Sklenka] The Czech Republic and five of the region's other  countries have signed association agreements with the EU. These  are the first step on the road toward full membership in this  organization. In your opinion, when would it be realistic for  the Union to begin expanding eastwards?    [Petersen] In accordance with a decision made by the  European Council, the EU should be expanded on 1 January 1995.  Following the probable admission of the four candidate countries  -- Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway -- more talks will be  held on possible institutional changes and the admission of  other new countries at the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  Talks on the admission of Central and East European countries  into the EU could begin in 1997. The length of the negotiations  and the speed of the actual process of their incorporation will  be individual and based on the readiness of each country. It  seems to me that there is a realistic chance of expanding the  Union again at the turn of the century at the earliest.  Naturally, Denmark will support -- as it has done until now --  closer cooperation between the Twelve and Central and East  Europe.    [Sklenka] The association agreements for Hungary and Poland  came into effect in February following a two-year ratification  procedure. How long could this take in our case?    [Petersen] As you know, Denmark was one of the first EU  countries to ratify -- in December 1993 -- the Czech Republic's  association agreement. I believe that the approval procedure in  all the EU member states will be completed by the end of this  year so that the document can come into effect on 1 January  1995. Irrespective of this, however, the Czech Republic has a  valid Interim Agreement, which encompasses all the economic and  trade issues contained in the association agreement, including  greater access to the EU market for Czech goods.    [Sklenka] The negotiations on expanding the EU to include  Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have reached the final  stage after more than a year. As a result of the continuing  differences of opinion on the speed of their adaptation to  conditions in the Union, however, there is a real risk that the  date of their admission will not be adhered to.    [Petersen] According to the original timetable, the talks  should be completed by tomorrow, if expansion is to be achieved  by 1 January 1995. In this context, all the EU states are  approaching the talks with the utmost understanding for the  demands of the other side and with an effort at compromise. In  the event that this does not happen, there is a real risk that  the planned date will not be adhered to. In view of the June  elections, the mandate of the European Parliament deputies --  who must also ratify the agreements on the admission of new  countries into the EU -- will come to an end.    [Sklenka] What is your assessment of the current state of  cooperation between the Czech Republic and Denmark?    [Petersen] I consider bilateral Czech-Danish relations to be  very good. During the past few years, we have succeeded in  forging very close cooperation on all levels, which has carried  mutual cooperation forward onto a qualitatively new perspective.  I believe that my official visit to the Czech Republic is  confirmation of this positive trend.    [Sklenka] How satisfied are you with the participation of  Danish companies in privatization in the Czech Republic and in  our market in general?    [Petersen] The privatization process in the Czech Republic  has made considerable progress. Many Danish enterprises are  monitoring developments in your country with great interest;  some of them have even become actively involved in  privatization. For example, Dansk Eternir Fabrik, which is a  subsidiary of the largest industrial group in the country, F. L.  Smidth, has established a special investment fund for Central  and East Europe through which it is taking part in a number of  joint enterprises. In the Czech Republic it is involved in 11  joint ventures, including ventures with EZ Beroun and EZA  Sumperk. At the moment, approximately 60 Danish companies --  whose activity is focused mainly on trade, industry, and  consultancy -- are operating on the Czech market. Denmark  considers the Czech Republic to be a very important potential  partner for developing economic cooperation, which underscores  the increasing interest shown by our companies in investing in  your country.</p>

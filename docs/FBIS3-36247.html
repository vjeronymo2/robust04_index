			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin has  said that the package of documents on the unification of the  monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is not yet prepared, and  that is why the unification agreement cannot be signed during  Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to Minsk.    The minister said he had learned of the premier's visit from  the mass media and that he had never given his consent to  signing the agreement. Shokhin recalled the fact that it was  the prime minister who asked him to take up preparing the  negotiations on the unification of the two countries' monetary  systems.    Shokhin said the package of documents defining the procedure  for the unification had not yet been prepared. He added that he  had a meeting with one of Belarus' deputy prime ministers in  Moscow last Friday. "We did not advertise this, but we detected  a number of approaches to solving disputable issues. Now the  task is to introduce the approaches into the text of an  agreement," Shokhin was quoted as saying. With this aim in  view, several Russian representatives left for Minsk for two to  three days. "If the documents are to be, we must approve them at  a government meeting," the minister pointed out. Only after  this can the documents be signed, he added.</p>

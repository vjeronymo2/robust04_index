			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lister Losses and special provisions largely associated with the restructuring of its furnishing operations, meant losses at Lister rose slightly, from Pounds 2.78m to Pounds 2.9m pre-tax, in the year to March 27. The company - which makes a wide range of textile products and has interests in property investment, engineering and insurance broking - lifted sales to Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 30.9m), but poor trading conditions continued to hit margins. Losses per share were 17.68p (17.11p), while the dividend is unchanged at 0.1p.</p>

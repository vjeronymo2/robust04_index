			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (10): An interesting battle looms - Video dial-up services The UK has two fundamental networks: telephone and television. All others, apart from a few specialised satellite, microwave or cable based-systems, are either adaptations or extensions to one or other of the two base models. The success of satellite-broadcast TV services and the few, scattered, cable TV networks that are available here is helping to foster demand, led mainly by domestic consumers - but business and academia is interested as well - for new entertainment and information TV services. Just as telecommunications, datacommunications and computer applications are converging to the point where it is practically impossible to tell them apart, so the telephone and television networks have significant, and growing, areas where their interests and capabilities overlap. For example, as more and more of the UK is cabled for multi-channel TV, it will be a technologically simple matter for the cable companies to provide access to the public switched telephone network over their TV cable and so compete, head on, with the likes of BT. Similarly, the technology now exists to permit high bandwidth video to be transmitted over existing copper-cabled telephone networks as well as on new fibre optic lines, putting telephone companies in direct competition with the cable TV businesses. The telephone system also has the supporting infrastructure to handle switched or on-demand applications, and the capability to bill for services rendered. After more than 10 years of duopoly competition, telephone bills in the UK remain uncompromisingly high. Individual and business subscribers may complain about the size of their quarterly accounts but these are also regarded in very much the same light as death and taxation: unfortunate but inevitable. Video dial tone networks will allow telephone companies to provide information, education, medical, banking, catalogue shopping - and home entertainment services such as cable television, pay-per-view channels, interactive learning and true video-on-demand. They will all have to be paid for. Most research and development work in video dial tone has taken place in the US where the both the regulatory environment and the market is more conducive to the deployment of such interesting new services. The situation in the UK is somewhat different, cable TV is far from ubiquitous here and legislative strictures are preventing the biggest potential players in the market, the telephone companies, from competing with the cable companies. The government, allegedly to allow infant cable TV companies time to grow up, has forbidden both BT and Mercury to provide home entertainment services over their networks until 2001. BT attempted to pilot video-on-demand services in East Anglia but the Cable TV Association (CTA) successfully contended that video-on-demand effectively constituted entertainment delivery. The argument hinges on just what constitutes broadcast entertainment. Television is a one-to-many medium that can provide a minimal degree of interaction via teletext type services. Telephony is a one-to-one medium, (except for business-based audio and videoconferencing services) that by its very nature is full duplex and therefore has the potential to be made highly interactive. The question is, is it broadcast? Wrangles such as this nicely illustrate how shortsighted and counterproductive it can be to make arbitrary rulings on how, when, where and why a technology may be deployed while that technology is still actually being developed. From the technology angle, subscriber transport of video signals can be achieved over existing copper loops using Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), fibre in the loop (FITL) or hybrid fibre-coaxial cable distribution networks. ADSL is the transport link that will allow local exchange carriers to use existing copper wires to deliver broadband services that provide high-speed data, digital audio and video to the home or business. It can carry a one-way transmission of a bit-stream up to 6Mbp/s from the public network to customers, while at the same time providing an interactive control bit stream from the individual customer back to the network; and still retain the use of the copper pair as the plain old telephone system (POTS) line. Asymmetric refers to the difference in bit rate between the two directions of transmission. When ADSL was first proposed, in the US in 1989, there were two competing technologies that seemed to be capable of delivering the 1.5Mbit/s service - as it was then envisioned - over the installed copper base. These were Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) which is also known as multicarrier. Further research and development showed that DMT was capable of providing high-quality performance at speeds in excess of 6 Mbit/s. It does this by dividing available bandwidth into 256 channels and uses digital signal processing to dynamically adjust parameters as necessary to minimise errors and crosstalk. DMT technology supports four 'A' channels at 1.5 Mbit/s, each of which may carry a video signal of VCR quality, or two channels can be merged to carry a high-quality, outside broadcast-type real-time video signal. For the future, all four channels operating in concert will be able to transport an extended definition TV signal. DMT also carries a 384Kbit/s ISDN channel which can be used to access to corporate LANs for teleworking applications using a frame relay service. A further basic rate ISDN channel is supplied, which contains two 64 Kbit/s 'B' channels and a single 16Kbit/s 'D' channel. Along with these comes a signalling-control channel, again operating at 16Kbit/s, which allows the user VCR-type controls over what is being shown on the 'A' channels. Control options include all the usual video recorder functions such as search, pause, reverse and fast-forward. A separate embedded operations channel permits internal system maintenance, monitoring, audit, telephone company administration and billing functions. Finally, the user can make or receive telephone calls over the same copper pair without affecting the digital transmission channels just described. What is more, because the ADSL is passively coupled to the POTS line, the subscriber's POTS capability is unimpaired even in the unlikely event of a systems failure. Taken together, these channels provide an aggregate transmission rate of close on 7Mbit/s that could take remarkable new broadband services direct to the home over existing copper cabling. Video dial tone also requires an interactive system that must permit automated, random access media-independent storage and retrieval capabilities. Sophisticated software must process subscriber requests and must provide subscriber interactive services, network interface support, robotics and drive control, statistical and accounting functions and video library and shelf management routines. It is anticipated that such an automated system will deliver any video selection or other service, in less than 10 seconds, from a library of 10,000 to 15,000 titles. Given the massive installed base of copper cable and the comparative expense of laying fibre optics, it seems likely that those systems that can exploit copper as a transmission medium will win a large share of the potentially huge video-on-demand market in the short and medium term. Fibre will continue to be deployed and can carry more services than wire, but fibre to the home is a long-term prospect whereas fibre to the workplace is with us now. The battle between the established and emergent telephone and TV interests could well be more interesting than some of the programmes on the box.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / New inquiry into police service promises big shake-up in ranks WIDESPREAD changes to Britain's police service are likely to result from an inquiry announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, yesterday. The inquiry will examine many areas of police organisation including its roles, responsibilities, career and rank structure, and pay. The service's centralised pay structure could be replaced by one based more on individual performance. Mr Clarke is under pressure to contain levels of spending on the police, which are high compared with other public services, and to improve management and efficiency. He announced the inquiry, which will report within a year, in a speech to the Police Federation conference at Scarborough. 'I believe that I should not simply charge into yet more change,' he said. Any decisions should be taken on the basis of an open, well-informed and independent assessment. The inquiry was well received by the conference and Mr Alan Eastwood, federation chairman, said: 'We have nothing to fear and much to gain.' After Mr Clarke had spoken, however, some delegates voiced reservations. 'I believe this is a cost-cutting exercise,' said Sgt Mike Bennett, chairman of the federation's Metropolitan Police branch. Some police forces are already modernising their management structures, and Mr Clarke said he intended to maintain the current 'direction and momentum of change for the better'. He made clear, however, that the inquiry would look specifically at rank structure - which means it is likely to consider whether the service is top-heavy with senior officers - as well as at pay. 'Is a blanket increase in pay to every rank and every officer, irrespective of type of work or competence, really the best way of reimbursing the police for the huge spectrum of work that they do?' asked Mr Clarke. The members of the inquiry team and their precise terms of reference will be announced within six weeks.</p>

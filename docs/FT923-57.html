			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer urges subsidy block on polluters THE EUROPEAN Community should have the power to suspend payment of subsidies to farmers who abuse the environment, Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture and current president of the EC Agricultural Council, said yesterday. He said individual governments could withdraw payments under national schemes but did not have the power to do so under community schemes. Mr Gummer was speaking after chairing an informal meeting of EC agriculture ministers at Cambridge. He said those few farmers who behaved in a way that was clearly damaging to the environment should not receive EC support. In the absence of such powers, the Common Agricultural Policy suffered as a result of public opinion, which wanted farmers to not only produce food but to be guardians of the countryside. Mr Gummer said he did not believe that environmental protection should be an optional choice for the countries of Europe. He wanted to see duties of environmental care written in to as many of the EC market support systems as possible. However, he made clear that not all EC agriculture ministers agreed with the need for more environmental regulations at a time when their farmers were already trying to come to terms with reform of the CAP. 'Mr Gummer's environmental fig leaf has finally wilted,' was the comment of Mr Hugh Raven, co-ordinator of the Safe Alliance (Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Environment), on the minister's statement, which he said acknowledged 'his dismal failure to have environmental criteria incorporated as part of the CAP support mechanisms.'</p>

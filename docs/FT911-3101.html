			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Not much cheer from ICI FT-SE Index: 2,482.1 (-6.5) If the UK chancellor is looking further for anecdotal evidence on the economy, he could do worse than turn to the first-quarter results from Imperial Chemical Industries. The 52 per cent fall in pre-tax profit represents a levelling out of sorts after the 72 per cent drop in last year's final quarter. But the 11 per cent drop in volume is genuinely startling, even if it compares with the last good period before the 1990 downturn. The company can point to theoretical reasons for optimism, such as the fall in UK and US interest rates, the stability of oil prices and sterling's decline against the dollar. But at the operating level, there is no sign of a revival in orders at all. More specifically, there is a worrying drop in profits from the pharmaceuticals division, ICI's traditional prop in the downswing of the cycle. Even after adjustment for disposals,profits seem to be down by perhaps a quarter. For the group, the impression is that recovery will be postponed until the third quarter at the earliest and will be modest when it arrives. It sounds like a prescription for the UK corporate sector as a whole, including the likely prospect of limited further recovery in 1992. But this need not be unduly bad news for ICI's share price, whatever it means for the market. Assuming recovery is at least discernible by the start of next year, ICI's present yield of 6.8 per cent should be safe enough. The shares have almost entirely missed the revival in cyclical stocks such as housebuilders. Their turn has to come eventually.</p>

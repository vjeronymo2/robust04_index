			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Discussion on Future Energy Concepts"] </F>   [Text] VDI-N, Cologne, 6 May 94, MG - During  several lively discussion periods, agreement was found on many  points when representatives from industry and the government  held a panel discussion on the topic "Future Energy Concepts" at  a joint session of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the VDE  (Association of German Electrical Engineers) in Cologne on 28  April 1994.    Doctor Engineer Horst Lennertz, board member at Preussen  Elektra, is convinced that the demand for power, and especially  current, will continue to increase. To be sure, the consumption  of current required for each individual application will be  less, but the number of overall uses for electrical current will  grow constantly. The electrical current requirements would have  to be met by a mix of different primary power sources. For that  reason, German electrical companies will continue to rely on  coal- and nuclear-powered plants, but current will also be  generated from wind and solar power. Lennertz is further  convinced that "at best, such regenerative sources could reach  from 10% to 20% of the total share."    Dr. Hermann Scheer, a member of the Bundestag, takes strong  issue: "There is absolutely no doubt that renewable power  sources must eventually replace the sources that have been used  to date." The president of Eurosolar has labeled the persistence  of the electrical companies "structural conservatism."  CO[.sub]2[/]-emissions will only be significantly reduced  when regenerative power sources occupy a substantially greater  share of the total supply picture. A comprehensive support  program for photovoltaics would help effect a swifter  breakthrough.    "Structural changes take decades," Professor Ernst Ulrich  von  Weizsaecker believes and proposes his own long-term program.  Were power costs increased annually by means of an energy tax by  only 5%, but over a period of 50 years, neither the  individual  consumer nor any specific branch of industry would suffer. In  this regard, the president of the Wuppertal Institute looks  forward to an "efficiency revolution," by means of which the  standard of living reached per energy unit could be increased by  a factor of 4.    Adolf Huettl, member of the board at Siemens, remarked: "In  all of these ideas about energy in the future, the simple fact  that the worldwide demand for power will double by the year  2000. Without new fossil fuel-based and nuclear-power-based  plants, this demand cannot be covered. It is true that  regenerative power sources will gain in importance in the  developing countries. German industry, as an exporter, is ready  for this. Although German industry possesses the technological  competence, it can only be maintained if the technologies are  employed at home as well.</p>

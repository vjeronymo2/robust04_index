			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Markets hit by devaluation and healthcare reforms Sales of drugs in Europe's seven most important markets collapsed 11.4 per cent in dollar terms during the 11 months to November last year compared with the same period in 1992. Healthcare reforms, combined with currency devaluations, caused the steep drop from Dollars 47.1bn to Dollars 41.7bn (Pounds 27.8bn). In local currency terms, the European market generated zero growth, according to IMS International, the market research group, against 10 per cent during 1992. The US market was also sluggish, up 5 per cent to Dollars 40.4bn, demonstrating the impact of lower price rises and increasing purchasing power of bulk purchasers. Drugs sales in Japanese pharmacies increased 7 per cent in local currencies, up from Dollars 14.8bn to Dollars 18.2bn. However, growth in the whole Japanese market - including hospitals where most drugs are dispensed - was slower. European sales were held back by Germany, the region's largest market, and Italy. Healthcare reforms in Germany introduced in January last year drove the market down 9 per cent in local currencies, a fall from Dollars 13.4bn to Dollars 11.5bn. The Italian market, which has also been shaken by a series of reforms, plummeted from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 7.6bn, a drop of 3 per cent in lire. Sales in France were down in dollar terms from Dollars 11.2bn to Dollars 10.9bn, but increased in francs by 5 per cent. Drugs sales in the UK also dropped in dollar terms, from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 4.6bn, but increased 11 per cent in sterling. Sales in Spain fell from Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 4bn, but in pesetas moved up 11 per cent. The Belgian market fell from Dollars 1.41bn to Dollars 1.39bn, but rose 5 per cent in local currency. In the Netherlands, sales improved 12 per cent from Dollars 1.39bn to Dollars 1.47bn. In Europe, cardiovascular medicines, the most important sector, declined 2 per cent in local currencies, from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars 9.2bn. Musculo-skeletal agents - primarily anti-arthritic products - fell 4 per cent, from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.2bn. Alimentary and metabolism drugs, mostly anti-ulcerants, reported no growth in local currencies as they declined in dollar terms from Dollars 8bn to Dollars 7.1bn. Some categories posted growth. Anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals  -were the fastest expanding therapeutic category, up 6 per cent, although in dollar terms sales fell from Dollars 4.2bn to Dollars 3.9bn.</p>

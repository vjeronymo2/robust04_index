			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: France sets price of Elf Aquitaine stake THE French government yesterday set the price of this week's sale of a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, at a small discount to the market. Investors are to be offered 5.78m Elf shares at FFr360 each, which will bring in FFr2.08bn (Dollars 371m) before expenses for the state. This is a 2.6 per cent discount on the FFr369.9 at which Elf's shares closed on the Paris market yesterday and will reduce the government's stake in Elf, France's largest company, from 53.8 per cent to 51.5 per cent. The offer price capitalises Elf at FFr90.43bn, representing 9.2 times historic earnings, a lower price earnings ratio than most leading oil groups. But it is well over the FFr350.4 at which the shares stood when the government postponed the sale last December, to await an improvement in the depressed stock market. The price stood at FFr435 when the sale was announced in mid-November. Since its autumn collapse, the CAC 40 index - of which Elf represents 10 per cent - has recovered strongly, passing the psychological barrier of 1,900 in late February to end at 1,976.28 yesterday. The offer will be open from March 10 to March 12, so that the shares can start trading on Friday, March 13. There are 5.78m shares in the sale, of which 2.4m will be syndicated internationally and the remaining 3.38m will be offered to the French public. This will bring to FFr3.4bn the amount the French government has raised in partial privatisations, since the FFr1.4bn collected from the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Credit Local de France in December. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, announced over the weekend that more state company share sales were on the way and that the income would be used to fund the job creation measures recently unveiled by Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister. The government is expecting to collect FFr5.6bn from partial privatisations this year, according to its 1992 budget. In all cases, the state will keep a majority stake in public sector companies, said Mr Beregovoy.</p>

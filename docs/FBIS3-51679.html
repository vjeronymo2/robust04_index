			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The events in Uraba have prompted the contempt and  censure of several groups in the country, and they lifted their  voices today to ask the government to take a stronger stand in  solving the problem.    President Gaviria, at the head of the list, did not spare  words in rejecting the guerrillas' actions, and he also  announced that military mayors could be appointed in the region  in the next days.    [Begin recording] [Gaviria] It is cowardly and knavish to  kill poor people who reentered civilian life after the Chinita  invasion [not further identified] in Apartado.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility that military  mayors will be appointed in this region?    [Gaviria] Those are decisions that will be made in the  coming  days.    [Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential candidate]  Those of us who are in politics and want to do a good job are  very concerned with the events. It is not only regrettable that  they are occurring in the country, but it is also important that  they be totally clarified.    [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party presidential candidate]  I believe the situation is very serious. I believe this has  been the worst or one of the worse things that has happened to  us on the road to achieving peace. The possibilities of ever  achieving it dwindles if the people who abandon their weapons  cannot obtain protection from the government or citizens.    [Monsignor Pedro Rubiano] The Uraba massacre merits the  rejection of the entire country. Heaven cries out for the blood  of those innocent peasants and workers.    [Senator Enrique Gomez] National sovereignty does not exist  in that area; the public force is totally inefficient. Justice  has disappeared, and the government's total lack of command is  unjustifiable.    [Barranquilla Mayor Bernardo Hoyos] Why can't the Colombian  Government understand that the violence in the country cannot be  solved from Bogota? [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Design, implement or evaluate new, or expand the use of an existing preventive intervention in one of the following secondary conditions: (a) pressure sores in persons with mobility impairments; (b) progressive disability in persons with arthritis; (c) behavioral problems in children with fetal alcohol syndrome; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Determine the preventive health care needs in consumer-managed activities such as centers for independent living, assess the feasibility of conducting interventions, and/or implement health promotion programs in those settings; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Measure or evaluate the impact of one of the following: (a) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure on developmental disabilities; (b) early intervention programs, e.g., home visiting programs, Head Start, educational child care, etc., in children at environmental risk for mental retardation; or (c) early intervention programs for women at risk for having a child with fetal alcohol syndrome; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Conduct a prevention program targeted to high risk groups in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Develop model public health surveillance for mild and moderate traumatic brain injury; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Define the impact of firearm injury, especially related to traumatic brain and traumatic spinal cord injuries, as to outcomes and secondary conditions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Coordinate or conduct community interventions related to the prevention of bicycle injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets and prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased use of occupant protection; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Assess the prevalence of risk factors for osteoporosis and establish an intervention program addressing high-risk groups; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Develop and conduct education programs for physicians and the public so that persons with urinary incontinence will seek and receive proper treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed design and implementation guidance regarding these special prevention projects is available from CDC. Please refer to the ``Where to Obtain Additional Information'' section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Budget and Project Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program has no statutory matching requirement; however, applicants should demonstrate their capacity to support a portion of project costs, increase cost-sharing potential over time, and identify other funding sources for expanding the project. Applicants must prepare separate budget requests for both the basic State core capacity and each special prevention project (identifying both Federal and non-Federal sources). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While CDC has not set specific limits as to the proportion of the total application budget request that should be directed to basic State core capacity, it anticipates that funds to support such core capacity will range from $200,000 to $330,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also anticipated that each special prevention project will have a budget ranging from $40,000 to $60,000. Applicants may propose special prevention projects at a budget level below or above this range. The overall quality of proposed special prevention projects, taking into account total funds available, will be the major factor as to those projects that will be funded. The CDC expects that no State will receive awards for more than three special prevention projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cooperative Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting activities to achieve the purposes of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities under A.

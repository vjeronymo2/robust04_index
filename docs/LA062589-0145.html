			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CIVIL AIR PATROL CADETS LAND A NEW HOME AT TORRANCE  AIRPORT.  </P> <P> It looks like the Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Squadron No. 107 in Torrance will be  getting a home to roost in after having been forced from its aerie at the  Torrance Airport in March.  </P> <P> City officials and the cadet squadron have signed a lease that will give the  squadron a 2 1/2-acre parcel of airport land for the princely sum of $1 a year.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the 20-year lease, the volunteer-run organization has 2 1/2  years to build two new aircraft hangars, plus classroom and meeting facilities,  at the site on the airport's eastern end, said Roger Griffin, an 18-year member  and former squadron commander.  </P> <P> The squadron hopes to pay for the facilities, totaling about 6,000 square feet  and costing an estimated $100,000, through fund-raising drives and donations,  Griffin said.  </P> <P> The organization had its headquarters in buildings and a hangar at the Torrance  airport since 1979. But the squadron was forced to leave its 7,000-square-foot  facilities when city officials decided to tear down the buildings on the site,  which faces Crenshaw Boulevard, and replace them with a commercial development,  Griffin said.  </P> <P> Since then, the cadet squadron has been sharing a 200-square-foot space with  Senior Squadron No. 129, in a building near the Torrance Airport tower, Griffin  said.  </P> <P> "It's tough trying to hold a meeting with 60 people in a 200-square-foot  space," he said.  </P> <P> The Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization and a civilian auxiliary of  the Air Force, Griffin said. Members of the cadet squadron, most of them 12 to  18 years old, learn emergency skills, leadership training and aerospace  education from adult squadron leaders. Members of the senior squadron are  adults who voluntarily assist aviation authorities in search-and-rescue  missions.  </P> <P> Flying lessons are available to participants, most of whom are interested in  aviation, said Griffin, who is a flight instructor. The emphasis on aviation is  what makes the Torrance Airport location attractive, he said.  </P> <P> "We like it because we are aviation-oriented," Griffin said. "Flying is part of  our program and the proximity to the airport is important to us."  </P> <P> While money is being raised and plans drawn up for the new structures, the  cadet squadron will continue sharing space with the senior squadron, officials  said.  </P> <P> Then, since turnabout is fair play, the senior squadron has proposed  consolidating with the cadets and sharing the roomier new space.

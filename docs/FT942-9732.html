			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / India invites private sector to invest Pounds 4.9bn in telecoms India announced the end of the state's monopoly of telephone services yesterday and invited private companies, including foreign groups, to invest up to Rs230bn (Pounds 4.89bn) over the next three years. The decision, the latest step in the country's economic liberalisation programme, has been made on the eve of a visit to the US by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to promote trade and investment. A highlight of the six-day visit will be a meeting with leaders of the US telecommunications industry. Potential investors are likely to be attracted by the prospect of entering one of the world's least developed telecommunications markets, with only eight telephone lines per 1,000 people, compared with a global average of 100 lines. However, the announcement yesterday left unclear the detailed terms under which private investment will be permitted, and left considerable authority in the hands of the government's telecommunications department, which will be both a competitor in providing services and a regulator. The policy statement sets out a target of increasing the number of lines to be installed in the government's 1992-97 five-year plan from 7.5m to 10m. India had just 5.3m lines in early 1992. The government calculates it will need about Rs230bn on top of the Rs245bn originally allocated for the five-year plan, and private companies are invited to help close the investment gap. But there will be restrictions. Companies entering the market will be required to operate in rural and urban areas. They will have to agree tariffs and revenue-sharing arrangements with the telecommunications department, which is entrusted with protecting consumers' rights and ensuring fair competition. Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister, who announced the decision, said the maximum permissible level of foreign equity participation would be decided 'case by case'. The new policy has been settled after six months of political wrangling between Mr Ram and Mr N. Vittal, chairman of the government's Telecommunications Commission and the chief civil servant overseeing telecommunications. Mr Vittal originally proposed radically overhauling the industry, including turning the telecommunications department into a corporation, prior to possible privatisation. The result is seen as a compromise. But much will depend on officials' attitudes. They have shown themselves slow to welcome private companies into services such as mobile telephones. Entry has been limited by bureaucratic delays, restrictive rules and legal disputes.</p>

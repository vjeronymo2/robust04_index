			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Collor trial delay as lawyers dismissed MR Fernando Collor, Brazil's suspended president, sacked his lawyers last night in a last-ditch attempt to delay his impeachment trial today. The manoeuvre gives Mr Collor seven days' grace while a public defender is appointed by Mr Sidney Sanches, head of the Supreme Court. Mr Collor said the move had been prompted by 'the inexistence of conditions for an impartial judgment', and that 'the office of the presidency would be compromised if I or my representatives participated in such a manifestly abnormal process'. The announcement fell like a bombshell in the Senate, where final preparations were under way for the judgment. The Senate had been expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of Mr Collor's impeachment, and for an eight-year ban on his contesting public office, for 'crimes of responsibility' allegedly linked to a massive corruption scandal. A furious Mr Pedro Simon, leader of the acting government in the Senate, said: 'This is the action of someone who has no defence'. Mr Caio Sercuilo, a lawyer for the prosecution, claimed it was 'a fitting demonstration of the moral weakness of the suspended president. The man who governed without honour is leaving without honour'. Representatives of the Brazilian Bar Association offered lawyers to represent Mr Collor, which would enable the trial to go ahead today. But Mr Sanches said that if Mr Collor did not appear today he would nominate a lawyer and postpone the trial to December 29. The delay means the government paralysis which has engulfed the country since Mr Collor was accused of corruption will continue.</p>

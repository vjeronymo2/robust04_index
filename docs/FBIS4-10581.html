			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 12 Apr (EFE) [date as received] -- The  Peruvian press reported on 13 April that the arrest of "Red  Path" terrorist group leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias  "Comrade Feliciano," is imminent.    According to the newspaper EXPRESO, National  Counterterrorism  Directorate (Dincote) agents on 11 April found a trail leading  to "Feliciano" when they raided a house in Lima's Callao Port  where Red Path leaders held meetings.    Five people were arrested in the raid and in addition  Dincote  agents seized guns and propaganda implicating the so-called Red  Path "Central Committee" and the "Lima Metropolitan Committee"  headed by Ramirez Durand.    EXPRESO reported that according to a Dincote spokesperson,  it  is known that Feliciano is in Lima with some of his main  lieutenants and that Dincote is following his footsteps.    In the last two weeks, Dincote has arrested in Lima more  than  20 Red Path terrorists, some of whom, it seems, have supplied  information that will lead to the arrest of their main leaders.    "Red Path" is an armed group that split from the "Shining  Path" Maoist gang, rebelled against Shining Path top-ranking  leader Abimael Guzman, and rejected the peace negotiations  Guzman currently is holding with the government.    Guzman decided to negotiate a peace agreement with the  government in September 1993, one year after his arrest, in two  letters addressed to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in  which he admits the political and military defeat of the Shining  Path, which took up arms in 1980.</p>

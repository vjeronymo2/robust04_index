Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule provides the Medicare HMO or CMP enrollee with the same administrative review rights and financial protections as are available to beneficiaries in the fee-for-service system. To the extent that current Medicare membership in HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to which this rule will apply is low (approximately 7 percent of the total Medicare population), we do not expect any significant increased costs or savings as a result of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lists of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 417  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Health maintenance organization (HMO), Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

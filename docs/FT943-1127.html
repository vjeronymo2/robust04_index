			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: Brindisi, 10 years on - Concert Though it has reached its 10th anniversary, the members of the Brindisi String Quartet are still quite young. Without making any great splash along the way, it has become known among aficionados of the medium as one of Britain's best quartets. It played at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday. Expert, judicious, selflessly intent upon the music and respectful of the great performing tradition: thus far, one might suspect that the players listen to other people's recordings more than is good for them. But they also make a point of playing 20th-century music, often new works, and in the classics - like Schubert's C major Quintet this time, with Anthony Pleeth as second cello - their 'standard' readings are lit by the immediate grace and conviction of their playing, and the lively balance of their collective sound. In the Schubert masterpiece, every major point in living, breathing sound was registered; radical new insights would have been superfluous. Alban Berg's op. 3 Quartet, however, demands committed individual imagination from each player, and it got that in full measure, reinforcing my conviction that this early-ish Berg work is one of the seminal - and most completely realised - quartets of our century. Even its most consciously outre effects have an exact expressive sense, which the Brindisi team regularly sought and found. It also revived the 1931 Quartet by the American Ruth Crawford Seeger (wife of Charles, mother of Pete) to bracing effect. Ms Seeger, who died in 1953, was a rigorous but highly inventive composer before she sacrificed her career to her husband's musical interests. Her Quartet tingles with spiky ideas, sharply carried through. In a feminist canon, it deserves a place alongside Elizabeth MacConchy's and Sofia Gubaidulina's quartets. The Brindisi's first violin is a woman, as it happens: Jacqueline Shave, almost the only female leader of any established quartet. She is the ideal prima inter pares - a democratic part-player among the other three (another woman and two men), yet she wields quiet musical authority whenever the score needs a dominant voice. We could do with more like her.</p>

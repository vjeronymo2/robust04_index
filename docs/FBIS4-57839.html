			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio has said that  the CACIF's [Coordinating Committee for Agriculture,  Commercial, Financial and Industrial Associations] refusal to  participate in the Civilian Society Assembly and its decision to  meet with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] and  to demand the legal prosecution of guerrilla commanders are  still puzzling me, but I respect its position because it proves  there is freedom in the country.    De Leon compared peace to a train, and sectors that  fail to hop aboard are left at the station. The CACIF has  realized that it must join efforts to reach peace, he added.    As for the petition made by business circles to the Attorney  General's Office that UNRG commanders must be legally  prosecuted, the head of state deemed it somewhat hard to  understand as CACIF is holding talks with the URNG. This shows  peace is more difficult to achieve than war. I want to clarify,  however, that I respect all decisions made by CACIF, he  pointed out.    As for the talks held by conflicting parties on the uprooted  population, the president said he has little to say because  civilian sectors have already made their proposals and the  delegations will make the final decision.    President De Leon also said he was pleased with the visit he  paid to the refugees who returned to Guatemala in the last few  days because he regards them as apolitical Guatemalans, although  some leaders are trying to use or manipulate them.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: PICK THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO YOUR TAX RETURN  </P> <P> So you've looked at that 1040 and thrown up your arms in disgust. No way can  you complete the thing by yourself, you conclude.  </P> <P> But finding a good tax preparer isn't a snap either. There are different kinds  of preparers with different skills and fees. Some are not well qualified.  Others may be out-and-out shysters. Just like Medflies, unscrupulous tax  preparers keep popping up all over the place.  </P> <P> "Anybody can call themselves a tax preparer, and unfortunately a lot of  anybodys do become tax preparers during part of the year," says Julian Block, a  Larchmont, N.Y., attorney and tax expert.  </P> <P> Here are some basic steps for selecting a preparer:  </P> <P> * Decide if you really need one at all. If your itemized deductions don't go  much beyond mortgage interest, or you don't have much non-wage income, the  bookstore tax guides or the Internal Revenue Service's free Publication 17 can  probably do the job.  </P> <P> Also consider adult education classes or seminars given at community colleges,  churches or community centers. Call the IRS at (800) 424-1040 for information  on free tax-preparation seminars offered primarily for elderly, low-income or  small-business taxpayers.  </P> <P> Another reason for doing it yourself: It's harder to deduct tax-preparation  fees these days. Those fees are included in miscellaneous deductions, which now  are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross  income.  </P> <P> * Decide what kind of preparer is right for you. Storefront chains such as  H&amp;R Block are good for simpler returns, and their fees tend to be lower.  For more complex returns, consider enrolled agents, who must have worked in  certain IRS tax occupations for at least five years or have passed a rigorous  two-day IRS exam.  </P> <P> Another alternative is a certified public accountant at a smaller accounting  firm. Tax lawyers or CPAs at the big national accounting firms should be  considered if you have a six-figure income and complicated tax situations.  </P> <P> * Get referrals from friends, relatives or colleagues. Nothing beats a referral  from a trusted friend and satisfied customer. Referrals for enrolled agents in  your area are available by calling the National Assn. of Enrolled Agents at  (800) 424-4339.  </P> <P> * Interview at least three preparers before picking one. Find out about their  experience in handling returns of people like you. Get names of their clients  and call them. Ask how the preparer will be compensated; find out the fee in  advance. Ask if they will accompany you to a meeting with the IRS if you are  audited. And be wary of any preparer who doesn't ask you about your tax  situation first before accepting you as a client.  </P> <P> * Screen out fraudulent tax preparers. Just say "no" to preparers who promise  you a refund without even looking at your tax situation, or those who base  their fee on a percentage of your refund. Don't allow your refund check to go  directly to the preparer. Never fill out a return in pencil, and never sign a  blank return. "That's the equivalent of a blank check," tax expert Block says.  </P> <P> * Get your records together. Many preparers charge by the hour, so it'll pay to  get your receipts, financial statements and the like organized first.  </P> <P> * Check -- and double check -- the preparer's work. If there are errors that  result in you owing additional tax, interest or penalties, it's you -- not the  preparer -- who's ultimately liable to pay.  </P> <P> * Finally: Don't procrastinate much longer if you want to file your return by  the April 16 deadline. Many good preparers get very busy toward mid-March and  can't handle many more new clients after that.  </P></p>

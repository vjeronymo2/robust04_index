			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: New Year resolutions worth sticking to - Looking for sensible investment advice? Scheherazade Daneshkhu talks to financial advisers about opportunities for the year ahead THE QUEEN'S annus horribilis was shared by many last year, not least by investors who found their options narrowing as the year progressed. The drop in base rates, changes to National Savings and the sluggish performance of equities made investment hard work. It does not look any easier this year. But this is why New Year resolutions should be made and adhered to. We asked a number of financial advisers which resolutions would top their list for the New Year. Wills and Inheritance Tax Just in case this is your last year, Mark Bolland, of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, urges those without a will to write one: 'From this starting point individuals and couples can go on to wider areas of estate and inheritance tax planning. Clearly, given the state of the economy at the moment and the level of the PSBR, the government is likely to raise taxes. I would have thought it rather unlikely therefore, that IHT - comparatively small though the receipts may be - will be significantly reduced.' People should also resolve to do something about their IHT liability, says David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, by making use of the annual Pounds 3,000 exemption and using the small gifts exemption - up to Pounds 250 to as many people as you like. Money on Deposit David Harris says savers should resolve this year not to keep all their investments on bank or building society deposits now that interest rates have dropped substantially, but should check alternatives. They should take advantage of the maximum investment allowable into the current National Savings issues and pay their next instalment - Pounds 1,800 - to their tax exempt special savings account in the New Year. Colin Jackson, of Baronworth investment services, advises those in a 90-day bank or building society account to give notice and get out. 'The advantage of a 90-day account (interest-wise) is now fairly minimal,' he says. 'I anticipate that in the coming year there will be some new investment products being launched. Those people who have their money tied up in a 90-day account will either have to miss out on an investment opportunity or lose interest by withdrawing their money without giving the appropriate notice.' Personal Equity Plans Resolve to look at the performance of your Pep if you have one says Harris, and look also at the level of charges, administration and strength of the company, adds Jackson: 'Peps are often sold to people who really do not need them as their tax position is such that the tax free benefits of a Pep would not apply. For those people there is no reason why they should pay the higher charges incurred by investing through a Pep.' He reminds those who need a Pep to take one out before the end of the tax year on April 5. Investment Strategies Robert Noble-Warren, of fee based advisers Murray Noble, says those with cash should be open minded about investment strategies. Instead of considering UK equities only, 'an alternative strategy is to have higher holdings of cash and fixed interest, to invest much less than one would normally in UK shares and take a small highly speculative holding in emerging markets such as South China and Mexico,' says Noble. Life Insurance Most people in the UK are underinsured and Harris says people should resolve to check to see whether their life insurance arrangements are adequate. He says investors should keep their wits about them and resolve 'to differentiate between life insurance for protection and other products that purport to be investment plans but are life assurance by any other name.' Retirement and pensions All advisers urge readers to make a resolution that they will no longer put off retirement planning. Harris and Jackson remind those in an occupational pension scheme to maximise their contributions for the year (up to 15 per cent of net relevant earnings subject to the pensions cap). Harris says policy holders should check the value of their pension arrangements and, if the policy holder is contracted out of Serps, to see whether proper rebates have been applied to a personal pension plan. Jackson thinks those who are contracted out should reconsider their decision, particularly if they are men over the age of 45 or women over 40. He reminds higher rate taxpayers to consider picking up unused pension relief for the past six years and paying a single premium before April 5. 'The tax inspector will give you relief in the current year initially at your highest rate of tax. However, you can put in an election (not later than July 5 1993) to carry back the relief to the year ended April 5 1992, if this is more tax efficient,' he says. Retirement may become a more risky business, warns Noble. Employers are moving to money purchase schemes since these are cheaper than final salary schemes. The reduction in interest rates means that a smaller pension will be bought with the accumulated pension fund than in recent years, state pension benefits are likely to be reduced and pension funds can expect lower growth from equities than they experienced in the 1970s and 80s. Pension contracts are being sold on growth rates allowed by Lautro, the regulator for the insurance industry, but Noble believes these estimates are too optimistic. He says, therefore, it is important to take impartial advice. Mortgages Harris would like homeowners to check whether their lender has dropped its rate in line with others and consider whether a fixed rate might not be more suitable while interest rates are still historically low. Guaranteed Bonds Jackson believes investors should steer clear of guaranteed bonds for the time being as rates are low. He also warns investors there are a number of products on the market promising 'guaranteed' returns while the small print reveals they do no such thing. Business Expansion Scheme The BES - which allows investors tax relief at their highest rate on up to Pounds 40,000 invested in a qualifying scheme - will be abolished at the end of the year. Chamberlain de Broe's Alan Greening reminds investors who have not subscribed in the 1992-93 tax year they have an allowance of Pounds 80,000 to invest - Pounds 40,000 before April 5 and another Pounds 40,000 after that date. 'Many advisers who would in the past have been wary about using BES investments for anything other than a small part of someone's portfolio, are now using them as the basis for secure growth (over 10 per cent compound for five years), allowing other more speculative investments to be chosen alongside to provide the high levels of income no longer seen in building society or fixed interest investments,' said Greening, who believes the majority of current BES issues have become secure investments. Last year a new type of scheme - 'non-status, non recourse loan' emerged and have added flexibility to the tax-efficiency of BES investments for higher rate taxpayers, according to Greening. These schemes grant tax relief about six months after the original investment is made. The investor is then offered a non-recourse loan of between 72 per cent and 76 per cent of their original gross investment. 'It is now possible to secure Pounds 8,480 tax relief from one Pounds 10,000 investment, by taking one investment for Pounds 10,000 now, taking a loan-back after six months (Pounds 11,200 including Pounds 4,000 tax relief), and reinvesting the proceeds in a BES for five years - thereby securing another Pounds 4,480 worth of tax relief,' said Greening. While the BES is now much safer than it used to be, Chantrey's Harris advises potential investors to take advice before committing themselves. He also warns that since a great deal of demand is expected of these schemes, potential investors need to be prepared to act quickly to take advantage of any offers. Financial Advice Jackson says people should ask their financial adviser how much commission they are earning and whether they will share it with them. Bolland and Noble, both fee-based advisers, urge people to move to fee-based advice for impartial financial planning.</p>

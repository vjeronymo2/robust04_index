			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Kuwait in plan to sell oil businesses Kuwait is to consider privatising parts of its downstream petroleumindustry in an effort to revitalise the economy and boost the private sector, according to senior Kuwaiti officials. A draft report proposing limited sales of mainly domestic petroleum operations has been prepared by a Finance Ministry committee for submission to the Council of Ministers. According to Kuwait officials, the recommendations stand a 'good chance' of being enacted. However, the officials stress that Kuwait has no intention of privatising or even selling stakes in its upstream oil production and drilling operations, which thegovernment has considered a strategic asset since Kuwait became the first Arab state to buy control of its oil operations in 1975. Officials said the likeliest candidates for privatisation would be Kuwait's petrol stations, some refineries and other non-core businesses associated with the national oil industry.' The purpose is that the government's domestic operations should be given to the private sector in Kuwait,' said one official. International oil companies would be particularly interested in the refining sector. One executive saidwestern companies 'would jump at the opportunity to get involved' in Kuwaiti refineries, which he said were among the best in the region despite being damaged during the Iraqi occupation. The small size of the Kuwaiti economy meansother downstream operations, such as retailing, are unlikely to attract a greatdeal of interest. The proposals are the fruit of intensified governmentinterest in privatisation since the Gulf war, which endowed Kuwait with subsequent high budget deficits and has left the non-oil economy and private sector largely moribund. Both the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have in the past year recommended Kuwait undertake some privatisations to improve efficiency,maximise government revenues and encourage the private sector.</p>

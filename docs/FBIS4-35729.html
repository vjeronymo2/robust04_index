			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Peres met King Hassan of  Morocco last night in Rabat. In their meeting, the king  rejected Israel's request to establish diplomatic relations  between the two countries. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports.    [Begin Hecht recording] The birth of the peace process  approximately one year ago was accompanied by impressive  political dividends: bonuses from Washington, cries of  hallelujah from Western capitals, and mainly public expressions  of friendliness from Arab states. Over the past few months,  enthusiasm seems to have waned and the region's capitals are  giving Jerusalem the cold shoulder. Among other things, this  has been reflected in opinion polls by a sharp drop in the  percentage of public support for the peace process.    Jerusalem is in need of some fireworks and King Hassan of  Morocco told Foreign Minister Peres that he was not the address.  I can be friendly towards Israel, the king explained, our  security services can readily cooperate with each other, but the  time is still not ripe for diplomatic relations. The king  stressed that his unique status in the Arab League permitted him  to act effectively on regional issues and establishing  diplomatic relations with Israel would, in his opinion,  terminate this state of affairs.    This week, the Moroccan king received Labor Knesset Member  [MK] Rafi Edri on two occasions. On the first occasion, Edri  was accompanied by Mrs. Feldman, the mother of soldier Tzvi  Feldman who has been missing in action since the battle of  al-Sultan Ya'qub. The king promised to do all he could,  stressing that this matter was beyond politics and that he  considered it an important humanitarian effort. In their second  meeting, Edri handed the king a letter from Prime Minister  Rabin. King Hassan surprised MK Edri when, in a rare gesture,  he awarded him the Moroccan officers' order, which is a very  highly regarded commendation. Shim'on Peres hoped to score some  tangible political achievements in Rabat; however, all the signs  indicate that he will have to be satisfied with a profuse  display of sympathy. It is nevertheless possible that Hassan  may accede to Peres' request to host an international economic  convention in Rabat within the framework of the multilateral  process headed by the foreign minister. [end recording]    [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 3 June in a page  1 report by David Makovsky adds that "Senior officials in  Jerusalem were seeking to dampen earlier expectations that the  two countries would agree on establishing diplomatic interests  as the first stage toward diplomatic relations." The report  points out that "These senior officials categorically denied  that the trip was designed to set up a back-channel for talks  with Syria," noting that "Israeli officials insist that the  Hassan-Peres meeting should be seen in a bilateral, economic  context."]</p>

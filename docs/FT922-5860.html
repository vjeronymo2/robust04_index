			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: White House set to fend off curbs on China trade THE Bush Administration is preparing again to fend off Congressional attempts to place conditions on the favourable trade treatment accorded to Chinese exports, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. Last year, the president was forced to veto legislation putting conditions on China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status, which gives it lower tariffs than those still applied to the former Soviet Union. The veto was sustained in the Senate earlier this year, but only by seven votes. One of the president's key supporters on the issue, Democratic Senator Max Baucus, is now threatening to withdraw his support. The senator is frustrated by the administration's failure to include environmental programmes and a worker's adjustment assistance scheme in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Senator Baucus, who heads the Senate's international trade subcommittee, is one of the most influential voices on trade in the Congress. He supported the administration both on China and renewal of fast-track negotiating authority for the Nafta, but warned that he would reject the latter without strong environmental and labour provisions. The president has until June 3 to notify Congress of his intention to extend China's MFN. Congress could then vote it down, but total rejection is unlikely.</p>

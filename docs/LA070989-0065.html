			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELADON POTTERY LEAVES VISITOR WITH GLAZED LOOK  </P> <P> About 80 years ago a Korean farmer returning from work noticed a curious object  half-hidden along a red dirt path near his home. He thought the item was a  piece of jade -- it had the right texture and color. But once he had picked up  the curio and rubbed it clean, he found a green ceramic duck instead of a  precious stone.  </P> <P> The duck was in good condition, and its charming shape showed the whimsical  intent of its maker.  </P> <P> People in the country had no use for such items, so the farmer went to town the  next day and sold his prize -- a perfect Koryo Dynasty (AD 935-1392) celadon  water dropper.  </P> <P> Serendipitous discoveries such as this were almost routine in early  20th-Century Korea. The story of the duck-shaped calligraphy instrument is not  unique. It was just one of several finds that exposed a cache of ceramics  unlike anything the art world has ever seen.  </P> <P> Celadon is to Korea what Sevres is to France, Ming to China and Delft to the  Netherlands. Until 1910, however, the grayish-green porcelains, symbolic of  South Korea's Golden Age, remained largely forgotten -- buried in aristocratic  tombs for about 600 years -- until unearthed when occupying Japanese began to  dig a network of highways throughout the peninsula.  </P> <P> Since their rediscovery Koryo celadons -- items such as water droppers, hair  ornaments, square pillows, rice bowls, teapots and wine vases -- have delighted  connoisseurs.  </P> <P> In South Korea's capital of Seoul, merchants lug wooden carts piled high with  intricate new inlaid maebyongs (vases with a gourd-shaped top) through crowded  streets of Insa-dong, Seoul's exclusive antique district, where shops show off  medieval ceramics from water droppers to wine bottles.  </P> <P> A few blocks south in the deluxe hotel region of Myong-dong, expensive  galleries in underground arcades lure buyers with one or two flawless Koryo  Dynasty copies.  </P> <P> For a first-time visitor the concentration is dizzying. After a while, however,  saturation gives way to appreciation. And before you know it, a love affair  with the soft green ceramics begins.  </P> <P> Part of what distinguishes Koryo celadons is their elegant simplicity. Unlike  the more flamboyant Mings and Imaris, effects rendered by a celadon maebyong  are as subtle as a Japanese garden.  </P> <P> The maebyong does not reach out and dazzle the observer as does a Ming;  instead, it waits. Its appeal stems from an uncontrived balance of color, motif  and form -- as well as the quiet impression this leaves upon the intellect and  senses.  </P> <P> South Korea's antique celadons are rare and expensive. Prices vary according to  quality and demand, but an authentic Koryo Dynasty bowl, even in poor  condition, is certain to bring $3,000 or more. Foreigners can buy flawed but  charming antique celadons at Insa-dong galleries.  </P> <P> (You must have government approval if you want to take any curio more than 65  years old home with you.)  </P> <P> But if it is perfection you want, do not despair. Reproductions crafted in  mountain kilns using the ancient process make fine substitutes. At city  galleries and even department stores you can buy copies that rival original  Koryo ceramics found in the National Museum of Seoul.  </P> <P> But they do not come cheap. Vases from potters such as Chi Sun-t'aek and Yoo  Keun-hyeong -- both national living treasures -- could cost $8,000 or more.  </P> <P> If your schedule permits, there is a less expensive way to acquire a celadon  souvenir. For one-third the cost and three times the fun, you can travel to a  country kiln and discover what South Koreans mean by "Chosun" or "Morning  Calm."  </P> <P> South Korea's most popular pottery region is this mountain village of Ichon --  about 20 miles south of Seoul, where famous kilns of Koryo-doyo and  Haegang-doyo, craft splendid Koryo celadon reproductions.  </P> <P> In early fall, country dwellers string red peppers atop roofs in preparation  for the kimchi festival (when Korea's staple of hot and spicy pickled cabbage  is celebrated) as workers push for an abundant celadon harvest before the  frigid winter sets in.  </P> <P> Ichon's kilns keep busy, and when its storerooms bulge with pots, you can seize  a masterpiece for a fraction of its gallery value. And better yet, the beauty  of the Korean countryside is there for the seeing.  </P> <P> Fluffy white clouds cap mountains and pepper hills with shadows as if imitating  subtle designs on a 12th-Century celadon vase. In the valley, the harvest nears  and the rice stands tall.  </P> <P> Farmers dressed in white carry heavy loads of produce on their backs and  gracefully walk red dirt paths as if being carried down terraced hills on a  wave of grain.  </P> <P> Part of what distinguishes South Korean celadon from that of the Sung Chinese  lies in these simple pastoral scenes. The graceful lines and sensuous forms  come from familiar objects -- a melon, a gourd, a bamboo shoot, a reed. The  spirited motifs -- ducks playing among reeds, cranes soaring through clouds --  arise from landscapes lyrical and naive.  </P> <P> Good celadon reproductions follow the same painstaking process of the Koryo  period. First, the best clays are selected and taken to the kiln site.  Preparation of the clay is important, for unless a suitably plastic condition  is achieved, the finished product will appear rough.  </P> <P> Also, without the proper mixture of clays containing kaolin and petuntse, a  Chinese discovery called the "bones and flesh" of porcelain, celadons would  crack at the high firing of 1,300 degrees centigrade, and the soft, green glaze  would never fuse with the body.  </P> <P> Twisting up and down Ichon's mountain roads, you encounter kiln upon kiln.  </P> <P> In one room, an artisan with Popeye-sized forearms throws a slab of gray earth  onto a spinning wheel and -- presto -- a shape is born. In another, 12-year-old  apprentices carve intricate designs onto "leather-dried" pots, while older  artists inlay chiseled crevices with white or black slip, depending upon the  master potter's whim. The day that storerooms fill with trimmed pots the real  feat begins -- the glaze.  </P> <P> Of Koryo celadon's three distinguishing features (shape, design and glaze) the  latter is the most important and the hardest to achieve. It is perhaps the  delicate serenity of the celadon glaze -- never opaque, always soft and  transparent -- that most distinguishes the beauty of Koryo pieces.  </P> <P> How a color so lush could emerge from elements as common as flower petals, red  clay and wood ash is a factory secret. While the precise composition of the  iron-oxide-based glaze varies from kiln to kiln, all masters share in one  tradition -- they reveal their formulas only to their heirs.  </P> <P> The best celadons bake in pine-burning kilns that arch like dormers onto  Ichon's wooded mountainsides. Some reproductions are fired in electric ovens,  but modern methods, while more predictive, fail to capture the luster of  medieval Koryo -- especially the soft sparkle caused by melted particles and  bubbles imprisoned within the glaze.  </P> <P> Master potters preferring ancient ways heat with pine even though only one in  10 of their intricately prepared pots will survive. Those that do are  expensive.  </P> <P> If you visit Ichon, you might want to take along a rabbit's foot or two. When  the kilns begin to smoke, a cloud of superstition wafts across the hills.  </P> <P> Believing that spirits reside not only in humans but in natural forces and  inanimate objects, Korean potters call on ancient shaman symbols to ensure a  successful outcome. Some hire mudangs (sorceresses) to perform ceremonies  (kuts) to shake off demons. Others offer food -- pig's heads on tridents -- to  get good spirits on their side.  </P> <P> Spells notwithstanding, fall firings are festive occasions. Besides good buys  (especially on pots judged imperfect for gallery sale), Ichon offers insights  and experiences not shared in Seoul.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The best approach to Ichon, 35 miles southeast of Seoul, is via bus tour or  private car. Your hotel concierge can put you in touch with one of the many  Korean travel agents who offer day trips to Ichon and nearby Kwangju  (Kyonggi-do province).  </P> <P> If you are not the bus-tour type, a chauffeur-driven car can be arranged  through your hotel. Most car-rental agencies, such as Seoul's Hertz-affiliated  Daehan Rent-a-Car, provide drivers. The daily rate (10 hours) for driver and  car is $80, plus tolls for the first 77 miles. After that, the rate changes to  50 cents a mile, plus $6 an hour.  </P> <P> While foreigners can obtain rental cars without drivers, most do not --  especially when traveling outside Seoul. Country road signs are only in Korean,  so persons not fluent in Hangul are advised to pay the modest chauffeur's fee.  </P> <P> About 40 kilns are spread out along the Kwangju-Ichon highway. Most feature  showrooms in addition to factories. The most famous are Chi Sun-t'aek's at 409,  Sugwang-ri Shindun-myon, Ichon, and Yoo Keun-hyeong's at 323-4, Sugwang-ri,  Shindun-myon, Ichon.  </P> <P> In addition to pottery, Ichon is noted for its hot springs. Just off the main  highway at 313-5-Anhung-ri, Ichon-up, is the town's famous resort spa -- Hotel  Seol Bong.  </P> <P> Besides offering some of Korea's best spa facilities, the hotel features both  Western and Korean cuisine.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Korea, contact the Korea National Tourism  Corp., 510 West 6th St., Suite 323, Los Angeles 90014, (213) 623-1226.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copenhagen fur auction prices increase 45% PRICES at this week's Copenhagen fur auction rose by an average of 45 per cent compared with the last auction in February. More than 1m Scanblack mink skins were sold yesterday, with top pelts fetching DKr420 each. On Tuesday all the 1.6m pelts on offer were sold. The Copenhagen auction is Europe's biggest since the London fur auctions closed in 1989. Danish Fur Sales said more than 425 buyers attended, and the rise in prices indicated confirmation of recent optimism in the trade. Italy and Germany were among the main buyers, alongside Greece, Hong Kong and Korea, which have become big manufacturing centres for fur coats. Mr Mike Allan of the Fur Education Council said yesterday the surge in demand followed the first cold winter in Europe after three warm winters. 'The customers have realised that furs are the best way to keep warm in winter,' he said.</p>

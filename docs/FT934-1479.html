			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Manweb increases to Pounds 55m and raises dividend 15% Manweb rounded off the electricity distributors' interim results season by announcing a 14.75 per cent dividend rise from pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 37.1m to Pounds 54.9m for the six months ended September 30. Unlike some other regional companies, which have reported dividend rises of up to 32 per cent, the distributor for North Wales and Merseyside is not rebalancing payments between the two halves of the year. Analysts believe that a 15 per cent rise is likely for the full year and that that will be about average for regional companies. Unlike other recs, the company has not restated its 1992 figures to take account of changes in coal contracts. The company said the underlying profits increase was 25 per cent but added it did not expect to see such a high percentage growth for the year as a whole. Turnover was Pounds 437.4m (Pounds 408.9m) and earnings 34.1p (23.5p) per share. The interim dividend is lifted from 6.1p to 7p. Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said the company added about 90 staff to reach 4,600 in the first half, but added that after cutting 20 per cent of staff since privatisation it was concentrating on improving quality through investment in people and services. Complaints fell 58 per cent and disconnections dropped by 98 per cent to the lowest rate in the country. Units distributed grew by 2.14 per cent, or 1.7 per cent weather corrected. Manweb's supply business was helped by the gain of 15 large customers outside the area. The retail side incurred losses of Pounds 500,000, against profits of Pounds 200,000. COMMENT Now here is an electricity company with a difference. While other regional companies are falling over themselves to answer the city's demands for job cuts, Manweb calmly announces that its headcount went up marginally in the first half of the year, and sees its shares rise later in the day. If the company pays 24.1p this year, the shares are on a prospective yield of 4 per cent, confirming Manweb as one of the highest rated companies. Investors like the highly personable Mr Roberts and the messages he and his team convey. Other recs have told similar stories on improving customer services but somehow he makes it sound more plausible than most; but what the City really admires is the company's stick-to-basics approach. Manweb may have net cash of Pounds 21m but it is not about to follow water companies into dangerous acquisitions and it is the only rec to have eschewed diversification into gas-fired electricity generation. The test of the generation policy will be in the back half of the decade when other companies reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of their diversification. In the meanwhile Manweb is likely to remain a sector favourite.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Management: A safety net for pensioners Revelations of the missing millions at the Maxwell companies' pension funds have set off a clamour for tougher laws for trustees and fund managers. The National Association of Pension Funds thinks the answer is to broaden the boards of trustees and to put strict limits on pension funds investing and dealing in the company's own shares. Others have suggested that trustees should have to pass a 'fit and proper' test. But Robin Ellison, partner at Ellison Westhorp, pensions solicitors and a member of the Occupational Pensions Board, argues that existing pensions law protects members against the alleged transgressions by the Maxwell funds. That view is shared by many within the pensions industry who point out that if Robert Maxwell did transfer pension fund assets to his personal accounts, the actions would be illegal by any definition. Instead, Ellison argues that what is needed is not laws, but insurance. Already, most pension fund trustees who are also company directors are covered by so-called 'directors and officers' policies. Fund managers usually have an 'errors and omissions' policy to cover them for oversights or negligence in their administration of funds. But the amounts insured by these policies are small relative to the funds under management. 'The highest limit we've heard of for trustees is Pounds 5m,' said Michael Ambrose, associate director of insurance brokers Alexander Stenhouse. For fund managers, insurance policies never exceed Pounds 25m, an amount that would do little to help the members of the Maxwell company pension funds. Obtaining insurance cover against fraud is problematic in any industry. 'We cannot indemnify individuals against the consequences of their own dishonest acts,' said Reg Brown, underwriter at RE Brown, a Lloyd's insurance syndicate and a specialist in indemnity insurance in the financial industry. 'It would be like giving someone a licence to print money. Blanket bonds, typical in the banking industry, insure corporate managers and directors against the dishonest actions of their own employees. But a group of pension fund trustees, for instance, could not insure itself against fraud. Brown said that pension fund beneficiaries can - and do  - obtain insurance of that type. However, the ceiling on reimbursable losses is roughly Pounds 20m - too little to comfort the Maxwell fund pensioners. Ellison is urging a policy that does not yet exist. He suggests that pension fund managers should be required to obtain insurance equal to the amount under management. Insurance companies would then price their policies after assessing the internal controls of the fund manager or trustee rather than their competence in earning a high return on investment. Well managed firms would pay low premiums, while those that were sloppy would pay more. Given the low historical incidence of misconduct among pension fund managers or trustees - the Maxwell funds are the first scandal within memory - premiums should be affordable even though insurers would be asked to cover billions of pounds of liabilities. To pension fund managers, a market approach to regulation has some appeal. 'It's a very interesting concept,' said Clive Gilchrist, of Aberdeen Trust and chairman of the NAPF's investment committee. 'If everybody had to obtain it, given the history of low risk, I'm sure it would be available.' The catch, Gilchrist says, is that the insurers would have to set premiums reflecting the risk of each individual fund manager. 'Otherwise you get a savings and loan situation,' he said. In the US savings and loan industry, risky institutions paid the same insurance premiums as healthy ones, leaving no incentive to invest assets safely. But the insurance industry is chary of taking on the task of evaluating either the probity or the efficiency of the fund management industry. 'Insurers tend to be very bad regulators,' Brown said.</p>

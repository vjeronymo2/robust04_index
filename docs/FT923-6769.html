			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Treasurers digest details of privatisation debt sale - Maggie Urry examines the auction's structure THE structure dreamed up by Baring Brothers for the UK government's sale of privatised companies' debts had corporate treasurers of the businesses concerned scratching their heads yesterday. Although they knew the debt sale was coming, they only learnt the intricacies of the sale in letters sent to them yesterday. Given also a natural reluctance to show their hands in advance of a bidding process, many retreated behind statements about the need for further consultation and the complexity of the tax issues involved. A period for consultation, between now and the end of September, has been built into the sale timetable. Details of the mechanics of the sale will be announced by the end of September with the auction taking place soon afterwards. The auction aims to sell Pounds 1bn of the Pounds 3.7bn debt, with maturities after 1997 and paying interest rates between 11 1/2 per cent and 13 per cent, owed by BT and 12 electricity companies to the government. The debt will be sold in whole tranches - there are 29 in all with the largest being a Pounds 350m loan to National Power - so the total of Pounds 1bn is approximate. Within that constraint, though, the highest bidders will be included in the Pounds 1bn and the loans of the rest will continue to run. Because there are different terms on the debt of BT and the electricity companies, the debt is being divided into two pools. BT, which has Pounds 1.7bn of the debt in question, will be in one pool able to bid for the debt itself but also competing against outsiders who can bid as well. In the other pool are the electricity companies with a total of Pounds 2.1bn of debt. There is no fixed allocation of purchases between the two pools - the government could sell the whole Pounds 1bn to BT or to the electricity companies - so the bidders in each pool are in effect bidding against the other pool, as well as against rivals in the same pool. Mr Douglas Brown, head of capital markets at Barings, said that the structure of the deal 'will create price tension within and between the bidders'. This should, he believed, maximise proceeds for the taxpayer. A further complication is that the tranches carry different interest rates and maturities, and the covenants on the loans vary between borrowers. There are also tax angles to consider. Thus absolute prices for the debt cannot be compared. To resolve this Barings will set a benchmark price for each tranche of debt on a tax adjusted basis. Bidders will then put in prices expressed at a premium to the benchmark price. Bids will be accepted in terms of descending order of the percentage premium offered. While the government is trying to whip up excitement for the buy-back, in order to achieve the best price, the companies are keen to appear relaxed. Most have strong balance sheets, some with net cash. So there is no great pressure to refinance their debts at lower rates, especially as they will have to pay a premium to buy the debt back. This premium will not be tax deductible while the interest payments are. 'Everyone will work out a price where the effect will be neutral, and no-one will bid above that,' one analyst said. However, there is another, non-economic, incentive for the companies to bid. In BT's case it is bidding against third parties - and BT is one of the few UK corporates with AAA rated debt - while the electricity companies know that if they do not buy their debt back the government will be free to sell it next year. Buying the debt back will give them control of their borrowings again. As the covenants on the government loans are in general more restrictive than is usual on bank debt or bonds, the buy-back would make it easier for the companies to deal with other lenders. With so many factors to consider, the companies and their advisers, as well as potential third party bidders for the BT debt, have much to think about over the next few weeks. One conclusion that can be reached at this stage is that the process will be fascinating.</p>

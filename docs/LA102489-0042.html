			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAIL IS DENIED LA HABRA MAN SOUGHT AS NAZI  </P> <P> A La Habra man sought by the West German government on charges of murdering  World War II concentration camp prisoners while transporting them to a camp in  Austria was denied bail Monday.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Ronald G. Parker contended that one-time Nazi prison guard  Bruno Karl Blach, 69, should remain free because the shootings he is accused of  took place in Austria rather than West Germany.  </P> <P> The attorney also maintained that Blach could not be prosecuted because he was  born in Czechoslovakia and was not a German citizen.  </P> <P> In denying bail, U.S. Magistrate Venetta S. Tassopoulos ruled that such issues  can be debated at an extradition hearing next month.  </P> <P> Blach said in an affidavit: "I have no intent nor motivation to flee this  country or this area. In fact, I would have no country or other area to flee  to, in that I am stateless."  </P> <P> During the hearing, however, a federal prosecutor disclosed that Blach recently  applied for a West German passport that, if granted, would have allowed him to  travel almost anywhere in the world.  </P></p>

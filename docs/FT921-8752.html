			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Wine: Bordeaux faces a difficult time - A look into the vats that hold the 1991 vintage BEHIND closed doors, the chateau owners of Bordeaux and their senior staff are making up the assemblage: the blend from the best vats of wine from the three or four grape varieties in their vineyards. In a month or so, they will present the grand vins 1991, which will bear the chateau labels. These days, up to 200 of the better-known properties also will be assembling a second-wine blend. This year, though, there are special problems because of last April's late frost and heavy September rain. Production has had to be reduced heavily, particularly the generic bordeaux rouge and blanc, Entre-Deux-Mers, Medoc and Graves, as well as St Emilion and Pomerol beyond the Dordogne. Bourg and Blaye were spared largely because they sit on the Gironde right bank which was affected less. In the Medoc, the vineyards near the river came off best. At Latour, the main vineyard has produced 40-50 per cent of its normal crop; inland, however, the vines for its second wine, Les Forts de Latour, suffered badly. Next-door Pichon-Lalande has only 20 per cent of its normal crop while Ducru-Beaucaillou and Grand-Puy-Lacoste produced only a third of the average. Palmer has estimated a similar proportion. Yet, St-Estephe Montrose and Meyney, on the hillside overlooking the Gironde, were not touched at all, although Cos d'Estournel behind was struck severely. In the Graves the output also was very small, and one classed-growth owner expects to produce no grand vin. The vintage is not to be dismissed, though. The enforced small yields could lead to higher quality. At a very prominent Medoc chateau recently, the just-assembled '91 grand vin (not yet in cask) had a deep colour, fine nose and full, fruity flavour. I agreed with the regisseur that it was better than the excellent '90, tasted at the same time. Moreover, a new report by Vintex, the British-run Bordeaux merchants, states that 'any first-generation bunches that survived the frost produced a well-built, dark-coloured Merlot-dominated wine, quite similar in style to 1985 or even better . . . In the Medoc the general reaction is of satisfaction and relative surprise at the colour, body and flesh of the Merlots, which compensate the weaker, less ripe Cabernets.' But those made from the second-flower grapes were 'extremely variable'. Should there, then, be en primeur offers of '91 clarets from April onwards? Those chateaux that made a reasonable quantity of good wines obviously would like this, and they will be essential for the cash-short small growers. But, influenced no doubt by the poor results in St Emilion and Pomerol, Christian Moueix of Petrus, an owner or merchant of other right-bank properties, is against offering still-doubtful wines that have only had a few months in cask. 'Wait until they are in bottle and their quality can be seen,' is his view. Yet, those with limited cellar storage might face problems in accommodating an additional unsold vintage. The Bordeaux trade, starved of cash flow since the '90s were offered last year, certainly would like an en primeur offer as well. But would they find immediate buyers? In the recession-hit UK and US, this is unlikely on any scale and, even after three good vintages, at least doubtful within France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Bordeaux is going through a difficult time. Two small merchants went bankrupt and one large, old-established merchant house is said to be in distress. Several important chateaux are on the market, including Gruaud-Larose and Talbot. Cordier, Talbot's owner, has been trying to sell these properties in a package together with others in and outside the Gironde. Rausan-Segla, owned by a trust belonging to George Walker, formerly of Brent Walker, is reported to be for sale at between FFr40m-50m. On top of this, there is a two-way traffic across the Atlantic in fine Bordeaux wines, including the return in a single consignment from a leading American importer of no fewer than 40 containers of 1,200 cases apiece. The position will be clarified in April when the Union des Grands Crus holds its annual series of tastings of the new red and white wines, at which their quality can be assessed. In a difficult year, British merchants would like to make an opening offer - but only very attractive prices could provide an excuse. While the '88s sold as 'classic,' the '89s as 'outstanding' and the '90s as 'rich, more regular,' it is difficult to think of any reason why their customers should invest in '91s in the near future. Christian Moueix could be right. After all, in-bottle is how we used to buy even the best vintages before the investment-in-wine boom started over 20 years ago.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Era ends at IBM Japan with chief's resignation THE sudden resignation of Mr Takeo Shiina from his post of chief executive at IBM Japan, the wholly-owned subsidiary of International Business Machines of the US, has shocked both the company's employees and its rivals. The decision comes as the company is attempting to shift its business strategy from hardware to software business. It represents the end of an era and of the active business involvement of a man who has changed the corporate culture of a subsidiary of one of the most famous US companies. 'I'm tired after 40 years,' said Mr Shiina, who is now the largely ceremonial chairman of IBM Japan. 'I'm not the kind of person who'll drag work to his grave.' He said he had decided to 'retire' as IBM Japan's chief executive earlier this month after being criticised by the local media of still trying to exert his power after handing over the presidency to Mr Kakutaro Kitashiro. With Mr Shiina's resignation and the departure of Mr John Akers as chief executive of IBM, analysts fear that the relationship between the Japanese group and its US parent, under which the former had almost total autonomy, could change radically. Mr Shiina argued for a flexible approach to the Japanese market in the late 1970s. He warned that the company needed to adapt to Japanese conditions, rather than merely apply the same global business strategy. This included centralised development of computer hardware and software. It also meant a marketing policy which stressed direct sales through the company's own sales force, rather than the construction of dealer networks, and a rigid adherence to fixed prices. Under Mr Shiina, IBM Japan formed a joint-venture company in 1983 to operate a leasing system and set up a network of independent dealers to sell its medium-sized computers. Mr Shiina also dealt with the Japanese system of 'administrative guidance' in a Japanese way. He wined and dined government officials and politicians at IBM's convention centre at the foot of Mount Fuji. He sat on an important advisory board at the ministry of trade and industry, and IBM Japan managed to join the ranks of leading Japanese companies at the Keidanren, the business leaders' organisation. Although IBM Japan earned high profits for more than 20 years due to its dominance in the Japanese mainframe market, the sluggish Japanese economy and fall in capital investment has hit earnings. The slump in IBM Japan's profitability may force its parent to impose more aggressive cost-cutting measures. Even Mr Shiina, long an advocate of Japanese-style management, has now pointed out that business management at Japanese companies needs to change. 'Japanese companies cannot go on unscathed by foreign criticism without making sacrifices. They need to bleed, too,' he said.</p>

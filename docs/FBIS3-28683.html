			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  Wednesday [9 February] adopted a tax reform platform for fiscal  1994 following the previous day's agreement among coalition  leaders on the tax issue. The seven-party coalition, in line  with Tuesday's accord, called for a one-year, 5.47 trillion yen  income and resident tax cut and taxation modifications to  rectify inequities.    Measures proposed to redress the tax burden inequalities  include a levy of 10 percent on entertainment expenses declared  by companies even within the currently nontaxable limit and a  punitively heavy tax on companies' unexplained expenses.    Inheritance taxation would be relaxed by enlarging tax  brackets and lowering tax rates.    Liquor taxes would be raised, such as a 9 yen tax increase  on  a 633-milliliter bottle of beer.    Also included in the proposal are tax incentives for  stimulating land and housing transactions.</p>

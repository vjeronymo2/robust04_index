			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Campbell snubs calls for nuclear arms ban Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's new foreign affairs and defence spokesman, yesterday called for Britain to maintain its level of military spending, in spite of traditional calls from some delegates for unilateral nuclear disarmament. Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and progressive cuts in defence spending given the end of the cold war. But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference as they did in the mid-1980s. The party endorsed each proposal to maintain defence spending put forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there. He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Campbell said any attempt by the UN to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other factions would destroy the efforts of UK peace-keeping troops.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL TO PLAY IN TENNIS EVENT  </P> <P> The Occidental College women's tennis team leaves for the third annual Las  Vegas Invitational tournament today.  </P> <P> In addition to Occidental, the tournament field comprises Cal State  Bakersfield, Utah State, Cal State San Bernardino, UC Riverside and Cal  Lutheran. The Tigers, who finished third in the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with a 9-3 record (12-11 overall) last  season, lost the four top players off that squad to graduation.  </P> <P> Unlike traditional tournaments, the Las Vegas tournament will be contested in  flights, with each team's top-seeded player meeting the top-seeded players from  each of the other teams, the No. 2 players meeting the other schools' No. 2  players and so on. Team scoring is not tabulated under the tournament format.  </P> <P> Last year, Sue Hulse of Occidental won the flight for top-seeded players. SAM  FARMER  </P></p>

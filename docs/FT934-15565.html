			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Finland helps Eurosterling sector back to life THE EUROSTERLING sector of the international bond market has bounced back to life, helped by a sizeable new issue from Finland last week and the prospect of further new issuance in the coming week. Depfa (Germany's largest mortgage bank), Fisons, and Turkey are three of the names being talked about in the market as likely to launch Eurosterling deals this week, although a big question mark hangs over the latter. On Friday, Moody's, the credit rating agency, placed Turkey's rating under review for possible downgrade because of concern about its deteriorating public finances. Turkey has a long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's, making it investment grade. If Moody's lowers the rating, it would fall into the sub-investment grade category. At worst, Turkey's Eurosterling issue could be postponed until a decision on the debt rating is taken, although market participants on Friday thought the deal would probably still go ahead but with a more generous yield pick-up over gilts than the 220 basis points initially indicated by the lead manager. This year has seen a record amount of Eurosterling issuance, admittedly at a time when the international bond market as a whole is witnessing record volume. Eurosterling issuance so far this year has reached Pounds 25.012bn, up from 1992's total of Pounds 13.107bn, according to figures compiled by Euromoney. Much of this year's issuance, however, took place in the first and second quarters. Foreign investors were willing to buy sterling assets to take advantage of currency appreciation, while investors in general were attracted by the relatively high yields and the prospect of falling interest rates. Borrowers hungry for funds took advantage of the demand and in many cases the deals were swap-driven. Eurosterling yield spreads over appropriate gilts have declined quite substantially this year. For example, the SG Warburg Securities All-Stocks Non-Gilt Index shows the average spread over gilts has fallen from 98 basis points at the end of 1992, to a low of 58 basis points on August 24, and stood at 61 basis points on Friday. For example, BT launched a 10-year Pounds 500m issue at a spread of 18 basis points over the gilt on August 25. Since then, the spread has tightened considerably and last Friday, Lehman Brothers, joint lead manager for the deal, was quoting a spread over the gilt of 3 basis points (bid) or flat (offer). 'Spreads have been tight and they are now beginning to reach a low,' said one dealer, adding that this was a reflection of strong demand from overseas investors, many of whom were attracted by Eurosterling yields and the prospect of sterling appreciation, particularly against a background of declining European interest rates. After a period of consolidation in September, the sector appears to have recovered and rumours of further new issuance have started to circulate. However, despite investors' calls for long-dated paper, new supply is likely to be concentrated in the short and medium-dated areas given the positive shape of the yield curve. Most issuance this year has been in the six to 10-year area, with this sector accounting for Pounds 12.509bn, compared with Pounds 6.311bn in the one to five-year area. A few names in the financial sector have opted for longer-dated subordinated capital but corporate names have steered clear of the ultra-long area. 'If you are a corporate borrower, it is difficult to convince your board to lock into interest rates at 9 per cent at the long end when short interest rates are 6 per cent,' said one dealer. It seems unlikely that corporate borrowers will issue ultra-long bonds unless the yield curve starts to flatten. 'At present, any company which borrows at the long end and does not put the money to immediate use is going to suffer an enormous opportunity cost of carry,' said Mr Tony Moverley of Baring Sterling Bonds. Also, most corporate borrowers expect long-term interest rates to continue to decline, perhaps to 6.75 - 7.00 per cent from the current level of 7.2 per cent. 'Frankly, most UK corporates can afford to wait,' says Mr Peter Capel of Hoare Govett.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE BY MARSHALL MCLUHAN &amp; QUENTIN  FIORE (TOUCHSTONE: $8.95)  </P> <P> Marshall McLuhan's central thesis, that the medium of transmission determines  how information is perceived, has obvious implications for a society  increasingly saturated with electronic data.  </P> <P> The revolution in communications technology that spawned the FAX machine, the  personal computer with modem, cable and satellite television and the video  cassette has brought his concept of the "global village" closer to reality.  Ironically, McLuhan's ideas remain fresh and cogent, but their presentation in  this reprint has become a hilariously passe monument to hip '60s graphics. The  solarized photographs, exotic type faces, Op Art patterns and serial images  make this book seem as dated as a zoot suit.  </P></p>

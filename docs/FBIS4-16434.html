			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 16 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  (independent newspaper) on the CIS summit:    "The economic integration of CIS member-countries proceeds  perhaps more successfully than the resolution of many regional  conflicts. The fact that the bulk of the package of issues  considered dealt with the situation in the Republic of  Tajikistan and the Transcaucasus shows that the Russian  Federation tries to apply all CIS instruments to somehow secure  the powers of its troops at flashpoints and share responsibility  with ex-Soviet republics".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI believes that "one can view as the main  achievements of the summit the establishment of a permanently  functioning agency -- a commission for economic union affairs --  at the CIS coordinating consultative committee and the signing  of an agreement between Russia and all the CIS countries on a  multi-sided free trade area".    Referring to remarks by Vladimir Mashits, Russian minister  for cooperation, the newspaper points out: "The implementation  of this agreement may begin soon".    PRAVDA on the CIS summit outcome:    "There were no sensations. The only more or less mature  undertaking -- the establishment of an economic union underwent  development. The establishment of a free trade area will  possibly become the first step towards reunification.    "Thus, the vector of the movement has been chosen: to  recreate the union, an economic one at first, and subsequently a  Euro-Asian one."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an interview with Yuriy  Meshkov, the first-ever president of the Republic of the Crimea.    In response to a question about the Crimean president's view  of the future of the Black Sea Fleet and its status, Meshkov  said: "The fleet should be Russian, since Ukraine is not in a  position to maintain it... I think the Black Sea Fleet has been  and remains the guarantor of stability in the Crimea and an  important element of the balance of forces in the south European  region."    TRUD on the birth centenary of former Soviet leader Nikita  Khrushchov:    "The transformation era of Khrushchov days created a culture  medium which brought forth people who arrived at conclusions  about the essence of administrative socialism, its historical  prospectlessness and the need to wind up the experiment on its  basis and launch a quest for new principles for the life of  millions of people".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Khrushchov's birth centenary:    "Thousands of innocent people who were subjected to  repressions are grateful to Khrushchov for the regained freedom  and rehabilitation.    "And still, under Khrushchov, we began to be dependent on  overseas bread. Prices began to move upwards, and haphazard  reorganisations were launched. In such affairs, associates  recede into the background, leaving the leader confronted with  the social discontent."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an article the writer of which  points out that, to his mind, there is still the need for a  long, thorough and impartial analysis of everything that was  done by Nikita Khrushchov, one of the most distinctive and  complex politicians of the 20th century".</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Sport: Rivals become partners - Golf Thirty years ago their rivalry was such that the American golfing public decreed it to be a clash between the good guy and the bad, with Arnold Palmer cast very much in the former role and 'fat' Jack Nicklaus in the latter. Of course, the sport's followers learned in time to shower an equal amount of affection on Nicklaus. For a start, there is nothing that America likes more than a winner and no one ever won like the Golden Bear. But it is only in recent times that their own personal differences have eased to the extent that they could kindle a friendship. Now, wherever there is a golf tournament, and in particular a major championship, the pair are often to be found in each other's company and they will always play at least one practice round together as partners. Perhaps they are making up for lost time. Nicklaus, with the nice line in deprecation he has developed since his golf skills have diminished, puts it this way: 'Thirty years ago we played a very competitive game against one another knowing that whoever won would invariably win the golf tournament as well. Now we play a very competitive game to see who avoids having the wooden spoon.' These days of grace are slowly coming to an end, though, or at least the public aspect of it. Palmer has already given up visiting Britain to play in the Open championship; and at Oakmont, Pennsylvania, on the eve of the US Open, he announced that this would also be his last appearance in the second of golf's four majors. It is an appropriate place at which to take his leave. It was in 1942 that Harry Saxman decided that the 12-year-old Palmer, who was born just 10 miles away at Latrobe, had already acquired enough golfing skills to experience the glories of Oakmont. By 1952, with Oakmont in the process of being split by the Philadelphia turnpike, then under construction - seven holes on one side of the road and 11 on the other - Palmer had already begun building bridges between the trad-itional game of golf and the modern. Palmer was the sport's Elvis Presley; he introduced an element of dare and panache. Palmer respected all the game's codes and discipline but he tore up the unwritten laws about playing sensibly and carefully. Peter Thomson won one of his five Open titles by never using a driver off the tee. Such an idea was anathema to Palmer. His idea of the game was to hit the ball as far as possible, find it, and hit it as far as possible again. Even today, he is a superb driver of the ball. He can still hit it 250 yards. But there are vast areas of Palmer's game which betray the fact he is in his sunset years. His iron play is poor, his chipping mediocre and his putting downright awful. What he has never lost is his enthusiasm for the sport. 'There are days when I just can't do a damned thing right and that's hard for me to bear. But this game, it's my soul in a way and there will always be something during a round that will give me pleasure and start me back to thinking that I can still play the way I want to play.' At Oakmont on Wednesday, the fact that Palmer did not walk down the centre of the fairways had nothing to do with inaccuracy. He had to talk with his people. They called him Mr Palmer and they applauded rather too loudly when his ball finished 40ft from the flag. Nicklaus was playing poorly, too. He won the US Open here in 1962, defeating Palmer in an 18-hole play-off, and in 90 holes he had just one three-putt. In his final practice round - alone this time - he had seven. Nicklaus has also recognised that the game which made his name has moved on. He has hinted that this could be his last US Open, too. There were days when Nicklaus could not stand the sight of Palmer - the player with the looks, the style and the support of the crowd. Now it is as if he cannot bear the thought of turning up at a major championship without the man he has finally learned to call partner.</p>

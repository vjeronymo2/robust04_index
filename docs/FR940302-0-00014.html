A work-around provides for an alternative method of meeting a commissioning criteria through the application for a pre-approved operational procedure implemented on a temporary basis. The WSR&hyph;88D Plan referenced below includes a process for recommending, approving, and documenting work arounds and requires that they be tracked as open items until they can be eliminated by implementation of the originally intended capability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Reference: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The criteria and evaluation elements for commissioning are set forth and further detailed in the NWS-Sponsored WSR&hyph;88D Site Component Commissioning Plan (the 88D Plan) and an Attachment to that Plan, called the WSR&hyph;88D Site Component Commissioning Evaluation Package (the WSR&hyph;88D Package). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Criteria: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  a. WSR&hyph;88D Radar Acceptance Test: The site component acceptance test, which includes objective tests to demonstrate that the WSR&hyph;88D radar, as installed at the given site, meets its technical specifications, has been successfully completed in accordance with items 1a&hyph;f, p. A&hyph;2 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Availability of Trained Operations and Maintenance Personnel: Adequate operations and maintenance staffs are available, training materials are available, and required training has been completed in accordance with items 2a&hyph;h, pp. A&hyph;3 &amp; A&hyph;4 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Satisfactory Operation of System Interfaces: The system can be operated in all of its required modes and in conjunction with all of its interfacing equipment in accordance with items 3a&hyph;e, p. A&hyph;5 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Satisfactory Support of Associated NWS Forecasting and Warning Services: The system provides proper support of NWS forecasting and warning services, including at least 96 percent availability of the radar coded message for a period of 30 consecutive days prior to commissioning in accordance with items 4a&hyph;kk, pp. A&hyph;6 to A&hyph;17 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Service Backup Capabilities: Service backup capabilities function properly when the primary system is inoperable in accordance with items 5a&hyph;e, p. A&hyph;18 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Documentation for Operations and Maintenance: A full set of operations and maintenance documentation is available in accordance with items 6a&hyph;n, pp. A&hyph;19 to A&hyph;25 of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Spare Parts and Test Equipment: A full complement of spare parts and test equipment is available on site in accordance with items 7a&hyph;e, p. A&hyph;26, of Appendix A of the WSR&hyph;88D Package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Decommissioning an Outdated NWS Radar <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Successful decomissioning of an old radar requires assurance that the existing radar is no longer needed to support delivery of services and products and local office operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> References: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The criteria and evaluation elements for decommissioning are set forth and further detailed in the NWS-Sponsored Network and Local Warning Radars (Including Adjunct Equipment) Site Component Decommissioning Plan (the Plan), more specifically in Appendix B to that Plan, called the Site Component Decommissioning Evaluating Package, and in Section 3.3 of the Internal and External Communication and Coordination Plan for the Modernization and Associated Restructuring of the Weather Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

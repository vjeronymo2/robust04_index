Their talks  lasted for more than two hours. Nimetz arrived on a two-day  working visit to the FYROM yesterday ahead of the resumption of  negotiations between Skopje and Athens in New York on 13 June.    In a press statement following his talks with Gligorov,  which  were also attended by Macedonian Foreign Relations Minister  Stevo Crvenkovski, Nimetz said that he spoke about the topics of  great importance for regional developments. According to  Nimetz, it is inappropriate to give any forecasts as regards the  outcome of future negotiations. [passage omitted]</p>

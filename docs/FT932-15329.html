			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Rather rapid rotation Sir, John Patten, the education secretary, may be the nation's headmaster (Man in the News, April 11) but he is the fifth in six years. Joseph (early 1987), Baker, MacGregor and Clarke have all had their day. One wonders what readers would make of a school, or for that matter a company, that has had so many chief executives in so short a time. J A D'Arcy, King's Walk, Malmesbury, Wiltshire SN16 9DB</p>

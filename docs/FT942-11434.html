			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (12): Measured activities - League tables provide evidence of general trends Senior bankers' views of M &amp; A league tables border on the schizophrenic. If their bank is doing well, they will happily use the tables as marketing tools, sprinkling them liberally over every brochure they produce. When their bank is not doing well, the tables are ignored, if not actively denigrated. Another view is the pragmatic one: if the tables are going to be published and publicised, they might as well be accurate. If properly compiled, the tables are a useful measure of relative and overall market activity. 'The tables are good for providing evidence of general trends, showing what's going on and who's doing what,' says Mr Lewis Lee, a director in Merrill Lynch International's M &amp; A department in London. There are a number of caveats, however, including excessive geographic and industry segmentation. 'That tends to give a misleading interpretation of what's going on and the strengths and weaknesses of the banks,' says Mr Lee. Another limitation which has to be acknowledged is that the subjective nature of interpretation means league tables can be produced to bolster virtually any argument. The tables feature two principal kinds of distortion, according to Mr Ali Wambold, head of international, Lazard Brothers, and a partner of Lazard Freres in New York: misunderstanding the methodology and over or under-reporting deals. 'We are chronic under-reporters; our whole philosophy is built on discretion, and our instinct is not to disclose. Not all the business we do appears in league tables.' Some banks have been known to go to the other extreme, claiming for deals they might not have been involved in. Furthermore, modern deals have become much more sophisticated, and more difficult for the tables to measure. 'It used to be boy meets girl, boy buys girl,' says Mr Wambold. 'Today, it's much more multi-faceted than A buying B. Joint ventures muddy the waters, and there's a lot of restructuring taking place. How do you capture this in league tables as a measure of merchant bank involvement in the strategic positioning of a company?' Mr Robin Broadley, deputy chairman of Baring Brothers, saw the emergence of league tables around 10 years ago as a good thing, but today joins those highlighting the need for care in interpretation because of the different criteria applied by different compilers. 'One clear problem is their concentration on business involving quoted securities,' he says. 'A lot of our business is not of that type.' Barings is among those banks that have been running press advertisements highlighting recent league table performance. In its case, these have focused on its success, in tandem with Dillon Read, its strategic partner in the US, in heading Securities Data Corp's 1993 transatlantic M&amp;A rankings. Another bank that has been displaying its enthusiasm for the tables with a series of advertisements is Union Bank of Switzerland. 'Recent league tables showing us in a top-five position in European cross-border M&amp;A deals are a clear demonstration of our emergence as a leading investment bank,' argues Mr Stephen Brisby, head of European corporate finance at UBS. There is broad agreement then that the tables, while far from perfect, are useful, if only as a snapshot of which banks are involved in transactions in one particular period. 'They do not give a true picture of what relationships really exist between banks and companies; that can only be judged by looking at the tables over a longer period than one year,' says Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell. Adds Mr Will Samuel, joint head of J Henry Schroder Wagg's investment banking division in London, 'They are not something that wins you business, but they can give a buyer confidence that you are a brand leader.' Students of the tables are further urged to take into account the volume of deals done as well as their value. Banks can climb the tables very quickly on the back of a single large deal, the classic example being in 1989 when a plethora of advisers were involved on the Pounds 13.5bn bid by Hoylake for BAT Industries. All those listed received full credit in the headline tables for 1989, even though the bid failed lamentably. This deal also brutally reinforced the point that league table success in any year is no guarantee of a rosy future. Who can forget that a prominent adviser on that bid was one Drexel Burnham Lambert? Probably the two most quoted tables today are those produced by the UK's Acquisitions Monthly magazine and by Securities Data Corp of the US. 'Acquisitions Monthly has been compiling league tables for 10 years,' says Mr Philip Healey, the magazine's editor and publisher. 'We hope we have gained respect for our independence and fairness. Over the past six months, the league tables have become more and more important in the market place in Europe. Some banks are stretching the truth, taking advantage of the growing complexity of some European deals and confusion over the various degrees of possible involvement.' The simplest tables are probably those compiled by Crawford's Directory of City Connections, for financial advisers, stockbrokers and public relations advisers. There is no argument about the methodology behind, or fairness of, these tables which are compiled by awarding one point for each client, and a half point for joint adviser status. This relationship-centred method is immune to the huge fluctuations of fortunes that can be experienced with the transactions-related methods. 'We feel our tables are a very objective measure,' says Adria Kinloch, editor of Crawford's. 'The information is compiled and confirmed by the companies themselves and reflects a long-term relationship rather than short-term dealing.' It is difficult to see the rankings compiled by the industry's leading publications developing into a more formal system. The compilers are arguably as objective as can be and so long as the different criteria are understandable, logical, fair and consistent, bankers are generally happy. A radical step might be for the banks who benefit from the tables in their marketing to fund the independent production of a new independent set of tables to an agreed industry standard. As things stand, though, the international M &amp; A arena is like the world of international boxing, boasting a proliferation of organisations distributing titles with gay abandon. While the purists might like to see unification, the marketing men like the wide range of tables available.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- League table of financial advisers on European cross-border deals (January - December 1993)  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Ranked by value of deals Adviser                 No of deals   Value (Pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Lazard Houses (3*)               22          4,848 Morgan Grenfell (8)              44          3,558 Goldman Sachs (2)                32          3,545 Morgan Stanley (14)              16          3,090 Union Bank of Switzerland (-)    18          2,453 S G Warburg (1)                  21          2,179 Credit Suisse First Boston (12)  14          1,776 Rothschild Group (13)            10          1,744 Schroders (11)                   28          1,695 J P Morgan (5)                   23          1,448 Enskilda (10)                     4          1,195 Credit Lyonnais (-)              16          1,180 Wasserstein Perella (-)           5          1,066 Kleinwort Benson (19)            10          1,010 Barclays de Zoete Wedd (17)      14            925 Lehman Brothers (16)             11            884 Salomon Brothers (-)             10            857 Price Waterhouse (15)            29            801 Credit Commercial de France (-)   8            729 Barings (7)                      10            633  ---------------------------------------------------------------- * 1992 full-year ranking  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly/AMDATA III  ----------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK public and private league table 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                  Public deals   Private deals  Combined totals                          No     Value    No     Value    No     Value                            (Pounds m)     (Pounds m)     (Pounds m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- S G Warburg (1*)           7      138    36    5,133     43     5,271 Morgan Grenfell (4)        7      436    35    2,055     42     2,491 Kleinwort Benson (10)      8    1,359    13      753     21     2,112 Schroders (20)             9      718    25    1,324     34     2,042 Hambros Bank (16)          1      758    15      958     16     1,716 Barclays de Zoete Wedd (7) 5      557    13      871     18     1,428 Lazard (9)                 7      408    20    1,016     27     1,424 Baring Bros (8)            7      645    18      688     25     1,333 KPMG Corporate Finance(11) 2       10    89    1,301     91     1,311 Wasserstein Perella (-)    2      247     3      730      5       977 Samuel Montagu (3)         4      339    15      361     19       700 Price Waterhouse (12)      -        -   116      750    116       750 Morgan Stanley (17)        -        -     6      693      6       693 NatWest Markets (-)        4      251    12      407     16       658 Swiss Bank Corp (-)        1      206     4      430      5       636 UBS (-)                    -        -    14      625     14       625 Charterhouse (14)          3       18    11      587     14       605 Coopers &amp; Lybrand (13)     1       22    82      572     83       597 Robert Fleming (18)        3      285    21      304     24       589 Touche Ross (20)           1        -    82      472     83       472  --------------------------------------------------------------------- This table is based on the 1993 UK public league table plus UK private transactions completed between January and December 1993. * 1992 full-year ranking  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly/AMDATA III  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

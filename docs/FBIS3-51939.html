			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] In an exclusive interview granted to the "National"  newscast, Regiment Commander Fernando Caldera [National Police  commander] said the population should rest assured that the  Police will guarantee public order and security during the  current transportation strike, which Caldera described as  generally peaceful with no regrettable violence.    Commander Fernando Caldera asserted that the transportation  workers' strike has not exceeded the limits of peace and  tranquility. To contribute to that atmosphere, the Police have  allowed vehicles to be parked on the streets so long as they are  not blocking traffic.    Caldera also listed the incidents that have taken place,  including the arrest of two armed persons and some broken  windows on vehicles belonging to those who support the strike as  well as to those who continue to provide service to the  population.    Caldera denied that there have been traffic jams in Managua  or in any other part of the country.    [Begin Caldera recording] The only incident that has taken  place was this morning in Ciudad Sandino, where a group of  transportation workers blocked the road. We went there and were  able to persuade them to unblock the road, then we left a  stronger Police contingent in the area.    There was another small incident. Some young children -- 13  or 14 years old -- threw some stones, but it was not important.  They didn't do any damage.    Some have said there was a traffic jam on 4th Avenue, but  that is not true. We also received reports of a traffic jam in  a place called El Capulina in Granada, but that was not true,  either. There were buses on the sides of the street, but no  traffic jam.    Generally speaking, the atmosphere has been tranquil in the  rest of the country. [end recording]    Caldera denied the statements made by Gustavo Aguiluz, a  member of the National Transportation Commission, who asserted  that 20 taxi drivers had been arrested.    [Begin Caldera recording; in progress] ... saying we had  arrested 20 taxi drivers in the (Repotola) 15. We were very  annoyed by that, because if, as a union leader, he wants to heat  up the strike, he has every right. However, we do not agree  that he should do it at the expense of the Police, that is to  say, by causing a state of alert at the expense of the Police.  There have been absolutely no incidents in (Repotola) 15. [end  recording]    The Police will continue to take the necessary measures to  maintain public order, thus preventing the appearance of  firearms and violence.    [Begin Caldera recording] People who have carried weapons  during past events should indeed worry because we are keeping an  eye on them. Those who have not carried weapons can feel calm.  Simply put, everyone who we suspect of carrying weapons or  anyone who we know was armed during past events should worry,  because we are keeping an eye on them. It is true. Why?  Because that person was carrying a weapon.    Everyone who has not been involved in violence can be calm  because we have no problem with them. Let's put it that way.    However, it is definitely untrue that we have arrested or  harassed anyone. I will say, however, that anyone who is going  around armed should worry. That is our duty, and we are  determine to banish violence and the use of violent methods.  [end recording]    The Police's main concern is to keep the strike from  creating  a violent situation of which criminals could take advantage.    Caldera then emphasized the Police's continuous surveillance  and willingness to use force if the situation warrants such  actions.</p>

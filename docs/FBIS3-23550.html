			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ona Mickeviciute: "Bird's-Eye and Close Views of </F> Lithuanian Military Airports"]    [Excerpts] As TIESA has already reported, the military  airports transferred by Russia have not yet been utilized until  now.    It has been reiterated what valuable assets we have  received,  because Lithuania, recognized by the former USSR as a  strategically excellent territory, has inherited 12 military  airports. Many of them are situated in forests and remote  places. No one cares about some of them, while disputes are  continuing about the others.    The Lithuanian president, his advisers, the Seimas  [parliament], and its National Security Committee will discuss  the utilization of the airports in strengthening Lithuania's  national defense. This will require objective information.    On 2 February, a group of officials had a chance to see the  airports from both the bird's-eye and close views and explore  the actual situation and the prospects for their utilization.  [passage omitted]    First of all, the group went to Kazlu Ruda airport in a Mi-8  helicopter. Currently, the airport is under the National  Defense Ministry ownership. Formerly, it belonged to the  seventh USSR airborne battalion occupying a 60-hectare area.  The airport has a 200-meter-long runway, several garages and  storehouses, 12 wooden barracks, the framework of the officers'  apartment block, and a two-storied underground emergency dugout  for the USSR air force command. Almost all of these buildings  have been either taken away or destroyed to prevent their  utilization. The edifices lack radiators, electric cables,  windows, and doors. Nor are there any aviation facilities.    Servicemen from the Kaunas motorized battalion of the field  army brigade are working in Kazlu Ruda now. They are guarding  the premises, repairing the facilities, and learning the art of  war.    Colonel S. Murza, deputy air force commander, said that,  thus  far, military aviators had been unable to use the Kazlu Ruda  base. There are plans to turn the latter into a training base  and to station a squadron there, so that war pilots could gather  in one place to perform common assignments. [passage omitted]    Incidentally, the Latvian military would also like to have  its pilots trained in Lithuania (we have already trained their  first two war aviators). The Latvians would contribute finances  and assist in restructuring the base. In addition, Kazlu Ruda  should house a duty air unit.    J. Lasinskas, chief of the training squadron at the rear  service, who is also acting commander, said that the base was  built on concrete blocks which were laid on poles driven into a  swamp. All underground conduits are close to the surface or on  it, the pipes are ruined, and there is no money to replace them.  [passage omitted] The pavement is good, and it has only grown  over with grass over the past couple of years. The Kazlu Ruda  airport has no commercial value, and no one claims it. From the  viewpoint of military strategy, the airport cannot be neglected.    Having flown over the Paliepiai airport, we found out that  its 3,500-meter-long and 80-meter-wide runway consisted of  10,000 concrete blocks, 1,000 of which had been sold by the  Russian soldiers. Fuel reservoirs had been sold to Lithuanian  and Latvian firms. There had once been plans to use the blocks  from Paliepiai in restructuring the Vilnius airport. The  Paliepiai airport had belonged to the USSR naval force and had  been an emergency base for long-distance planes.    The Kedainiai airport has become the property of the  self-government.    After landing at the airport in Meskuiciai, we found all the  Lithuanian military aircraft -- fighters, training planes, and  helicopters -- stored under the open winter sky. [passage  omitted] Those are not top-class planes. Therefore, they are  not leak-proof, and water easily gets into their engines. Only  the Zokniai airport has sufficiently spacious hangars suitable  for storing planes. However, these facilities have been  assigned to the Siauliai self-government.    The military facilities accumulated in Meskuiciai can hardly  undergo major repairs because there is no equipment or spare  parts. A group of highly skilled engineers with higher aviation  education is trying to make spare parts itself, and it is  gradually repairing all planes and helicopters deployed in  Meskuiciai.    A conference held at the Meskuiciai base put forward the  following idea: Does the National Defense Ministry [KAM] have a  chance of acquiring at least some of the necessary buildings and  hangars at the Zokniai airport? Air Force Deputy Commander S.  Murza delivered a report about the key goals of Lithuania's  aviation. These are control over the state borders and the  Baltic Sea economic zone, and the supervision of the  inviolability of the entire air space. Aviation should also  engage in rescue operations, assist other army units in  performing special assignments, and transfer other military  units, servicemen, equipment, and facilities. In addition,  aviation should also perform photographic work from the air and  the radiation and chemical surveillance of the territory.    According to the speaker, Lithuania needs three airports.  The most suitable ones are in Zokniai (Siauliai region),  Pajuoste (Panevezys region), and Kazlu Ruda (Marijampole  region). It was expected a year and a half ago that the Zokniai  airport would become the first strategic airport in northern  Lithuania. It has the best hangars built in 1989, new  buildings, the possibility of installing a good flight control  center, and so on.    It has a particularly good 3,500-meter-long runway (which  was  also an emergency runway for the spaceship "Buran"). The KAM  received the buildings situated on both sides of the runway  which cannot be used for cars. The zone for fighters, the  launching pad, the parking lots for heavy planes and vehicles,  the headquarters of the radioelectronic combat regiment, and the  laboratory went to Siauliai City. "The security of entire  Lithuania was sacrificed for the benefit of the city and for  temporary finances," stressed Colonel S. Murza. "The airport  which was too large for Russia has become too small for  Lithuania." The self-government has forbidden the military even  to drive across its territory. Therefore, quite a long road  will have to be built on the other side. This might cost the  military about 0.5 million litai.    The conference was also addressed by Captain J. Marcinkus,  commander of the first air base, who noted that the runway  belonged to the self-government, but that the services for  maintenance, navigation, and flight control could be common --  as is the case around the world. The self-government uses only  part of the buildings (which the aviators need). The  devastation of many facilities is continuing. The compact  territory belonging to the self-government has all the buildings  necessary for the normal work of the national defense air force,  for the organization of the air defense, and for the  installation of repair and engineering facilities, laboratories,  and a maintenance unit.    In the opinion of A. Norvilas, the president's adviser for  national defense issues, and A. Orenius, adviser to the Seimas  National Security Committee, a special commission should be set  up and a project drafted for national defense. The fate of the  Zokniai airport might change then. The decision of the former  B. Lubys' government concerning the division of the airport will  not be revoked unless there are some serious arguments.  However, A. Norvilas told a TIESA correspondent that military  aviators should be supported.    From Meskuiciai we flew to Zokniai and inspected the  deplorable buildings allotted to the KAM. After the "excursion"  in Zokniai, the airport in Pajuoste (Panevezys region) looked  tidy and well-groomed. [passage omitted] Thus, the restoration  of the Pajuoste airport may not require large finances, if the  decision to use this heritage for Lithuania's national defense  is adopted.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Savoy loss unchanged at Pounds 1.75m SAVOY HOTEL announced an unchanged first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.75m and said it had not benefited from the improvement in the economy or from last September's devaluation of sterling, writes Michael Skapinker The loss for the six months to June 30 was on turnover up 3 per cent to Pounds 37.8m. The group, whose hotels include the Savoy, the Connaught and Claridge's, said its operating costs rose 3.5 per cent to Pounds 36m, largely due to an increase in sales and marketing expenditure. Mr Giles Shepard, managing director, said: 'Despite certain aspects of the economy improving, such improvements as there were did not benefit the company, nor were the effects of last September's devaluation of sterling reflected in an increasing number of foreign visitors to our hotels and restaurants.' The group's pre-tax loss was limited by an increase in investment income from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 587,000. This included a Pounds 555,000 profit on the sale of the Savoy Theatre's investment portfolio. At the trading level, the loss increased to Pounds 1.6m Pounds 1.15m. Losses were 4p (3.5p) per A share and 2p (1.7p) per B share.</p>

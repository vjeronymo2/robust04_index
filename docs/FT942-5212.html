			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: World Bank support for Indian blindness control programme Sir, I refer to your May 14 article on the World Bank credit to the Indian National Blindness Control Programme ('World Bank cash to help the blind') and to Professor R A Weale's letter (May 20). The World Bank agreed to finance this project at the request of the government of India. Similar requests from other countries would be welcomed and considered on their own merits. Cataract blindness constitutes a big public health problem in India. A disproportionate number of blind people are the rural poor, particularly women, who have little access to health care. The social and economic returns of dealing with cataracts in India are very high. In addition, as the population of India ages, it will be even more important for the country to have an effective and efficient cataract programme in place. Projects assisted by the World Bank are prepared and implemented by the borrowing countries. This project was prepared over two years with the involvement of local experts, numerous Indian and international voluntary organisations, the Eye Care Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health, World Health Organisation, and the Danish Development Agency (DANIDA). WHO does not implement projects of this type. Most of the training under the project will be in-service training. The aim will be to raise the quality and productivity of service providers, as well as to help train people in surgical techniques using intra-ocular lenses. Alternative schemes were considered. The project's final design supports a variety of service delivery models, based on a number of criteria, including location of the people to be served, size of the problem, availability of facilities, and availability of trained personnel. Based on the application of these criteria at the district level, services will be rendered in both mobile camps and in fixed facilities. Project implementation will be carefully monitored at the district, state, and national level. World Bank staff will also review progress against project objectives through field visits two to three times per year. In addition, the project will be subjected to big technical reviews by competent Indian and international experts every two years.

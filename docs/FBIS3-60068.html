The injured person himself  made this disclosure.    The military-police operation began after those planes had  flown over the settlement of La Brecha for 15 minutes. The  agents seized four small trucks with treads, and without license  plates, and 30 empty aviation fuel tanks, each with a 50-liter  capacity.    A report provided by the 18th Cavalry Regiment's  headquarters  in San Miguel Zapotitlan and the State Judicial Police base in  this municipality observes: "The community residents were  alarmed when they noticed the planes flying over them, expecting  them to crash. For this reason, they notified the police."    It adds that efforts were promptly coordinated between  military forces and police agents; meanwhile, the two aircraft,  with unidentified registrations, landed. Seven minutes later,  bursts of machine gunfire were heard in an area adjoining that  settlement.    The report states that the security brigades surrounded the  area but, upon reaching the site, found only the body of one  person showing AK-47 caliber bullet wounds in the abdomen, and  another individual seriously injured.    The area is still cordoned off. The report concludes by  noting that the body was taken to the PGR offices, and the  wounded person is at a clinic, in serious condition and under  heavy guard.</p>

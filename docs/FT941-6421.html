			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Conflict alleged on tendering rules The government yesterday sought to end confusion over its new private finance guidelines after they appeared to be questioned by a leading civil servant. Mr Mark Lambirth, head of the Department of Transport's finance division, said it would be 'pretty unusual' for his department to award a contract without competitive tendering. 'Imagine the outcry,' he told an Institute of Directors' conference on private finance, if ministers gave a particular company a clear run at building a project such as the channel tunnel or the London CrossRail line. Earlier, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told the conference the government would award contracts in certain cases without putting them out to tender. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction group, said: 'There appears to be a conflict between the Treasury, which wants to get the scheme off the ground, and the users' departments which are suspicious of doing it.' The competition guidelines have been changed to meet the concerns of companies which have complained that it is unfair to produce an original idea only to see another company win the contract. Under the guidelines announced by Mr Dorrell, a contract will not be put out to public tender if 'advantages of stimulating innovation justify an alternative approach'. Other senior executives attending yesterday's conference underlined Mr Dwyer's concern that civil servants may continue to work under the old rules. Mr Dorrell later said he was 'slightly surprised' at the line taken by Mr Lambirth. 'It is possible to conceive of circumstances where it might arise in Transport that a contract is awarded without competitive tendering,' he said. He encouraged companies to use the Treasury document, containing the new guidelines, when bidding for a contract. 'It amounts to a code of practice for departments to follow in taking projects forward,' he said. The government also confirmed that guidelines specify that departments should say clearly what they want from a project.</p>

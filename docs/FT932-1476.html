			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Money Markets: More speculation EXPECTATIONS about a reduction in UK interest rates failed to disappear yesterday, in spite of better than expected data about the state of the economy in the first quarter, writes Peter Marsh. The speculation about a cut in bank base rates, now at 6 per cent, has been fuelled partly by the fragile economic conditions in much of Europe. It has been aided by the easing this week in borrowing rates elsewhere on the Continent. The signs of weakening demand, especially in Germany, has led to worries that any UK recovery may be held back by reduced activity on export markets. On the UK money market, the three-month interbank rate was quoted last night at about 5 13/16 per cent, slightly down from the 5 7/8 per cent figure the previous evening. Signs that investors were looking for a cut in base rates were confirmed by changes in the sterling futures market, where buying of the December contract lifted it to 94.32. The figures for gross domestic product published yesterday by the UK government had little effect on investor sentiment. This was on the grounds that they related to the first quarter. Since then, economic conditions in the rest of Europe have deteriorated, underlining the view that a further cut in UK interest rates may be needed to consolidate any upturn. The Irish central bank cut its key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, reducing its short-term facility rate to 7.75 per cent and the overnight deposit rate to 4.5 per cent. The move followed Monday's rate cuts in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. In Germany, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, held out the prospect of further cuts in German interest rates. He said the bank would cautiously review further possibilities for easing borrowing conditions, but would continue to be guided by developments in M3 money supply. Spanish interest rates might come down soon, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, signalled yesterday. But he warned that the pace of any movement would be conditioned by success in reducing inflation. In London the Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 500m of late unspecified assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.39bn.</p>

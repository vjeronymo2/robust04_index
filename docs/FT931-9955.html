			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / OFT reviews UK stock market rules THE Office of Fair Trading is investigating London stock exchange rules which have helped to centralise share trading on the UK's official stock market. The rules guarantee that the exchange's share prices are always the best available on any electronic price system, encouraging investors to use the official market rather than trading outside the exchange. Unusually among leading international markets, the London exchange controls almost all the turnover of shares in the companies it lists. The New York stock exchange has seen trading seep away to rival trading systems in recent years, while the leading European bourses have lost business to London. The Securities and Futures Authority, the UK regulatory body, says less than 5 per cent of turnover in UK companies' shares takes place outside the exchange. The exchange's rules 335 and 362 forbid brokers and dealers from quoting better prices on any other electronic trading system than the ones they quote on the exchange's own system. The regulations cover both the domestic stock market, prices for which are carried on Seaq (the Stock Exchange Automatic Quotation system), and the international share market which has grown up rapidly in London in recent years on the back of the international Seaq service. The rules were adopted at the time of Big Bang in 1986, when share trading moved off the exchange's floor to be replaced by a telephone market supported by the price quotation system. The OFT said it was looking at the regulation, along with other exchange rules. It added the investigation was in its early stages, and that it was still gathering information on the effect of the regulation. The exchange said: 'We're not aware of any investigation by the OFT, or of any complaints about our rules.' The competition authorities have fought a running battle over the exchange's rulebook in recent years, concerned that vestiges of the old exchange cartel have survived the deregulation of the mid-1980s. A number of rivals want to challenge the exchange's dominance of London trading. Tradepoint Financial Networks, a system headed by Mr Stanley Ross, one of the founding figures of the Eurobond market, last week completed efforts to raise Dollars 11m and plans to launch later this year. Instinet, the Reuters subsidiary which has taken a substantial share of US share trading, has also tried to break into London.</p>

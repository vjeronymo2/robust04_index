			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Most fund chiefs see hung result A POLL of City fund managers found that 89 per cent expect the election to result in a hung parliament. Labour will be the single biggest party, according to 48 per cent, while 41 per cent think the Conservatives will have the most seats. Most - 46 per cent - think the Liberal Democrats have conducted the most impressive campaign. None consider the Tory campaign the most impressive, while 30 per cent chose Labour. However, 80 per cent think the Tories have the best long-term economic programme. The survey was conducted by Gallup for Smith New Court, the securities house. The number of people voting by post and proxy is higher than ever before. About 10 per cent of the population are entitled to vote in this way, but in no constituency has 5 per cent previously been reached. Figures compiled by Labour indicate that the 5 per cent figure has been breached in seven key marginal seats, and suggest that nationwide there are more than 1.3m postal and proxy voters compared with about 901,000 in 1987.</p>

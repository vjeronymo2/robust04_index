			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Legality of an obligation to buy - European Court An exclusive purchasing obligation, forcing local electricity distributors to purchase all their electricity from a regional company, could be lawful provided such a restriction was necessary to allow the regional company to fulfil its public service obligations, the European Court of Justice ruled recently. Local electricity distributors in the Netherlands brought a case against their regional electricity company. Under Dutch law, electricity is distributed by regional companies to local distributors, which in turn ensure the supply of electricity to individual clients in their areas. However, certain end-users, notably those in rural areas, are directly supplied by the regional companies. Regional distributors have a non-exclusive statutory right to distribute electricity in their region. Between 1985 and 1988, the regional distributor concerned prohibited the local distributors from purchasing electricity from any other source. There was a corresponding obligation on the regional company to sell electricity only to the local distributor companies. These companies, in turn, imposed an obligation on the final consumer to purchase electricity only from them. The regional companies also had to purchase their electricity from the national generators. From January 1 1985, the regional company imposed a surcharge on the local companies in order to compensate for the difference between the higher cost of distributing electricity direct to rural consumers and the lower costs of distributing electricity to the local companies for use by urban consumers. The local companies made a complaint to the European Commission. The Commission ruled that the restriction imposed by the national generators on the regional distributors was unlawful under the Rome treaty. It also held that the restrictions on the end-users breached competition rules and could not be justified under Rome treaty rules on public service undertakings. The restrictions between the regional and local companies were not explicitly dealt with by the Commission. However, before complaining to the Commission, the local companies had started arbitration proceedings to decide the legality of the surcharge imposed by the regional companies. A tribunal found that the surcharge was lawful. The local companies appealed to a national court which sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on, among other things, whether a prohibition on the importation of electricity such as existed in the present case was contrary to Rome treaty rules covering state monopolies and competition. The ECJ first held that European state monopolies rules were not relevant to the present case, as the regional distribution company did not have an exclusive right to distribute electricity in the relevant territory. The ECJ then found that the import prohibition restricted competition and affected trade between member states, as it partitioned the Dutch market from other European Union markets. But the ECJ left it to the national court to determine whether a collective dominant position actually existed between all the regional companies in the Netherlands. The ECJ said if it did, the tying-in of electricity purchasers in the way described would constitute an abuse of that dominant position. The ECJ finally examined the Rome treaty provisions on public service undertakings which provide that restrictions on competition imposed by such companies are lawful to the extent which they are necessary for the performance of the relevant services of general economic interest carried out by those companies. The ECJ said it was for the national court to determine whether the import restriction was necessary for the regional company to distribute electricity in its territory. It stated that, in determining this question, the national court should take into account the costs borne by the company, in particular regulatory costs relating to the envi-ronment.

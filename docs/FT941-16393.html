			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / ADollars 100m fire claims feared Damage from bushfires raging across the state of New South Wales could reach ADollars 100m (Pounds 45.2m) in insurance claims for burned-out homes and businesses. The fires, the worst in the state for 50 years, have so far claimed four lives, burnt out 600,000 hectares of land, destroyed 185 homes and damaged 130 others. More than 20,000 people have been evacuated, including residents of Sydney's northern and southern outskirts, since last Thursday. The Insurance Council of Australia said that by Sunday, the damage bill to houses was ADollars 50m, with another ADollars 50m for damage to commercial properties. The New South Wales government also faces losses of about ADollars 50m in forest assets plus Dollars 10m in lost annual royalties. There have been no estimates on rural properties and livestock. The authorities do not see an immediate end to the disaster. Rain and cooler temperatures yesterday provided relief to nearly 10,000 firefighters, helping to contain the number of fires to 135 from the Saturday peak of 155. More than 2,000 of the firefighters have come from other states.</p>

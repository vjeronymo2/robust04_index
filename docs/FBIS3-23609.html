			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Aleksandr Yegorov, </F> under the rubric: "Arsenal": "Spetnaz Weapons"]    [Text] Everyone knows the story of the capture of  Powers, the American U-2 pilot who was shot down by a  surface-to-air missile over Soviet territory. That story  preceded the appearance in Russia of weapons that were developed  and are being produced under the classification of  "spetsizdeliye" [special item]. Powers was armed with a silent  discharge weapon -- a pistol with a barrel silencer -- that was  unknown in the USSR at that time.    Because lagging behind in any sphere of weapons was  very severely assessed in those years, the model was urgently  sent to the Central Institute of Precision Machine Building  (TsNIITOChMASh), already at that time a leading scientific  center, where they researched, developed and tested practically  all models of firearms comprehensively, together with the round.  The experience and reserves that had been accumulated at the  institute, and also the talent of Engineer and Designer Anatoliy  Arsenyevich Deryagin, permitted them to quite rapidly accomplish  the task. Soviet "competent organs" obtained a  domestically-developed silent discharge pistol system. And at  TsNIITOChMASh a new direction of research was opened by this  topic -- individual protection weapons and equipping special  subunits.    One of the results of this research was the acceptance  into the inventory of a silent weapons system and a team of  designers (I. Kasyanov, A. Deryagin, P. Serdyukov, V. Petrov)  was awarded the Russian Federation State Prize for that.    Three models are part of the system: "Vintorez" 9-mm  Sniper Rifle, "Val" 9-mm Assault Rifle, and "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm  Pistol.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tactical-Technical Specifications                                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |"Vintorez"        |"Val"             |"Vul" PSS         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Caliber, mm       |9                 |9                 |7.62              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aimed range, m    |400               |400               |50                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight, kg        |2.5               |2.6               |0.7               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Magazine round ca-|10                |20                |6                 |  |pacity            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H6>  "Vintorez" </H6>   Designer Petr Ivanovich Serdyukov utilized the so-called  classic silencer design -- a barrel silencer -- in the  development of the "Vintorez" Gas-Vented 9-mm Sniper Rifle. In  the process, he dealt extraordinarily successfully with the two  main enemies of silent discharge -- pressure and temperature.  The gases that propel the bullet toward the barrel's end  initially end up under the impact of fan-shaped drilled gas  ports, through which an intensive pressure drop takes place.  Then -- in the first chamber of the silencer, an expansion  chamber, where the pressure drops even more simultaneously with  the lowering of the temperature. And, finally, the so-called  separator completely "chops up" the jet that follows the bullet,  dismembering it into numerous streams with different directions.  A screen completes the cooling. That is the principle.    We need to point out that the round also does its part to  lower the temperature and pressure. This is also specifically  explained by the large caliber, 9-mm, for a rifle.    "Vintorez" is distinguished from other sniper rifles by its  capability to conduct not only single round fire but also  bursts. To do this, it can be equipped with 20-round instead of  standard 10-round magazines.    The rifle is equipped with a mechanical -- front sight and  notched rear sight -- and also with three optical sights,  including a night vision sight. One of the optical sights is the  PSO-1 four-power sight with a range finder scale. A special  screen has been introduced into its design that permits  detection of infrared radiation sources. The sight is equipped  with a range and direction adjustment mechanism.    "Vintorez's" stock has a special recess which alleviates the  design and forms a pistol grip. This type of stock was "broken  in" and proved itself on the famous Dragunov sniper rifle.    And, finally, the rifle can be completely disassembled and  carried in a briefcase.  <H6>  "Val" </H6>   The silent assault rifle received the name "Val". The  silencer type and design is the same. It has been equipped with  the identical equipment as "Vintorez", including the optical  sights. The differences are primarily external and they are few.  Among the most visible are the metal folding stock which  slightly increased the assault rifle's weight (by 100 grams) and  compelled the designer to return to the traditional pistol grip.  The capacity of the magazine has been increased to 20 rounds. We  discussed it in the portion that concerns "Vintorez's" automatic  fire. "Val" has been deprived of the briefcase which would  hardly be appropriate in raids against enemy rear areas.    However, there is a fundamental difference. It is in the  round. "Vintorez" has the SP-5 round that was developed by  Designer Nikolay Zabelin and "Val" has the SP-6 that was  developed by Designer Yuriy Frolov.    How do they differ? The former is a special sniper round. It  is designed to destroy personnel.    The assault rifle's round has heightened penetrability. It  easily penetrates a 6-mm sheet of high-strength steel at a range  of 100 meters.  <H6>  "Vul" </H6>   And, finally, the last member of the TsNIITOChMASh family of  silent weapons -- the "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm pistol that was  developed by Yuriy Krylov and Viktor Levchenko.    This model is a kind of surprise for lovers of  nontraditional  solutions, because suppressing the sound of the discharge occurs  in it based upon an entirely different principle: By employing a  special round with a powder gas cut-off in it.    We need to say that the idea for the development of this  type  of ammunition is not new. What is more, such rounds exist and  are utilized in the world. But in a very limited manner. In  single-shot and double-barreled systems that are hard to call  truly combat systems. The reason for that is the imperfection of  the design and its low effectiveness that is caused by the  inability of the round to support semi-automatic fire.    Viktor Petrov, the developer of the SP-2 (the designation of  the new round with the powder gas cut-off) took a fundamental  step forward in this sphere when he developed a round that  brought the automatic back to life. In the process, the SP-2's  combat effectiveness is close to the effectiveness of the  Makarov PM [Makarov Pistol] pistol's round and lags behind it  only in penetrability: The bullet of the silent round does not  stick into the fourth 25-mm pine board like the PM but in the  third board which it enters sideways. That is caused by the  ammunition's blunt tip that disrupts stability when it  encounters an obstacle. If you consider that a shortcoming of  the round, then it is the only one. In the remainder, the PSS is  no worse than the PM. Moreover, it is equipped with a series of  innovations, one of which is an adaptation for the installation  of a modern collimating sight that is indispensable when firing  under nighttime conditions. The shining dot on the sight, which  is fed by a small battery, is compatible with night vision  glasses and creates conditions for firing that are close to  ideal. Based upon the big picture, sights of this type are  instruments of the future.    The pistol itself provides a decent advantage over its  competitors. If we turn to the specifications, it exceeds even  "Vintorez" in the primary one -- the level of noise suppression.    Russian silent weapons are one more source of pride for  the domestic small arms school that is recognized in the  world.</p>

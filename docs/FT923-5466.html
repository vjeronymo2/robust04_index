			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / CBI sees end to wage-price spiral BRITAIN is in a strong position to break the wage-price spiral that has undermined previous recoveries, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, said yesterday that only one-in-three UK employers was quoting the cost of living as an important upward pressure on pay. During the past year one-in-four settlements was at or below 3.5 per cent and a similar number between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. He added that pay settlements were ahead of inflation as the UK entered the recession and the latest evidence from the CBI's pay databank showed that business factors were now the most important determinants of pay. Yet Britain's two main independent pay research groups, Incomes Data Services and Industrial Relations Services, both publish reports today saying the link between pay and inflation remains central. IDS says: 'Not only do most private-sector employers report that the rate of change in the cost of living is a very important factor in decisions on pay, but inflation protection is still quite explicitly built into a number of major pay settlements'. IRS has found that a majority of employers plan a further reduction in pay rises in the next year. A poll of 280 employers indicates that the average settlement will fall from the current plateau of 4.3 per cent to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. About a quarter of employers plan to give the same rise as last year and only one in 20 plans a pay freeze. The most important upward pressures on pay are labour productivity and inflation.

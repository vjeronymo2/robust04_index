			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Commander Tomas Borge to close the Sandinist </F> National Liberation Front, FSLN, Special Congress at the Olof  Palme Convention Center in Managua -- live]    [Text] [Words indistinct] shown by you during 76 hours of  nearly uninterrupted work, with the efforts of support teams --  which have carried out their work unselfishly -- with the  efforts of the Electoral Council -- which has worked virtually  without rest just as we did -- [and with the efforts] of the  entire personnel, the physicians, and others who helped us  ensure that this Congress worked, and with the extreme  discipline, mutual respect, and the joy that was present in this  event.    I do not know how to reward you other than by expressing our  affection, but perhaps the biggest reward that we could give you  after these 76 hours, is to be brief now. Thus, I declare the  FSLN Special Congress closed. [applause]</p>

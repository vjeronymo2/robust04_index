			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Quality Care Homes advances 64% Rapid expansion continued at Quality Care Homes, the Darlington-based nursing home operator, and pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 rose 64 per cent to Pounds 3m, against Pounds 1.84m last time which was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 152,000. Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said that trading in the current year had been good so far but the rate of earnings growth would be affected by the number of new homes opening and a rising interest charge. During the year capital expenditure totalled Pounds 6m, compared to operating cash flow of Pounds 3.48m, and gearing rose from 15 per cent to 29 per cent. With capital expenditure likely to reach Pounds 8m in 1993-94, gearing could top 50 per cent by the year end if further equity is not raised. Last year QCH increased its beds from 540 to 799, in 16 nursing homes. Six home openings should take the beds total to 1,193 by the end of the current financial year. The average cost per bed was Pounds 18,500, up 6 per cent, but each bed is valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 27,100. Turnover rose 40 per cent to Pounds 8.67m (Pounds 6.2m) although prices of beds were held at 1992 rates in spite of rising costs. The impact of the new Community Care Act on occupancy rates was small, with a rate of 96.2 per cent compared with 98.4 per cent in 1992-93. Operating profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 2.29m), partly thanks to the absence of the exceptional charge which related to the flotation in July 1992. Net interest fell Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 155,000, with Pounds 124,000 (Pounds 69,000) of interest capitalised. After a lower tax rate of 22.5 per cent (30.1 per cent) earnings per share, excluding the exceptional charge, rose 49 per cent to 17.5p (11.8p). A final proposed dividend of 3p gives a total of 4.5p, up 12.5 per cent on the indicated dividend for 1992-93.</p>

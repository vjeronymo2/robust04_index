			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: The death of a visionary - Architecture / The work of the late Roger Ferri In a city where one in every 53 of the population is now deemed to be HIV positive, the recent death of one young architect may be seen as a blip on the hospital computer screens. New York now 'lives with AIDS' and last week it was my grim duty to speak at a memorial service and attend a requiem mass for the soul of an architect friend, Roger Ferri, who has died of AIDS aged only 42. AIDS is reaping a rich and untimely harvest, particularly among the 'artistic community' in many countries, but it does seem to have had the most devastating results in New York. There are, of course, hundreds of unrecorded deaths from this plague, but it is the tally of workers in the arts and architecture that especially concerns me. For an architect to be stricken with AIDS there are especial problems. In many cases there is a conspiracy of silence made necessary to ensure the continuation of a flow of work into the office. When the reputation of an office or studio depends on the design talent of one person - which is often the case - and that person is affected by the virus, all work can easily dry up. Roger Ferri almost needed to wear a disguise as his condition worsened over four years and he struggled to maintain a flow of work. The stress of this way of living (and dying) is hard to imagine. What was it that made Ferri's short career so remarkable? From the beginning his training marked him out as an unusual kind of architect. It was the kind of training that is slowly being adopted again as architects are forced to realise the artistic poverty of much of their work. After an orthodox architectural training at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Ferri studied figure drawing, anatomy and painting at the Art Students League of New York. It must have been this solid background of artistic training that made Ferri's drawing style so remarkable. He realised that drawing was the key to architecture, even in these mechanistic days. It was his drawing skill that gave him his first serious break. The curator of architecture and design at New York's Museum of Modern Art invited him, with others, to explore in drawings the answer to the question: 'What would you do if you were free of all emotional and intellectual commitment to modern architecture?' This was a loaded question designed to encourage a response that would move architecture beyond mere functionalism. Ferri's imagination was fired by this question to produce not simply an unusual new design for a building, but to suggest an approach to design which he called 'A proposal for an American architecture and urbanism in the post petroleum age.' With all the energy and bravado of the young (this was in 1979) he proposed that architects should return to nature as the source of their inspiration. Nature could provide all the roots of ornament and structure, at the same time as it provided a referential framework that had real meaning. This is best understood in some of the drawings that Ferri produced for the Museum of Modern Art - and they remain in the Museum's permanent collection. These drawings show a plan for an imaginary city set in the plain with clear boundaries between town and country. At the heart of this pedestrian city there is a great domed hall - somewhat in the tradition of Ledoux. It was to be called the Hall of the Three Races and giant figures representing Europe, Africa and Asia spin in the dome against a spiralling galaxy. Around the dome and spreading throughout the city are a series of hypostyle courts. These courts are halls of columns; each column rises up some forty feet and at its top bursts into bloom in the form of a lily. Each curved petal of the lily joins to form the lines of a vaulted roof. It may sound strange and unworkable but it was entirely feasible. As one critic wrote at the time: 'Ferri shows how to butt the flowers on the domes of Buckminster Fuller.' These visionary drawings showed nature as a source of Divinely ordered geometry. Ferri was to go on and prove that this vision was entirely workable. In more receptive times he would have been demonstrating his talent by using geometry to create Baroque churches probably in the manner of Guarino Guarini's masterpieces in Turin. In fact he was able to build a small number of remarkable houses and spread his influence through theoretical projects. One of these projects, a skyscraper for Madison Square, showed a fusion of nature and architecture by turning the skyscraper into a mountain with trees and goats and running streams. The 'mountain' was in fact a series of terraces and hanging gardens planted and landscaped around the core of an orthodox modern tower. It was entirely feasible and was later to be developed as the 'Spiral Tower', where the actual structure of the tower curved heavenwards only to burst into bloom like a giant tree as it reached the sky. On a more modest scale many of Roger Ferri's ideas were condensed into a weekend house at Ligonier, near Pittsburg. The fortunate owners of this house occupy the equivalent of a house in the American tradition of Frank Lloyd Wright of harmony between landscape and architecture. This house also showed that Ferri's work encompassed the design of interiors, furniture and decorative objects which he hoped would spark off a revival of American craftsmanship. Roger Ferri's untimely death removes one of the few visionaries on the architectural scene. His drawings and archives are to be preserved at the Avery Library at Columbia University in New York with the hope that students of architecture will continue to be inspired.</p>

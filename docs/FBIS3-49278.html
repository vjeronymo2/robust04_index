			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning the representatives of the main trade  union confederations held a news conference, which was attended  by Bogdan Hossu, chairman of Cartel Alfa, Miron Mitrea, the  executive chairman of CNSLR [National Council of Romania's Free  Trade Unions]-Fratia, and Marian Miclici, general secretary of  the National trade Union Bloc [BNS]. During the news  conference, Hossu announced that during yesterday's conference  of the executive bodies of the three trade union confederations  they agreed upon a program of action in the near future, as they  all consider that the sole solution to the current economic and  social problems is to go on a general strike. Therefore, on 28  January, a one-hour warning general strike, on 4 February a  one-day strike, and, beginning with 16 February, an open-ended  general strike will begin, until all demands are met. Hossu  added that he personally hopes that the labor conflict will be  ended before 15 January. The precondition to this is that the  government should also consider the demands forwarded by the  trade unions, including the one requesting the establishment of  a coalition government, in which case there will be no reasons  to go on the planned strikes, which are actually not wanted by  anyone, Hossu emphasized.</p>

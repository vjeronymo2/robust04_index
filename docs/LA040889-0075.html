			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 9, SUSPENDED FOR TAKING GUN TO CLASS  </P> <P> A 9-year-old third grader familiar with firearms was suspended from his Poway  elementary school for two days because he took an unloaded handgun onto campus,  authorities reported Friday.  </P> <P> The child took the gun off his grandfather's dresser, put it in his lunch sack  and took it to school Thursday, where it was seen by other students during the  lunch period, said Fred Van Houten, principal of Midland Elementary School.  </P> <P> The child had a bullet in his pocket that would not fit the gun, and the gun  itself was not loaded, Van Houten said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies were called to the scene and talked to the youngster, but no  arrest was made and no crime report taken, said Sheriff's Department spokesman  Al Bates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Released to Grandparents  </P> <P> The child was released to the custody of his grandparents, who are his legal  guardians.  </P> <P> Van Houten on Friday talked to the school's students, classroom by classroom,  to clarify the incident, which he said had been wrongly characterized by rumor  and exaggeration.  </P> <P> Among the reports circulating the campus were that the child displayed the gun  while trying to get another student to turn over some of his collector toys.  </P> <P> Some parents called school officials Thursday and Friday because they were  concerned about the incident, but apparently no children were kept out of  school Friday because of it, Van Houten said.  </P> <P> He insisted that the gun never left the child's lunch sack, although the mother  of another child, who asked not to be identified, said her son was the one who  first noticed the weapon.  </P> <P> "He asked, 'Is that a squirt gun?' And the other boy said, 'No, it's a gun.' He  took it out of his sack, showed my son, and put it back in his sack."  </P> <P> Students then reported the weapon to the school office, and the youngster was  brought in.  </P> <P> "This kid knows his guns," Van Houten said Friday. "His grandpa takes him  shooting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rarely Gets in Trouble'  </P> <P> Van Houten said the boy "rarely" gets in trouble on campus, but apparently took  the weapon to the school because "he was looking for attention from adults."  </P> <P> Law enforcement authorities downplayed the incident. "I think more publicity  will feed overreaction," said sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Bob Takeshta. "No report  was taken. The school is handling the incident."  </P> <P> Said Bates: "No one was in danger at any time, and no threats were made. It's  just a show-and-tell type thing a lot of times."  </P> <P> Mike Fickel, director of pupil services for the Poway Unified School District,  said a student who takes a loaded firearm on campus would face expulsion and  possession of an unloaded gun could bring about expulsion as well.  </P> <P> Among the criteria for discipline, Fickel said, is the student's intent, and  that incidents on elementary school campuses are typically handled by the  school principal "based on the children not having an understanding of the  total significance of what harm they could create."  </P></p>

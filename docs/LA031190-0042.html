			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'MANIACS' ON TV WAKE UP POLAND;  </P> <P> CULTURE: AS THE NATION LOOSENS UP, FLEDGLING OPERATION COULD BE THE VANGUARD IN  A NEW ERA OF INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT.  </P> <P> The future of private television in the Eastern Bloc is here on the 11th floor  of a student dormitory, in a windowless janitor's room where three wall  calendars depict Polish women in various stages of undress.  </P> <P> As far as hardware is concerned, there is not much else in the broadcast center  of Echo TV-Channel 28 to catch the eye. The electronics are unimpressive: a  living-room videocassette recorder, a Commodore computer keyboard on loan from  a Wroclaw teen-ager, a homemade transmitter with the main broadcast cable  snaking up to a rooftop antenna through a wall vent.  </P> <P> The total cash investment in the first private television station in Eastern  Europe comes to a whopping $15,000.  </P> <P> "People who know television have come here and told us that only maniacs could  use this kind of equipment," said Henryk Pacha, one of the eight founders of  Echo TV, which went on the air in mid-February.  </P> <P> But in the duller-than-dull world of Communist-bred television, where  apparatchiks have stupefied the masses for decades with documentaries about  tractors in pursuit of five-year plans, the future may well belong to maniacs  willing to broadcast from dormitory closets.  </P> <P> For on a recent weekday evening, when Polish state television Channel 1 was  airing a talking-head panel program about business problems, Echo TV was  building its growing audience -- estimated at 700,000 in this city in  southwestern Poland -- with 1 1/2 hours of commercial-free MTV rock videos,  along with other material pirated from satellites.  </P> <P> The private station followed up with a brief business show of its own, then  segued into coverage of European soccer, a Polish passion. State television,  meanwhile, droned on with another talking head, the minister of labor  illuminating the economic situation. Echo TV settled in for prime time with an  American car-chase movie called "Police Special." As the evening's programming  drew to an end, cops busted bad guys on Echo TV while state television treated  viewers to a Russian-language lesson.  </P> <P> "We definitely can fill gaps that Polish television creates," said Pacha, who  made his career as an announcer on state television in Wroclaw. "We think we  are going to make money. Otherwise we wouldn't do it."  </P> <P> Although there are no Nielsen ratings, there are signs that Wroclawians are  tuning in Echo TV. Shortly after the station started broadcasting, virtually  everything resembling a television antenna in Wroclaw was sold out of the  shops. An usually large number of people have been spotted dragging wires  around on their roofs. (To receive the station you either have to swivel your  old antenna or rig a new one.)  </P> <P> Back in Warsaw, the Polish capital, state television is in trouble. Not only is  it often boring, but many viewers continue to regard it as a morally bankrupt  holdover from a Communist government that in 1981 imposed martial law, fired  scores of journalists and required all others to "verify" their loyalty.  </P> <P> Since Solidarity took over the government last fall, a gradual effort has been  made to spruce up this image. One-third of the managers and directors of  television have been replaced and a full reorganization is coming in the  spring.  </P> <P> At the same time, the money-strapped Solidarity government, which is in the  throes of radical free-market reforms, is searching for ways to make television  pay for itself. An idea has been floated in parliament to sell state  television's Channel 2 to foreigners. This notion reportedly has traumatized  the staff at Channel 2. The bureaucracy there is bracing for a fight; protests  are being organized.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Echo TV in Wroclaw, there is endless room for free-market  innovation.  </P> <P> "We are planning to be very flexible in our programming. If, for example, a  person decides that he wants to broadcast his wedding, we will do it. Or, to  give another example, if a person loses his passport, he could come on our  channel and make a personal appeal. We would charge between 50,000 and 100,000  zlotys ($5 to $10)," said Pacha, who has loaned the station the use of his own  home video equipment.  </P> <P> The station has 12 employees, 11 of whom work for free. The remaining one, a  television technician trained at a state telecommunications institute, said his  salary is "what they will give me." The broadcast power of Echo TV is about 500  times less than Warsaw's Channel 1. News programming currently amounts to zero  minutes per day. Long-range plans envision a five-minute daily news show.  </P> <P> The station's corporate strategy for technological improvements can be summed  up in one word: begging.  </P> <P> "We would like the possibility of getting some outdated equipment from abroad.  We have information that such equipment is being thrown out in the United  States. They should send it to us and we will fix it," said Andrzej Zygmunt,  director and head of technical services at Echo TV.  </P> <P> Zygmunt, who is in his late thirties, is a can-do kind of guy with a small  brown mustache and a big brown briefcase full of screwdrivers and  profit-and-loss charts. He may be the only television executive in the world  who built the transmitter of the station he directs. He built his first radio  at age 10 and has a doctorate in microwave transmission. As a teacher at the  Wroclaw Institute of Telecommunications and Acoustics, he has specialized in  communication satellites.  </P> <P> It is a satellite dish -- Echo TV has one -- that so far is the station's major  source of programming, and of potential legal trouble.  </P> <P> "We are profoundly aware that we shouldn't pirate television programs, although  state television does it all the time," Zygmunt said.  </P> <P> Echo TV rebroadcasts programs without express written permission from MTV, Sky  News and the Eurosport Channel. Zygmunt said the station has received "verbal  permission" for using MTV and is trying to sign written agreements so it can  operate in accord with international regulations.  </P> <P> "With all that has happened politically in Poland, we are a civilized European  country again," he said.  </P> <P> While international broadcast law is a concern for Zygmunt and his colleagues,  there is a higher law that the station cannot afford to appear to be violating,  at least while the Roman Catholic cardinal of Wroclaw, Henryk Gulbinowicz, is  watching.  </P> <P> In Poland, the Catholic Church is a formidable moral and political force. It  helped bring down the Communist government, and smart Polish businessmen know  it can raise heck with profits.  </P> <P> So, when Zygmunt was getting ready to go on the air with Echo TV early in  February and Gulbinowicz called him in for a little chat, the broadcast  executive showed up promptly and listened carefully.  </P> <P> "He warned us against spreading pornography and he congratulated us on our  station. He said that private television in the West gained viewers through  pornography. He said that this may be the simplest and cheapest way, but he  expressed the hope that we would not travel down that road," Zygmunt said.  </P> <P> His station has heeded the cardinal's warning and not broadcast pornographic  films, he said.  </P> <P> But as Echo TV expands its broadcast schedule into the early morning hours,  past the bedtime of likely critics, Zygmunt says it probably will put some  mildly erotic fare on the air.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COASTLINE MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL  </P> <P> I was walking along the bluffs in Rancho Palos Verdes some weeks ago when I  came upon a fantastic sight. In one of the small bays below Berryhill Drive I  saw pelicans diving for fish.  </P> <P> Not just a few pelicans but dozens and dozens of them. The sky above the bay  was filled with circling and diving pelicans. The surface of the bay was dotted  with more pelicans splashing, diving, surfacing and trying to swallow their  catch.  </P> <P> What a sight! I had never seen so many pelicans in one small bay before. It was  difficult to count, since scores of pelicans were arriving as others were  leaving . . . but I would guess there were about 80 to 120 pelicans in this  feeding frenzy.  </P> <P> It was an incredible and absorbing show, and I stood and watched for perhaps 15  minutes as the feeding went on and on. This spontaneous bird show is a key  reason why all citizens must have easy access to our coastline. In addition to  sheltering whales and dolphins and seals and cormorants and gulls and many  other sea and shore creatures, the coastline is a bountiful resource which must  always be available for kids, adults and seniors. Fantastic sights and  marvelous bird, fish and mammal sightings may be lost if we allow the coastline  to be overdeveloped and do not allow for hiking and biking trails and coastal  roads. Be sure to tell your city council members that coastal access for all  comers must be guaranteed.  </P> <P> GAR GOODSON  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the night of April 27 Azeri troops will cease  their fire along the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh. The  agreement was reached by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  and Chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul Guliyev in Moscow on  Tuesday.    After the meeting Grachev told journalists that he intends  to  file a similar request to the opposing side in the conflict in  the near future. He expressed the hope that it might become an  efficient step in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict.    Grachev also said that at the meeting with Guliyev the two  sides agreed in principle on the problem of a missile attack  warning station in Gabala. Grachev hopes that the governments  of Russia and Azerbaijan will soon agree on the official status  of the station as a Russian military base on Azeri territory.  "That would serve the interests and security of Russia,  Azerbaijan and other CIS countries," Grachev pointed out.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UN forces chief to set up Bosnia peace talks General Sir Michael Rose, the UN military commander in Bosnia, yesterday agreed to a Bosnian Serb request to arrange talks with their Moslem enemies on an overall ceasefire. Gen Rose, speaking after talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and military chief, General Ratko Mladic, said he had promised to help arrange talks on a 'global cessation of hostilities'. He said the Serbs had pledged to stop shelling the embattled Moslem enclave of Gorazde, to which he cancelled a planned visit yesterday. At least 64 people have been killed and 300 wounded in a week-long upsurge of fighting around the enclave, one of three so-called UN safe areas for Moslems in a largely Serb-controlled region of eastern Bosnia. The British officer played down the cancellation of his own trip to Gorazde. 'If they (the Serbs) don't want us to go there now, then we have to accept that,' he said. However, the Serbs did allow a number of UN monitors to enter the enclave. Gen Rose appeared to accept the Serb contention that the recent push forward by their forces around Gorazde was in response to Moslem advances in other parts of Bosnia. The Serbian request for talks, and the UN's willingness to treat the request as sincere, boosted hopes that the 'rolling ceasefire' process in Bosnia could acquire fresh momentum. However, diplomats said further progress would depend on consistent pressure from Washington and Moscow, the architects of the Sarajevo ceasefire and the federation pact between Bosnian Moslems and Croats. There have been signs of internal disagreement in both capitals. In Washington, the Pentagon has firmly ruled out air strikes against the Serbs in the Gorazde area, while the US State Department has been less categorical. The White House was understood to be working yesterday to hammer out a common US approach to the peace effort. In Moscow, the Duma or lower house of parliament has voted to discuss calls for an end to Russian participation in sanctions against former Yugoslavia. A vote against sanctions would weaken the authority of President Boris Yeltsin's administration, although its legal impact would be unclear. Control of all or part of the Gorazde area would bring the Serbian side closer to its goal of linking Serbia with Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia. There is speculation that the Serbs might be prepared to trade territory in northern Bosnia if they could establish control over Gorazde and the other Moslem enclaves.</p>

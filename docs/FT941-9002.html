			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Mahathir tries to woo untameable Sabah: On eve of elections, Kieran Cooke visits the state that has missed out on Malaysia's boom Keningau, in the interior of the state of Sabah, East Malaysia, has a down-at-heel look. Once it was a timber boom town but now most of the trees in the surrounding jungle have been felled. An upmarket hotel was built in the town in the early 1980s to encourage tourism. But few visitors venture into this remote corner of the island of Borneo. People survive on small-scale agriculture and what is left of the timber industry. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, says Sabah - and towns like Keningau - have missed out on Malaysia's economic success story. While Malaysia's overall gross domestic product has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last six years, Sabah, the federation's second biggest state and potentially one of the richest, has lagged behind. Tomorrow Sabah goes to the polls to elect a new state assembly. Sabah, with a population of 1.8m, is one of only two states controlled by parties opposed to the ruling national front coalition, headed by Dr Mahathir. For the last nine years Sabah has been governed by the locally based United Sabah party (PBS), headed by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the state's chief minister. According to Dr Mahathir, progress will only come when Sabah sees the error of its ways and rejoins the national front coalition, dominated by the prime minister's United Malays National Organisation (Umno). Umno is now spending thousands, some say millions, on trying to win over Sabah voters. The heavily government influenced media has swung into action. 'Let us not waste any more time on the narrow sectarianism preached by ambitious and self seeking politicians,' said Dr Mahathir in an election message to Sabah voters. 'We can together transform Sabah into an economically advanced and spiritually resilient state that will make Sabahans proud . . . .' But the majority of Sabahans seem unlikely to heed Dr Mahathir's message. A PBS victory once again seems likely, though Umno could succeed in denting the ruling party's majority. Some voters fear the emergence of a one-party state in Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, is two and a half hours flying time away from Sabah. Many people in Sabah resent being pressured by what they perceive as a remote and uncaring federal administration. The PBS has successfully campaigned under the slogan 'Sabah for the Sabahans'. Sabah's leaders say the federal government has taken away state rights to revenues from offshore oil production and tried to impose restrictions on the timber trade, a principal source of state revenue. Meanwhile Sabah has been starved of infrastructure funds. Repeated requests for a university to be set up in the state have gone unanswered. Dr Mahathir does little to hide his impatience with the PBS, which he has long suspected of making moves to take Sabah out of the Malaysian federation. A brother of Mr Pairin and a candidate in the election tomorrow was only recently released after being detained without charge for three years under Malaysia's wide-ranging internal security laws. In peninsular Malaysia politics is divided along racial lines. The Moslem Malays, who make up just more than 50 per cent of Malaysia's total population, vote for Umno. The Chinese, who have considerable economic power but little political clout, have their own party while the Indians also have their political group. Sabah has very different political traditions. Over the centuries Moslems, Chinese and Christians have intermarried. In recent years hundreds of thousands of immigrants - some legal but many not - have crowded in from poor areas of the southern Philippines and the eastern islands of Indonesia. The PBS, while dominated by the majority mainly Christian Kadazan community, is a mixture of different races and religions. There are fears that peninsular Malaysia's racial brand of politics could cause deep divisions within Sabah society. Sabah has always been hard to discipline. For years Sabah's leaders treated the state like a private fiefdom in which financial handouts were the norm, coherent policies the exception. One particularly profligate chief minister used to order his state aircraft to fly round Sabah airspace while he sat back in the clouds and watched Chinese Kung Fu films. Another indulged in grandiose road building projects: roads to nowhere are a part of the Sabah landscape. Dr Mahathir and his Umno party are out to tame the state the early explorers called 'the land below the wind'. Dr Mahathir is a leader used to getting his own way. But Sabah looks like it is going to tread a solitary path yet again. It could be some time before Keningau sees any federal development funds coming to town.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Scottish business 'feeling confident' Scottish companies are confident about the prospects of recovery, but are finding progress slower than expected, according to a survey of the region's five main chambers of commerce. It found confidence still rising - although at a lower rate than previously  -in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and tourism. Factories were continuing to find a strong increase in orders and sales. However, confidence was still falling in the retail sector as tax rises continued to have an effect. The quarterly survey by the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic research body at the University of Strathclyde, said results in the third quarter did not generally live up to expectations, with wholesaling the only sector where performance outstripped expectations.</p>

The message said the conference which is open in a  significant year in which falls the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the socialist rural theses is a historical  conference which will proudly review the great victory in  brilliantly fulfilling the tasks set by the rural theses and  display the validity of the theses and the vitality of the  socialist agricultural system in our country and a glorious  conference which will demonstrate the invincibility of our-style  socialism.    With the chuche-based socialist rural theses carried into  reality under the wise guidance of the party and the leader, a  brilliant example has been set in the solution of the rural  question and a change of the century has taken place in our  countryside, the message noted, and stated:    With the ideological revolution carried on vigorously in the  countryside, our agricultural working people are being prepared  to be dependable chuche-type revolutionaries who always breathe  and struggle as intended by the party, regarding loyalty to the  party and the leader as their life and soul, and are honestly  working for the country and the people, the society and the  collective under the slogan "One for all and all for one!"    As a result of the successful implementation of the party's  policy of the rural technical revolution, irrigation has been  completed on a high level and electrification realized with  success in the rural communities, and a great progress has been  made in the mechanisation of agriculture and extensive use of  chemicals, enabling the farmers to do farming easily and  efficiently with the help of machines and chemicals.    And the chuche farming method has been strictly applied,  with  the result that agricultural production is rapidly developing on  the basis of modern science and technique. And the vigorous  rural cultural revolution has helped remarkably enhance the  level of general knowledge and technical and cultural standard  of the agricultural working people and turn our countryside into  a cultured and affluent modern socialist rural areas.    With the constant improvement of the guidance and management  of the rural economy and enhancement of the guiding role of  all-people property over cooperative property, a great success  has been made in eliminating the distinctions between towns and  the countryside in the form of management and ownership.    The WPK Central Committee in the message noted that our  agricultural working people in the past 30 years have made great  contributions to the building of a new socialist life in the  motherland and to the prosperity and development of the country  and a greater happiness of the people with their devoted  struggle and creative labour, cherishing in their hearts the  firm faith in socialism, and highly estimated their feats in  labour.    Calling upon the entire party members and working people in  the agricultural domain to make redoubled efforts to effect a  new upswing in rural construction and agricultural production in  hearty response to "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural  Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses", the  historical letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  to the conference, the message elaborated on the tasks for this.    It said: The ideological revolution must be deepened, first  of all, so as to push ahead with the work of arming the party  members and other working people with the great chuche idea and  the chuche-based idea of rural construction of the party and  assimilating the farmers to the working class and  revolutionizing them. And the technical revolution must be  powerfully pressed ahead on a higher stage, to ensure that the  material and technical foundations of agriculture are further  consolidated and a constant upsurge is effected in agricultural  production.    Through a more dynamic cultural revolution, the number of  agro-technicians must be largely increased, the technical and  cultural level of the agricultural working people who are  directly responsible for agricultural production be lifted to a  higher stage and a cultural and hygienic practice in and out of  work be developed to build up our socialist constryside into  ideal villages good to work and live in.    The WPK Central Committee in the message expressed the hope  that all the agricultural working people, united behind the  party and the leader as firm as a rock, will determinedly  struggle to firmly defend and further glorify Korean-style  socialism under the banner of the chuche idea and thus  creditably live up to the deep trust and expectation of the  party.</p>

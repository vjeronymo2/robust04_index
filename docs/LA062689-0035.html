			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH LOCKUP;  </P> <P> NEW JAIL NEAR CASTAIC ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE 2,800 OF COUNTY'S MOST DANGEROUS  INMATES  </P> <P> Sometime in the next two to four months, 2,800 men will arrive in buses to live  for up to a year in the hills below Castaic. Unlike many residents of the area  who commute to distant jobs, the newcomers will be within walking distance of  their jobs in a new bakery, print shop and textile factory. They will also have  ready access to facilities for exercise, basketball games, card playing and  other hobbies.  </P> <P> These men will not be among the hundreds who have flocked to the area in recent  years to escape the perils of big city living.  </P> <P> Rather, their experience of the countryside will be limited to glimpses through  the rectangular, 4-inch-wide bulletproof windows in their new home: a  $131-million maximum-security jail complex scheduled to open soon at the Peter  J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, Los Angeles County's largest jail complex.  </P> <P> The men will be among the county's most dangerous criminals. Most of them will  be sent to the facility while awaiting trial or sentencing for such felonies as  murder, armed robbery, assault and rape.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relative Danger  </P> <P> "On a danger scale of one to 10, they are seven or better," said county  Sheriff's Capt. Michael A. Nelson, who since April has supervised planning for  the facility and who will be its director when it opens.  </P> <P> Called the North County Correctional Facility, the 680,000-square-foot complex  will increase the jail's population of minimum-, medium- and maximum-security  inmates from about 7,500 to more than 10,000. It will about double the maximum  security population to about 6,000.  </P> <P> The jail, east of the Golden State Freeway between Santa Clarita and Castaic,  for 40 years was known as the Wayside Honor Rancho until officials changed its  name in 1982 to honor the former county sheriff.  </P> <P> The new complex, built partly to relieve crowding in the 6,800-inmate Men's  Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, will be the latest step in the evolution  of the rural, 2,865-acre jail site from a minimum-security "honor ranch" for  low-risk inmates to a sophisticated, high-tech detention facility for dangerous  criminals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sophisticated Electronics  </P> <P> Nelson said the new complex, which is about 98% complete, will be among the  most advanced of its kind in the nation. It will incorporate the latest in  electronic surveillance and automated security systems, he said, while  affording inmates opportunities for work and recreation.  </P> <P> Located behind an existing maximum-security facility, the complex consists of  four two-story detention buildings and a one-story structure connected by long  corridors. Four of the buildings are divided into dormitory-style cells for 32  inmates apiece, while a fifth, "high-risk" building has 196 individual cells  for the most dangerous inmates.  </P> <P> A "discipline" section in the high-risk building has 48 individual cells for  unruly inmates who will be sent to the cells for up to 10 days at a time and  allowed only an hour of exercise per week, Nelson said.  </P> <P> The complex has three heavily guarded outdoor exercise areas. Seven smaller  ones, all covered with heavy metal mesh, are in courtyards in the inmate  buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TV Monitors, Cameras  </P> <P> From a central command post, guards will be able to see virtually every corner  of the complex through 20 television monitors linked to 128 cameras posted  throughout the facility's five main buildings, Nelson said. Every door, from  individual cell doors to the main entrance gates, can be electronically locked  and unlocked from the command post, he said.  </P> <P> Using the electronic locks, guards should be able to contain inmate  disturbances by instantly locking doors leading to other areas, he said.  </P> <P> "Anyone who thinks they can get a key from someone and get into another part of  the building is sadly mistaken," Nelson said.  </P> <P> Nelson said the facility's design has nothing in common with the recently  completed federal Metropolitan Detention Center downtown, from which five men  escaped June 18 after cutting through metal mesh enclosing an eighth-floor  recreation area. The men, who were awaiting trial or sentencing for federal  crimes, used a rope made of bedsheets to lower themselves to the street. One of  them was arrested several hours after the escape, another was arrested Sunday;  the other three remain at large.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heavier Screen  </P> <P> "We have no design similarities with their operation," Nelson said. "Our  screening in outdoor recreation areas is considerably heavier than the  screening they use."  </P> <P> In case of fire, a computer connected to alarms will automatically print out  instructions showing the quickest route to the blaze, Nelson said.  </P> <P> The jail is more than a high-tech detention center, Nelson said. It also puts  inmates to work to save the county money and to develop occupational skills  that they may be able to use after their sentences end, he said.  </P> <P> Inmates working in a new, 10,000-square-foot bakery will bake 25,000 loaves of  bread every day for 22,000 inmates in the county's eight jails, Nelson said.  Others will be put to work in a 19,000-square-foot sewing shop to manufacture  T-shirts and underwear for inmates, and some inmates will work in a print shop  producing crime report forms and other documents used by the Sheriff's  Department, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Keep a Man Busy'  </P> <P> "Obviously, if you can keep a man busy, give him a job, it's better for him --  and for us, too," Nelson said.  </P> <P> In addition to putting inmates to work, the complex will employ 368 uniformed  guards and 144 paid cooks, bakers, clerks and other personnel to supervise  inmate workers, Nelson said. The Sheriff's Department is accepting applications  for many of those positions, he said.  </P> <P> Nelson said planners designed the complex using suggestions from guards and  captains at other county jails. He said the design should prevent a repeat of  the March, 1985, jailbreak in which seven inmates, including one murderer,  escaped from the existing maximum-security unit, which was built in 1957.  </P> <P> The escaped murderer burglarized a home in nearby Bouquet Canyon before  authorities arrested him in downtown Los Angeles. Five of the other escapees  were captured not far from the jail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Opposition  </P> <P> Despite the escapes, news that nearly 3,000 additional high-risk criminals will  be moving into the area apparently has not stirred community opposition.  Several homeowners who live across the freeway from the jail said in interviews  that they are not worried that inmates might escape and commit crimes in their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> "I'm really not worried about it," said Bill Straughan, who lives with his wife  and two young daughters in a neighborhood north of Hasley Canyon Road. "It's  full-security, and so is my home -- we have an alarm. By expanding it out here,  they'll save taxpayers money. They're going to have to put it somewhere."  </P> <P> Straughan added, however, that he worries about additional traffic from people  visiting inmates. And he wants the jail to change its practice of releasing  inmates at the jail's main entrance. If no one is there to pick up the inmates,  he said, they might wander into the neighborhood and commit crimes.  </P> <P> Resident Andy Swanson, a California Highway Patrol officer, said he does not  welcome the new inmates.  </P> <P> "It's something to think about," he said. "Even the way it is right now, it's a  constant thought. If they ever escape, where are they going to go?"  </P></p>

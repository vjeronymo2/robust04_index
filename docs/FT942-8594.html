			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France outlines farm export reform for EU France yesterday served notice of its intention to increase its share of the European market by becoming more competitive and Europe's share of the world market by making more sparing use of subsidised food exports now constrained by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture minister, told the National Assembly that his new ideas would be contained in a memorandum to go to Brussels and France's European Union partners just before France takes over the EU presidency for the first half of 1995. In addition to a series of structural and financial changes to French agriculture, Paris will be also suggesting that: The EU should abolish export rebates on sales to richer countries or on products like poultry where the subsidy is of marginal impact; Concentrate cereal sales in the winter months when the world price generally rises to nearer that of the EU, so that less subsidy is needed; Exploit Gatt requirements that Europe increase other food producers' 'minimum access' to the European market by using these imports as a cheap input material for re-export. One example is that the melting down of cheese imports for re-export without subsidy; Introduce differential pricing so that European farmers would only get guaranteed prices on a percentage of their production, the rest of which could exported without the benefit of subsidies.</p>

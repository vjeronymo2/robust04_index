			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Negotiators set sights on February Gatt deal SENIOR trade negotiators will today formally endorse a negotiating timetable designed to conclude the Uruguay Round of global trade talks early next year. The meeting of the trade negotiations committee (TNC), the overseeing body for the 108-nation Round conducted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), follows the deal struck last week by the US and EC on farm subsidies. The agreement broke a logjam which has stalled talks since last December. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general and TNC chairman, will propose finalising the Uruguay Round package of rules by Christmas and completing bilateral negotiations on market access for goods and services by February, at the latest. This is to beat the March 1 deadline for the US administration's 'fast-track' negotiating authority, which prevents Congress tinkering with the final trade liberalising accord. Diplomats yesterday cautioned against over-optimism, pointing out that several important and politically sensitive issues were unresolved. The Round, launched in 1986, spans 15 broad trade areas and extends fair trade rules for the first time to agriculture, textiles, services and intellectual property protection. Mr Dunkel's first task will be to see if countries are willing to modify the draft 'final act' presented to negotiators last December to incorporate the US-EC farm trade accord. Beyond this he will emphasise that those wanting changes to the draft must show evidence of a consensus in their favour. It remains to be seen to what lengths Japan and South Korea are prepared to go to press objections to opening their rice markets. Many countries, including the US and EC, also have reservations about aspects of the draft but may not insist on changes if others show the same restraint. The bilateral negotiations - an integral part of the package - could also fail if countries are not able to make the necessary political decisions to reduce protection across the spectrum of goods and services. Gatt officials have recently visited 32 developing countries to help them prepare services liberalisation offers, without which they cannot become signatories to the proposed services accord nor to the Multilateral Trade Organisation, which will incorporate it, and Gatt.</p>

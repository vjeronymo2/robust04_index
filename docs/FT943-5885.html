			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Abnormal charges put MIM in red MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals and mining group, yesterday announced a ADollars 195.1m (USDollars 145m) loss after tax in the year to end-June, largely resulting from heavy abnormal charges. In the previous year, it had made a ADollars 74m profit. Revenues were ADollars 2.31bn, up from ADollars 2.02bn previously. The abnormal charges amounted to ADollars 170m before tax last year, compared with ADollars 80.8m in 1992-93. In large part, they were due to the restructuring of MIM's interests in Germany and included a ADollars 95m write-off of goodwill at the Duisburg zinc smelter, in which MIM has acquired a 100 per cent interest, and a ADollars 50m provision for the reduced value of its investment in Berzelius Umwelt Service, the recycling business. However, even at the pre-tax level, and before exchange differences, MIM made a much reduced profit of ADollars 43.3m, compared with ADollars 126.8m in the previous year, with an ADollars 16.9m loss coming in the fourth quarter, against a loss of ADollars 13.2m. The company said it had not been a good year and it had been hit by lower metal prices. The average copper price, in Australian dollar terms, was down by 14 per cent from the previous year, while lead was 7 per cent lower, and zinc down by 9 per cent. Higher volumes partly offset this effect but the rising Australian dollar diminished their impact. MIM is paying a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share, after a similar interim.</p>

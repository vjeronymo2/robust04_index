			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations seek to balance concerns such as a fair opportunity for participation by account holders and the desire to infuse significant amounts of new capital into converting savings associations. In addition, the regulations are structured to assure that a savings association receives fair value for its conversion stock and to prevent insider abuse by governing the manner and extent to which a savings association's insiders and their associates, individually and in the aggregate, may acquire stock and other benefits in a conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent months, mutual to stock conversions have become the subject of controversy and negative media attention. In particular, there has been controversy over the fact that some states offer insiders of state savings banks the opportunity to gain potentially greater benefits and more generous compensation packages than are currently permitted under OTS rules. Congress also has expressed serious concerns in this area. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to address the issue of minimum standards for conversions by state savings banks and limitations on management benefits in conversions. In addition, both the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the House Banking Committee and the Senate Banking Committee recently have held hearings on perceived abuses in mutual to stock conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the OTS believes that its current regulations have generally provided sound safeguards for mutual to stock conversions, the OTS and the FHLBB, in administering the conversion program, have refined the conversion regulations periodically in light of experience with the conversion process and in response to developments in the market place. As a result of the recent events concerning mutual to stock conversions, the OTS has again reviewed its conversion regulations to assess whether additional revisions to its rules are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of its review, the OTS has analyzed the changing financial condition of converting mutual associations. During the 1980s, most mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. As a result, the FHLBB undertook a number of regulatory initiatives designed to encourage associations to convert to stock form. Many associations took advantage of these changes to recapitalize. Now, however, most mutual institutions in the industry are healthy. Generally, these healthy institutions are not converting to meet regulatory capital requirements. Instead, they seek to raise capital to expand their current operations through branching or acquiring other institutions, to engage in new activities, through both the formation of a holding company and establishment or acquisition of operating subsidiaries, and to establish stock benefit plans for management and employees. This change in the reasons for conversions has caused the OTS to rethink the need for the regulatory inducements for conversion contained in the current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing, the OTS has identified several areas of the regulations, discussed below, that it has determined to revise, update and clarify to further strengthen the standards governing the conversion process. The OTS has consulted with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') in developing these changes to ensure consistent policy in this area. The OTS also has determined to adopt the amendments immediately as an interim final rule to protect the integrity of the conversion process. As such, the final rule is designed to assure the public that the conversion program will continue to be fair and equitable. Also, Congress has made it clear that it expects both the OTS and the FDIC to act promptly to assure that any abuses or potential abuses in the mutual to stock conversion area are addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of Revisions to Conversion Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Revision to the Appraisal Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(1), a converting savings association is required to sell its capital stock at a total price equal to its estimated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market value, based on an independent valuation. When the FHLBB adopted the initial conversion regulations, it found that underpricing conversion stock would result in ``windfall'' distributions of the value of a converting association and that no method of conversion could be considered equitable unless the conversion stock was accurately appraised and sold at its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market value. This was necessary to assure that the association received full value for the conversion stock it distributed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

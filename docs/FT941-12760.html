			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada's media hype Stopping the clock in takeover bids may drag the process out, but at least it allows more time for knockabout exchanges. Yesterday's missive from Granada was good value in that respect. There were some eye-popping numbers: Granada's bid values LWT at a Japanese-style 35 times its annual cash flow, and rates it at a 42 per cent premium to the FT-SE-A All-Share index, itself scarcely undervalued. There was also some entertaining rhetoric which, incidentally, reinforced the point that much of the re-rating of media companies has already happened. Indeed, shareholders may be beginning to wonder whether Granada's offer more than reflects the sector's prospects. It may be that Granada has little option but to participate in the current consolidation if it wishes to remain a large shark in the shrinking ITV pool. But that does not guarantee good long-term returns for shareholders. The debate over advertising sales has shown that ITV companies are currently little more than a moderately predictable cash flow over the next nine years with a reasonable certainty of renewal for a further decade. On that basis, the current bids look expensive. Unless the new larger companies can use their channel 3 licences as a platform for wider ambitions, the bids may come back to haunt chairmen in future annual general meetings. Stretched valuations are not the only nail in LWT's coffin. Granada is likely to be able to meet any Office of Fair Trading objections on advertising sales. LWT's prospects of finding a white knight able to match Granada's offer seem to be evaporating. That leaves LWT with a very difficult proposition to sell. Given that Granada is in such a strong position, it was thus a touch disappointing that in the pursuit of good sport the predator found it necessary to cast innuendo on LWT's profits forecast.</p>

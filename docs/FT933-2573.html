			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Turner seeks deal with France over TV network MR TED TURNER, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, said yesterday he was seeking a compromise with France in a row over US programme content of his new satellite television network. France has blocked reception of the TNT/cartoon network, launched in Europe today, on domestic cable networks. The network, carried on the Astra satellite system, runs cartoons from 6am to 6pm and mainly old films from the MGM library during the rest of the day. French opposition to the network is based on EC rules which say that where practicable there should be a minimum of 51 per cent European production in satellite television channels. The French government would also like to see trade in cultural products raised in the Gatt trade talks. Mr Turner said yesterday: 'The French have their own way of doing things and they are entitled to do it.' The founder of Cable News Network, the 24-hours-a-day television news service, added: 'We are trying to be good guys and to sit down and try to see if some kind of compromise can be reached.' Mr Turner has called for a study of European content in the TNT film channel and found that a number of the library films were shot in the UK. Other films have involved European co-producers. Mr Turner said yesterday he estimated that as much as 30 per cent of TNT was either made in Europe or had European co-production links. The TNT/cartoon network, which is freely available across Europe to those with satellite television equipment, has already been given a licence by the Independent Television Commission in the UK. Under EC regulations, if a television channel is licensed in any EC country that usually means it should be freely available throughout the Community. The row intensified yesterday as Belgium joined France in banning the channel from its cable television network on the grounds that it did not have enough European content.</p>

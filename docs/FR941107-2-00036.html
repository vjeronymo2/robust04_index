The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the preliminary determination and postponement of the final determination of this investigation on June 10, 1994, (59 FR 31204, dated June 17, 1994), the following has occurred:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 27, 1994, Hornos Electricos de Venezuela, S.A. de C.V. (Hevensa) submitted its response to Section D of the Department of Commerce's (the Department) questionnaire. (Section D of the questionnaire requests information on the cost of production (COP) and constructed value (CV).) On June 29, 1994, Hevensa submitted a revised version of this response correcting bracketing errors. On July 12, 1994, Hevensa also submitted supplemental responses to its March 1, 1994, and April 19, 1994, submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department requested additional information regarding Section D of the questionnaire on July 14, 1994. Hevensa submitted this information on August 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Verification of Hevensa's sales and COP/CV questionnaire responses was conducted in July and September 1994, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hevensa and petitioners submitted case briefs on October 3, 1994, and rebuttal briefs on October 6, 1994. At Hevensa's request, the Department held a public hearing on October 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is June 1, 1993, through November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We made fair value comparisons using the following such or similar categories: (1) lumps and (2) fines. Where we were not able to compare U.S. sales to sales of identical merchandise, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping duty questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether Hevensa's sales to the United States of silicomanganese were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

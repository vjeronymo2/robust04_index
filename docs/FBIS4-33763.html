			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshinori Nakai] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jun -- During an interview on 2 June  with six foreign press groups, including MAINICHI SHIMBUN,  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said: "The  delegation of the Japanese private sector has confirmed to me  that it has the intention of investing in and starting business  operations in Mexico. The Honda Motor Company, Ltd., will also  launch its production of passenger cars. Investment by Japan  has been materializing." The president thus refuted the view  that "Japan's investment in Mexico is sluggish." Mexican mass  media reported that the Japanese delegation expressed a cautious  view on the investment environment in Mexico during recent  meetings with the president and other government officials  concerned.    With regard to the country-of-origin certification system of  NAFTA, Salinas said, "Efforts should be made to ensure the  transparency of the system so that non-NAFTA member nations can  easily understand it." He then stressed the advantage of  investing in Mexico, saying, "Mexico's population is 85 million  people, and its market is the 10th largest in the world."    As for the fact that Mexico succeeded in joining the OECD,  Salinas said: "Mexico needs strategies to approach the markets,  financial resources, and technologies (of developed countries).  The establishment of NAFTA and Mexico's participation in the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have enabled  Mexico to expand the markets in North America and Asia for its  products. It can also have access to the European market  through the OECD. Mexico's financial system and technologies  have been gradually catching up with those of developed  countries." He thus expressed confidence in Mexico's economic  growth.    Touching on the investigation into the assassination of Mr.  Colosio, who was the presidential candidate of the ruling party,  Salinas denied the possibility of this case remaining unsolved,  saying, "Investigations will be conducted until the truth is  learned."</p>

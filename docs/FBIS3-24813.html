			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Here in Bujumbura town, as you have heard,  things deteriorated during the day. No work was done, and most  of the roads in the town were closed. In the suburbs of Musaga,  Kinanira, and Kanyosha, properties were damaged, and people are  said to have been killed. It has been reported that peace is  returning this evening, although tires were burning at road  blocks between Ngagara and the town center. Security officials  have tried to put out the fires but movement has been difficult,  especially for cars. We have not seen any vehicles in  circulation apart from those of the security services. The  government has taken the opportunity to say a few words about  the events through Cyriaque Simbizi, the minister of youth,  sports, and culture who is also the interim information minister  and government spokesman.    [Begin Simbizi recording] [passage omitted] As things stand,  those who oppose the government which was put in place by the  people are also those who pretend not to recognize that the  current problems have arisen from the killing of the head of  state. They have been blocking roads, burning, and killing.  Such behavior at this time is contrary to the spirit of the  return of peace. In fact, if one takes a close look one finds  that many opposition leaders are planning to start a war in the  country. [passage omitted]    It is surprising to see that there is no security in  Bujumbura town though everybody knows that the security forces  are there in strength. Those who have a complaint against the  government should not be allowed to express their complaints  through killing and looting. Is the thirst for power alone  responsible for the current damages, or do they not know that  the actions of the opposition are also responsible for those who  have died?    Yesterday more than 30 people died in Musaga zone. They were  killed by [words indistinct] stones and knives. In Kinindo, two  people were killed. Tonight, a grenade killed six people in  Nyakabiga. Also today, some citizens were sho,t and a grenade  was thrown at others who were trying to remove stones that had  been put in place by the warmongers.    A wise politician looks for power through peaceful means and  first tries to see if the people he wants to lead will accept  him. Otherwise we would be heading for dictatorship.

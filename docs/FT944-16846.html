			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais takes tough line Credit Lyonnais hopes by the end of next year to recover some FFr12bn (Dollars 2.27bn) of its total FFr70bn worth of doubtful loans for which provisions have been made, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said yesterday. In an interview with the Agence France Presse news agency, he signalled a tougher line in pursuing creditors, and for the first time quantified the impact the bank hoped this policy would have on its balance sheet. The bank is involved in legal action to recover its loans to Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-politician, and has started criminal proceedings against former staff of its International Bankers subsidiary. Credit Lyonnais had often been lax in trying to recover loans once provision for possible non-repayment had been made in its accounts, a bank spokesman said yesterday. But it now has FFr70bn in provisioned loans on its books - excluding FFr40bn doubtful real estate loans transferred to a state-guaranteed company earlier this year. Mr Peyrelevade 'firmly hoped' the group's current banking business should show a profit next year. In the first half of this year, pre-tax 'current' operations produced a FFr1.57bn profit. However, this was submerged in a FFr7.2bn loss on 'exceptional' bank and non-bank loans inherited from the past. But the chairman said the possibility of hiving off and privatising the purely banking parts of Credit Lyonnais was 'only one solution among 50 others'. He added that he was still negotiating with the government as to how to carry out their joint agreement that the bank should be protected from 'risks latent' in past loans and investments made under his predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer. He again denied that he told analysts on September 30 that the state would take all doubtful assets off the bank's books. Reports of such a move prompted a sharp rise in the bank's non-voting shares and led to questions from the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock exchange watchdog authority. Mr Peyrelevade has so far reached FFr6.8bn towards his target of selling some FFr20bn of the bank's industrial and financial investments, and yesterday said he planned to complete 'very rapidly' the sale of Credit Lyonnais' 9.4 per cent stake in the Meridien hotel chain to Forte at the same price which the UK hotel group is paying Air France for control of Meridien.</p>

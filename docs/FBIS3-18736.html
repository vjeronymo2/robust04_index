			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "Do Not Support Berlusconi's </F> Men"]    [Text] Rome -- Let the Forza Italia candidates fend for  themselves, let them undertake the election campaign on their  own, with their own resources, and let them just forget Bossi's  League working for them. Behind the scene, the relationship  between Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is even worse  than on stage, in front of the spotlights. The latest blow came  from Bossi. He has written with his own hand, in a handwriting  bearing signs of rage and haste, a warning memorandum to "all  League secretaries," which goes more or less like this: Take  care not to "support" the enemy-ally. They should remember who  Berlusconi is and what he wanted to do before being  "neutralized" by the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy.    The fact that relations between the leaders of the pole of  freedoms were not good is nothing new, but the fact that, right  in the middle of an electoral pact, one of the two allies  instructs "his people" not to cooperate with colleagues from the  same line-up is, to put it mildly, unusual.    And yet, it has happened. On Thursday 3 March, Umberto Bossi  drafted a handwritten memo on "Chamber of Deputies" leaderhead:  "To all Northern League Secretaries. It is absolutely forbidden  to support or to present in any way Forza Italia candidates.  This is solely an electoral alliance, but we must not forget  that Forza Italia has been set up in order to place the Northern  portfolio into the hands of the social security hand-out  politicians of the south and to recycle the old political class  of the center already routed by the League. Signed: Umberto  Bossi." In other words: Leave them to their fate. They are  former enemies, whom we have isolated.    The pen strokes are clear, determined, given the Senator's  strong aversion to the man who is carrying off votes and the  limelight. Bossi knows that the opinion polls are sliding for  him, and on 2 March, at Varese, he had already publicly attacked  Berlusconi as if he were the enemy to be beaten: "I want to see  how he will behave when we begin to discuss the question of his  television stations, he who speaks so much about free trade...."  On 3 March, he launched the nonpublic offensive: Boycott  Berlusconi. The fax arrived at the periphery of the Northern  Empire, at the League's Verona headquarters, where it was  intercepted by Verona's local LA CRONACA newspaper. How does  one justify such a gaffe? Difficult... And, indeed, the  contents of the message were not denied, but wrapped in  explanations. Bossi's message, it was specified, was  accompanied by one from Patelli, the League's organizational  secretary, on the same topic. The Forza Italia candidates  should not be supported, not for spite, but for perfectly  technical reasons, relating to the division of electoral costs  within the pact.    Bossi's words are too aggressive to be attributed simply to  financial concerns. The fact of the matter is that Bossi,  beyond the warlike statements, is worried. The latest polls are  showing the National Alliance overtaking the League. The  Northern League is vacillating. The insults aimed at the  National Alliance and the "absolute ban" on helping in any way  the electoral success of Berlusconi's men are the fruit of  nervousness.    Allies are allies and League Chairman Franco Rocchetta,  still  in a critical position within the League, is not convinced that  it is helpful to attack them: "No dirty tricks or blows below  the belt between us," he exhorted at Mestre, presenting the  Venetian candidates of the pole of freedoms (Northern League,  Forza Italia, Center Union, Casini's former DC [Christian  Democratic Party] members and Pannella's "reformers"). We must  all be united in the uninominal vote and fight honestly and like  sportsmen for the proportional seats. The pole of freedoms is  an alliance and not a malicious marriage, made up of betrayals  and sell-outs, like the progressive pole."    A similar call for a lowering of tension came from Emma  Bonino, who has landed in the Forza Italia's anti-left pole.  "It is our duty to live for this country and many are trying to  make us lose," the "reformers" candidate stated. "We must  clarify the polemics and overcome the differences...."    It is a pity that Bossi has his opinions and that they count  more than those of the others, given that he is a so-called  charismatic leader. The latest attack was launched yesterday at  Florence where the Forza Italia, that is, the ally, became  "False Italy" [Falsa Italia] or "Italian Weakness" [Sforza  Italia]. "Our objective," the Senator said, "is to create a  free trade pole which perhaps could be revolutionary. I say  perhaps, because I doubt whether Forza Italia would agree with  an antitrust law which would sweep away [Berlusconi's]  Fininvest."</p>

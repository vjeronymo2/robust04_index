More than 75 percent of all profit is  attributable to industry.    Profits increased 8.0-fold as compared with January-November  1992, including a 7.5-fold increase in industry. The entirety of  the increase seen in profits was due to increased prices.    At the same time, the financial state of enterprises  continues to be adverse. The profitability factor with respect  to industrial production was on the level of 41-44 percent.  However, the increased prices are noticeably depreciating the  income received by enterprises. Over 16 percent of all  enterprises and organizations of the oblast were operating  unprofitably in January-November. In industry and  transportation, 14 percent of enterprises operated at a loss; in  housing and municipal facilities--12 percent; in trade--over 20  percent; and in provision of everyday services--40 percent. On  the whole, the number of enterprises operating at a loss  decreased by 7 percent as compared with January-November 1992,  but their number in industry rose 17 percent.    On the whole in the state sector of the oblast economy, the  proportion of unprofitable enterprises was 3.8 percentage points  higher than was the case in the nonstate sector.    Insolvency of enterprises is significantly aggravating the  problem of unprofitability. As of 1 December 1993, the total  amount of creditor indebtedness of enterprises in industry,  construction, transportation, and agriculture came to R145.6  billion, of which R40 billion, or 27 percent, was overdue.  Residual free monetary assets totaling R19.4 billion as of 1  December covered one-seventh (13.3 percent) of their total  creditor indebtedness. Debts receivable for the above-mentioned  sectors amounted to R185.2 billion, 27.2 percent higher than the  enterprise debt.    Low solvency (the ratio of monetary assets and debts  receivable to creditor indebtedness and debts on credits and  loans secured) was observed at enterprises of the coal industry  (12.7 percent), the machinebuilding and metalworking industry  (68.2 percent), the lumber and woodworking industry (64.7  percent), the textile industry (55.4 percent), the garment  industry (69.5 percent), the food industry (54.3 percent), and  at agricultural enterprises (48.3 percent).    The indebtedness of industrial, construction,  transportation,  and agricultural enterprises with respect to bank credits as of  1 December exceeded their own monetary assets fourfold.    Delinquent indebtedness with respect to issuance of  consumption funds in the sectors of industry, construction, and  agriculture amounted to R3.8 billion as of 1 January 1994. The  amount of unpaid wages in industry decreased by 23 percent in  December 1993 as compared with November, amounting to R1.7  billion; in construction this figure dropped to half its  November level, coming to R0.7 billion; in agriculture, the  figure decreased by 13 percent, amounting to R1.3 billion.    Poor payments discipline at enterprises is complicating the  generation of financial resources necessary for production and  social development.    The largest share of assets expended consisted of payments  to  the budget--55 percent (31 percent for 1992).    Some R215.6 billion in taxes and other payments were made to  the state budget from enterprises, organizations, and the  populace of the oblast in 1993. This is seven times the amount  paid in 1992. About half this figure (48.7 percent) came from  tax on profits. Value-added tax accounted for 24.6 percent, and  taxes from the populace--11.5 percent.  <H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>   As of 1 January 1994, 1,375 enterprises in the oblast had  been privatized. Of these, 439, or 32 percent, were privatized  in 1993. Of the total number of privatized enterprises, 20  percent became private property through conversion to  joint-stock operation (full or partial), 80 percent--through  sale.    The proportion of large-scale federally owned enterprises  privatized increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent in  1993, while the proportion originally constituting oblast and  municipal property decreased somewhat--from 18 to 14 percent and  from 76 to 75 percent, respectively.    The main avenues for sale of property of enterprises during  the process of "small" privatization were: buy-up of leased  property (21 percent of the total number of enterprises  privatized); sale through commercial competition (35 percent);  auctions (23 percent). Sale of the property of liquidated  enterprises was chosen by only 1 percent of enterprises.    The proportion of enterprises privatized through conversion  to joint-stock operation rose 4 percentage points over 1992. Of  three alternatives of benefits offered labor collectives when  converting to joint-stock operation, the second alternative was  preferred, allowing the labor collective to hold a controlling  package of shares. More than three-fourths of the enterprises  converting to joint-stock operation selected this benefits  option. One-fifth of such enterprises chose the first  alternative. In addition, 2 percent of enterprises converted to  joint-stock operation through transformation of leased  enterprises.    The total value of property of enterprises privatized (prior  to reevaluation of fixed capital) amounted to R27.5412 billion.  The average value of an enterprise privatized from municipal  ownership was R2.7 million, from oblast ownership--R39.6  million, and from federal ownership--R88.4 million.    Competitive demand for property privatized is determined  both  by sector affiliation and type of ownership. On the whole, the  difference between the sale price and initially declared value  of the property, i.e., the average value rate of enterprises  privatized, is 12-fold, including 24-fold for enterprises of  municipal ownership, and threefold for enterprises of oblast and  federal ownership.    Total proceeds from the sale of property to new owners  (including funds from enterprises privatized in 1992) amounted  to R5.7 billion in monetary assets and 526,300 privatization  checks.    Over 60 percent of the funds received from privatization of  enterprise property was deposited as revenue into oblast, rayon,  and city budgets; 16 percent went to the federal budget, and 22  percent was directed to state privatization organs.    As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments were privatized in  the oblast (30.6 percent of the total number), including 35,700  in 1993. Of the total number of apartments privatized, 99  percent were privatized at no cost.    Funds totaling R59.6 million were received from the  privatization of housing, R37.4 of which (63 percent) was  received in 1993.    The average value of a privatized apartment was R11,000. The  average size--50 square meters.  <H5>  PRICE AND RATE LEVELS AND INDICES </H5>   The fairly high level of inflation was maintained in 1993.  It  was spasmodic, however.    Consumer prices for basic products and services increased  8.1-fold by December 1992. The maximum level of inflation was  set at the beginning of the year, when consumer goods and  services had almost doubled in price toward the end of the first  quarter, as compared with December of the previous year. A trend  toward reduced rates of inflation was seen beginning mid-year:  1.7-fold during the second quarter, 1.8-fold during the third  quarter, and 1.4-fold during the fourth quarter.    However, the growth of consumer prices of goods and services  in 1993 was significantly lower than in 1992, when a 24.9-fold  increase was seen.    Thus, prices for food products in 1993 increased 8.7-fold,  nonfood products--6.7-fold. These figures for 1992 were  13.1-fold and 19.8-fold, respectively. In this regard, during  the first half-year of 1993, food product prices rose at a  galloping rate, while this was the case for nonfood products in  the third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter an alternation was  seen: in October in favor of food products, in November nonfood  products, and in December the rate increases were the same.    Changes in the prices of individual food products were also  diverse. Compared with December 1992 prices, meat dumplings  increased in price 29-fold; vegetables--18-fold; cottage cheese  and sausage products, meat and meat products, milk and dairy  products--from 11-to 14-fold; butter, cheeses, eggs, bread, and  bakery products--from seven- to 10-fold. Fluctuations in the  rates of price change for industrial commodities were also  observed.    Prices increased significantly over the year for medicines  (102-fold), operating stock (27-fold), office products, building  materials, fuel, and individual commodities for children and  adults (from 10- to 14-fold).    A more significant rise in prices was observed with respect  to paid services provided the populace. This change overall  amounted to a 14.8-fold increase for the year (48.2-fold for  1992). This is 2.2 times greater than the growth of prices of  nonfood products, and 1.7 times greater than that for food  products.    In 1993, the stipulated rates for certain notary services  increased by a factor of 1,462, for legal consultation--by a  factor of 61. Passes for rest and relaxation facilities  increased 44-fold, tickets for the theater and museums and the  initial visit to the doctor--more than 30-fold. Certain cosmetic  and medical services, parental fees for child care, lodging in  hotels and dormitories, photography, laundry, dry cleaning, and  barber services, repair of footwear, refrigerators, and  televisions, rates for electric power and intercity  communications, postal rates, subscriber fees for home telephone  use and cable radio--all increased in price by factors of six to  20.    Wholesale prices of enterprises for industrial production in  1993 increased 9.6-fold as compared with December 1992.    The rise in wholesale prices was most significant in the  meat  and chemical industry, electric power industry, and building  materials industry (13- to 14-fold), and in the milk industry  (10-fold). Nitrogen fertilizers, water-heating boiler  facilities, footwear, meat products, and glass kitchenware  increased from 11- to 14-fold in cost, and crushed stone--more  than 19-fold.    The purchase price index for grain in 1993 was 578 percent,  for potatoes--330 percent, vegetables--1,545 percent. The  purchase price of livestock and fowl increased 13.4-fold over  the year, milk--10.3-fold, and eggs--9.5-fold.  <H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>   The demographic situation. As of 1 January 1994,  the population was 1,167,000, according to estimated data.    In 1993, 9,600 infants were born in the oblast. This is  1,200  (11 percent) fewer than in 1992; 19,200 people died--2,900 (17.6  percent) more than in 1992.    The level of natural population loss was 1.7 times greater  than that of 1992, and amounted to 9,600 people. This was  observed everywhere except in the city of Desnogorsk. The city  population of the oblast diminished by 4,700 people as a result  of natural processes, the rural population--by 4,900.    Heart disease and malignant tumors remain the most  frequently  encountered illnesses, constituting the cause of 72 percent of  deaths.    Some 8,408 marriages were registered in the oblast in 1993,  or 3.7 percent more than in 1992. The number of divorces  increased 2.5 percent, amounting to 5,534. There are 63 divorces  for every 100 registered marriages.    The volume of migration (arrivals and departures) dropped 13  percent as compared with 1992, amounting to 66,800. The number  of arrivals exceeded the number of departures by more than  10,000 individuals. New arrivals in the oblast included 4,374  refugees and people forced to resettle. Among those leaving the  oblast, 208 departed for permanent residence in countries of the  far abroad.    Labor resources. The number of persons employed in  the oblast economy (not including cooperatives, small or private  enterprises) during 1993 was 451,000. This is 2.7 percent fewer  than in 1992.    Some 18,100 citizens seeking jobs filed application with the  state employment service in 1993. The intermediary efforts of  this service resulted in job placement for 9,200 individuals, or  51 percent of the applicants.    As of the beginning of January of this year, 2,800 citizens  out of work were registered with the employment service organs.  This number decreased 24 percent over the year. Some 1,100  individuals were declared unemployed. Some 44 percent of the  unemployed were persons laid off in connection with the  elimination or reorganization of enterprises and with personnel  cuts. More than 56,000 people (12.4 percent of those employed in  the oblast economy) took additional leave or were shifted to  employment based on less than a full work week at the initiative  of the administration, i.e., constitute the potentially  unemployed. For every 10 vacancies indicated by enterprises,  there are 13 individuals seeking employment. In this regard, it  is blue-collar workers that enterprises require most of all (73  percent of the employment requirement).    Some 362 persons (3.7 times greater than at the beginning of  1993) underwent occupational training at the direction of the  employment service.    Monetary income of the populace in 1993, according  to preliminary estimates, totaled over R406 billion, a 9.7-fold  increase over 1992. Growth of income of the populace last year  surpassed the growth of consumer prices during all months except  January, May, and July.    Income of the populace increased 10 percent over the year in  real terms.    Growth of income in December is explained through the  regular  increase in the minimum wage and corresponding increase in  salaries in the budget sphere. Also influencing the growth in  incomes were material-assistance payments at the end of the year  and awards for annual work results.    In the final months of 1993, the proportion of outlays for  purchase of goods and services decreased, while the proportion  of savings in deposits and securities increased. Significant  amounts of ready cash stayed in the possession of the populace.  Thus, in December 1993, the share of total income kept on hand  by the populace came to 31.4 percent (in November this was 26.8  percent, in October--24.8 percent).    Average per capita face-value monetary income over 1993  amounted to 197 percent of the subsistence minimum (157 percent  in 1992). At the same time, almost one-fifth of the population  had an average per capita monetary income lower than the  subsistence minimum during the course of 1993.    The average monthly wages of workers at enterprises and  organizations (not including cooperatives, small or private  enterprises) for 1993 came to R43,800--9.7 times greater than in  1992 (first quarter--R14,300, second quarter--R30,500, third  quarter--R51,500, fourth quarter--R78,800).    The average wage in December 1993 was R96,300--35 percent  greater than in November 1993.    In this regard, the average wage in the material production  sectors exceeded R96,100. In the nonproduction sphere it was  R97,000, and not including credit and insurance  organizations--R77,000.    Consumer market of goods and services. Toward the  end of 1993, the decline in production of consumer goods had  decelerated. The industry of the oblast produced consumer goods  during the year totaling R429.5 billion, or 12.6 percent less  than in 1992 (for the first quarter the reduction was 26.4  percent, for the first half year--14.2 percent).    The output of nonfood products decreased to the greatest  extent (by 14.4 percent). This was affected by the sharp  reduction in output of light industry products (by 20.4 percent).    The production decrease was 48 percent for cotton fabrics,  34  percent for knitted articles, and 14 percent for leather shoes.    The output of food products decreased by 4.7 percent. Some  5,300 tonnes (14 percent) less meat (industrial output) was  produced than in 1992, sausage products--1,200 tonnes less (7  percent), whole milk products--8,200 tonnes less (13 percent),  bread and bakery products--44,300 tonnes less (21 percent), and  confectionery items--1,100 tonnes less (9 percent).    The production volume of dishware and crockery, sewing  machines, electric irons, umbrellas, tape recorders, and  greenhouses was higher than in 1992.    Over the past year, the retail trade volume of officially  registered trade enterprises and public kitchens of all forms of  ownership amounted to R245.2 billion. Expenditures by the  populace on the purchase of commodities increased 9.8-fold in  actual prices as compared with 1992. Trade turnover in physical  terms decreased by 9.7 percent. Almost half the trade turnover  volume (48 percent) was attributable to privately owned  enterprises. With respect to food products on the consumer  market, an adverse situation has developed concerning provision  of potatoes and vegetables to the populace.    As far as nonfood products are concerned, sales of  televisions and synthetic detergents rose significantly  (1.4-fold). It was precisely with respect to these goods,  however, that interruptions in trade were observed.    Paid services totaling R18.1 billion were provided residents  of the oblast over 1993. In current prices, the provision of  paid services increased 9.2-fold as compared with 1992, while in  physical terms 39 percent less in services was rendered to the  populace.    The volume of provision of everyday services decreased 36  percent in comparable price terms over the 1992 level. Over half  the volume of everyday services were provided by officially  registered enterprises of the nonstate sector. Provision of  everyday services to the rural population deteriorated.  According to the results of a one-time survey of the network of  rural enterprises providing everyday services to the populace,  16 rural rayons lack a permanent network of consumer services,  and an equal number do not have the itinerant variety of service  provision.    Education. As of the start of the 1993/1994 school  year, there were 696 general-education schools operating during  the daytime and 14 evening-session schools. Additionally, there  were two nonstate schools--a private high school and orthodox  secondary school.    Pupils number over 153,000--1,719 (4 percent) more than was  the case the previous school year.    There continues to be an increase in the number of schools  operating in two or three sessions. Whereas for the 1992/1993  school year, 17 percent of schools were in this category, the  proportion was 20 percent in 1993/1994. The percentage of pupils  attending second session increased from 23 to 25 percent, third  session--from 0.7 to 0.8 percent.    Some 12,300 students receive instruction in five institutes  of higher education of the oblast. This number includes 9,800  students in daytime instruction. As compared with the 1992/1993  school year, the number of students has decreased by 679 (5  percent). Some 2,435 individuals obtained higher education in  1993. Only 49 percent of the graduates received employment  assignments. The remainder were afforded the right to seek job  placement independently.    In 27 special secondary and higher educational institutions,  17,200 students are receiving instruction. This includes 7,900  students (46 percent) at nine colleges. The number of students  decreased a negligible amount--by 400 (2 percent)--as compared  with the (1992-1993 school year. In 1993, 4,413 specialists were  trained with special secondary and higher education. Fewer than  one-third of the graduates (26 percent) received an employment  assignment.    Crime. Some 22,700 crimes were registered in the  oblast in 1993, 10 percent more than in 1992 (in 1992 the  increase was 30 percent). Over half the crimes (58 percent) were  solved.    The proportion of grave crimes committed during the year  increased by 3 percent, amounting to 13.6 percent.    The proportion of property crimes continues to rise. Theft  constituted almost 60 percent of all the crimes committed.  <H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>   Industry. Industrial production in the oblast in  1993 was marked by instability. A trend toward deceleration of  the decline in production was noted in the final months,  however. Whereas the ratio of production volume for the first  quarter of 1993 to that for the same period of 1992 was just  79.4 percent, the volume of industrial production on the whole  as compared to the 1992 level was 88.3 percent. Deceleration of  the decline in industrial production was affected by a growth in  production output achieved by enterprises of the  energy-producing machine building industry (137.6 percent),  garment industry (112.7 percent), butter and cheese processing  and dairy industry (115.5 percent), and printing industry (103.7  percent). The most significant lag behind 1992 levels was  observed in the tractor and agricultural machine-building  industry (37.6 percent of the 1992 level), in instrument  manufacture (75.1 percent), the fuel industry (78.4 percent),  and the textile industry (73.1 percent).    A drop was noted in the production of electric power--by 4  percent, major electrical machinery--by 31 percent, light  bulbs--by 13 percent, automation tools and devices and their  spare parts--by 41 percent, computer equipment--by 39 percent,  and mineral fertilizers--by 20 percent.    Production of commercial timber fell by 31 percent. Due to  the lack of raw timber, output of sawn lumber was reduced 17  percent.    Enterprises of the construction industry curtailed their  output of building bricks by 7 percent, prefabricated reinforced  concrete components--by 20 percent, soft roofing materials--by  39 percent, enameled ceramic tile--by 16 percent.    At the same time that production volume in industry  diminished, a reduction was seen in the number of employees.  This reduction in personnel is proceeding less intensively,  however. In 1993 the number of employees decreased by just 5.1  percent. As a result, the drop in labor productivity was more  significant--6.9 percent. One reason for this situation is the  fact that the number of qualified workers has been retained in  hopes that production will improve.    There are 10 enterprises in the oblast engaged in  conversion.  In 1993 the total volume of production at these enterprises  decreased 17 percent from the 1992 level, including a 47 percent  decrease in military production. The proportion of the total  output of these enterprises attributable to civilian production  was 56.8 percent, as opposed to 63 percent in 1992.    Agriculture. With respect to agriculture, 1993 saw  a continuation of the redistribution of lands, their  privatization, and the reorganization of kolkhozes and  sovkhozes. As a result, at the end of the year the oblast had  312 partnerships and joint-stock companies of the closed  variety, 60 collective farms, 31 agricultural cooperatives, 31  sovkhozes, 21 kolkhozes, and two associations of peasant  (owner-operated) farms. As of 1 January 1994, there were 3,183  peasant (owner-operated) farms, with 165,800 hectares of land at  their disposal.    Some 633 peasant (owner-operated) farms were newly  established during the year (1,947 in 1992), while more than 300  farms ceased their operation.    The gross production output of farms of every category in  1993 amounted to R936.2 million (in 1983 comparable prices).  This is R82.3 million (8 percent) less than in 1992.    More than half (52 percent) the volume of gross agricultural  output was obtained from farms of the populace and peasant  (owner-operated) farms. Their share amounted to 42 percent in  1992. For all categories of farms, planted crop production  output was significantly less than in 1992, as a result of  reduced areas under seed and diminished crop productivity. Grain  output totaled 726,200 tonnes (weight after additional  processing)--88,800 tonnes (11 percent) less than in 1992;  vegetable production totaled 106,200 tonnes--45,500 tonnes (30  percent) less; and flax fiber output was 6,800 tonnes--11,700  tonnes (65 percent) less. Production of potatoes increased by 8  percent, amounting to 719,500 tonnes.    For the 1994 harvest, agricultural enterprises almost cut in  half their sowing of winter crops and plowing of land for spring  planting.    The situation with respect to livestock is ambiguous. In  1993, a 2 percent growth was achieved in livestock production  output for all categories of farms by increasing production in  owner-operated farms and farms of the populace.    Agricultural enterprises reduced their production of meat in  1993 by 7 percent from 1992 levels, eggs--by 4 percent, wool--by  45 percent. Production of milk increased by 7 percent due to  increased productivity of the cows, amounting to 412,800 tonnes.  The average amount of milk yield per cow for the year was 2,008  kilograms (1,677 kilograms in 1992). The trend toward reduced  herd size is continuing. As of 1 January 1994, the number of  cattle at all varieties of farms decreased by 8 percent,  amounting to 618,300 head. The number of cows was reduced by 1  percent, amounting to 276,300 head. The number of pigs came to  318,800, 0.7 percent less; the number of sheep and  goats--133,000, 6 percent less.    Increased numbers of livestock on farms of the populace and  owner-operated farms did not compensate for their drop at  agricultural enterprises.    Agricultural enterprises went into the winter season with  reduced feed supplies.    In 1993, 57,600 tonnes of mineral fertilizers (converted to  100-percent effective nutrient substance) were delivered to meet  the agriculture needs of the oblast, 20 percent less than the  quantity requested.    As compared with 1992, agricultural enterprises obtained 73  percent fewer trucks last year, 67 percent fewer tractor  trailers, 69 percent fewer bulldozers, and 6 percent fewer  tractors. Sixty-six more combines were purchased, and 44 percent  more earth movers.    Capital construction. Facilities and capacities  were put into operation last year in the oblast at the Yartsevo  diesel engine plants, at Dvigatel (in Yartsevo), at the Smolensk  printing combine, Roslavl chemical plant, and Smolensk city  dairy.    Hard-paved roads were constructed over 402.6 kilometers,  including 285.6 kilometers of intra-farm road. This is 34 and 51  percent less than in 1992.    Livestock breeding premises were put into operation in the  oblast to accommodate 4,100 cattle and 660 pigs; storage  facilities for grain and seed storage--for 14,600 tonnes; and  vegetable and potato storage facilities--for 1,200 tonnes of  simultaneous storage.    The volume of capital investments from all sources of  financing in 1993 was reduced by 32 percent, amounting to R118.8  billion. This is the consequence of decreased investment  activity on the part of enterprises over the past two years. The  rate of decline of capital investment volume was significantly  higher in agriculture (53 percent) than in other sectors.    The proportion of centralized capital investments dropped  from 58 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1993. The remainder of  capital investments are covered by funds of enterprises (51  percent), preferential term credits (4 percent), and investment  funds (9 percent). Some 59 percent of the centralized funds are  attributable to republic budget funds.    Construction work is being accomplished by contractor  organizations of various forms of ownership. State contractor  organizations account for 23 percent of the cost of the work.  The rest is accomplished by privately owned (21 percent) and  mixed (56 percent) organizations.    Some 63 percent of capital investments were used in the  construction of production facilities, 33 percent lower than the  prior year level.    Capital investments in the nonproduction sphere were reduced  by 2 percent, amounting to R43.9 billion. Of the total volume of  capital investments, the share of funds used for housing and  sociocultural construction increased from 35 percent in 1992 to  37 percent in 1993.    Some 4,780 apartments with all the modern conveniences were  commissioned out of all sources of financing, including  individual housing construction. These covered an area of  288,700 square meters--56,200 square meters (16 percent) less  than in 1992. At the same time, the volume of housing put into  operation from funds of the populace increased (by 26 percent),  although the share of total housing introduced in the oblast  attributable to such funds is still quite low (4.9 percent).    Transportation and communications. Some 16.3  million tonnes of diverse freight was shipped in 1993 by  general-use transportation of all varieties--9.7 million tonnes  (37 percent) less than in 1992.    Shipments of freight by motor vehicle transport decreased  2.2-fold. Shipments by rail decreased by 11.8 percent.    Virtually the entire volume (about 97 percent) of freight  shipments by motor vehicle transport was accomplished by  privatized enterprises.    Passenger traffic volume in general-use transportation  totaled 6 billion passenger-kilometers, a decrease of 2.2  percent. This includes motor vehicle transport--decreasing by  16.7 percent--and railroad transportation--increasing by 1.2  percent.    Over 1993, 19.8 million (6.2 percent) fewer passengers were  conveyed by all types of transportation than was the case a year  ago, including a drop of 2.6 percent in railroad transportation  and 14.2 percent in motor vehicle transport.    The plan for number of trips completed by intracity bus  service was implemented only to the level of 79.5 percent as of  1 January 1994. This is 8 percent lower than for 1992.    Income from basic activity of communications enterprises  totaled R9.1 billion in 1993, including R1.7 billion from  services rendered to the populace. This represents a 10.7-fold  increase over the 1992 level.    The main factor accounting for the growth in income was  increased prices and rates for services.  <H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY </H5>   Fifty enterprises and organizations of the oblast shipped  production output abroad in 1993 (including to the Baltic  countries). The volume of exports came to R164.6 billion in  domestic prices, and $171 million in foreign trade (contract)  prices.    The production association Minudobreniya shipped $12.5  million worth of fertilizers abroad (7.3 percent of the export  volume of the oblast); the production association Kristall  shipped precious stones valued at $150.8 million (88.2 percent).    Enterprises also shipped 2,600 tonnes of artificial  graphite,  2,100 tonnes of pelts, 460 tonnes of wood for fuel, 3,475  refrigerators (household), 330,900 fluorescent lamps, 131,600  square meters of facing tile, 640.7 tonnes of reinforced  concrete items, 590,000 pair of socks, 624 tonnes of flax fiber,  138,100 square meters of roofing material, in addition to other  production output. Some 42 percent of all exporter enterprises  concluded barter transactions, receiving commodities from their  foreign partners in exchange for their output.    The total volume of foreign trade turnover (total of exports  and imports) through trade exchange relationships amounted to  $9.2 million in 1993.</p>

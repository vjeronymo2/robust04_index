			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental board may ask chief executive to quit CONTINENTAL'S supervisory board meeting, called to discuss the request by Pirelli of Italy for renewed merger talks, ended last night with reports that Mr Horst Urban, chief executive of the German tyre company, had been asked to step down. More details also came from Milan about the strength of support behind the Italian company. Continental had no comment on the result of the meeting, or whether Mr Urban was resigning. A report in the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, made available in advance of publication, said the supervisory board had opposed Mr Urban's continued rejection of Pirelli's merger approach. His pugnacious defence of Continental's independence has given the bid tussle with Pirelli a drama which German mergers and acquisitions do not normally attain. This reached a peak in March when an extraordinary general meeting of Continental shareholders voted to remove its 5 per cent limitation on voting rights. Pirelli, claiming the support of a majority of Continental shareholders, has since reaffirmed its desire for further contacts with the German company. Continental and its UK merchant bank adviser, Morgan Grenfell, has questioned Pirelli's assertion that it has majority support. They argue that the voting at the EGM showed it had around 36 per cent. Yesterday, Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman of Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta, Italy's second biggest private sector insurer, said it owned 2.5 per cent of Continental's stock. This raises to more than 21 per cent the proportion of Continental's shares clearly identified as being in control of Pirelli and its allies. Mr Zanni also confirmed that Allianz, the German insurer which owns RAS, has a line of Continental shares which is believed to be 5 per cent. Allianz, whose finance director, Mr Friedrich Schiefer, is on Continental's supervisory board, has sometimes been identified as a supporter of Continental.</p>

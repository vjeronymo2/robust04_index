			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alekos Konis] </F>   [Text] Larnaca, (I SIMERINI Office)--After the recent  incident at Larnaca Airport, where aircraft movements were under  surveillance, a new act of espionage against the security of  Cyprus took place last Wednesday afternoon [22 June] in a  sensitive military area of Larnaca.    According to our information, last Wednesday afternoon a  National Guard patrol caught red-handed a British military  police corporal stationed at the British base at Dhekelia while  he was making notes on a topography map in an area next to  National Guard minefields west of the British base and south of  Pyla village.    The British serviceman had a compass in his possession,  which  he apparently used to locate accurately the exact geographic  position of the minefields and the passages through them by  enemy forces toward the territory of the Republic of Cyprus.    The British serviceman protested his arrest and there was an  incident with the national guardsmen.    The Englishman was finally arrested by the police. After  giving a statement in which he attempted to justify his actions  and the annotating of a map, he was released and handed over to  the authorities of the British base.    The actions of the police action remain inexplicable,  however; according to our information, they released the  Englishman without the consent of the military authorities and  the National Guard General Staff. The Briton's surname is Lee  [name published in English]. The police returned the compass  and map he was using, and an attempt was made to hush up an  event that is considered one of the most serious cases against  the security of the Republic of Cyprus in recent years.</p>

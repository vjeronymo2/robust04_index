			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ostankino General Director A. Yakovlev, by </F> GOLOS correspondent A. Nadzharov: "Ostankino Counting Money"]    [Text] Three months ago, as he was coming to  television, Aleksandr Yakovlev heard many worrisome reports  about mercenary crimes at Ostankino.    [GOLOS] Were they confirmed, Aleksandr Nikolaevich?    [Yakovlev] Not entirely. For instance, one of the cameramen,  or so I had been told, was not averse to accepting a  "consideration" for showing the thoughtful face of a businessman  who had placed a "private order" during, say, a hockey match.    [GOLOS] Possibly. Only this is completely unpunishable, in  my  opinion.    [Yakovlev] Correct. However, there is also the concept of  one's reputation. And when it develops in a certain manner it  necessarily excludes the possibility of that kind of operator  continuing to work in any serious institution.    [GOLOS] Did you discover any more serious violations,  though?    [Yakovlev] I didn't. At my request, however, the president  has ordered his administration's control commission to arrange a  special investigation. It has just completed its work and  apparently has not uncovered any truly serious crimes. It is  true, there are some suspicions concerning the economic  activities of Ostankino's former deputy general director,  Bandura, but it is still too soon to draw any conclusions: we  recently submitted the documents that were gathered to the court  for them to sort out.    [GOLOS] By the way, about criminal activity. Lately rumors  have been going around about the president's alleged ill health  or about another putsch being readied. During Yeltsin's  vacation, your channel broadcast an alarming report from one of  the new agencies about Chernomyrdin's sudden Sunday visit to  Sochi and about the telephones being out of order at the White  House.    [Yakovlev] That's all nonsense, and it was pointless to put  out an unverified report. Chernomyrdin did fly to see the  president, but not on Sunday or on Monday, and not on the  subject of any "coup being readied," but to settle on some  corrections to the budget, and certainly not because of how  Yeltsin was feeling. I should have his health.    [GOLOS] So, it's like the joke about the man who didn't win  a  car but lost, not the lottery but solitaire, and not a car but a  hundred rubles?    [Yakovlev] Something like that. Only I think someone is  organizing these campaigns regularly. Previously, a special  subdivision of Kryuchkov's KGB did this kind of thing. He's gone  now, but his nasty business seems to have survived.    [GOLOS] To be honest, I was somewhat uncomfortable about  talking with Aleksandr Nikolaevich about any criminal activity.  Especially since in the final analysis none of us is all that  interested in the TV "kitchen." What lacks does Ostankino's  director see in the activities of state channel No. 1, and how  does he plan to overcome them?    [Yakovlev] I will say straight away that we are going to be  airing the multi-series Mexican melodramas. No matter how much I  dislike them, they rate very high for viewer interest.    [GOLOS] But what about our own, Russian cinema? After all,  there are so many films made in recent years that the viewer has  never seen!    [Yakovlev] I agree, only the filmmakers are demanding 15  million rubles [R] for each showing, and where is that kind of  money to be got if the state is only paying for 30 percent of  the state channel's work? After all, besides paying for the  showing, we also have to pay the Communications Ministry R35  million per signal hour. No advertising money is enough here. In  short, we and the film people have to sit down and count the  money. Count it together.    [GOLOS] From time to time certain shows disappear from the  airwaves. Individual leaders drop out of sight. By what criteria  do you determine their right to air?    [Yakovlev] Generally speaking, I'm not involved in that.  There are editorial offices and television associations, and  what you're talking about is in their hands. So that I am not  reckoned as a censor or benevolent granddad in television. I  will say, however, that if I were one of the editorial  directors, I would simply fire those journalists who are  clarifying their relations in the collective through the press.  I'm an old newspaper man myself. I started out on the district  paper, and I have no memory, say, of our newspaper reporters  ever complaining about their bosses on "Sportloto."    [GOLOS] Would you please say a few words about Ostankino's  new TV shows?    [Yakovlev] There are lots of them. We are trying to  emphasize  the information and the nearly vanished current affairs  programs. Meanwhile, some leaders are mad at me because there's  no room for moralizing within the framework for putting out the  news. And it's right that they don't. Give the viewer the facts;  he'll draw his own conclusions. Which, actually, by no means  excludes intelligent analysis or expert commentary. This is a  neglected area among us, unfortunately. After all, the childish  kick given in passing to the president, who, in the opinion of  the story's young author, supposedly missed or overlooked  something, cannot be considered analysis. By the way, about the  young. It was in their milieu--I have in mind MGU (Moscow State  University)--that a pretty good idea was born for a series of  broadcasts on "hot topics." Ostankino is starting to prepare  another series on the provincial cities on which, as the saying  goes, Russia stands.    [GOLOS] But what are your personal television plans,  Aleksandr Nikolaevich?    [Yakovlev] I will leave Ostankino after a while. By the  president's edict I, speaking generally, have been appointed  chairman of Gosteleradio (State Television and Radio). Channel  No. 1 is temporary.    This business of holding more than one job will come to an  end, and, along with my colleagues, I will be involved in  issuing broadcast licenses, which will go, I am certain, to the  best programs, films, directors, and journalists.</p>

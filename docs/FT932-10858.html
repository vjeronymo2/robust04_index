			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): Much easier to give it all to one manager - Specialisation / Are the days of balanced fund management over? 'THE days of balanced fund management are over,' pronounced Tim Gardiner, partner at consulting actuaries William M. Fraser and Co, at an actuarial conference last autumn, thus prompting a stormy debate over exactly how pension assets should be invested. Mr Gardiner's remarks were aimed at trustees who had failed to try to link their investment strategy to their liability profile. The average balanced UK pension fund's 80 per cent weighting in equities may be inappropriate for very mature schemes with large current pension obligations and few contributors, he said. The debate has been misinterpreted by some as being about the relative merits of bonds and equities. But among pension trustees, it has encouraged a trend already under way to try to link assets more closely to liabilities. And that, pensions consultants say, has led them to look at moving away from balanced management and into specialist funds. 'We will probably see an uptick in specialist mandates due to asset liability modelling,' said Mr Robert Baker, pensions consultant at William M Mercer and Co. The most recent data available from the US-based research firm, Greenwich Associates, suggests that until now, there has been no great love for specialist fund management in the UK. At the end of 1991, 51 per cent of UK pension funds surveyed used balanced managers exclusively, 14 per cent used specialists exclusively, 30 per cent used both and 5 per cent were managed internally. If funds over Pounds 1bn are counted, specialists are somewhat more popular, used exclusively by 25 per cent of funds with only 32 per cent using balanced management exclusively. Roughly a third use a combination of the two and 11 per cent are managed internally. 'There are still a lot of trustees locked into balanced management. It's much easier to give it all to one manager and instruct him to make the asset allocation decisions for you,' Mr Baker said. 'There is a lot of comfort in being managed in a pool and having its performance measured against the average.' The reluctance of UK pension funds to seek specialist managers is in stark contrast to the US market where they are the norm. Mr Baker said that while many factors could account for the differing attitudes, it is helpful to note the involvement of corporate treasurers in US pension fund operations. Because they are comfortable with more sophisticated financing techniques, they are more willing to take on the responsibility of asset allocation and understand how the use of competing investment styles could add value. Indeed, the willingness of US schemes to award specialist mandates has proved to be a boon to a number of Scottish houses including Ivory and Sime, Murray Johnstone, Martin Currie Fund Managers and Baillie Gifford, who say they are winning so-called EFEA mandates - mandates to invest in Europe and the Far East. But closer to home, interest in specialist fund management has most recently been aroused by the shifting demographics of pension schemes. Waves of redundancies at leading UK corporations have dramatically changed the maturity profile of many pension schemes and some trustees, reviewing recent actuarial valuations, are having to face some unpleasant truths. 'Once you start thinking about asset allocation, you begin to think about specialist management,' said Ms Alison Ramsdale, marketing manager at pension investment consultants Frank Russell, a US-based firm with expertise in analysing specialist management. Ms Ramsdale acknowledges that there has hardly been a headlong rush into specialist management by UK pension funds. 'Balanced managers have a very strong grip on the UK pension fund market and they have no interest in promoting specialist management,' she said. Pension schemes using specialist managers are typically those of the UK subsidiaries of American companies such as IBM and Ford. One UK fund which has is Rolls-Royce. Its investment manager, Mr David Colclough, says the scheme made the switch in 1986 after careful consideration and that the asset-liability mismatch was among their initial concerns. First, he said, the scheme was achieving poor performance out of the three balanced managers it was using. Rolls-Royce could not control the overall asset allocation and as a result, its portfolio had a heavy bias towards fixed income and property and had missed the very hefty gains on equities. Also, the fund managers frequently took sector bets which cancelled each other out, leading to a neutral effect on return and incurring substantial transactions costs in the process. Also, Rolls-Royce found that not all balanced managers are good in all areas. The reporting process for balanced managers allows them to gloss over their weaknesses because results are reported in total, rather than by asset category. Mr Colclough said that in 1986 asset-liability modelling was a relatively crude affair and that it had not been able to build asset allocation decisions on then-available systems. But the process has moved light years ahead recently and with more than 60 per cent of the scheme's members categorised as current or deferred pensioners, modelling plays a significant role in asset allocation. The scheme has 50 per cent of its assets in UK equities, half of that in an indexed core and 30 per cent of its assets in overseas equities, also split into an indexed core. The scheme uses 10 foreign managers because it has found they typically perform better than UK managers do in those markets. Ms Ramsdale said that Frank Russell's own research shows that in US markets, local managers do indeed outperform UK managers, although domestic managers as a rule do not necessarily outperform foreigners. Japan is the only other country where domestic managers have the distinct edge over foreigners. But even in their home markets, fund managers report much more interest from pension funds in their specialist products, particularly 'plain vanilla' UK equity pools. Mercury Asset Management, for instance, reports that its UK specialist business is among its fastest growing, having started from almost nil three years ago.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: One Step Beyond - Theatre The pop group Madness (1977-85) spawned a clutch of unusual and very British dance songs. Now, in these retrospective times, the Theatre Royal Stratford East has produced a show ingeniously based on their songs. It is a comedy revue about homelessness, written by Alan Gilbey. While the subject is strong and the performances gutsy, the plot is weak. It follows the fortunes of two homeless people: Squirrel, 'the nuttiest boy in town' and Stoker, a post-gothic woman selling 'The Big Issue' outside Camden Town Underground. They decide to house the homeless in the Ideal Home Exhibition, where they find a homeless wine salesman camping out at his Gewurztraminer stand, but the party ends when the police arrive. There is even a Strangeways rooftop retrospective. The levity of the music balances the gravity of the message, not always clear, about the need for concerted collective action to help the homeless. Anyone who has worked in a shelter in the UK or US will know that the homeless do not arrive there by choice, and that they are different in degree rather than kind from those with homes and jobs. Gilbey's succeeds in giving each nameless face a personal story, making the matter personal. Madness's songs, particularly the Grammy-winner 'Our House', shape the action and provide a light, accessible medium for comments and statistics about community care and the young homeless 'in a world that trips you up and blames you for falling.' However, the jokes have an edge. One beggar pleads, 'I'm in community care, and you are that community'; another delivers a four-minute guide to sleeping rough, constantly interrupted by TV documentary teams; and there is a vicious fashion show, all sleeping-bags and cardboard, in the Ideal Home Exhibition. Jeff Teare's direction keeps the action flowing through Jenny Tiramani's excellent Camden Tube and Ideal Home set, but the show still needs to be cut. The principals, Paul Kissaun as Squirrel and Sophie Lawrence as Stoker, give a fizzy, energetic performance; around them, Alan Cowan and Adam Price are particularly versatile in other parts.

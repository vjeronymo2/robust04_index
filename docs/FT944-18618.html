			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): London West End Jeremy Sams is winning a reputation as the rising Renaissance man of British theatre. He writes music (see 'Arcadia'). He translates the recent 'Les Enfants Terribles' and English National Opera's revival of 'The Magic Flute'). And he directs. His recent staging (and adaptation) of the Chabrier opera 'Le Roi malgre lui' has just entered Opera North repertory; his staging of 'Neville's Island', by Tim Firth, was a hit at the Nottingham Playhouse this January and opens at the Apollo Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, tonight. Quite a range for a man who only began directing in 1992.</p>

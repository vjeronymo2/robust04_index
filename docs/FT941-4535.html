			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: US pressure on BP Weakness of oil issues in the US on Tuesday night and in early New York trading yesterday caused further tremors in the UK majors, where British Petroleum dropped 9 1/2 to 353 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 11m shares. Much of the selling, dealers said, emanated from the US and followed the recent steep fall in Atlantic Richfield, regarded by oil specialists as the leading Alaskan oil play. Dealers added that the market was increasingly concerned over profitability in the Alaskan oil fields. 'Every Dollars 1 fall in the oil price reduces BP's earnings from Alaska by Pounds 100m,' said a Nomura oil analyst. Shell gave up 2 1/2 at 696 1/2 p, unsettled by weakness in international oil shares, while Burmah Castrol fell 7 to 811p. Enterprise Oil held at 420p in spite of being included in a sizeable sell programme yesterday and ahead of this morning's preliminary results. The market has been rife for some months with stories that Enterprise may be about to chop its dividend payment, but analysts insist the company will maintain the payment. Talk of a sizeable rights issue is also seen as wide of the mark, according to dealers. ICI rose 18 to 767p in response to a press interview with Sir Denys Henderson, the company's chief executive, and broad stock market support. Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation on the shares, and dealers said both SG Warburg and Goldman Sachs were bidding for stock. Euro Disney improved 15 to 405p, reflecting a sharp gain in the French-traded stock. A press report that the troubled theme park had agreed a restructuring with banks and the Walt Disney parent company prompted dealers to cover short positions. Standard Chartered, one of the market's most volatile stocks in recent weeks, lived up to its reputation, the shares racing ahead immediately following the bank's preliminary results and the proposed share split and then retreating to close sharply down on balance after the post-results meeting with analysts. The bank's profits were in the middle of the market range, but the dividend was at the top of expectations, while there was good news in the form of a four-for-one share split. The good news saw Standard shares pushed up to 1208p before closer analysis prompted a sell-off down to 1117p. They closed 37 off at 1143p on turnover of 4.7m. Specialists said the market was unsettled by implied growth of only 15 per cent in the dividend, against similar prospects for other banks. Profits estimates for 1994 were hoisted to around Pounds 500m. Barclays tumbled 10 to 502p on keen turnover of 5.9m, with some traders deciding that the shares were too high relative to the sector and ahead of this morning's preliminary results. National Westminster fell 17 to 467p on 8.6m traded and Lloyds 14 to 567p. Merchant banks retreated in the wake of Schroders, which confirmed recent market speculation by being dropped from the FT-SE 100 Index; the non-voters lost 40 at 1053p. Fears of big provisions with the figures on March 17 hit United Biscuits, which lost 3 1/2 at 335p. Analysts are worried that it could have to find some Pounds 50m for restructuring at Keebler, its US arm. An unwanted line of stock hanging over Unilever saw the shares slip 19 1/2 to 1088 1/2 p. Rolls-Royce put on 4 1/2 at 181p ahead of today's figures, with Henderson Crosthwaite reported to have been a keen buyer. Also reporting today is TI Group, up 8 at 434p. Engineering group T&amp;N recorded its second highest daily turnover - 16m shares - following the release of full-year figures in line with market forecasts. The shares closed 2 easier at 245p.</p>

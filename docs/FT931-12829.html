			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carlton chief gets 84% pay increase MR MICHAEL Green, chair-man of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and media services group, received a pay rise of 84 per cent last year taking his total remuneration to Pounds 520,000. The rise came at a time when Mr John Major, the prime minister, has been urging senior executives to show restraint on pay. Mr Green received a rise of Pounds 122,000 on his basic pay, taking it to Pounds 400,000. A further bonus of Pounds 120,000 was linked to a 16 per cent increase in Carlton's earnings per share under an incentive scheme. The pay rise was made by a remuneration committee chaired by Lord Sharp, the former Cable and Wireless chief, and whose other members are Mr Nigel Wray, a non-executive director, and Mr Green himself. Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ and a non-executive director of Carlton, will join the committee next month. A review of Mr Green's salary, supported by outside consultants, concluded that 'the chairman's salary failed to recognise the significant contribution that he makes to the company, the progress the company has made in the last year and the market level of remuneration of a person of his status within the company.' In the year to September 1992 turnover at Carlton increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 701.6m, pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 102.3m and earnings per share by 16 per cent to 34.2p. The average pay and bonus package for the chairman of a FT-SE 100 company is about Pounds 400,000 with total packages ranging from Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 6.2m. Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, received a one-off bonus of Pounds 250,000 'for his services relating to the company's broadcasting interests.' The sum almost certainly relates to Carlton's victory over Thames Television in the competitive tenders for new franchises and for preparing the company for going on air. The bonus took Mr Walmsley's salary for the year to more than Pounds 490,000. Five directors were awarded options over 341,000 shares during the 1992 financial year.</p>

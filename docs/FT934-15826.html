This was achieved on a greater turnover of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.8m). However the company said the return on sales had been diluted as the result of a large amount of low margin business. The result, which followed a recovery from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 832,000 in 1992, left the share price 8p lower at 58p.

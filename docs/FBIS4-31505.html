			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eszter Szaloky] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday Ferenc Madl, minister of culture and  public education, is scheduled to sign an agreement on the  long-term financing of religious schools by the state with  institutions which were so far unable to come to an agreement  with local governments.    In reply to NEPSZAVA's question, the minister stated that  this measure concerned more than 100 schools. As is well known,  based on the terms of this contract the government would  undertake to finance religious schools for 20 years, in spite of  the fact that local governments as well as the parties protested  the planned transaction. The deal has been called a  renationalization of the schools, which is contrary to the  spirit of the law on public education, namely, to the intention  of decentralizing public education. As Gabor Horn, education  specialist of the Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], put it,  if these contracts go into effect, religious institutions will  give up their schools themselves. After all, this contract will  turn religious schools into public schools.    Assessing the past four years of the portfolio, the minister  called the new, 1993 law on public education an outstanding  accomplishment. At the press briefing presenting his evaluation  he added: The national basic curriculum was completed after much  superfluous discussion which did not contribute to the  portfolio's reputation. As the greatest accomplishment  concerning higher education, the minister emphasized the  autonomy of institutions.    According to information available to us, the program for  the  Renewal of the Profession of Educators [PSZM] did not receive a  penny of the 82 million forints which were allocated to it from  the budget. This money is intended for the establishment and  development of county regional educational centers. Concerning  these, Ferenc Madl told NEPSZAVA that the restoration of the  PSZM program is under way, but this does not mean that it will  be abolished. The board of trustees which used to be headed by  Jozsef Zsolnai was dissolved only in form. The minister said he  considered it conceivable that by the time the contractual  obligations of PSZM are fulfilled, a different crew, of similar  composition than the previous one, can take over this program.</p>

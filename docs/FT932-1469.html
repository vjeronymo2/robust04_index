			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rothmans plan surprises THE MARKET was enlivened minutes before the close by an announcement from tobacco group Rothmans International which sent the company's shares racing forward in hectic trading. Rothmans is in talks with Richemont Securities and Dunhill Holdings about a reorganisation of assets to create two new quoted groups to focus separately on tobacco and luxury goods. The announcement took dealers by surprise. Rothmans shares forged ahead 55 to 720p in frantic trading which caused a backwardation - a brief period when the bid and offer prices are temporarily reversed - in the process. Volume in the tightly held stock jumped to 3.6m, with more business done after the official close.</p>

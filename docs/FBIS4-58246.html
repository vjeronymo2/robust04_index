			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The 1 May editions of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ  and Tel Aviv HATZOFE, both in Hebrew, carry contrasting  editorials on the agreement signed in Cairo on 28 April.    The 800-word editorial on page B1 of HA'ARETZ, entitled  "Removing the Obstacles," attributes the Cairo agreement "mainly  to the prime minister's decision that the time has come to put  an end to the recurring complications." The editorial goes on  to say that it will be "impossible to divest the autonomy of its  symbols," such as passports and stamps, "when it is applied to  all the occupied territories, and the self-rule is bound to be  recognized as a stage en route to full Palestinian independence."    Referring to the economic agreement signed in Paris on 29  April, the editorial notes that "it reflects the premise that  the State of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule have a de  facto equal standing."    The editorial concludes: None of the agreements should be  seen as undermining Israel. Rather, they are a vehicle that  will result in a stronger Israel. Nothing can fortify its  security better than peace with the Palestinians and the Arab  countries."    The 1,100-word page 2 HATZOFE editorial, entitled "The  Document of Capitulation," states: "Israel has surrendered  every principle to which it adhered in the course of the  protracted talks with the PLO." "Only a blind man can still  insist that the agreement deals with `autonomy' in the spirit of  the `Camp David' accords. No one with eyes in his head can  ignore the government's policy of capitulation. Not only is  this policy incapable of promoting peace in the region, on the  contrary, there is every sign that we are witnessing the  establishment of `a terrorist state' that will permanently  threaten Israel's well-being and security."    HATZOFE maintains that in view of the agreement, "it is  one's  duty to rally in a bid to prevent at the last moment the  disgraceful capitulation which has no equal anywhere in the  world." "Since the `capitulation agreement' contravenes the  Oslo agreement, the prime minister is duty bound to submit the  document again for the Knesset's approval. He must present both  the open and clandestine documents, to enable the people's  representatives to judge whether they support the capitulation  agreement.    "And as is well known, the majority of the Knesset members  do  not support the establishment of a Palestinian-PLO state in  Eretz Yisra'el. The Jewish majority opposes capitulation."    The editorial further argues: "The forced Knesset majority  supposedly supporting the left-wing government represents a  popular minority. Therefore, the government has no mandate to  decide on issues fateful for the people and the State of Israel.    "And if the prime minister does not understand this, the  people must bravely make themselves heard, in order to force  Rabin to resign and to make way for a national Jewish government  capable of safeguarding the Jewish people's right to Eretz  Yisra'el and of protecting the well-being and security of the  State of Israel.    "The perils, as we said, are great. We must not keep silent.  Everything must be done to prevent the signing of the `agreement  of capitulation' to the PLO.    It is time to act!"</p>

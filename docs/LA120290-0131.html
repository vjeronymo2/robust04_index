			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PLANS TO SEEK CUTS IN SAFETY NET FOR BANKS;  </P> <P> FINANCE: OFFICIAL SAYS THAT UNDER THE PROPOSAL NOT ALL INSTITUTIONS WOULD ENJOY  UNLIMITED DEPOSIT INSURANCE.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration plans to propose radical banking system reforms that  would give regulators more power to allow big banks to fail without blanket  government protection for the institutions or their depositors, a senior  Administration official said Saturday.  </P> <P> The proposal, certain to spark controversy in Congress and banking circles,  would infuse greater "discipline" into the system by creating uncertainty over  just which banks would be protected beyond the minimum levels required by the  government's deposit insurance program, the official said.  </P> <P> If enacted, the Administration plan would mean that some banks would no longer  automatically receive complete government protection and total depositor  insurance in the event of their failure. As a result, bank managers would be  under greater pressure to follow more prudent business practices, said the  official, who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> "Providing constructive ambiguity is at the heart of it," the official said.  "The problem is that now, all of the ambiguity has been drained out of the  system. We have got to create more uncertainty as to whether regulators will  intervene."  </P> <P> To instill that uncertainty, the official acknowledged, the government will  have to let some institutions fail in order to demonstrate that its new policy  is credible.  </P> <P> The plan, expected to be introduced as part of a legislative package in  January, would represent a dramatic change in federal banking policy.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Washington has pledged virtually automatic support and blanket  protection for the nation's major commercial banks. At those institutions,  federal deposit insurance has been extended well beyond the legal limit of  $100,000 per account, in part to prevent panics and maintain consumer and  investor confidence in the integrity of America's financial system.  </P> <P> But that policy, known in the industry as the "too-big-to-fail" doctrine, has  come under mounting criticism for contributing to a growing crisis in the  banking system. The doctrine has, in effect, given bankers an incentive to  engage in risky practices, while remaining secure in the knowledge that the  government will bail them out if they get into trouble.  </P> <P> Under the Administration proposal, at least in theory, size would no longer  provide protection against failure.  </P> <P> "We've got to address 'too big to fail,' otherwise we can't have a real reform  package," the Administration official said.  </P> <P> The apparent willingness to abandon the current doctrine comes at a time when  the economy is sliding into a recession and the health of the banking industry  appears more at risk than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  </P> <P> Although the commercial banking system is in better shape than the  scandal-plagued savings and loan industry, many banks have been forced to take  losses on real estate loans and the government's deposit insurance fund has  dwindled to a dangerously low level.  </P> <P> In fact, the timing of the proposal would seem to pose grave risks for the  Administration, and might lead to charges that the White House is not living up  to its responsibility to protect the soundness of the financial system.  </P> <P> The proposal to do away with the too-big-to-fail-doctrine represents just one  component of a sweeping reform package now being prepared by the Treasury  Department and the White House, following a legislative mandate ordering the  Administration to propose reforms of the nation's deposit insurance system.  </P> <P> The Administration official indicated that a final deposit insurance proposal  has not been worked out. Several alternatives are now under study, including a  plan to limit the number of insured accounts held by any one individual to  three.  </P> <P> "We are still looking at a bunch of options on deposit insurance, but we want  to shrink it back to its original purpose, which was protecting small savers,  letting them sleep at night," the official said.  </P> <P> The overall package, as currently envisioned, would involve much more than a  simple reform of deposit insurance, with the Administration apparently poised  to push for a fundamental change in the structure of the commercial banking  industry.  </P> <P> "The Administration feels strongly that issues of deposit insurance reform,  that is, the extent and character of the safety net, are so closely intertwined  with questions of reform of the industry's structure, that it makes no sense to  treat them separately," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Friday in a  speech in Florida.  </P> <P> To address those concerns, the Administration plans to propose full interstate  banking for the first time in the nation's history, in an effort to spur a  massive consolidation among banks that, the Administration hopes, would winnow  out the weakest institutions. Administration officials note that the United  States has far more independent banks than any other country in the world, and  they contend the system should shrink to become more efficient.  </P> <P> But that plan will almost certainly draw fire from smaller banks, who fear they  will be swallowed up by the nation's largest institutions.  </P> <P> The Administration also plans to propose an end to the so-called Glass-Steagall  restrictions, which have prevented commercial banks from engaging in stock  brokerage operations while prohibiting Wall Street firms from entering the  banking business.  </P> <P> The Administration plan would allow bank holding companies to set up  subsidiaries separate from their commercial banking units that could enter the  securities business, as long as they did so with funds that were not federally  insured.  </P> <P> While that proposal might increase the risks being faced by banking firms, the  senior Administration official said that the proposal would provide for  creation of "fire-walls" designed to prevent financial problems in securities  trading operations from harming the commercial banking side of the business.  </P></p>

The increase is to take  into account the possibility of a large shortfall in tax revenue  and a widening gap with the fees of private universities,  ministry officials said Wednesday [9 February].    The ministry intends to apply the new fees to those who  enter  state universities in April 1995. The plan, if approved, would  be incorporated into its budget proposal for fiscal 1994, which  starts in April.    The fees of state-owned universities were hiked in fiscal  1991 and 1993 by 36,000 yen each.    Private universities have raised fees almost every year,  with  average fees for students majoring in liberal arts standing at  587,900 yen a year, those majoring in engineering at 787,900 yen  and those majoring in medicine at 2,444,700 yen.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Mark Thatcher revelations seen as 'plot' Allegations of impropriety appeared to be taking a toll on the government yesterday, as a senior backbench MP blamed disclosures about Mr Mark Thatcher's role in arms sales on a plot against the Conservatives. Baroness Thatcher, who arrived at the conference yesterday morning, refused to comment on claims that her son received a commission for helping to set up the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia. But Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbench MPs, said the timing of the disclosures on the eve of the party conference suggested that the intention was 'to undermine the government'. Sir Marcus, the most senior Conservative backbencher, told BBC Radio: 'I see in all this a plot.' He asked: 'Is it just coincidence that as soon as we arrive for our party conference . . . something breaks?' Baroness Thatcher, who was given a warm but muted welcome by conference delegates, was lavishly praised by Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, after emerging from 40 minutes of talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister. Smiling grimly, Lady Thatcher waved for the cameras, but refused to answer journalists' questions. Later, guests at a private lunch said she appeared frail, but adroitly sidestepped questions on the Al Yamamah affair. Lady Thatcher later left for a visit to the US. Party managers sought to play down the allegations, but Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, admitted they were hurting the party even though they were inaccurate. 'I know there is this miasma around. I believe it is unfair in that it is not based on real fact and I believe that the party must shake itself free of all that,' he said. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, who left for a visit to the Gulf Co-operation Council in Kuwait last night, said the controversy was unlikely to be raised by Arab ministers. Mr David Hunt, the public service minister, also sought to play down the affair. He said the government would not be deflected from the main purpose of the conference. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, said that he had no recollection of Mr Mark Thatcher's name being mentioned in the context of the Al Yamamah deal. 'There was no question of any impropriety being suggested in relation to Mark Thatcher or anybody else,' he said on BBC Radio. Mr Alan Clark, a former trade and defence minister, said he was 'quite certain' that Lady Thatcher would never have allowed her son 'to talk to her about a deal or to influence the way it was structured'. Labour continued to issue allegations against Mr Thatcher. Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, wrote to Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, asking whether Mr Thatcher and a Saudi middleman had paid tax on commissions earned from the arms deal.</p>

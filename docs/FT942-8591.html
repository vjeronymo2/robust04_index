			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar under pressure The dollar finished lower on the foreign exchanges yesterday as investors took profits after the US Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on Tuesday, writes Philip Gawith. It was a classic case, said dealers, of the old stock market adage of 'buy the rumour and sell the fact' or, in the words of one wag, 'buy the mystery, sell the history'. The US currency ended in London at DM1.6596, down from its Tuesday close of DM1.6683, before the rate increases. Against the yen it finished at Y103.665 from Y104.380. In New York it closed at DM1.6567 and Y103.50. While the dollar's response was seen as disappointing, analysts said it had been so widely expected that it was discounted in the market. Elsewhere, the Bundesbank surprised observers by cutting the repo rate by 12 basis points to 5.23 per cent - the second week in succession that it has cut by more than the market was expecting. Sterling finished easier at DM2.5002 from DM2.5095, weighed down by the weaker dollar and comments in the UK monthly monetary minutes. While few observers had expected the dollar to rally immediately upon higher rates, the tepid response did leave the market wondering what was required for the US currency to appreciate. The dollar is now at the same level against the D-Mark, and only Y2 firmer, compared to its position at the end of April. In the interim, it has enjoyed the support of concerted central bank intervention, a 50 basis-point fall in official German rates, and a similar margin rise in US rates. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that over the past 25 years the dollar has weakened three out of the four times that the Fed has embarked on a path of sustained monetary tightening. While fear of renewed central bank intervention is probably limiting the downside, there are still analysts pred-icting that the dollar will test the Y100 level. The fundamentals underlying this position have been clearly laid out by Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. He notes that during the first quarter of 1994, Japan's surplus on the current and portfolio capital accounts equalled Y9.1trillion, double the equivalent 1993 figure. The effect, says Mr Weinberg, was to 'reduce the supply of yen in the world by Y9.1trillion, or roughly Dollars 84.3bn. In Economics 101, we teach that a reduced supply of a commodity leads to a run-up in its price.' Mr Weinberg predicts that these flows will continue, and therefore that the yen must appreciate. 'The Fed cannot avert yen appreciation,' he concludes. The dollar also failed to gain any support from the sharp fall in the German repo rate. Even the bulls were surprised by the extent of the cut. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said if the bank were to only cut at an average five basis points per week in the weeks ahead, it would have to consider reducing the discount rate again before its July summer recess. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said the Bundesbank was giving markets what they wanted, but in a slightly novel fashion. In the past the central bank has often used fixed rate repos to take rates quickly lower. This time it was following a more 'stepped' approach, preferring variable repos. German call money rates eased to 5.30/5.40 per cent, from 5.40/5.45 per cent, after the repo cut. The D-Mark was barely changed in Europe, in spite of the repo, ending unaltered against the French franc at FFr3.426, and a shade firmer against the Italian lira at L956.8 from L956.6. Greek interest rates stayed high to protect the drachma. The Greek currency was under pressure yesterday morning, with dealers reporting heavy orders for the D-Mark, driving the currency up to about Dr148.57/62 from the opening Dr148.25/32. The one month Athens Interbank Offered Rate (ATHIBOR) jumped to 121.36, from 77.69 on Tuesday. The National Bank of Greece raised bids to 60 per cent for overnight to one week deals, and 50 per cent for two weeks to one month, both up from 35 per cent. Markets believe that the high rates are unsustainable, but government spokesmen have ruled out a devaluation. Sterling showed little response to the plethora of economic data released. But analysts said comments in the monthly monetary minutes, suggesting that rate cuts might not be out of the question, caused a slight weakening. The futures market fastened on to the 4 per cent year-on-year growth in average earnings for March, and this caused a minor sell-off. The December Eurosterling contract finished at 93.91, from 93.96. Volumes were strong in the September and December contracts. In the money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 20m. Earlier it had injected Pounds 491m liquidity on forecasting a Pounds 700m shortage.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BUS OF DREAMS BY MARY MORRIS (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> A collection of competent but uninvolving stories reprinted from various  magazines.  </P> <P> Mary Morris can put words together in ways that suggest a character or set a  mood, but these brief vignettes involving alcoholic fathers, quarreling  families and unhappy lovers lack a distinguishing voice. The stories seem  vaguely familiar, as if the reader had skimmed them in the dentist's waiting  room a few weeks earlier. If such a thing as generic fiction exists, Morris has  pioneered it.  </P></p>

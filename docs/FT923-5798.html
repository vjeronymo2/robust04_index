			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel urges accord over Gatt differences MR ARTHUR DUNKEL, director-general of the 104-member General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), has again called on those nations blocking conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks to settle their differences so that 'results from which every trading nation will gain' can be speedily implemented. The six-year-old round has been stalled since last spring by the failure of the US and the European Community to reach an accord on cutting farm subsidies. In his introduction to the world trade body's annual report, Gatt activities 1991, published today, Mr Dunkel says the draft agreements which are already on the table from the Uruguay Round negotiations are 'relevant, precise, balanced and urgently needed answers to some of the biggest economic challenges of the day.' The round, the most ambitious ever attempted, would reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, strengthen Gatt rules, extend them for the first time to textiles and agriculture, and devise new international rules for trade in services and intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast to most international negotiations, the round's ambitions have risen rather than fallen, over time, Mr Dunkel says, citing examples where negotiators have gone well beyond the original objectives. The report itself draws attention to the sharp drop in growth rates of world output and trade since 1988, to which uncertainty over future trading rules has contributed. It also notes increasing reluctance of countries to implement in full the judgments of Gatt disputes panels, often on the grounds that this must await the round's conclusion. 'The keys to a conclusion are held in a very few hands,' Mr Dunkel says in his introduction, without naming names. Trade officials said yesterday that talks on farm trade between the US and EC were expected to shift into high gear once the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20 was out of the way. The two sides must reach agreement before the end of the year if the Uruguay Round package is to be finalised in time to meet the March 1993 deadline for expiry of the US administration's 'fast-track' negotiating authority. Both Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr James Baker, now President Bush's chief of staff, have recently stressed the importance of finishing the round. US officials said yesterday they did not think the upcoming presidential election would inhibit the negotiations. Mr Dunkel has already begun to take soundings to ensure that if and when the bilateral deal is reached the round can be swiftly concluded between all 108 participants. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FIRE UP ANTI-SMOKING DRIVE AT STADIUM  </P> <P> At this weekend's San Diego Chargers-San Francisco 49ers football game, a  coalition of community groups plans to officially kick off its anti-smoking  campaign by taking a swipe at a popular tobacco industry symbol.  </P> <P> The alliance of more than 30 organizations, known as the Tobacco Control  Coalition, will display its logo, in fireworks, during a display after the game  -- directly above a huge stadium sign advertising Marlboro cigarettes, a  spokesman announced at a press conference Thursday.  </P> <P> "That logo will be displayed right over the top of the Marlboro man," said  David Burns, the coalition's chairman.  </P> <P> It will be the first step in a local drive that will encompass a greater scope  than other anti-smoking movements, Burns said.  </P> <P> Rather than simply educating people about the health hazards of smoking, Burns  said, the groups will attack media images and societal attitudes associated  with the habit.  </P> <P> Segments of the community will be targeted that statistically are more likely  to start smoking -- such as children and some ethnic minorities -- or that are  particularly susceptible to harm from cigarette smoke, such as pregnant women,  said William Cox, director of the county's Health Services Department.  </P> <P> The "tobacco-free" coalition includes the local chapters of the American Cancer  Society, American Heart Assn., American Lung Assn. and the county's health and  education departments.  </P> <P> "Smoking is part of the way we cope with stress," Burns said. "It's part of the  way that we interact with one another. . . . What will happen is that we will  go after tobacco on a broad front."  </P> <P> As spectators arrive at Saturday's game, they will receive an anti-smoking  pledge card and bumper sticker, Cox said.  </P> <P> The coalition's members hope people will sign the pledge cards and turn them in  at the stadium's gates -- an act that could be the first step toward quitting,  Cox said.  </P> <P> Also, several hundred children who attended anti-smoking educational programs  in the community will attend the game as guests of the health services  department, Cox said.  </P> <P> Funding for the anti-smoking campaign, which totals about $8 million, will come  from state cigarette tax revenues, Cox said.  </P></p>

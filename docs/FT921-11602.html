			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates edge down UK MONEY market conditions were easier again yesterday, as the heavy taxation payments which drained funds from the financial system earlier in the month subsided, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of just Pounds 100m early in the session, revised up to Pounds 200m later but very low compared with daily shortages of over Pounds 1bn for most of the year to date. The main factor yesterday was maturing assistance, draining Pounds 678m from the market. However, Exchequer transactions added Pounds 690m. There was no clamour for funds in the slacker market conditions and the Bank of England refrained from early assistance. Later in the morning it purchased Pounds 40m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance amounted to Pounds 10m, bringing the total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 50m, which was Pounds 150m less than the forecast shortage. The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at around 11 per cent for most of the day and it finished at 10 7/8 - 5/8 per cent. Longer rates were also little changed. Three months inter-bank funds traded at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent, slightly easier than the 10- 9/16 per cent seen on Tuesday. One month interbank money was 10- 5/8 per cent, also a touch easier. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.81, virtually unaltered, implying base lending rates of 10.19 per cent by the spring. In Frankfurt, call money rates moved higher again, continuing the trend set earlier in the week. Call money touched 9.70 per cent but settled at around 9.60/70 per cent for most of the day. The Bundesbank again used special powers to transfer funds held on deposit for the public sector to commercial banks. Similar action was taken on Tuesday and last Friday as the authorities attempted to hold down rates. Pension payments are draining cash from the market this week and putting upward pressure on rates. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan injected Y900bn funds in the face of a Y1,000bn liquidity shortage. As a result call money traded up to 5 3/4 per cent, from 5 9/16 on Tuesday. Three months certificates of deposit traded at around 5.10 per cent, climbing from the 4.95 per cent seen at the end of last week.</p>

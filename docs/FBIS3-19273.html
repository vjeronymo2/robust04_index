			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "New Poll: Forty-Five Percent </F> of Finns Support EU Membership"]    [Text] Almost half, or 45 percent, of Finns favor joining  the European Union (EU), according to a poll taken after  conclusion of accession talks last Tuesday [1 March]. According  to the poll results announced on Finnish Broadcasting Company's  TV news program, 27 percent of respondents opposed membership.  Another 27 percent were in the "don't know" category.    Commissioned by Television News, the poll was conducted by  Taloustutkimous OY last Wednesday -- or the day after the  accession talks were concluded. Some 1,000 Finns were asked  whether Finland should join the EU, based on the outcome of the  negotiations.    The margin of error for the poll is in the 3-percent range.    According to the poll, the typical supporter of membership  is  engaged in intellectual work [henkinen tyo] and is in a  leadership positions. He is a resident of Uusimaa province and  under 40 years old.    In contrast, the typical opponent is a rural area farmer or  worker, most often retired, living in the northern or  southwestern areas of the country, or in Hame province.    It was found that deciding on a position regarding the EU is  extremely difficult for pensioners.    Regarding specifically the outcome of Finland's  negotiations,  1 percent saw the results as "excellent," 41 percent as  "satisfactory," and 12 percent as "poor."    Television News intends to follow opinion trends about once  a  month until the referendum this fall.</p>

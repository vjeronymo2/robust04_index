			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Securities  Dealers Association said Monday it would be favorably disposed  if three unlisted Hyundai Group companies reapplied for  registration on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, a signal that  the government has begun lifting financial restrictions on the  group.    The three firms -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai  Elevator  and Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development -- will submit  their reapplications by Monday at the earliest, Hyundai  officials said.    The three applied for OTC market registration in March 1992  and again in October 1993 but were turned down each time. They  have not reapplied since, the association said.    The Hyundai Group has had "uncomfortable relations" with the  government and been subjected to financial restrictions in  connection with honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run in the  1992 presidential election.    If the lifting of financial restrictions is confirmed,  Hyundai will also apply for long-term loans from the Korea  Development Bank, for floating foreign exchange-denominated  securities overseas, and for listing of two unlisted firms --  Hyundai Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development -- on  the stock exchange to reactivate its investment plan for this  year, an official said.    Because of the trouble it has faced raising funds, Hyundai  has had to kill or put off some projects envisaged under the  investment plan scaled at 4.5 trillion won (5.6 billion U.S.  dollars) for 1994.    Among the projects scrapped or deferred were construction of  two new automobile factories by Hyundai Motor, completion of a  new 16-M DRAM assembly line by Hyundai Electronics, and  construction of a 1.5-million-ton-class dock and facilities  producing 3,000-megawatt-class generators and turbines by  Hyundai Heavy Industries.</p>

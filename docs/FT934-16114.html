			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Evidence links Hani case trio THE BLACK maid employed by two of the white right-wingers accused of murdering Mr Chris Hani, South African communist leader, gave evidence yesterday linking the two to the alleged killer, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Ms Elizabeth Motshwane told the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg that Polish-born Mr Janusz Waluz, alleged to have killed Mr Hani with four shots on April 10, visited the home of Mr Clive and Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis four days before the murder. 'I saw Waluz seated in the sitting room. . . he was holding a fire-arm in his right hand, pointing downwards,' Ms Motshwane said, adding that Mr Waluz had breakfast with her employers that day. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Hani, which plunged South Africa into one of its worst political crises since President F W de Klerk began dismantling apartheid in February 1990.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Economy faces severe test as turmoil grows: Daily oil output is down at least 20% and Nigeria's debt arrears have risen to Dollars 7bn The month-long strike in Nigeria's oil industry threatens the vital source of revenue which until now has saved the national economy from collapse. Although foreign exchange restrictions since January have sharply depressed the non-oil sector, oil production has remained strong this year, near an all-time peak of 2m barrels a day. This provides more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's exports and over 81 per cent of forecast government revenue. This mainstay of the economy is at risk from the political crisis leading up to today's general strike. The anti-government action by the oil workers' unions has already cut daily production by at least 20 per cent. Nigeria's 1994 budget was based on oil production of 1.9m b/d and an average price of Dollars 14 a barrel. Around 300,000 b/d is for domestic refineries, and the rest is exported. Net oil revenue, after the operators' share of the oil and the government's share of operating costs, is just below Dollars 4bn a year, which is less than Nigeria's total debt service obligations. There has been no loss to the government in oil revenue during the first month of the strike as the cut in output has been offset by the sharp jump in the price of oil as traders speculated on fall in supply of Nigeria's high quality light crude oil. If production falls below 1.5m bpd at the current price of Dollars 19 a barrel however, oil export revenue would end up below the budget forecast. The oil companies say production losses are likely to increase if the strike lasts. The multinationals which operate Nigeria's production and exploration joint ventures - 60 per cent owned by the government - are however reticent in talking about the detailed effects of the strike. The security of their staff, their revenue and their relationship with the government are at stake. So far only Anlo-Dutch Shell, the largest operator in Nigeria, has declared that some of its installations have been closed with a loss of at least 400,000 barrels a day. Shell in partnership with the state owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, normally produces about 1m barrels of oil per day, half of Nigeria' oil. Its operations are the most exposed to attack. Nearly all its fields are onshore and are too many to fully protect. Threats of violence and sabotage are taken seriously and the company declined the government's offer of increased armed security forces to help maintain operations. The crisis in the oil industry has come at a time when the country is externally insolvent. Payment arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 28bn external debt stood at Dollars 7bn by April this year, the government's deficit looks set to reach last year's level of 12 per cent of GDP, whilst state regulation of financial markets by an unstable military regime has stopped access to international aid and debt relief. For 1994 Nigeria's government assumed debt relief which it has no prospect of securing, allowing for debt service payments of Dollars 1.8bn, whilst its obligations are Dollars 4.4bn, according to the finance ministry. So far the Paris Club of official creditors, who are owed more than half the debt, have received no payments. Nigeria stopped servicing its debt to the Paris Club in early 1992 and there is no prospect of debt relief since talks with the IMF broke down last year. The government forecast a balanced budget for 1994. Economists say that the official figure of a Dollars 1.3bn deficit by the end of May is probably an under-estimate. They estimate that the flow of non-oil revenue into Nigeria has almost dried up since the budget in January. Non-oil exports, for example, fell from Dollars 16m in January to Dollars 5m in March.

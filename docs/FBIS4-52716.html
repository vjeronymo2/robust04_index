			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The ulterior intention  of the U.S. in declaring nuclear non-proliferation the "basis of  its state diplomacy" is based on its hegemonistic mode of  thinking and is aimed at isolating and stifling the DPRK and  other countries by taking issue with their peaceful nuclear  activities under the pretext of "preventing nuclear  proliferation".    A spokesman of the DPRK Institute of Disarmament and Peace  made the remarks in an interview with KCNA today concerning the  Clinton administration's declaration that nuclear  non-proliferation is the "basis of its state diplomacy."    He told KCNA:    The United States developed nuclear weapons before any other  country and was the first to use them in World War II. With the  beginning of the cold war between the bipolar blocs, the number  of the recognised nuclear-weapon states grew to five.    Each time agreements on limited abolition of nuclear weapons  were signed, mankind watched them with hopes for the future of  nuclear disarmament. However, the status of the nuclear-weapon  states is still maintained and public concern is growing over  nuclear arms development in other countries.    International studies estimate that most of the Western  countries have experience in nearly completing the development  of nuclear weapons after World War II and have material and  technological foundations to manufacture nuclear weapons without  much difficulty, once determined.    Especially, the development of nuclear weapons in Japan and  South Korea has gone beyond the limit of international  apprehension and Israel is known to have produced and possess  nuclear weapons.    The United States and some Western countries suspect that  certain countries in the Middle East and South Asia, South  Africa and some countries of South America are engaged in  nuclear development for military purposes, though the suspected  countries contend that their nuclear activities are for peaceful  purposes.    With the emergence of nations of the Commonwealth of  Independent States possessing nuclear weapons after the collapse  of the Soviet Union in recent years, the problem of nuclear  weapons involves many more countries worldwide.    As seen above, the nuclear problem assumes a very wide and  complicated international character. Therefore, international  efforts for nuclear non-proliferation must be directed to  reducing and abolishing the existing nuclear weapons in keeping  with the post-cold war trend, and must be concentrated on  preventing the nuclear activities of those countries that  actually intend to develop nuclear weapons and have enough  potentials for this.    On the contrary, the United States is continuously promoting  the modernisation of its own nuclear weapons and conniving at  the dangerous nuclear gamble of its allies or some other  countries, while throwing doubt upon the peaceful nuclear  activities of the DPRK and other countries that go against the  grain with it and even calling for "sanctions" against them.    At the meeting of the disarmament commission of the United  Nations which ended on May 7, many developing countries charged  that the nuclear-weapon states had not stopped the production  and modernisation of nuclear weapons while paying attention only  to nuclear non-proliferation rather than to nuclear arms  cutback. On the other hand, the United States and other Western  countries busied themselves laying stress on strengthening the  "nuclear non- proliferation system" and enhancing the "role of  the U.N. Security Council" in such a manner as to increase  pressure and sanctions. This shows the unfair attitude of the  United States toward nuclear disarmament.    The United States' double standard regarding the nuclear  issue and its sinister political intention result in concealing  and encouraging the nuclear ambitions of many countries.    While the United States is resorting to a fruitless campaign  over the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities, the development of  nuclear weapons in some countries has reached a more dangerous  line under its shade. This will have a grave irrevocable impact  on the international nuclear non- proliferation system in the  future.    If the United States renounces its hostile policy toward the  DPRK and takes the position of respecting its independence and  carrying out the steps of joint action, the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula will be settled smoothly and equitably. This  will mean a contribution to international nuclear  non-proliferation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rationale for Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 111(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator is required to publish, and periodically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update, a list of source categories that in his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgement cause, or contribute significantly to, air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health or welfare. This list appears in 40 CFR 60.16  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ranks, in order of priority for standards development,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various source categories in terms of quantities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide pollutant emission, the mobility and competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of each source category, and the extent to which each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant endangers public health and welfare. The priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list reflects the Administrator's determination that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from the listed source categories contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, and it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to identify major source categories for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of performance are to be promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The priority list ranks the SOCMI source category first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of 59 listed source categories. For regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes, the SOCMI category was divided into the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segments: SOCMI unit processes; volatile organic liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VOL) storage vessels and handling equipment; SOCMI fugitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources; and SOCMI wastewater sources. Standards have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for the other three groups of SOCMI sources; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSPS proposes standards for the fourth and final category of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This division of the source category on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar types of emission sources and applicable emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control techniques was chosen over a more traditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach for NSPS that involves the development of standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to each specific chemical process. The selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach is more resource efficient than the chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process approach because a large number of specific chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes can be covered by one regulation. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI plants contain similar wastewater emission sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarities in the behavior of wastewater emission sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in SOCMI allow the same control techniques to be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the processes. Therefore, because the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques can be applied to the entire industry group and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because regulating the entire group would be more resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient, a single regulation is being proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling wastewater emissions from the SOCMI source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SOCMI is a large and diverse industry producing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several thousand intermediate and end-product chemicals from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a small number of basic chemicals. Most of the chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced by this industry fall under standard industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification code 286.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, a SOCMI process unit is defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as one producing or using one or more of the chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in the regulation. The list of chemicals proposed is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an inclusive list that was derived from several sources that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also formed the basis for the initial list of chemicals used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to characterize SOCMI process units in the HON (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of the HON BID, EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;92&hyph;016). The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are the basis for the composite list of chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the proposed NSPS: (1) ``Industrial Organic Chemical Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trees,'' EPA/ORD, October 1992; (2) Standards of Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Equipment Leaks of VOC in SOCMI, 40 CFR part 60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart VV; (3) Proposed Standards of Performance for SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reactor Processes, 55 FR 26953, June 29, 1990; (4) Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Performance for SOCMI Distillation Operations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN; and (5) Standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance for SOCMI Air Oxidation Processes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60, subpart III. Therefore, the proposed list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a compilation of all the chemicals in these databases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to characterize the SOCMI process units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selection of Emission Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several emission sources associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI processes (e.g., process vents, product storage and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer operations, and equipment leaks); however, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSPS is directed toward the control of VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater generated by SOCMI process units. This includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from wastewater collection and treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. Wastewater streams that contain organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds are generated at SOCMI process units by one of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms, either direct contact of water with organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds or by contamination of indirect contact water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through equipment leaks in chemical processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water may come in direct contact with organic compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a variety of different chemical processing steps,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus generating wastewater streams (referred to as ``process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater'') that must be discharged for treatment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal. Direct contact wastewater includes water used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wash impurities from organic compound products or reactants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water used to cool or quench organic compound vapor streams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensed steam from jet educator systems pulling vacuum on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels containing organic compounds, water from raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and product storage tanks, water used as a carrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for catalysts and neutralizing agents (e.g., caustic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solutions), and water formed as a byproduct during chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactions. Direct contact wastewater is also generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within SOCMI process units when water is used in equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washes and spill cleanups; this wastewater (referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``maintenance wastewater'') is typically more variable in flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and concentration than process wastewater streams and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be collected in ways that differ from process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indirect contact wastewater streams are generated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unintentional contact with organic compounds through leaks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in process equipment. For example, indirect contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater may be generated as a result of leaks from heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchangers, condensers, or pumps. These wastewaters also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be collected and treated differently from direct contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

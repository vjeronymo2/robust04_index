			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati met in  Cairo this afternoon on the sidelines of the 11th Non-Aligned  ministerial conference.    Velayati told reporters after the one-hour meeting that the  talks were good and constructive, and that they discussed  bilateral relations and the topics on the agenda of the  non-aligned conference.    He said they also discussed the subjects that will be  brought  before the next meeting in Damascus attended by Syria, Turkey  and Iran at the end of July concerning the situation in northern  Iraq.    Velayati said he will meet with his Kuwaiti counterpart  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and will take part in the  meeting of the liaison group of the Islamic Conference  Organization on Bosnia.    For his part, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said  after the meeting that he and Velayati discussed bilateral  relations and a number of issues of mutual concern. He  described the Syrian-Iranian relations as cordial and said the  two countries are exchanging views.    Al-Shar' said it is intended to hold a summit meeting among  the presidents of Syria, Turkey, and Iran in Damascus in July to  discuss ties and issues of common concern.    On the Middle East peace process, al-Shar' said no progress  has been made in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations because of  Israel's intransigence. There is no peace between Israel and  Syria now, he said.    Asked about Israel's abduction of Lebanese resistance leader  Mustafa al-Dirani, the Syrian minister said this is an act of  piracy and terrorism. He said the abduction is a violation of  Lebanese sovereignty and an act of international terrorism. He  said resistance in southern Lebanon is a legitimate right which  Syria supports.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Hungary makes striking switch to mass privatisation HUNGARY, anxious to make privatisation more popular with investors and voters and speed up the transfer of industry to the private sector, is moving towards a mass distribution of companies lingering in state control. The authorities plan to embark next year on a scheme owing much to Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation, Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's privatisation minister, said in an interview yesterday. The new initiative represents a striking departure for Hungary's privatisers, who have until now set themselves against widespread local distribution of state property, so much so that the word 'voucher' remains taboo. Western multinationals have dominated the Hungarian privatisation picture so far. The first big privatisation deal was in 1990 with the sale for Dollars 150m to General Electric of a majority stake in state-owned Tungsram light bulb producer. This was followed by the sale of Lehel, the refrigerator maker, to Electrolux of Sweden. Last year a spate of sales of state-owned consumer goods companies to western companies brought in Dollars 500m. But Hungary has been compelled to shift ground. The sale of so much local industry to foreign companies has proved politically increasingly unpopular. There is also a feeling in Budapest that many of the most attractive companies may already have been sold. 'We won't use the word voucher,' said Mr Szabo, admitting at the same time that the new scheme would present 'a similar picture from the outside as the Czech.' No details of the Hungarian scheme have been released yet. But Czechoslovakia's privatisation programme cuts across a wide spectrum with Dollars 9.9bn worth of equity in 1,491 enterprises to be distributed this summer. Over 8.5m citizens are participating, using vouchers bought for a nominal sum, with two thirds entrusting their vouchers to one of the 460 private investment funds set up earlier this year. The political impact of was underlined in Czechoslovakia's elections earlier this year. Mr Vaclav Klaus, former finance minister, who masterminded the programme, saw his party win an absolute majority in the Czech parliament. In addition to the political attractions Hungary's initiative arises out of dissatisfaction with the pace of privatisation which - even if the most rapid in eastern Europe - is not on course to meet the government's target of putting half the economy in private hands by 1994. 'The decisive argument is that we have to achieve a breakthrough,' said Mr Szabo.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Government seeks Pounds 630m EC funds for Merseyside THE government yesterday asked the European Community for about Pounds 630m over six years to help reverse the decline of Merseyside's economy. It proposes to double the sum to Pounds 1.26bn by adding contributions from the public and private sectors. The money, which has to be finally negotiated over the next six months, would go to Merseyside under the EC's Objective 1 status, which gives the poorest and most lagging areas special help. The EC is likely to press for the UK public and private sectors to give more than 50 per cent of the Pounds 1.26bn. The strategy document asking for the money is likely to raise doubts about whether Merseyside's decline can be reversed. Growth would have to be 5.4 percentage points a year above the EC average to reach average EC gross domestic product per head of population by the end of the century. This figure is thought unachievable by government ministers, civil servants and local authority leaders and officers. Even to reach 90 per cent of the EC average level, local growth would have to average 3 percentage points a year more than the rest of Europe. With an unemployment rate twice the UK's national average of about 10 per cent, about 6,600 jobs a year would have to created by 1999 to reduce the jobless total to UK average levels - and 8,400 jobs a year to reach the EC average. The hope is at least to halt decline and start the process of catching up. Merseyside appears to be falling behind faster than previously thought when Objective 1 status was first mooted earlier this year. Merseyside's per capita GDP is expected to have fallen to only 73 per cent of the EC average when the figures for 1992 appear. In 1982 the figure was 95 per cent. The region's population fell by 20 per cent to 1.37m between 1961 and 1991. The strategy document hopes the rate of exodus will decline, to give a stable population of 1.35m by 2001. No specific projects are suggested at this stage. Nearly 47 per cent of total spending would go on human resources, principally training. The Northern Ireland Office is to prioritise human resource development in its use of EC structural funds over the next six years, and emphasise the importance of cross-border links with the Irish Republic, Tim Coone writes. Northern Ireland's Objective 1 status for EC funds will entitle it to more than Pounds 950m for the years 1994-99. The office said there were three objectives: economic growth to achieve 'a meaningful degree of convergence' between Northern Ireland and the more successful regions of Europe'; promotion of internal cohesion by focusing on the development of human resources and reducing community divisions; and promotion of external cohesion to reduce the province's geographical isolation through improved transport and energy infrastructure. Spending will be allocated under seven sectoral programmes with human resource development taking the lion's share of 28.5 per cent of the funds.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Damages for rail crash widow THE WIDOW and two children of one of the 35 people who died in the Clapham rail disaster on December 12 1988 were awarded Pounds 485,000 damages in the High Court yesterday. Mr Stephen Loader, 34, personnel manager of the wholesale operations division of Midland Bank, was on the 6.14am from Poole to Waterloo when it ran into a stationary train near Clapham Junction. Moments later an empty train ran into wreckage. Today's agreed award against British Rail went to Mrs Gillian Loader and her two children. Their counsel, Mr Ronald Walker QC, told Mr Justice Buckley that BR had immediately admitted liability for the crash.</p>

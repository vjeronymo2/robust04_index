			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 14 Apr -- The press center of the Foreign  Affairs Ministry of Ukraine has disproved today's report by the  information program of the Ostankino First Channel to the effect  that Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko laid the  responsibility for the Odessa incident at the door of the local  power bodies. "The words ascribed to the minister were never  pronounced. The interview itself, mentioned in the news by the  Russian mass media, was nonexistent," emphasizes the statement  by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry.  "Such distortions and the campaign of falsehoods, launched in  the Russian mass media around the Odessa incident, have quite an  obvious objective: To aggravate the situation around the entire  package of the Black Sea Fleet problems, shifting the  responsibility onto the Ukrainian side," indicates the statement  by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry.</p>

One of Yeltsin's closest advisers is currently holding talks  in Germany to find out to what extent the Russian president can  count on the support of internationally renowned economics  experts. One of the German advisers Yeltsin would like to win  over is Professor Otto Schlecht.    Schlecht was a leading official in the German Economics  Ministry for 31 years, including 18 years as state secretary.  At present he is chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation,  which promotes economic research programs all over the world.    Another personality Yeltsin would like to win over is former  Social Democratic Party Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who was  economics and finance minister before he became chancellor.  Schmidt developed the European Monetary System together with  former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.    Yeltsin also hopes to be given special advice by Bundesbank  President Hans Tietmeyer.    If Schlecht and Schmidt agree to act as Yeltsin's advisers,  it is also hoped that France's Raymond Barre will accept a role  in this cast. According to information available to WELT AM  SONNTAG, Moscow has already established the appropriate contacts  with Paris, hoping to gain the support of the renowned  economist. Raymond Barre was French prime minister from 1976 to  1981. Before that he was vice president of the European  Commission in Brussels, where he was in charge of economic  policy, and monetary problems in particular. Barre was professor  of economics at the Sorbonne for many years.    The adviser problem has also become topical for Yeltsin  because U.S. experts such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard  University have resigned as advisers to the Russian government.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LATE buying spree helped the futures market to its first premium to the cash market in recent sessions as traders reported a busier, but still volatile session, writes Christopher Price The March FT-SE contract opened up at 2,471, but was soon sold down to 2,464 before finding buyers. The contract was then squeezed higher to 2,477, its best point of the day, with independent traders taking long positions. Mild panic selling set in with the release of UK government statistics at 11.30am. The gilts and short sterling markets were knocked and March followed suit, tumbling to 2,455 within five minutes. With the opening of Wall Street in the afternoon session, the market steadied. But buyers moved in towards the end, squeezing March to 2,471. This was 11 higher than the previous session's close and some 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover was a busier 7,223 contracts. The traded options market was also busier than the previous session, with 29,636 contracts traded. The FT-SE 100 option traded a third of these, while the best-traded stock option was Asda at 3,870 contracts, followed by British Steel and Cable and Wireless.</p>

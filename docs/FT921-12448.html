			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Personal View: Side effects of deregulation Any radical reform, even if it achieves its objectives, is likely to bring about unforeseen side effects. This has proved particularly true of financial deregulation. Financial deregulation in no way implies the absence of financial regulation for prudential purposes. If this sounds paradoxical, it is, in fact, no more so than the well-known interdependence of freedom and the rule of law. Financial deregulation is a somewhat imprecise term; but it is possible to identify at least 10 specific events that qualify as acts of financial deregulation (see box). From this list, two events stand out as being of particular importance. The most important was the abolition of exchange controls. At the time a radical and controversial act, it is now the norm throughout the big industrial nations. This is partly because of a belief in freedom and deregulation and partly because the information technology revolution has made controls on capital movements difficult to police. The consequences of this for the conduct of economic policy are considerable. First, it has transformed the foreign exchange markets. In the past, movement of currency across the exchanges was largely associated with trade flows, and the external value of currencies was largely determined by the state of the balance of payments on current account. Today the vast bulk of the flow of capital across the exchanges has nothing whatever to do with trade flows; and exchange rate movements are dominated by capital flows, often of a speculative nature, as can be seen most clearly in the gyrations of the dollar over the past 10 years. And for a time these gyrations can be self-perpetuating, with a move into a currency causing that currency to rise, and the consequent rise itself generating the expectation of a further rise and thus a further capital inflow. The resulting currency instability, unrelated to economic fundamentals, can cause considerable damage and dislocation to the world economy. That is why leading finance ministers agreed on the Plaza (1985), and Louvre (1987) accords, to seek a system of international financial co-operation designed to introduce greater currency stability. The other main international consequence of the freedom of capital movements is the dethronement of current account payments balance as a policy objective. In a world of rigid foreign exchange controls, a current account deficit could be financed only by a country running down its foreign currency reserves, which could only continue for a short time. Today, by contrast, any country that can maintain a reasonable degree of confidence in its currency can finance a current account deficit for many years, as the US has done by importing capital from overseas. Looking at it from the other end of the telescope, so to speak, in a world in which capital is free to move across frontiers, it would be extraordinary if, for each country, capital outflows precisely equalled capital inflows. There will be, for each country, either a net inflow or a net outflow of capital. And since the balance of payments overall must balance, it follows that those countries with a net inflow of capital will run a current account deficit, and those with a net outflow will run a current account surplus. This can be seen in terms of the relationship between savings and investment. At any given period those countries whose capacity to generate savings exceeds their indigenous investment opportun-ities will experience a capital outflow, which will finance the current account deficits of those countries whose capacity to generate savings falls short of their indigenous investment opportunities. But the abolition of exchange controls has not merely rewritten the rules for the conduct of economic policy. It has also rendered ineffective any form of direct national controls on credit. For in a world in which capital can flow freely, the effect of such controls would merely be to drive lending off-shore. This other important side-effect of the abolition of exchange controls links with the second of the two main acts of financial deregulation in the UK: the collapse of the building societies' cartel. Unlike exchange control abolition, this was not brought about by any action by the government. Although philosophically in favour of it, I always feared the short-term consequences. It happened as a result of growing competition among the bigger building societies themselves, followed by the invasion of the mortgage lending business by the banks. The collapse of the building societies' cartel, under which mortgage rates were kept well below market clearing rates, and advances were rationed by a queueing system, thus occurred in a new world in which direct credit controls were out of the question, and the only checks on excess were the price of credit, which the government could control, and prudence, which it could not. The consequent explosion of lending, and of spending financed by lending, both for consumption and investment, private and business, on an unprecedented and unforeseen scale is now a commonplace explanation of the switchback course the UK economy has followed in recent years. Compared with the two main acts of deregulation I have identified, the other eight had little real impact, since the restrictions they abolished were either ineffectual (particularly, in the case of the corset, following exchange control abolition) or technical or (as in the case of Big Bang) not directly connected with the quantum of bank and building society lending at all. In looking at this period, it is important not to be parochial. Of the seven big industrial nations that comprise the G7, three - the UK, the US and Canada - have been undergoing a recession of a remarkably similar nature. These are also the three economies that have travelled furthest along the road to financial deregulation. There always has been an economic cycle. But with credit facilitated by financial deregulation, these three economies experienced a particularly virulent form of credit cycle. In other words, individuals and companies came to borrow excessively. And while this was bound to be a self-correcting process (which the authorities can by their monetary policy to some extent expedite), the correction inevitably involves a period of recession. Why the degree of excess in the first place, though? One important reason is that the economic upswing had continued for so long that too many borrowers and lenders thought that it would go on forever. Clearly, with hindsight, the UK authorities - and I accept my prominent part in this, although I was by no means alone - greatly underestimated the demand effect that deregulation, a supply side reform, was to have. The banks, for their part, only dimly recognised the extent of their vulnerability to the credit cycle. As interest rates rose, home buyers inevitably cut back on purchases in the high street to keep up with mortgage payments. Thus by fuelling the housing boom with easy lending, they were inadvertently undermining the quality of their lending to the smaller, more vulnerable end of the corporate sector. What, then, are the lessons? First, a financially deregulated economy, while more efficient and more dynamic, is less stable, by virtue of the credit cycle, which will never disappear completely. Second, recognising this, borrowers need to exercise prudent self-discipline and lenders to develop a far more sophisticated risk analysis than they have hitherto found necessary. And third, what we have gone through in this country is to a considerable extent a once-for-all occurrence: the change from a financially regulated to a financially deregulated economy. Others still have this in store. The author was chancellor of the exchequer 1983-89. This is an edited text of a speech delivered to the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. It appears this week in Certified Accountant, the association's journal. TEN STEPS TOWARDS DEREGULATION The unannounced ending, virtually as soon as the new Tory government took office in May 1979, of the restrictive guideline on building society lending. Abolition of exchange controls in October 1979. Scrapping of the so-called corset, the supplementary special deposits scheme designed to curb bank lending, in June 1980. Abolition of the Reserve Asset Ratio Requirement, under which banks had to hold at least 12.5 per cent of their deposits in a specified range of liquid assets, in August 1981. Abolition of hire-purchase restrictions in July 1982. The collapse of the building societies' cartel in October 1983. Some aspects of the Building Societies Act 1986. Big Bang in October 1986. Withdrawal of mortgage lending guidance in December 1986. The effective abolition of the Control of the Borrowing Order in March 1989.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Diet members -- who are calling for the next  general House of Representatives election to be held under a new  electoral system, combining single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation -- held a general meeting at a Tokyo  hotel 21 June after forming a nonpartisan group "Kaikaku Rengo"  [Reform Coalition]. A total of 218 people, including proxies  (and 112 actual members), attended the meeting.    A group of Diet members who have been conducting a  signature-collecting campaign seeking a general election under  the new system formed "Kaikaku Rengo" to continue their  campaign. It is comprised mainly of signers in the campaign,  and former Health and Welfare Minister Yuji Tsushima was named a  representative.    Among the "Kaikaku Rengo" policies are: 1) it will  tenaciously oppose the attempt to take political reform back to  the drawing board by holding a general election under the  current multiseat system; 2) Diet reform, administrative reform,  and economic restructuring should be promoted; and 3) political  ethics should be established to root out political corruption.  The group intends to ask the government and each party to  cooperate in realizing these policies. It also intends to  positively tackle legislation sponsored by house members.    The 218-member group is comprised of 31 Dietmen from the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; 23 from the Social Democratic  Party of Japan; 52 from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 48 from  Komeito; 26 from the Japan New Party; 14 from Sakigake  [Harbinger Party], Group Seiun, and Minshu No Kaze; 10 from the  Democratic Socialist Party; three from the Liberal Party; five  from the New Party Mirai; and six independents.    Group Representative Tsushima held a news conference after  the general meeting. Commenting on the connection between the  LDP move to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata  Cabinet to Diet and "Kaikaku Rengo's" activities, he said: "Our  appeal for political reform and the move toward the  no-confidence motion are different issues." Meanwhile, he  stressed: "The common view of `Kaikaku Rengo' members is that a  general election should not be held unless the redistricting  bill is enacted."</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm ministers resist plan to drop currency cushion EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers yesterday resisted European Commission plans to do away with the community's mechanism for cushioning farmers against currency fluctuations. The clear majority against abolishing the so-called 'switchover' system was an early augury of what is likely to be a long list of demands from the farm sector to ameliorate the effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and as compensation for last month's EC-US deal on subsidised food exports within the Uruguay Round world trade talks. This week's farm council, originally to have been two days, has already formally been extended to three days, and could run to five - and risks being transformed into a bazaar. The biggest ticket item in the horse-trading is 'switchover', which will almost certainly be retained once the system of monetary compensatory amounts is abolished on January 1, when the Single European Market comes into effect. Commission agriculture officials calculate that the currency turbulence of the past six months alone could cost the farm budget - Ecu35.3bn (Pounds 28bn) this year - an extra Ecu1.6bn. The conclusions of the weekend's Edinburgh summit of EC leaders agreed that 'appropriate steps' could be taken to compensate for monetary realignments, but left unclear whether any new money would come from the EC or national budgets. The CAP-linked monetary reserve to compensate currency movements was also retained at Ecu1bn for the next two years, whereas the original plan had been to cut it much faster and beef up contingency reserves to underpin EC external policy. There is no clear picture of where the bulk of any additional spending would go, but France would almost certainly be a significant beneficiary. France is anxious to get concessions to wave in front of its farmers, who are in near revolt over the Uruguay Round deal. It is also after more money for beef, durum wheat (for pasta) and wine producers. Italy will again try this week to get retrospectively revalidated about a third of its illicit surplus milk production. And Ireland is looking for concessions for its livestock sector.</p>

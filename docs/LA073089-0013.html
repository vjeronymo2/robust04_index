			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, NENEH'S NO JONI . . . PERIOD;  </P> <P> A RAP FLAP AMID ANTI-SEMITISM CHARGES  </P> <P> A reaction to Steve Hochman's July 16 article about Public Enemy, the rap group  that announced it was disbanding after a group member created a controversy by  saying in an interview, "The Jews are wicked. We can prove that":  </P> <P> We have almost completed a decade filled with hatred, violence and racial  contempt, as witnessed by several alarming incidents. Among them are the Al  Campanis blunder on national TV; the emergence of Louis Farrakhan; the  resurgence of white supremacist movements; the escalation of gang warfare.  </P> <P> Now there is anti-Semitic sentiment from Public Enemy and what appears to be a  racially motivated movie by Spike Lee ("Do the Right Thing"), which I consider  incendiary.  </P> <P> What has become of the '60s movement that included a cause for civil rights?  And what about the '70s, which saw a push for equality in many areas?  </P> <P> Apparently we have not come far. Or maybe we have just come full circle, back  around again to a time of prejudice as we head into the '90s. In any case, I am  saddened by the attacks on people in regard to the color of their skin, the  colors of their clothes or the way they pray to God.  </P> <P> JEREMY M. SMITH  </P> <P> El Segundo  </P></p>

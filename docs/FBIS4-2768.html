			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Chen Jinhua, minister of the State  Planning Commission, said that excessive price hikes had given  rise to serious concern in the CPC central body and the State  Council. Beijing must take controlling inflation as a top  economic task for the next few months. The State Council  recently adopted a series of measures for stabilizing prices.    Chen Jinhua pointed out at a recent national meeting of  commodity price bureau chiefs in Wuhan that controlling the  increase in retail prices in the cities is "a key factor which  has a bearing on reform, development, and stability." Urban  retail prices in China increased by 25.9 percent in February.    The national meeting of commodity price bureau chiefs was  held from Tuesday to Friday in Wuhan. The meeting primarily  considered the further implementation of various measures laid  down by the State Council for adjusting and controlling prices  and curbing the excessive price hikes in order to ensure the  stability of the overall situation.    At the meeting, Chen Jinhua said: A prominent problem in  current economic life is the further aggravation of inflation  and the too rapid increase in commodity prices on the market.  In January and February of this year, the monthly retail price  index throughout the country increased by three percentage  points, and this was rarely seen after the beginning of reform.  In particular, the prices of the basic daily necessities, basic  services, and basic production materials that had a close  relationship with the people's livelihood and the national  economy increased too much, and the price increase exceeded the  degree that the people could endure.    Chen Jinhua demanded that commodity price organs at all  levels resolutely implement the State Council's measures --  principally, to control the prices of grain, cooking oil,  nonstaple foodstuffs, basic services, and major production  materials, especially agricultural production materials and to  persistently give publicity to the relevant policies, inspect  the situation, handle and solve problems, and carry out  rectification and correction.    He also stressed that the State Council had adopted a series  of measures for stabilizing prices, including:    First, to strictly exercise "double control," that is,  controlling the size of investment in fixed assets, which was  increasing too quickly, and controlling the excessive expansion  of consumption funds.    Second, to seriously guarantee agricultural production and  increase effective supply.    Third, to strengthen the government's management and control  over market prices. This includes the establishment of a risk  fund for the prices of grain and nonstaple foodstuffs, and  intensified supervision over the prices of 20 kinds of daily  necessities and basic services that the people need in their  daily lives. Prices of commodities and services should all be  clearly marked, and nationwide price inspections should be  carried out.    Fourth, to resolutely enact economic measures for  restraining  price increases and guaranteeing commodity supply on the market.</p>

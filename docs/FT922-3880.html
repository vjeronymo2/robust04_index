			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru attempts to give mine sector a 'competitive edge' A NEW Peruvian mining law aims to attract much-needed private investment into the country's deeply recessed mining sector. The supreme decree, published as a separate supplement to the official government gazette, liberalises mining activity in all respects and forms the legislative framework for all mining activity in Peru, one of the world's top mining countries. In essence, the law draws together previously scattered legislative initiatives to curb the traditionally interventionist role of the Peruvian state and guarantee foreign investment. Mr Demetrio Patsias, vice-minister for energy and mines, said the law was intended to 'give Peru a competitive edge over our nearest neighbour, Chile.' One new incentive concerns the guaranteeing of tax stability for investors starting up operations yielding between 350 and 5,000 tonnes a day, or involving investment of at least Dollars 2m. They will be able to sign 10-year tax stability contracts with the Peruvian state, shielding them from any taxes the government may create in the future. The tax 'drawback' system to allow recovery of taxes paid to the Peruvian state is extended to all exporters. It previously applied to Peruvian silver producers only. In another change long demanded by the sector, mining companies will now be liable for taxes only on profits rather than total sales. The Peruvian state has traditionally viewed mining as a 'milch cow' and taxation has been swallowing up as much as 20 per cent of all revenue from sales - with the result that only four companies in all Peru turned in profits last year. The minimum area for a mining concession has been reduced to 100 hectares (240 acres) and concessions will be granted in multiples of this minimum unit. Administrative procedures are also streamlined. Joint ventures are permissible under the new law in any and all areas of mining activity. Existing legislation guarantees foreign investors freedom to remit profits and dividends without any restriction or prior authorisation. Foreign exchange is guaranteed and mining exporters are entitled to the best available rate. The new law appears to be intended as a timely forerunner to an avalanche of state sell-offs scheduled for coming months. The government has committed itself to privatising all its vast but under-developed mining wealth. New legal dispositions defining exactly how debt papers may be used in coming privatisations are expected within days.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (7): Reservoirs to top up local pools - Community foundations, long established in the US, are taking root in the UK There is an alternative to giving money to a favourite charitable cause  - giving it to a favourite community. Community foundations and trusts, in existence in the US since early this century, are now becoming a feature of charitable support in the UK. Their task is to build substantial, permanent funds from which grants are made to local charitable and community organisations. There are still relatively few community trusts in the UK, but their development received a substantial boost from a recent decision by the US Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, acting in partnership with Britain's Charities Aid Foundation, to finance a Pounds 2m challenge scheme. Three established UK trusts - the Tyne &amp; Wear Foundation, Greater Bristol Trust and Cleveland Community Foundation - submitted successful bids to share the Pounds 2m challenge prize. To get its one-third share of the prize money, each trust had to top it up to Pounds 2m locally by adding Pounds 1.33m from its own fundraising efforts. All three trusts succeeded in doing so by the deadline at the end of the 1993-94 financial year. The Association of Community Trusts and Foundations (Actaf) - which was set up three years ago to support the work of Britain's fledgling trust movement  -is now trying to maintain the impetus generated by the challenge programme, and is seeking funds to repeat it. 'It is still early days for the community trust movement in the UK, and one of our most important tasks is to make the public more aware of the value of trusts as a way of supporting local causes,' says Ms Gaynor Humphreys, co-director of Actaf. 'But new trusts are being formed, and most of the established ones are growing.' Tyne and Wear Foundation, one of the recipients of the challenge fund Pounds 2m, is the largest of 15 trusts affiliated to Actaf. Launched at the end of 1988, it had endowments of Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94 and made grants of Pounds 544,000. It is fundraising with a target of building a Pounds 10m endowment fund by the end of the century. The social deprivation that exists in much of the foundation's area is reflected in many of its grant-making decisions, from Pounds 24,000 for work among homeless young people in Hexham to Pounds 500 to help publish a newsletter on Tyneside's deprived Meadow Well estate. An important attraction of trusts is that, since grant decisions are made by local committees, it is easier and less intimidating for small community organisations to approach them than to seek help from national trusts or distant corporate sponsors. First, however, the money must be raised. Mr George Hepburn, the Tyne and Wear Foundation's director, says his trust was helped by the remarkably strong attachment to the north east felt by its business and civic leaders. 'Wealthy people were quickly attracted to the idea of the foundation as a means of making a lasting contribution to the region as a whole. . . It can be rather like having a private family trust fund without going to the trouble of setting one up. If people give substantial amounts, we are happy to involve them in discussions about how the money should be distributed.' A frequent criticism of big national grant-making trusts is that they are usually located in London, with a disproportionate amount of their support going to causes in the south east or national organisations. Mr Hepburn is currently managing Pounds 1.5m, which the London-based Henry Smith's charity has decided to invest in projects tacking social deprivation in the north east. He sees this approach - with community foundations acting as agents of national grant-making trusts and contributing their knowledge of local needs  -as a way of overcoming concerns about London bias. While a strong, supportive sense of local community is an advantage in establishing a trust, not all the current ones are in deprived inner-city areas. Wiltshire Community Foundation is an example of a successful trust in a predominantly rural county. One of the Wiltshire foundation's first initiatives was to produce a report on rural needs which showed that poverty and social problems are often disguised by the area's conventional image of affluence. The foundation is running a strong campaign to build corporate support in Swindon, the county's main business centre. It has also been selected to manage the Pounds 1.6m Wiltshire Independent Living Fund, a new project to give people with disabilities more control over buying the care needed to live independently in the community. Community foundations are in a particular segment of the fundraising market: they want wealthy individuals and corporate donors to give them very large sums of money. Achieving this is never easy, but the justification - to build up funds that will be of lasting benefit to communities, rather than simply financing single projects - is a powerful one. Growing political interest in the concept of community should help consolidate the community foundation movement in the UK, and encourage its development.</p>

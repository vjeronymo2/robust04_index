			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Israel extends its arm to tie up central Asian links - Following success elsewhere, the Jewish state finds open doors in unlikely places TURKEY and Iran attract most of the headlines in the battle for influence in the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. But Israel has wasted little time in establishing links it hopes will blossom into lucrative trade. The Jewish state is anxious that the Moslem republics should not line up against it with fellow-Moslem Arab states and Iran, the most strongly anti-Israel state in the region. It has moved quickly to establish official relations with five of the six republics  - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Kirghizia  - but not Turkmenistan, and may soon have representative offices in the first two. To underpin the diplomatic relationship  - and establish a foothold in what is seen as a big potential export market  - there are efforts to build trade links. It is a pattern Israel has followed in the past in regions such as South America and Africa and recently in China. As many as 18 Israeli companies are said to have visited Kazakhstan, with at least three 'doing serious business'. Israel was one of the first countries to be put on a direct-dial telephone link by Kazakhstan. Several Kazakh government delegations have been to Israel in recent weeks, including one led by the agriculture minister which held talks with Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, and was given lavish treatment. The Kazakh prime minister is expected this month. Similar links have been established with Tadjikistan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. In a typical Israeli scheme, cotton yields at a farm in Uzbekistan were reported to have increased by 40 per cent on one-third of previous water consumption in one season through improved irrigation techniques. Mr David Kimche, a former director general of the foreign ministry who specialises in fostering delicate relationships such as that with China, has been building contacts in the central Asian republics in recent months. He says he has found 'no hesitation' among them in forging links with Israel. In South America, Africa and China, much of what Israel has offered has been military supplies. In public at least, the emphasis in central Asia has been on the republics' outmoded agriculture and communications systems  - both areas Israel reckons it is ideally placed to upgrade. 'They believe we have a lot to offer in agricultural technology and food production,' said Mr Kimche. He said there was interest also in studying the experience of Israel's collective  - but independent  - Moshavim farms. Although these farms have been in difficulties, the Asian republics are said to be thinking of using the Moshav model in scaling down their huge collective farms left over from the Soviet era. The risk for Israel is that the current secular-oriented regimes it is now getting close to will be replaced later, perhaps by more militantly Islamic governments. But that has not deterred the drive into the republics. One Israeli company which has signed agreements for four projects in Kazakhstan is Merhav, part of an Israeli-owned international private group Metropolitan Investments Corporation. With widespread experience in debt settlement, project development and trading in regions such as South America and Africa, it has taken the plunge in central Asia enthusiastically. The four turnkey projects to refurbish outdated agricultural systems signed in January  - one in cotton and one in tomato production are already underway  - have a total value of Dollars 35m. But, as Mr Yosef Maiman, the company chief, admits, the deal is a calculated risk. It was concluded with the Kazakh government in three days in mid-February, barely a month after first contacts were made. 'You have to take decisions on the spot. A lot goes on intuition and you have to be fast to implement. We started ordering millions of dollars worth of equipment before the deal was finalised,' said Mr Maiman. Merhav has had to spend a lot up front to get the projects moving. It has established a 25-person office in Alma Ata in Kazakhstan. Getting equipment shipments to the distant, land-locked republic has been a logistical nightmare. The company uses its own private jet and charter flights to speed things up. In early April, a 14-truck convoy was sent back to Turkey from Iran causing a 20-day delivery delay. Only a 'small part' of the price is paid in hard cash. For the rest, Merhav gets to pick from a Kazakh list of commodities which, like a menu in a flagging restaurant, has fewer items available than it first appears. Cotton and tomato paste will make up some of the payment, says Mr Maiman. But he insists Merhav will make money on these initial projects and foresees future business for Merhav in Kazakhstan of up to Dollars 100m a year. 'Yes, there is a particular value for Israel to be in a predominantly Moslem republic which has natural resources Israel may need over time,' Mr Maiman says. 'But we are a business operation aiming to penetrate a market and to be profitable doing it. We wouldn't have got into it otherwise.'</p>

Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;601, et seq., requires EPA and other federal agencies to prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IFRA). EPA's internal guidelines require that an IFRA include a profile of the small entities and determine if the statutory authority allows consideration of alternative implementation actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that the action does not allow consideration of alternative implementation actions. First, under the Clean Water Act, water quality criteria must be based solely on science. Second, EPA is promulgating water quality criteria that in effect supplement state criteria that fail to meet the requirements of the CWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has prepared an abbreviated regulatory flexibility analysis. It's findings include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Minimizing the impacts on small farms can be accomplished by developing the least costly implementation plan, which distributes water supply reductions widely and facilitates trading between water districts. Given that allocation of water at the farm level depends primarily on decisions at the irrigation district level, determining which size farm would experience water supply impacts will also be difficult at the State level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

Specific Issues for Commenters to Address <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written public comments are invited on all issues raised in this notice. EPA is especially interested in soliciting public comments on the following issues: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. EPA requests comments on the feasibility of setting water quality criteria based on a smooth function rather than on the mean value for each water year type categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony at recent State Board hearings criticized the use of water year type categories. Because water year types can change as the year progresses, criteria based on the historical mean for each water year type can cause major changes in project operations and habitat conditions if a given year shifts from one water year type to another. For example, a later season storm could cause the water year type to be reclassified from the below normal category to the above normal category. This shift would increase the number of required days of compliance at Chipps Island from 119 to 144 days. Such large and sudden changes are inefficient for water resource management and can harm aquatic resources by dewatering or washing away newly spawned eggs. One formulation of the criteria that could provide for more gradual shifts is described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California DWR, USBR, and others have suggested that a smooth function should replace the use of means for each water year type category. Use of these smooth function equations would result in the same average number of days required for each year type but would involve higher numbers in wetter years within the category and lower numbers for the drier years within each category. Incorporation of a smooth function would likely ease the actual operational procedure to meet the criteria and would avoid the relatively large scale changes in operations that might come from a shift in the determination of year type as spring progresses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has discussed the use of a smooth function criteria with water project operators and the State Board, and has thus far received a very positive response. Because it is a new approach that has not received substantial scrutiny in California, EPA's proposal above relies on the traditional water year type classification. However, if public comments do not raise any significant issues preventing its use, EPA would be inclined to use the smooth function criteria as an alternative to the water year type classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion below describes one possible approach to the construction of a smooth function criteria, and compares the potential effects of those functions with the traditional water year type criteria. Because no critically dry years occurred in the reference period it is necessary to extrapolate from the four year types for which there are data to the critical year type. Fortunately, there is a very high correlation among the four points (Figs. 1 and 2). These extrapolations allow the required number of days at Roe and Chipps Islands in each year type to be described as a pair of smooth functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Port Chicago Equation (see Figure 1). Days=76 * Index^3.3 * (index)2^299 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This equation produces a wide range of required number of days within most year types and in all but wet years would involve a range of about thirty days. Use of the equation would result in little variance within wet years. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d474 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:FRFMEP06JA94.008 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

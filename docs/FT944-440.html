			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Russian pledge on state sell-offs Russia's privatisation programme will continue strongly next year and foreign investors can expect more real security, according to Mr Maxim Boiko, chief executive officer of the Centre for Privatisation. Mr Boiko, whose agency is independent but closely linked to the government and to the reformers in it, said new laws on security markets, tax and property rights would address most of the main fears of foreign investors. 'The government has taken their worries on board and you will see progress,' he said. He admitted, however, that Mr Vladimir Polevanov, who heads the State Property Committee - the main agency for executing privatisation - had 'given grounds for concern that we would not keep up the momentum for privatisation'. Mr Polevanov wants the aluminium industry renationalised for strategic reasons. The momentum of the programme depends crucially on the success of a stabilisation plan which in turn depends on international aid to the 1995 budget of more than Dollars 12bn. Mr Boiko said the government remained committed to: Sell the large proportion of shares it retains in semi-privatised industries, including energy. Under the special rules for oil, the government's shares may not be sold for three years, but, said Mr Boiko, 'for many of them that time will be up next year and these shares will then be sold. Many of them are pressing for it.' Continue privatisation of companies still in state hands by a cash system in place of the initial system of sales for vouchers given free to the population. The new system is scheduled to bring in Rbs9,000bn to the budget in 1995, though Mr Boiko said it would easily top that figure. Introduce a regulated securities market and a more transparent tax and share registration system, in order to attract a much larger amount of foreign investment than the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.5bn which has come in this year - an amount far exceeded by the amount of domestic capital fleeing the country. Press ahead more rapidly with the privatisation of land. Insisting that even the sceptics in the government and in the enterprises were being won over to the privatisation programme - by far the world's biggest and fastest - Mr Boiko said there was now serious discussion of pushing privatisation into areas from which it had hitherto been excluded, such as the railways and health care.</p>

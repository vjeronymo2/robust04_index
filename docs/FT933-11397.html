			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Charge helps push Noranda into red NORANDA, the big Canadian resource group, has run into the red with a first-half loss of CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m), or 32 cents a share, against profits of CDollars 49m, or 10 cents, last time, writes Robert Gibbens. The group has been hit by declining commodity prices and a CDollars 30m charge on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel. Revenues were CDollars 2.6bn, down from CDollars 4.3bn, reflecting the MacMillan Bloedel disposal. The second-quarter loss this year equalled 7 cents a share against a profit of 9 cents. The lower Canadian dollar and lower interest expense partly offset weak prices for metals, papers and oil and gas. The sale of the MacMillan stake has reduced Noranda's long-term debt to CDollars 2.9bn.</p>

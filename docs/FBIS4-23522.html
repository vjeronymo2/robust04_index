			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- Public Service and  Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya said on Wednesday he would  create at least 1,000 new civil service posts at all levels to  address apartheid imbalances. "The Public Service Commission  and I have (consequently) embarked on a programme to ensure that  groups that are under-represented are targeted for immediate  employment in the public service," Dr Skweyiya said in a  statement. He said all existing posts which needed to be filled  would be filled. "At least 1,000 posts will be made available  for filling and the posts will be at all levels, ranging from  entry posts up to and including posts in the management  echelons," he said.    A spokesman said this included directors-general of  government departments. Earlier this week, Dr Skweyiya  announced the promulgation of a public service act that lays  down guidelines for the rationalisation of the central  government and former homeland civil service corps.    Dr Skweyiya said "the filling of posts will be dealt with  within existing budgetary allocations". He said he was  establishing a "component to assist the (Public Service)  Commission [PSC] with all issues relating to representivity will  be established in the office of the PSC. [sentence as received]    "An organisational component will be established in each  department to assist the management in promoting representivity.  A data base will be established to analyse the composition of  the public service continuously. The public service as a career  will be promoted amongst under-represented groups."    Dr Skweyiya indicated that he already had several candidates  for some posts. "I am aware of many well-qualified persons from  under- represented groups who could play a key role in the  public service. I call on them to respond positively when posts  are advertised."    Dr Skweyiya said that although the posts were aimed at  under-  represented groups, persons from "other groups" were welcome to  apply. Serving civil servants could also apply. He said  departments would be advised that where a Public Service  Commission had already made recommendations on the filling of a  post, that recommendation was withdrawn with immediate effect.  He said the posts would be re-advertised.    In addition to existing vacancies, further employment  opportunities would be created. "If suitable candidates apply  for these positions, new posts will be created in consultation  with departments."    Dr Skweyiya said the new government was committed to  transforming the public service into a democratic, non-sexist  and non-racial public service to serve all South Africans.    "After the struggle against apartheid all South Africans are  anxiously waiting for the transformation of the public service.  In this regard my ministry will do its utmost to ensure that,  in the spirit of the Reconstruction and Development Programme  and of the new constitution, the public service will be  restructured to serve the needs of all South Africans.    "South Africa's public service is not broadly representative  and therefore fails to comply with the constitutional  requirements of Section 212(2)(B). This needs to be addressed  as a matter of urgency. The problem is not just the lack of  representation of racial groups in many categories, but also  gross under-representation of women, particularly black women.  A well-planned and structured approach, comprising definite  positive actions by the Public Service Commission, the  provincial service commissions, departments and management at  all levels is called for."</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Cash option poses problems - Changes in company car perks VERY many UK companies would like to offer cash to employees as an alternative to the company car. Yet the number of corporations actually offering the cash alternative has gone down in the past year. This is in spite of the fact that the 1991 UK budget was expected to drive many 'perk' company cars off the road because the Chancellor of the Exchequer caused many corporations to re-think fundamentally their company car policies. He did so by: Raising the personal tax paid by company car drivers yet again - it has jumped by 280 per cent since the 1988 budget; and By insisting employers pay National Insurance contributions on company cars and fuel. That certainly gave corporations food for thought. A survey by the William M Mercer Fraser consultancy group shortly after last year's Budget showed that two thirds of the companies contacted were reconsidering their car policies. Half of those thinking of changing were considering the introduction of a cash alterative. So, what stopped them? 'While there is evidence that a large number of companies would like to offer a cash alternative, they are being put off by administrative complexities and the imprecise VAT and income tax position of cash allowances,' says Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt of Monks Partnership, the remuneration advisers. Not only that, some companies which anticipated the Chancellor's tough measures and launched a cash instead of cars policy in 1990, have been forced to drop the offer. Mr Vernon-Harcourt suggests that, while the income tax difficulties eventually can be ironed out with the help of individual tax inspectors, the potential VAT problem remains a serious one for companies. He says Customs and Excise are taking the view that, if an employee could have, say, Pounds 3,000 in cash or a company car, the supply of a company car by the employer to the employee must be deemed supply by the employer of a car for the VAT-inclusive consideration of the cash alternative. Giving a simple illustration, Mr Vernon-Harcourt takes the example of a company which offers employees a choice of Pounds 3,000 cash or a company car. The company has 500 cars and 50 employees take the cash while 450 retain their cars. Customs and Excise will insist that the 450 car users have had the supply of a car from the company on the following terms: supply Pounds 2,553.19; plus VAT Pounds 446.81 (for a total of Pounds 3,000.) So Customs and Excise might demand 450 times Pounds 446.81, or a total of Pounds 201,065, from the company. 'For a company with 2,000 to 3,000 cars the VAT bill could be Pounds 1m,' Mr Vernon-Harcourt points out. As the VAT problem affects those cars retained by employees, it does not arise if a company decides to do away with all its cars and give cash instead to eligible employees. Monks has found a handful of companies considering this course of action. They are mainly financial/City organisations where all the cars on the fleet are 'perk' cars. In any case, Mr Vernon-Harcourt says that, in spite of the Chancellor's efforts, 'in most of the companies we've looked at, two out of three cars remain tax efficient compared with the tax alternatives. So there is no great impetus to change in this direction. It is not cost-effective to move every company car driver to the cash alternative.' Neither would a forced change from cars to cash be particularly popular. The Mercer Fraser survey found that, while 12 per cent of companies were offering a cash alternative, only one in 10 described the take-up of the cash option as even 'moderate'. The problem the UK government faces in trying to eradicate the 'perk' company car is that the benefits to both employer and employee are far broader than those which can be stated in simple monetary benefit terms. The 'perk' cars era in Britain certainly started because companies in the 1960s and 1970s were looking for other ways to reward employees because high personal taxes made pay increases relatively unattractive. The government's counter-attack started in 1979 when it said it aimed to reduce the UK's high personal tax rates but, to compensate, it also wanted to eliminate the provision of 'perks' being handed out in lieu of extra pay. Since car benefits were believed to account for about 80 per cent of the total value of fringe benefits (apart from pension provisions) it seemed appropriate for the Chancellor to concentrate on that sector. However, over the years companies have found there are other benefits arising from providing company cars. According to Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary in Britain, there are four main reasons why employers provide company cars for key personnel: Business efficiency. 'Mobility in business is essential,' says Vauxhall. 'Key staff must have continuous access to reliable, cost-effective car provision.' Presenting the right image. 'First impressions are important, particularly when company directors, sales managers or representatives arrive at customer premises.' Key personnel retention and company loyalty. 'The company car is seen as a significant part of the overall package of remuneration and equipment provision. Perceived status is often associated with the type of company car and, in a competitive market place for skills, organisations believe it is essential to retain the loyalty and full commitment of the employee.' Safety. 'Regular and recorded service maintenance can be guaranteed if the vehicle is in company ownership.' According to Mr Len Clayton, managing director of Swan National Leasing  - who, like Vauxhall, obviously has a vested interest in the future of the 'perk' car - there is more to the 'cash-for-cars' option than meets the eye. Many of its problems emerge only when the option is examined more closely. 'The main problems may begin to arise only after a few months or a year after the scheme has been implemented,' he suggests. Mr Clayton says that, when users consider matters calmly, they will decide to scrap the idea of a cash alternative. He adds for good measure: 'The company car is an essential business tool. It is not a dying species. It is alive and well and will remain so - because in the final analysis there is no viable alternative.' While these might be heartening sentiments as far as the car makers and contract hire companies are concerned, there is no doubt that more companies than ever have been reconsidering their company car schemes. Pressures of recession have forced many of them to keep their company cars longer so that four years, rather than three, is becoming the norm. And that is not such good news for manufacturers or contract hire groups.</p>

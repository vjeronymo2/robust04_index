			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: A burden on business - EU competition law has come under fire for wasting time. Robert Rice examines ways it could be improved The competition rules of the European Union are unsuited to the 1990s and in need of reform. This is the view of the Confederation of British Industry concerning the current regulations, which were adopted in the 1950s, and the main administrative procedures and policy directions, which were established in the 1960s. The CBI has produced a discussion document, with a six-point plan for reform of the Treaty of Rome rules on anti-competitive agreements and abuse of market power. Launching it last week, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said that, if the benefits of the single market were to be realised, an effective and efficient competition policy was needed. All too often, when companies sought to clear their business plans with the European Commission in Brussels, they met with delay and legal uncertainty, he said. Progress had been made in the handling of mergers and joint ventures in recent years, which had proved popular with European industry. But in most other respects, the CBI believed, the Commission's approach to competition law had ossified. The way the regulations operate is still unclear. There is confusion over the precise scope of the prohibition on anti-competitive agreements under article 85 of the Rome Treaty, and the extent to which an exemption may be available for a particular commercial agreement. Industry finds it difficult to judge whether an agreement is covered by the European regime. In theory, the Commission's jurisdiction extends only where an agreement has a significant and foreseeable effect on intra-state trade within the EU. In practice, the test as to whether there is such an effect is so wide as to make it virtually impossible for companies to say with any precision that the rules do not apply to any particular agreement. Uncertainty is increased by the Commission's continued assertion of jurisdiction in cases where the effect on intra-Union trade appears insignificant. As a result of all this, companies end up notifying agreements unnecessarily to the Commission - including agreements that do not even have a significant effect on competition, says the CBI. Concern about the time and money being wasted led the Commission in 1986 to adopt a policy of granting block negative clearance, where certain agreements are assumed not to need vetting. Such clearance applies to agreements involving goods and services with 5 per cent or less of the market, and where the aggregate worldwide turnover of the companies involved does not exceed Ecu200m (Pounds 157m) - a de minimis test. The intention was to reduce the burden on business of having to notify the Commission about minor agreements. In reality the initiative has been of little value to business. Because agreements can only benefit from block negative clearance where both the market test and turnover test are satisfied, companies with a worldwide turnover of more than Ecu200m still have to refer all agreements, no matter how small their share of the relevant product market. The CBI also has concerns about the regime for gaining exemption for an agreement. The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to grant individual exemptions, but does not have the resources to assess all anti-competitive agreements individually. To get round this, it has developed block exemptions for certain categories of agreements and developed procedural short cuts, such as comfort letters. But neither of these approaches has proved satisfactory. Comfort letters, where the Commission informs the parties without taking a formal decision that it does not intend to take further action, lack certainty. Although the Commission is unlikely to reopen the matter without good reason, the letters are not binding on it or on national courts. Block exemptions are subject to arbitrary and irrational limitations. For example, the 1983 Exclusive Distribution Regulation is limited to exclusive distribution agreements between two parties, relating to goods, but not services, and to goods sold for resale with no significant value added. The biggest problems for industry arise in the handling of commercial agreements, according to Mr Laurence Elks, a partner of London solicitors Nabarro Nathanson and chairman of the CBI group which produced the discussion document. He said CBI members were 'all very conscious of the vast amount of time and expense incurred dealing with absolutely innocuous agreements'. The CBI wants the Commission to 'lift the burden of regulation where it is serving no purpose', he said. This would require a number of changes. The rules should apply only where commercial agreements had a genuine effect on intra-state trade. The Commission should set out clear guidelines covering the widest possible range of circumstances in which agreements would be deemed not to have an effect on intra-state trade. To reduce the number of insubstantial agreements caught by article 85, the turnover element of the de minimis test should be abolished and the market share threshold raised substantially. And block exemption regulations should be reassessed to guide companies towards drafting agreements which do not need Commission clearance. The CBI has fewer concerns about article 86, which covers abuse of market power. Nevertheless, Mr Elks's committee is worried about the swingeing fines that can be imposed for behaviour which was believed to be legitimate at the time it was undertaken. It is also concerned that intellectual property rights might be undermined if the Commission develops further the notion that, under article 86, it is unlawful for rights owners to refuse to grant licences to competitors. This issue is currently before the European Court of Justice in the Magill TV listings case. The advocate-general's preliminary opinion will be delivered next week. In future, the CBI would like to see action under article 86 taken only where dominant companies are clearly abusing their market power. The CBI also has concerns about a number of the procedures and practices of the Brussels competition directorate, DGIV. There is a lack of safeguards ensuring that the rules of natural justice and rights of defence are respected, it says, and a lack of supervision of the fact-finding and decision-making processes. These concerns have also been addressed recently by a subcommittee of the UK House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, which called for improvements in the Commission's handling of competition cases. Such matters were not merely of British interest, said Mr Graham Mason, head of corporate and commercial affairs at the CBI. There was a general feeling among the members of Unice, the European employers federation, that competition rules needed to be reinterpreted to reduce delays and cut unnecessary bureaucracy, he said. He did not expect every member of Unice to support all the detail of the CBI's proposals, but if the discussion document initiated a debate, pressure on the Commission to take action would mount.</p>

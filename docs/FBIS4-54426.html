			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 26 -- Dariusz Rosati, the ruling  coalition's candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and  finance minister, on Tuesday resigned from seeking the posts.  Rosati was to have filled the posts after his predecessor,  Marek Borowski resigned a few weeks ago, but President Lech  Walesa refused to accept him.    In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and  leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander  Kwasniewski Rosati wrote that "another candidate should be  sought urgently, one that would win support of the coalition and  the president."    Rosati firmly rejected the arguments raised against his  candidature by "the president and his representatives," but is  of the opinion that the course of political developments in  Poland over the past month indicates ever more clearly that the  coalition is unable to persuade Walesa to approve him as a  candidate for the posts of deputy prime minister and finance  minister. Efficient performance of these functions would be  "very difficult in the conditions of a lack of approval on the  part of the Belvedere."    Rosati thinks that it is in the interest of the country to  urgently seek another candidate for the vacant posts.  "Energetic actions to this end are necessary in face of ever  more visible symptoms that the economic and social situation in  the country is getting destabilised," Rosati wrote.</p>

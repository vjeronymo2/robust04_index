			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse falls back through the 2,100 level Yesterday gave investors the opportunity for second thoughts after Wednesday's consolidation, writes Our Markets Staff. At Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the European equity strategy team led by Mr Andrew Bell upgraded Spain, and downgraded Germany. Spain, said Mr Bell, looked reasonable to cheap in p/e terms, and cheap against bonds which, in turn, were pricing in too much relative risk considering the improvement in inflation and wages. 'While investors may be inclined towards Germany, given stronger than expected growth,' the team added, 'the trend in our earnings estimates is disturbingly weak for a market with so much priced in. If this does not reverse, the market will have to give up relative ground.' PARIS eased towards the end of the session on a combination of factors both external and internal - a softer dollar and bond markets and a recurrence of profit-taking. The CAC-40 index fell back through the 2,100 barrier, closing off 18.62 at 2,096.45. Turnover continued to express the seasonal tone, at about FFr3.5bn, below even the average of FFr3.8bn seen in July. Rhone-Poulenc's first-half results came in line with most analysts' expectations and the shares improved FFr2.70 to FFr141.50, off the session's high of FFr143. However, Goldman Sachs commented that underlying trends were better than had been expected and the outlook for the group was positive. Goldman considered that, since the bad news was now out of the way, the shares should see a period of moderate outperformance, forecasting that they could trade up to FFr160. Euro Disney was another stock to find support yesterday following the news, which came after the market had closed on Wednesday, that its FFr6bn rights issue had been 80 per cent subscribed. The consortium of banks which underwrote the issue is now likely to sell remaining shares to Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi investor, who agreed to purchase whatever shares remained at the issue price of FFr10. The market price rose 75 centimes to FFr10.75. FRANKFURT fell into the doldrums after its attack on the 2,200 level, the Dax index losing 15.56 at 2,183.36 on the session and subsiding further to close the afternoon at an Ibis-indicated 2,176.66, as turnover eased from DM8.8bn to DM7.7bn. The Bavarian banks stayed weak after the disappointing Bayernverein report on Wednesday, chemicals saw more profit-taking and, at the pharmaceutical end of that industry, the impact of dollar weakness on Schering's profitability left the shares DM21 lower at DM938. There was selective buying interest in engineering and metals, where Deutsche Babcock rose DM4.40 to DM263.20, Klockner-Werke by DM6 to DM163 and Preussag another DM2.20 to DM478.20. Dealers in Frankfurt attributed this to sector rotation after the earlier enthusiam for the automotive and chemical industries. ZURICH finished easier, but above its lows in moderately active trade. The SMI index eased 5.4 to 2,615.3. UBS bearers gave up SFr3 to SFr1,184 ahead of the bank's six-month figures today. Credit Suisse forecast that the UBS first-half net profits would fall by 35 per cent. Baer Holding bearers were SFr45 lower at SFr1,295 in response to Wednesday's news of a 24 per cent first-half profits decline. Sulzer rose SFr8 to SFr968 after Credit Suisse issued a strong buy recommendation and predicted that the engineering and technology group could double its earnings in 1996. Jelmoli, the retailer, rose SFr20 to SFr930 ahead of an announcement that it was to hold an extraordinary news conference today. The company declined to give further details or to comment on recent market rumours that its majority shareholders were seeking to sell the company. AMSTERDAM bided its time ahead of the heavy results programme which begins in earnest next week, and as investors continued to take profits following the good results from Akzo Nobel and DSM earlier this week. The two chemicals groups lost Fl 1.30 and Fl 2.80 respectively to Fl 218.20 and Fl 142.90 as the AEX index softened 1.09 to 419.79. MILAN lacked direction as political worries receded with parliament heading into the summer recess. The Mibtel index eased 24 to 11,328 in very thin trade. News that the net inflow into Italian mutual funds slipped sharply to L184bn in July from L1,120bn in June added to the downbeat mood. Benetton fell L742 to L23,038, with the very low level of business tending to distort the price movement. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index fell just 2.90 to 1,497.20. But after the market close Astra said that the German health authority had suspended its licence for the intravenous injection of its anti-ulcer drug Losec for one year. The 'A' shares were unchanged at SKr173, but were quoted SKr3 lower at SKr170 in London later. ATHENS saw international investors back in the market, pushing the general share index up 10.36, or 1.2 per cent, to 906.58 after a midsession high of 912.03. Carnegie International saw no fundamental reasons for this, or the cumulative gain of over 60 points this week, but it said that new issues were performing well, and expected the improvement to be sustained.

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cominco hit by weak prices for base metals WEAK BASE metal prices pushed Cominco into losses for the second quarter and first half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The company said further efforts were being made to reduce operating costs. The second-quarter loss was CDollars 16.3m (USDollars 12.7m), or 22 cents a share, including a CDollars 31.6m gain on the spin-off of Cominco Fertilisers. This compared with profit of CDollars 18.1m, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 225m from CDollars 416m. The first half loss was CDollars 53.1m or 69 cents, compared with profit of CDollars 13.2m, or 15 cents, on sales of CDollars 517m, against CDollars 746m. Second-quarter mining and metals sales were off 24 per cent due to lower prices and also the temporary shutdown of the Trail lead smelter.</p>

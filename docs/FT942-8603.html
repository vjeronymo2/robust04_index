			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Molson earnings flat despite asset sales Earnings at Molson Companies, the diversified Canadian consumer products group, were little changed in fiscal 1994. This was in spite of the sale of a part-interest in its brewing arm and a disappointing performance by the US operations of Diversey, its cleaning services unit. Earnings before unusual items slipped to CDollars 110.2m (USDollars 79.8m), or CDollars 1.87 a share, in the year to March 31, from CDollars 113.7m, or CDollars 1.90 per share, a year earlier. Revenues declined to CDollars 2.97bn from CDollars 3.09bn. Unusual gains totalled a net CDollars 15.5m, or 26 cents a share, compared with CDollars 51m, or 86 cents, in 1993. The latest gain was due largely to the disposal of a 10 per cent stake in Molson Breweries and a 75 per cent stake in Aikenhead's, a hardware retail chain. These gains were partly offset by restructuring costs totalling CDollars 42.5m. Mr Marshall Cohen, chief executive, forecast a 'significant' rise in earnings this year, stemming mainly from an improved performance at Diversey, rising beer exports to the US, and stronger retail business. Profits from brewing operations fell almost 30 per cent. The drop was blamed on the sale of the Molson Breweries stake to Miller Brewing of the US, the growth of the discount beer market and a lower market share. Molson, in which Australia's Foster's Brewing is also a partner, had a 49.6 per cent share of the Canadian beer market in the three months to March 31, down from 50.1 per cent last year. Molson is the second-biggest exporter of beer to the US. Its sales there jumped 31.7 per cent in the past year.</p>

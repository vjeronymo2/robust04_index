			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ CHARGES U.S. IS PUSHING WORLD TO BRINK OF WAR;  </P> <P> UNITED NATIONS: IN A SPEECH TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, BAGHDAD ENVOY ACCUSES BUSH  OF LEADING 'WESTERN IMPERIALISM.'  </P> <P> In a hard-line response to President Bush, Iraq charged Friday that the United  States and its allies are mobilizing military forces and bringing the world "to  the brink of a devastating war" in an effort to control the Mideast's oil  wells.  </P> <P> Iraq's deputy envoy, Sabah Talat Kadrat, accused the United States of "seeking  in a dangerously coercive manner to impose its hegemony over the world."  </P> <P> In an address before the U.N. General Assembly, Kadrat, subbing for his  nation's ambassador, who is ill, accused the Bush Administration of seeking to  establish a "new imperialistic order" in the wake of events in the Soviet Union  and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "The bitter truth is that this era is the era of the resurgence of Western  imperialism under the leadership of the United States, at times with the tacit  acquiescence of other great powers and at other times with their active  participation," Kadrat charged.  </P> <P> Raising the specter of war in the Mideast, he warned that the United States and  its allies have mobilized forces "in a way that has had no parallel in  contemporary history, thus bringing the entire region -- nay, the entire world  -- to the brink of a devastating war."  </P> <P> Kadrat proposed that the United Nations consider all the region's problems,  "Palestine, Lebanon, the (Persian) Gulf and others," on the same basis.  </P> <P> If, in the wake of President Bush's address to the General Assembly last  Monday, any diplomats were expecting a glimmer of conciliation from Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein's representative at the United Nations, Kadrat's  toughly worded speech dashed that hope.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union joined Friday with Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait in strongly condemning the speech.  </P> <P> Thomas R. Pickering, the U.S. ambassador, labeled Iraq's arguments "a  distortion, a deliberate misrepresentation."  </P> <P> "Iraq has looted and pillaged in Kuwait, has tortured. Iraq is an outlaw. It  violated the most basic (U.N.) charter obligations. . . . Iraq should get out  of Kuwait, and it should get out now," Pickering said in a rebuttal in the  General Assembly to Kadrat's remarks.  </P> <P> Speaking for the Soviet Union, Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said  his nation categorically rejects Iraq's assessment of events in the Mideast.  </P> <P> And referring to the U.N. Security Council's sanctions against Iraq, he added  that discussions in the council "represent the will of the council."  </P> <P> But it was Kuwait's representative, Dharar Razzooqi, the Kuwaiti Foreign  Ministry's director of international organizations, who delivered the most  emotional response.  </P> <P> "He should be ashamed of himself what he said here," Razzooqi said, referring  to the Iraqi diplomat. " . . . Who is violating the charter? Who is pillaging  my country?"  </P> <P> His voice rising, the Kuwaiti diplomat looked toward the representative of  Iraq: "I say to the representative of the Iraqi regime, we are going back, God  willing -- we are going back to Kuwait."  </P> <P> Kadrat was a substitute for Abdul Amir Anbari, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, who on  Thursday suffered a serious nose bleed at the United Nations, forcing  postponement of his planned address. The ambassador was taken early Friday to  New York Hospital, where he was admitted by physicians.  </P> <P> Kadrat charged that the United States had embarked on a new era of Western  imperialism.  </P> <P> "America and its Western allies are seeking, through this military, political  and information campaign, to gain control over the oil wells and to impose  imperialist political, economic and military hegemony over the world, and over  Third World countries in particular," he said.  </P> <P> Kadrat accused the United States and its allies of pursuing "one of the most  dangerous and pernicious campaigns of disinformation known to history." He  charged that the Bush Administration is seeking to "put Arab mechanisms out of  action" and to take control of the political situation in the gulf region.  </P> <P> "In a manner which has no precedent in the history of the United Nations," he  added, "the United States and its Western allies had the Security Council pass  a series of subsequent resolutions, each of which has had the effect of causing  further aggravation and escalation of the situation."  </P></p>

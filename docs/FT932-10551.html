			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Engineering company director charged with false accounting MILAN magistrates yesterday arrested a director of TPL (Technologie Progetti Lavori), a leading Italian civil engineering company 55 per cent owned by France's Technip, on charges of falsification of accounts. The arrest of Mr Tradico, 72, is understood to relate to contracts involving subsidiaries of the state oil concern, Eni. Some Eni executives also face charges of falsifying accounts. There were two other significant developments in Italy's corruption scandals yesterday. In Naples Mr Antonio and Mr Lucio Cirino Pomicino, brothers of Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicio, the former finance minister and the leading Naples Christian Democrat politician, were arrested on charges of extortion. The allegations related to kickbacks on drainage contracts in the wake of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake - an affair already involving nearly 20 local politicians. Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino also was notified that he was under investigation for the same offence. This was the ninth such notice he has received. The magistrates allege local businessmen either through Mr Pomicino's brothers or others directly handed over nearly L2bn (Dollars 1.3m) between 1985 and 1992 to cover his political expenses. Mr Pomicino yesterday denied any wrongdoing. In a second development, Rome magistrates arrested Mr Angelo Iacorossi, one of Italy's leading entrepreneurs in the oil and construction business, on corruption charges. He was alleged to have paid L1.5bn to secure a contract with a leading housing association, IACP. Two members of the IACP were also arrested. Mr Iacorossi, who has been on bail since being arrested in March for another corruption charge related to power station contacts, has been recently trying to take over Roma football club. The club is controlled by Mr Giuseppe Ciarrpico, the Rome mineral water magnate, who is also on bail on corruption and fraud charges.</p>

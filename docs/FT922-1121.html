			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Accounts show 'irregular' payments THE 1991 accounts for the Mirror Group show extraordinary losses of Pounds 421.5m from a series of transactions which took place during the few months up to the collapse of the Maxwell business empire late last year. The most significant losses and provisions come from deficiencies in the pension funds and a series of 'irregular transactions'. Pounds 208.6m for pensions deficiency and related matters. Most comes from the deficit in the pension funds, estimated at Pounds 192.9m. Deferred tax of Pounds 62.3m and regular pension costs of Pounds 4m for 1991 reduce the net provision to Pounds 126.6m. A second charge of Pounds 10.9m reflects Pounds 16.3m in pension pre-payments written off because of the misappropriations of assets, net of Pounds 5.4m in tax. A third item for Pounds 3.4m - or Pounds 2.3m after tax - is MGN's commitment to meeting pensions of members of the Maxwell Communication Works Pension Scheme, who were never employed in the MGN Group, up to June 30 1992. Pounds 122.4m in losses associated with transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies including a provision of Pounds 50m against advances from a loan facility with Bankers Trust. There is Pounds 48.8m accounted for as interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, including Pounds 38.8m with a Maxwell-controlled company. A further Pounds 17.1m remains outstanding from a CDollars 35m promissory note receivable from Robert Maxwell Group, and provisions of Pounds 6.5m against other balances with Maxwell-controlled companies. Pounds 50m for extraordinary contingencies. Only two of the contingencies are quantified: a Dollars 6.5m claim from an individual, believed to be Mr Mark Booth, formerly the US-based chairman of Maxwell Entertainment Group; and a claim of Pounds 800,000 from employees of the European newspaper under contracts they claim were in the name of MGN companies. Pounds 46.4m in 'associated undertakings', including a provision of Pounds 22.2m resulting from sales of MGN's interest in Donohue; a loss on the disposal of QPI, the Canadian printing group, of Pounds 17.6m; and a Pounds 6.6m adjustment to provide additional deferred tax under a change in Canadian tax law. Pounds 42.6m, split between Pounds 20.5m in fees payable to MGN's advisers and bankers arising from the default of the group and its restructuring, and Pounds 22.1m to 'crystallise' potential liability under interest rate transactions. Pounds 14.4m in losses arising from a Pounds 200.4m forward foreign currency contract apparently designed to hedge against servicing a loan in dollars. This was entered into without consultation with the board. Pounds 7.3m including a Pounds 4.4m provision against the balance of a loan outstanding against an employee share ownership trust, Pounds 2.4m from closure losses and costs of The Racing Times, and Pounds 500,000 in sundry items. There was a deferred tax credit of Pounds 70.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] All the French nationals living in Rwanda should be  evacuated today. There are about 600 of them. They have the  best deal, since only French planes can land and take off from  Kigali airport. On the contrary, the Belgians and the Americans  are making their nationals leave by road. So far, 246 French  nationals have already left Rwanda. Cooperation Minister Michel  Roussin hopes all French nationals will be able to leave by this  evening thanks to the rotation of the five Transall planes.    This is possible, but it all depends on the ground situation  in Kigali. This is what the person in charge of the Belgian UN  soldiers in Rwanda, Colonel Marchal, told Benoit Colombin:    [Begin Marchal recording] The duration of the evacuation  depends directly on the number of available planes. For the  time being, only France has started to evacuate. No other  country has started to evacuate, at least with planes. The  United States is preferring to evacuate by road. Since  yesterday, convoys have been heading toward the south of the  country through Butare to reach the other side of the border,  Burundi, and in all likelihood to wait for the situation to  stabilize and to return to normal here. [end recording]    This is unfortunately far from being the case. Indeed,  violence between Hutus and Tutsis is continuing in Kigali. This  violence is extreme. Listen to a report by Jean Helene, who is  with Radio France Internationale:    [Begin Helene recording] The church square is smeared with  blood. In the aisles, two rescue workers collect an  unconscious, wounded man. The man has been lying in a room  under the nave for 24 hours, dying. He locked himself in there  with four other people, but assailants threw a grenade through  the basement window. He is the only survivor. Nearly 100  people took refuge in the church. Just after yesterday's  service, dozens of armed militiamen invaded the mission. They  jumped over fences, and the slaughter started. There was  nothing else we could do, an eyewitness says. Those who fled  into the street were systematically butchered. The mission  employees buried nearly 70 bodies this morning, and the ICRC  came to collect almost 30 wounded, including many who will not  survive.    At the hospital, the situation is not safe. Soldiers came  into the wards yesterday and executed seven wounded people.  This morning, they came and beat up the wounded in the MSF  [Medecins Sans Frontieres] dispensary and threatened to come  back in the evening to kill them.    The march of the RPF troops on Kigali is making soldiers  increasingly nervous. If the RPF tries to take the capital, the  survivors of the massacres will probably be finished off. Jean  Helene, RFI, Kigali, for France Inter. [end recording]    According to the Red Cross, the RPF rebels have just arrived  in Kigali. The Meridien Hotel, which has been housing the  foreign nationals about to be evacuated, was bombed. It is  impossible for the time being to know whether any foreigners  were still there.</p>

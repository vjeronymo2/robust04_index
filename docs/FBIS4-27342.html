			<p>CSO     [Text] Samsung Electronics, the general electrical  machinery manufacturer of the Samsung Group, South Korea's  largest zaibatsu [conglomerate], is buying out over-the-counter  public-offered companies of Japan. They have acquired 51 percent  of the stock issued by Lux, the high-class audio manufacturer  under reconstruction with the assistance of the Alps Electric  group, and hold management rights. The prestigious brand firm,  which has lost competitive power with the high yen, is aiming  for reconstruction with South Korean capital. It is the first  buyout of a Japanese public-offered stock company by a South  Korean firm. It seems that along with the acceleration of  company tieups between Japan and Asia via the exchange of  capital, moves have broadened for restructuring Japanese firms  using mergers and acquisitions with Asian capital as a lever.    Alpine, a car audio manufacturer, which is a subsidiary of  Alps Electric and the chief stockholder of Lux, transferred all  the 1.63 million Lux stock that it owned to Samsung Electronics.  Furthermore, Lux will implement a third party-allotted capital  increase with Samsung Electronics as the other party. Samsung  Electronics will hold 51 percent of the stock.    The amount of the buyout is estimated at about 2 billion yen  to 2.5 billion yen, combining the buying of existing stock and  payment to the third party-allotted capital increase. Lux's  liabilities in excess of assets will be liquidated by this.  However, South Korea regulates foreign currency carried out of  the country and it is estimated that the actual payment will be  about August.    Lux has its headquarters in Yokohama city, and sales for the  March 1994 quarter were slightly over 2 billion yen. Its size is  small, but the "Luxman" brand is famous in the United States,  Europe, and throughout the world.    Samsung Electronics, on the other hand, is a large firm that  deals in computers, communications, and home electronics;  December 1993 quarter sales were about 8,155 billion won (about  1.06 trillion yen), and the ordinary profit was 374 billion won  (about 49 billion yen).    Although it is in the ranks of first-class electronics  manufacturers, standing as tops in the world in semiconductor  memory production volume, it has played second fiddle to  Japanese manufacturers in distinction and image in the field of  home electronics where brands have power. By buying out a  prestigious brand firm, it will obtain an improved product image  and high-class audio production technology. This is very useful  for Samsung Electronics, which aims to break into the Southeast  Asian and Chinese markets, where the demand for home electronics  is increasing faster than in the advanced nations market.    Lux was established in 1935, and has been a pioneer in the  Japanese audio trade. It had sales exceeding 7 billion yen in  its golden age, but with the low-price product offensive of  major AV [audiovisual] manufacturers, sales of high-class items  which are its forte declined sharply. In the March 1994 quarter,  the ordinary profit and loss showed a deficit of about 200  million yen. Liabilities in excess of assets have continued and  that amount reached 2.5 billion yen at the end of the March 1993  quarter. As it stood, it became a situation where continued  public offering of stock was difficult.    The Alps Electric group had capital participation in Lux in  1980 and has continued assistance. However, Alpine's major  product is the car radio, and there being little merit in having  Lux remain in the group, Alps Electric turned to an ordinary  deficit of 4.6 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter. Suffering  a worsening business environment, it decided to sell to Samsung  Electronics, which saw that it could use the brand-name and the  technology.    The Japanese industrial world is suffering a serious  earnings  slump with the prolonged recession. Although it is being pressed  for drastic restructuring such as the sale of unprofitable  enterprises, it has been difficult to find the proper receptacle  at home. If the move broadens for Asian capital which is rich in  growth capability to purchase Japanese brands and technology, it  seems that the industrial redisposition between Japan and Asia  will accelerate.</p>

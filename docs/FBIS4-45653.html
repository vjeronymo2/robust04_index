			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Shunevich: "The Tender for </F> `Sarcophagus 2' Is Open"]    [Text] Currently, representatives of several firms -- the  participants in a tender, opened last year by Ukraine and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for the best  feasibility study of the project to transform the "tomb" housing  the remnants of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's fourth power  unit into an ecologically safe facility -- are examining the  situation at the plant. In Zelenyy Mys, the settlement of the  plant's security guards, the Ukrainian side represented by the  leaders and specialists from the State Committee for Nuclear  Power Industry [Derzhkomatom], the Ministry for Chernobyl  Issues, and the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences have  explained to the guests the technical task on which the  feasibility study of "Sarcophagus 2" construction should be  based. Although the conversation, in which EC Envoy to Ukraine  Louis Morren participated, was held behind closed doors, there  was a presentation of the technical task. Its basic conditions  are as follows: To build a new sarcophagus which would allow  the continuation of research on the old one and its contents and  the stabilization of the situation, to construct a nuclear waste  storage, to sort out and reprocess nuclear waste, and to  dismantle the old sarcophagus. The main issue here is the  safety of people and environment. All this should not hamper  the station's safe operation and its gradual closure. It has  also been envisioned that Ukraine's industry and  scientific-technical potential will be used in this process.    The last two conditions have become the most significant  obstacle. The West is afraid of our instability, and it trusts  neither the country's leadership nor our specialists. Nor does  it want to continue the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's  operation, indicating that after the plant is closed down, it  will help to construct additional power units which would  compensate for the closure, and it will build the "Shelter 2"  itself. To put it briefly, the situation resembles that  connected with Ukraine's nuclear weapons. By the way, the West  does not put such pressure on Russia, which has many more less  sophisticated RBMK reactors.    Asked by a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent whether EC is  planning to provide assistance to the constructors of the first  sarcophagus and other people who suffered while liquidating the  Chernobyl disaster aftermath, and whose health is much worse  than that of their creation, and whether it is not better to  allocate the funds the West intends to spend on closing the  station for this purpose, Mr. Morren replied very evasively:  "The international community should tackle all Chernobyl  problems." His statement was expounded on by H. Hotovchyts,  minister for Chernobyl issues, who led the presentation: "The  EC Commission is helping us in many directions. This  assistance, however, does not relate to social protection of  those who suffered. Here, Ukraine is coping with its misery  alone."    Derzhkomatom Chairman M. Umanets: "The Chernobyl nuclear  power plant is a part of our state's nuclear power engineering  system, without which our independence is impossible. The  station is operating successfully, and nobody is more interested  in closing it than Ukraine itself. Therefore, we should have  the decisive voice. Yet, the Chernobyl plant can only be closed  down after resolving all problems. We cannot allow ourselves to  again deceive the station personnel."    S. Parashyn, Chernobyl nuclear power plant director general:  "We are professionals, and the most important goal of our work  is to improve safety. Nevertheless, political games surrounding  this issue, as well as our uncertainty concerning the future,  are hampering our safe work. We are tired of being a bargaining  chip in someone's policy. Two commissions of the International  Atomic Energy Agency have recently visited the station, and  nobody said that it should be closed down. On the contrary,  they noted that we are proceeding on the right path, and that  there are no preconditions to stop the RBMK reactors. Having  done that prematurely, Ukraine would lose hundreds of highly  qualified specialists. It takes from seven to 10 years to train  one such specialist."    Of course, there are also contradictory opinions among our  specialists, and while this protracted debate continues, the  following question is very much to the point: What is the real  condition of the "Shelter 1"? Will it not tumble down as we  keep talking? I addressed this question to Oleksiy Bytskyy,  former general designer and current director of the Ukrainian  National Academy of Sciences department of design-construction  works of MNTTs [expansion unknown] "Shelter":    -- The current condition of the sarcophagus does not pose  any  threat, Oleksiy Andriyovych says. However, it is deteriorating,  simply because everything in the world ages. There are not  enough funds to service it; we are looking for them. It is  unfortunate that the tender drags on. The "Shelter 2" should  have been built as early as two or four years ago. I doubt that  foreigners will build anything. This is nonsense, and the old  sarcophagus will last another 30 years.    Well, shall we wait?</p>

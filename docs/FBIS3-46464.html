Governor Chris Patten, to use  his present -- and more familiar -- title, was  characteristically forthright in dismissing claims there was a  1991 deal over airport-related debt. "It's extraordinary that  this allegation has come out after 2 1/2 years," he said. "If  Chinese officials are actually saying that there is a secret  deal, they should come out and say that for themselves. But, of  course there wasn't."    But these are the sort of comments he will be unlikely to be  saying by the end of next year, as the Governor attempts to fade  away into the background, and adopt a role more like that of a  municipal leader. "It is right and proper that, the closer we  get to 1997, the more I should take a back seat, the less I  should take a prominent political role, and the more I should  try to ensure that public servants locally, and politicians  locally, are making, running and setting the agenda," he said.    Although it is strange to hear such an upfront leader  contemplate taking a low-profile role, Mr Patten insists he knew  this would be his fate ever since he arrived, and dismisses  suggestions it may make him a touch irrelevant. "I shall very  much enjoy being mayor of Hong Kong and look forward to seeing  through the agenda which I first sketched in the autumn of  1992," he said. "I've always assumed that, as would have  happened with governors in other situations, where it wasn't a  question of the transfer of sovereignty but a granting of  independence, that the closer you get, as it were, to D-day, the  more time you spend in the back seat of the car."    Whether Mr Patten will get his low-profile wish, given the  probability agreement will not be reached on political reform,  and the likelihood of continued Sino-British hostilities, is  another matter. The Governor insisted none of the bad sentiment  had influenced his plans to step back from the political arena  after the 1995 polls. But he agreed recent Chinese comments had  badly affected morale in the civil service, which is expected to  take up the responsibility Mr Patten intends to relinquish.  "There have been quite a lot of things said by Chinese  officials which I don't think have helped civil service morale  and I sometimes wonder whether some Chinese officials actually  understand what the traditions of our public service amount to,"  he said.    But the Governor reiterated the British belief that, despite  the public dispute, senior mainland officials, such as Hong Kong  and Macau Affairs Office chief Lu Ping, fully realised the need  to safeguard the stability of the civil service. Mr Patten's  plan to step back may also be one solution to having a governor  who is unable to talk to China, by allowing others -- such as  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang, who last week dined  privately with local XINHUA (the New China News Agency) chief  Zhou Nan -- to fill the vacuum.    Indeed the Governor now seems relatively relaxed at the  prospect of being unable to reach Mr Lu by phone or have any  direct contact with the Chinese in the final years of the  transition. While saying he still hoped such contacts would  eventually prove possible, Mr Patten noted many of his  predecessors had faced the same situation, and there were plenty  of contacts at lower levels. "For years, Hong Kong governors  weren't able to deal directly and there was a lot less contact  than there is today. There's a huge amount of contact between  our officials and Chinese officials...a great deal of business  is transacted and even more will be transacted between now and  1997," he said.    Mr Patten was equally relaxed about the practical problems  of  organising the 1994-95 polls in the face of Chinese opposition.  It is possible, with Beijing likely to declare their results  null and void, some candidates may decide not to stand, and  there may be an even lower voter turnout than usual. But, even  if that produced a turnout rate still worse than the  disappointing 39 per cent recorded during the hotly-contested  1991 polls, Mr Patten did not think it would cast a shadow over  the elections -- noting how turnout was even lower in the US and  some British polls.    They are hypothetical considerations that very soon may  become reality, with the Governor dropping strong hints that the  tabling of a further -- third stage -- bill on political reform,  which will mean finally giving up trying to restart  negotiations, is now close to a certainty.    Mr Patten stressed that, while he still wanted further  talks, the ball was effectively in China's court. Britain would  not take any sort of initiative -- such as further letters at  prime ministerial level -- to try to lure them back to the  negotiating table, beyond the routine diplomatic contacts that  have so far failed to yield any results. "The Chinese have  walked away from the table. We'd like them to walk back, but I  don't know of any special initiative or special deal we could  offer them in order to trigger talks," he said.    Even if talks did restart, they could not last for long. "We  have to try for a much more express version of negotiation," the  Governor said. "Everybody realises that if talks were to  resume, which, I repeat, I would like to see, they couldn't drag  on for round after round, for month after month." And --  answering a question he has evaded in the past -- Mr Patten said  the agenda for further negotiations could not include the  contents of the first-stage bill, on so-called issues such as  the voting age: "The partial bill...is on its way now and is  not going to be delayed or taken off the track."    Even the content, and rough timing, of a third-stage bill  seems pretty much decided. Although a formal and final decision  has yet to be taken, the Governor added to the growing body of  opinion that he will plump for his original October 1992  package, by noting the support it had attracted in the  Legislative Council [Legco], while expressing some sympathy for  the criticisms of the July 1993 compromise proposals. "When  Legco has expressed a view on the 1992 package in the past, it  has done so positively and enthusiastically on all three  occasions, but I think you have to take the temperature on the  day," he said.    On the July 1993 conditional concessions, Mr Patten said he  "can see the strength of the argument" of those who say they  should now be put aside since "you didn't get a through train,  you didn't get an agreement on anything, apart from the voting  age. You made all these substantial concessions and there's no  deal."    Even on the timing of any new bill, options are clearly  limited, with the Governor noting that time is running short, if  the Government is to meet its July deadline for having all  electoral arrangements in place. Indeed it is further  constrained by the budget, which eats up three otherwise  available dates for introducing a political reform bill to the  Legislative Council before the Easter recess. "The Budget is a  factor in deciding when to bring in the third bill," he said.  "It takes up a good deal of time because we need some time for  the council to debate the good news about Hong Kong's  economy...it affects the amount of time you've got before Easter  if you want to do it (introduce the bill) before Easter."    The Governor's reluctance to take any new initiative to try  to resume negotiations on the political front is in stark  contrast to the situation with the airport, where he is dangling  concessions in front of the Chinese in an effort to bring them  back to the negotiating table. "To demonstrate our flexibility  we can put constructive proposals on the table," he said.  "We've been in a difficulty since last summer because there  have been questions about land premium which we would have liked  to have resolved in the land commission. But, as a  demonstration of our constructiveness, we will, I think, be able  to develop our proposals in the Airport Committee straight away."    But, even here, there is a baseline beyond which Mr Patten  will not go. "I'm not going to make decisions about funding  which would be unwise and unreasonable to the Hong Kong taxpayer  in order to try to bring things forward by a week or two," he  said. "People sometimes say `pour in all the money's that  necessary, to make sure there's an airport before you go'. I  don't think the people of Hong Kong would regard that as very  sound public administration. We should proceed as sensibly and  carefully as we can." There is more than a hint of weariness  too: "The documents on the airport make, I would guess, the  documents which went into setting up the United Nations look  like a short story."</p>

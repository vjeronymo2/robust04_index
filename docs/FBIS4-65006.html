			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Optimistic Business Leaders"] </F>   [Text] Optimism is now discernible among managing directors  in large and medium-sized firms. This was contained in an  economic forecast report that the business newspaper FORUM FOR  EKONOMI OCH TEKNIK presented in its most recent issue.    This positive view applies both to the Finnish economy  overall and to their own firms. On the other hand, the number of  CEO's stating that their personnel staffs are going to be  reduced is larger than the number of business leaders planning  new hirings.    The report, which was prepared by Oy Interpersona Ab, is  based on a questionnaire sent to 230 managing directors around  the end of March and beginning of April.    Almost three-fourths of business leaders assume that the  Finnish economic situation is going to improve over the next six  months, while 25 percent believe the situation will remain  unchanged from the present level. Only 3 percent expect a  worsening.    Regarding their own firms, six of 10 think that activity  will  pick up in the coming half-year. One-third believe that the  activity level will remain unchanged, while 6 percent expect  declining figures.    The business leaders, however, do not expect to see any  improvement regarding jobs. Only 12 percent say they are going  to increase their work force during then coming six months.  Every third CEO is counting on a reduction of personnel, while  55 percent foresee retaining their current work force size.    The CEO's, in addition, were asked to describe their firms'  current general policies.</p>

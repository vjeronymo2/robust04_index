			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>   [Text] Only a handful of top political officials in Israel  were party to the secret, but even they were surprised when  (Tengku Abdullah), also known as Sultan Abdullah, landed in  Israel on 12 June. Abdullah is the brother of the Malaysian  king. He is a member of parliament and is very close to Prime  Minister Mahathir. This was quite a surprise, considering that  with the exception of Iran, Malaysia is -- or at least was --  one of the toughest nuts for Israel to crack.    Malaysia is a Muslim country with a population of  approximately 20 million. There is no Jewish community. The  capital is Kuala Lumpur. The supreme ruler is King Muhibbuddin.  Longstanding Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed, who is second  in command, is the country's real strongman.    The Israeli Foreign Ministry's semiofficial representative  was expelled from Malaysia back in 1966. Since then, there has  been no contact whatsoever between the two countries, and  Malaysia's leadership has adopted a vehemently hostile  anti-Israeli and overtly anti-Semitic line. Malaysia's rulers  recognized the State of Palestine back in the 1980's and  established close relations with Iran. They declared that  Malaysia would never make peace with Israel, even if the Arabs  did. When former President Herzog visited neighboring  Singapore, Malaysia recalled its ambassador from that country  and almost severed diplomatic relations with it. Even the movie  Schindler's List, which is about the Holocaust, was banned as  Jewish propaganda.    The brother of the Malaysian ruler arrived in Israel  accompanied by a Jewish businessman, who served as a mediator.  There is no doubt that Sultan Abdullah's visit was undertaken  with the knowledge and approval of the Malaysian leadership. On  Sunday, the Malaysian official met with the foreign minister  before Mr. Peres flew abroad. On 14 June, the Malaysian official  met with Prime Minister Rabin. He left Israel yesterday after  touring the country between meetings. Despite the veil of total  secrecy surrounding the matter, we have learned that Malaysia is  already expressing readiness in principle to establish business  and economic ties with Israel. Once sufficient progress is made  in the peace process, diplomatic ties will follow.    This is one of the most succulent pieces of fruit Israel has  reaped from the agreement with the Palestinians so far, along  with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican.  There is significant economic potential here, which goes far  beyond the breaching of yet another fanatical Muslim wall of  hostility. Although Malaysia has sacrificed democracy and civil  rights in exchange for political stability, it has achieved an  incredible level of economic prosperity. Its economy is growing  at a tremendous rate with no unemployment, and its natural  resources guarantee a rosy future. It goes without saying that  when asked, all the Israeli officials who played a role in this  affair refused to make any comment.</p>

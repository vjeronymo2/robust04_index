			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Richard Tompkins: founder of the Argos stores chain - Obituary RICHARD TOMPKINS, the man behind the Green Shield stamps phenomenon of the 1960s and 1970s and founder of the Argos catalogue shops, has died aged 74. Tompkins started his working life in a north London laundry, and then worked as a petrol pump attendant and as a racing tipster. He spotted the appeal of trading stamps on a visit to the US, brought the idea back to Britain and set up in business in 1958. Green Shield, a trade name bought for Pounds 50 from a luggage company, was a big success and made Tompkins a multimillionaire. In Green Shield's heyday from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s its annual turnover was more than Pounds 50m and 36,000 stores and garages traded with it. Stamp-licking became part of the shopping routine and queues formed at redemption centres where books of stamps were traded for a range of goods. The idea was dealt a blow in 1977 when the Tesco food chain, one of Green Shield's main customers for 14 years, dropped the stamps in favour of price cuts. There was a battle to save the idea, with offers of treble and quadruple stamps to attract customers, but inflation was rampant and shoppers prefered lower prices. The exchange of Green Shield stamps for goods ended in 1980. Tompkins had moved into catalogue sales and had launched the Argos chain in 1973. The chain was sold to the tobacco group BAT Industries in 1979 for Pounds 32m, largely because of Tompkins' ill-health. In 1986 he relaunched Green Shield with a lavish marketing campaign designed to attract younger shoppers. More than 2,500 shops were signed up, but no big supermarket chains joined the scheme and the venture was wound down in August last year. Tompkins, who died on Sunday, is survived by his second wife, Elizabeth, and three daughters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, Apr 27, BNS -- A group of Latvian experts,  headed by Foreign Ministry State Secretary Maris Riekstins, met  with Russian counterparts on Wednesday [27 April] to discuss the  date of the anticipated visit of Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis to Moscow.    The date of the presidential summit could be announced on  Thursday, a spokesperson for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow told  BNS.    The embassy official named April 30 as a potential date for  the summit but he said that it was not for sure.    Currently, Latvian and Russian negotiators are coordinating  a  supplementary protocol to the agreement on social rights of  Russian military retirees, said the spokesman. "There is a hope  that the protocol will be approved as an annex to the  agreement," he said.    The protocol, which Latvians submitted to the Russian  delegation this week in Jurmala, Latvia, foresees an option for  demobilized servicemen to repatriate and a chance for Russia to  participate in the setup of a repatriation foundation.    During the trip of Ulmanis to Moscow, he and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin are expected to sign the package of  agreements on Russian troop withdrawal, including sections on  Aug. 31 as withdrawal deadline; on temporary operation of radar  facility at Skrunda in Latvia; on protection of withdrawing  troops; and on social rights of retired servicemen.    Latvia wants to amend the section on war pensioners, while  Russia insists on the signature of the whole package together.</p>

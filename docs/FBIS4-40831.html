			<p>BFN     [Text] The planned air-lifting of the personnel and  materiel of two Russian peace-making battalions to the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone will require 60 aircraft sorties.  This was reported to INTERFAX on Monday by the command of the  Russian military transport aviation.    Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes are to carry the  battalions  formed on the basis of two peace-making divisions stationed in  Leningrad and Volga military districts.    At the Defence Ministry INTERFAX was told that two more  battalions from the Russian contingent in the Caucasus are  expected to enter the zone on their own vehicles.    Deputy Defence Minister Grigoriy Kondratyev denied reports  about the possible participation in the operation to separate  conflicting sides formations of the 345th Air-Borne Regiment  stationed in Gudauta. He said the regiment would be used only  for guarding the joint staff of the peacekeeping force in  Sukhumi.    At the end of last week engineering units were transferred  to  Abkhazia, in particular sappers and a signal office. This  required 15 flights of Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes.    Officials at the ministry stressed that this is only a  preparatory stage of the peacekeeping operation: the area is  being clear of mines and communications established between the  staffs of the peacekeepers, Georgians and Abkhazians and the UN  mission in Georgia. The operation to separate conflicting sides  can begin only after the Russian Council of the Federation  passes an appropriate resolution. The upper house of the  Russian parliament is to discuss the matter on Tuesday.</p>

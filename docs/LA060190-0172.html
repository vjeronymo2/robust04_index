			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NINTENDO SUIT SAYS RIVAL'S DEVICE MAKES ITS GAMES TOO EASY  </P> <P> Nintendo Co. Ltd. said today it has filed suit against a rival toy maker,  alleging the competitor infringed its copyrights with a device that allows even  novices to master the popular Nintendo video games within minutes instead of  hours.  </P> <P> Nintendo seeks to prevent Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., one of the nation's 10  biggest toy makers, from bringing Game Genie to market.  </P> <P> Japan's Nintendo, which has the lion's share of the fast-growing  multibillion-dollar video games market, claims that when Galoob's Game Genie is  connected to a Nintendo video game cartridge, essential features in the games  are changed.  </P> <P> "By substantially changing the play of our game, Galoob's product directly  compromises the depth of play and challenge of Nintendo's games," Nintendo  said.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in federal court in San Francisco, where Galoob is  headquartered.  </P></p>

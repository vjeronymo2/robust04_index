			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Quest for ever more power - A look at the manufacture of aero engines The development of the most powerful commercial jet engines ever built has continued to dominate the efforts of the world's leading aero-engine manufacturers. The stakes are huge. Between them, the big three aero-engine makers are spending around Dollars 4bn to develop these new power plants which can deliver more than 100,000lb of thrust. The Trent being developed by Rolls-Royce of the UK has already been run at 106,000lb of thrust. General Electric of the US has tested its new GE90 at an even higher rating of 110,000lb, while the other big US manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has also run its more powerful derivative of the PW4000 at more than 100,000lb of thrust. When Rolls-Royce first unveiled the Trent programme at the Farnborough Air Show back in 1988, Sir Frank Whittle, the father of the jet engine, could hardly disguise his amazement at the extraordinary progress made in engine technology since the development of his first engine with only 480lb of thrust. 'The most powerful engine I designed had a thrust of 2500lb. I would have said something like 10,000lb was as far as we were likely to go. If we wanted more power for a particular aeroplane, we'd just have had more engines than, say, two of these enormous, powerful jobs,' he said. Throughout the history of the commercial aerospace industry, aircraft have been getting bigger and heavier, and as Russ Sparks, the GE90 programme manager notes 'the heavier versions of aircraft have traditionally sold best'. This trend is showing no sign of abating. Aero-engine makers now expect that by far the largest portion of all civil aerospace business in the future - around 50 per cent by value - will be in the large, widebody aircraft sector requiring a new generation of heavy thrust engines. At present there is only limited market application for the new big power plants under development with the new Boeing 777 wide-body twin-engine airliner, which made its flight debut in June with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, the prime contender. At the same time, there is no demand at this stage for engines with thrusts of more than 100,000lb since Boeing requires thrust ratings of 76,000lb and 84,000lb for the first two versions of its 312 to 400-seat 777s. But the engine makers are already anticipating demand for heavier versions of the aircraft as well as development of other new large airliners. All big three manufacturers are thus anxious to show airline customers that their new large commercial engine programmes can meet potential demand for bigger and heavier derivatives of the 777 as well as super jumbo 600 to 800-seat airliners under study. However, the timing of these ambitious and costly programmes could not have come at a more difficult moment. The battle to power the 'big twins', as it has become popularly known, has coincided with the worst recession in the highly cyclical commercial aerospace industry coupled with the decline in military business following the reduction of government defence budgets in the wake of the end of the cold war. The industry has been caught in the classic pincers with research and development costs running very high at a time when cash flow has been inhibited by poor trading conditions, which have hit not only new engine sales but activity in spares, a traditional large source of profit for engine makers. Moreover, the decline in defence spending, which for the first time has come simultaneously with the downturn in the civil side, has had severe implications on the government funded part of company research and development budgets. This has forced aero-engine companies to pursue sweeping restructures including heavy job cuts and plant closures. Rolls-Royce, for example, closed three plants last year and is closing three more this year to match the cost-cutting of its US rivals. The UK company has also sought to expand its activities in the industrial power business to reduce its reliance on aero-engines. However, unlike its US competitors, which are part of big diversified industrial groups, the UK company still remains heavily dependent on aerospace. The competitive pressures and heavy costs of developing new engines have also stepped up the pace of consolidation and collaboration in the industry. All the three big aero-engine makers have forged partnerships with other international companies in the heavy thrust engine market. Risk and revenue sharing partners from Japan, Germany, France, Spain, South Africa as well as the UK have taken almost 20 per cent of Rolls-Royce's Trent programme. The GE90 has reinforced the collaboration between the US manufacturer and Snecma, the French state-controlled aero-engine group. Through their CFM International partnership, GE and Snecma have formed what many regard as a model of international collaboration which has enabled them to take a leading position in supplying engines for narrowbody airliners such as the Airbus A320 as well as for the new long-range four-engine A340. Pratt &amp; Whitney for its part has entered into a strategic partnership with MTU, the aero-engine subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, and is the principal partner with Rolls-Royce in the International Aero Engine consortium which develops the V2500 engines in competition against the GE-Snecma CFM International partnership. Collaboration is intensifying at every level of the market and not just at the top end. This has seen the successful launch of the joint aero-engine venture between Rolls-Royce and BMW, the German car group, which is developing the BR700 series of engines to power new long-range business jets as well as future regional jet aircraft. Deutsche Aerospace has now also renewed approaches to its German rival to suggest co-operation. The industry now believes it has probably seen the worst of the current prolonged recessionary cycle with a recovery in orders starting to pick up around 1996.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of efforts are responding to human resource deficiencies with the intent of increasing the professionalization of child welfare staff.

In addition to meeting the minimum requirements detailed previously, applicants need to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Describe how the Resource Center will employ an Organizational Development perspective in rendering services.

Priority Area 1.01D&blank;National Resource Center for Youth Development. The pressures on and dissolution of greater numbers of families coupled with negative social forces and peer pressure has resulted in higher levels of family conflict and increasing numbers of youth struggling with the problems of maintaining effective school performance, homelessness, substance abuse/addiction, prostitution, delinquency, pregnancy and suicide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuing difficulties in attaining permanency means many youth remain in foster care without returning to their biological family or becoming and remaining part of an adoptive family. This sizeable population of youth needs to be prepared for self-sufficiency, independence, and effective community living. These youth need assistance in seeking additional education or training, and help in securing employment, finding housing/living arrangements, learning about parenting as they form their own families, and linking with family/social/community supports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

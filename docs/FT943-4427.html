			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Berliners say goodbye to Allies: US, British and French leaders see military presence come to an end Leaders of Allied countries joined nostalgic Berliners yesterday as the last American, British and French troops bad farewell to the city after protecting it for nearly 50 years. 'It will be so difficult to forget the Allies, especially the Americans. They bombed us during the second world war but in 1948 they dropped parcels full of food. They kept us alive,' said Mr Helmut Bischof, a 76-year-old former engineer in the German air force. The day's events were presided over by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and attended by President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. At a ceremony at the Luftbrucken memorial at Tempelhof airport in the south of the city, they took the salute from units of each of the four countries. At Tempelhof on June 25, 1948, General Lucius Clay, commander of the US forces in Berlin, ordered 'Operation Vittles', a massive airlift designed to feed the west Berliners after Stalin had attempted to take over the entire city through starving into submission people living in the sectors controlled by the US, British and French. 'Stalin had tried to intimidate the Berliners. But the resolve of the Allies and the Berliners' prevented this, said Mr Christopher. 'I remember the airlift so well,' said Mrs Barbara Wagner, an 82-year-old pensioner. 'On the night of June 23, the lights over our city went out. We thought we would fall into the hands of the communists. But a few days later, we heard the hum of Allied aircraft swooping down on Berlin. That was the best sound I had ever heard in my entire life. I never wanted that sound to leave the skies over my city.' Mr Christopher recalled how, at the peak of the airlift, aircraft were landing every 90 seconds. 'Two million tonnes of supplies were delivered to Berlin. The roaring engines provided Berliners with hope and reassurance,' he added. Mr Kohl, speaking earlier at the Schauspielhaus concert hall in east Berlin, said when he first visited Berlin in 1947, 'I was 17 years old. . . the city lay in ruins, the future was uncertain. For almost half a century the three western Allies protected and defended freedom here in Berlin, in the heart of our continent.' The older generation of Berliners regret the departure of the Allies. But their military presence in the city had already been sharply reduced under the terms of the unification treaty. The housing, barracks and sport grounds will revert to the German state, which last year paid nearly DM1bn (Pounds 400m) for the upkeep of the troops. And Berliners, for the first time since the unification of Germany in 1871, will no longer require an army to subdue them, or defend them.</p>

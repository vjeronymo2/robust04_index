			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.S. Shatalin, president of the Reform </F> international foundation, academician of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, under the "Point of View" rubric: "The Market Needs To  Be Managed"]    [Text] The Economics Division of the Russian Academy  of Sciences and the "Reform" International Foundation have  prepared the joint report, "Socioeconomic Transformations in  Russia: The Current Situation and New Approaches," and forwarded  it to the supreme leaders of the state. The report analyzes the  progress of the reform and the outcome of the socioeconomic  development of Russia in the last two years. Conclusions have  been drawn about the need for a new strategy for socioeconomic  transformations which would make it possible to complete the  formation of the model of a socially oriented market economy  that would be suitable for the conditions of Russia and would  ensure its position among the leaders of the world economy. At  the request of the editorial office, Stanislav Sergeyevich  Shatalin, the president of the Reform international foundation  and an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, discussed  the main provisions of the report.    Two years, 1992 and 1993, is a sufficient period of time to  make it possible to sum up the outcome of "shock therapy" and to  evaluate its results. The latter are far from unambiguous, which  is quite natural. Socioeconomic developments always have their  positives and negatives. The final balance and the evaluation of  the consequences of emergent tendencies are important in this  matter.    So, positives first. The process of overcoming the total  statization of the economy and creating diverse forms and types  of economic operation has continued and largely accelerated. The  formation of an infrastructure of a market economy and its  characteristic mechanisms has begun; the mechanism of supply and  demand has begun operating, albeit with disruptions; the first  signs of competition have appeared. The mentality of economic  cadres who are adjusting to the conditions of an emerging market  economy is changing. A new generation of managers--educated,  energetic, and free of the baggage of old dogmas and habits--is  assuming management responsibilities at various levels of  economic operations. A stratum of entrepreneurs has gradually  been evolving.    All of this makes it possible to evaluate favorably the  movement toward a market economy that has gotten under way. At  the same time, we must note the continuously growing, and  largely excessive, "price" that our society has already paid and  will be forced to pay for the selected strategy and tactics of a  transition to a market economy.    The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a  result of "shock therapy," and its internal structure are  affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly  painful manner, and are fraught with the danger of irreversible  destruction of the economic and scientific-technical potential  of the country.    In the last two years alone, the fall in production on key  macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the  precrisis level it approximated 40 percent. I will stress,  first, that the drop in production is of a universal rather than  structural nature. Second, it has affected the most progressive  and high-technology industries and types of production to the  greatest degree.    A slump in investment activity is the most profound and  dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the  last two years alone, the volume of investment in the Russian  economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to  about 40 percent of the precrisis level.    The amortization of fixed production assets has already come  close to 60 percent--the threshold beyond which the physical  destruction of the production potential of the country begins.  Our society has become a witness to a growing number of  accidents and disasters. The number of unprofitable enterprises  and those with slim profit margins is growing. The  disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the  budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments  crisis, and uncontrolled emissions all testify to the loss of  state control over monetary circulation.    The growth of inflation that was triggered by the  liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. The  failure of combating inflation is explained by a failure to  understand its nature in the economy of Russia, for example, due  to underestimating its highly monopolized structure, ignoring  the factor of cost inflation, and correspondingly opting for  inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of  demand constraints. As we can see, the hope for financial  stabilization without overcoming the slump in production is  turning out to be illusory and theoretically unsound.    The depletion of social resources for the continuation of  "shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of  this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the  population by a factor of more than two, accompanied by a sharp  differentiation in incomes, has aggravated the social situation  in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent of the  most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same proportion  of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. One-third of  the population has incomes below the official subsistence  minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 15 million  people, are below the threshold of physical survival. This is a  signal that the society is entering a social conflict zone. The  social price paid by society for the "shock therapy" has  exceeded the maximum permissible limits.    A deep crisis and social calamity are not the result of  unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, isolated  miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative forces  (although all of these have also occurred), but rather an  unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and  the methods used to carry it out.    It appears strange, but it looks as if some political  leaders  both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to believe  that any change in the chosen course of the economic reform  means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system.  The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for  deliberately refusing to seek national accord.    In the December election, the people resolutely came out  against experiments associated with "shock therapy." Only 8  percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's Choice  bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and champions of  this course. To continue this course in the future means to act  against the clearly stated will of the people.    The RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Economics Division and  the Reform international foundation believe that, in the name of  rejuvenating Russia as a superpower, it is necessary to evaluate  the results of the past two years critically and honestly, and  to work out a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations.    We have selected the following as the key parameters of the  ultimate objective of reforms in the Russian economy which  should certainly be made more specific and refined with regard  to individual stages and time periods.    It is the orientation of the economy, in terms of its  structure and motivation, toward accomplishing social tasks,  attaining a high standard of living, and creating institutions  and mechanisms that make it possible to combine economic  effectiveness and social justice. It is the formation of a  modern system of market relations and mechanisms with an active  role of state regulation of the economy, a combination and  mutual complementariness of various forms of property and  economic operations that ensure stable motivation for  entrepreneurial and labor activity. Finally, it is the creation  of a highly effective economy that is flexible and receptive to  scientific-technical innovations and continually changing social  and personal needs.    The RAN Economics Division and the Reform international  foundation propose certain initial principles for the  development of such a strategy.    First. Social indicators of the reform should be  specified and set forth: its goals, as well as the borderlines  and limits the transcending of which is impermissible under any  circumstances and for any considerations--a guaranteed  subsistence minimum, an employment threshold, the proportion of  expenditures for education and health care in the composition of  the gross national product, and others.    Second. The naive belief in the automatic nature  of healing the economy with the help of impersonal monetarism  should be abandoned, and the natural and commonly accepted  functions of state regulation should be restored. As we see it,  by way of priority measures the accent must be shifted toward  supporting material production and stimulating business  activity, including investment activity.    It is necessary to develop an effective industrial policy,  including structural policy, which will be called upon to give  the Russian economy a modern image and to improve the  competitiveness of domestic products on the world and domestic  markets. Also, the supreme power of the law should be ensured on  a priority basis, and well-conceived and reliable economic  legislation, stable "rules of the game" must be created in the  absence of which it is impossible for entities in the market  economy to function successfully.    Third. We should make a transition to new  principles for financial stabilization in the national economy.  They include the elimination of disproportions between  material-tangible and financial-outlay aspects of reproduction;  the mobilization of domestic sources of  accumulation--depreciation allowances, profits, and monetary  savings of the population; a combination of a firm financial and  credit policy with selective support for priority sectors and  production facilities; the use of various forms of regulation of  prices and incomes, including the establishment of price  parities and cartel agreements; and the improvement of tax and  budget policies.    Fourth. The course toward the formation of a  unified all-Russian market, taking into account the  peculiarities of the federated arrangement of Russia, should be  made the foundation for the reform. This means shifting the  focus of implementing the economic reform to the localities,  with the center retaining the function associated with the  formation and operation of a unified market. At issue is the  development of uniform "rules of the game," the regulation of  monetary circulation, the commonality of the customs territory,  and ensuring the freedom of movement of goods, financial  resources, and labor among regions.    Fifth. The issue of the role of outside assistance  in reforming the Russian economy should be reconsidered, with  orientation toward the domestic scientific, technical, and  production potential and internal sources of accumulation being  made the foundation of this strategy. This does not run counter  to the course of an open economy or of Russia organically  entering the world economy. However, this presupposes that  Russia may and should solve its own problems itself for the most  part.    Sixth. The problem of transforming ownership  arrangements plays a special role. This is one of the key  avenues for the further development and enhancement of the  economic reform.    We should overcome the ownerless, no-man's nature of  property, and help each of its forms (including the state form)  find a real, motivated, and responsible master. There should be  a gradual movement toward a modern multisectoral economy, in  which most diverse forms of property are combined and mutually  complement one another: private and state property, cooperative  and municipal property, the property of public and religious  organizations, foreign property, and various mixed forms of  property.    Ensuring the growth of effectiveness and attracting  investment to expand and upgrade production should be the main  criteria for making particular decisions concerning  privatization. It is necessary consistently to wind down voucher  privatization as a populist direction which is not able to solve  the problem of social justice but boosts the growth of inflation  and the disintegration of the production potential.    The almost complete loss of manageability in the economy has  become an extremely dangerous peculiarity of the current  situation in Russia. A deepening managerial crisis has begun in  the country; virtually not a single state structure remains that  has not lost its authority and has not been deprived of genuine  devices for affecting processes under way in the economy. Laws  and edicts are adopted, decrees are issued, and programs are  approved, but the management mechanism does not operate at any  level.    The continuation of this situation renders the development  of  any program for enhancing the reforms simply nonsensical; the  programs are doomed to failure in advance. Not a single one of  the tasks of overcoming the crisis in the country and a  constructive continuation of reforms can be accomplished in the  absence of immediately overcoming the organizational muddle in  all elements and at all levels and eliminating defects and  disharmony in the management mechanism. The existing power  vacuum should be filled to the full extent by restoring the  status of the principles of state regulation and substantially  increasing the level of manageability of the economy.    The manageability of the economy is an antipode to a power  vacuum and lawlessness, and it should not be confused with a  return to the administrative-command system.</p>

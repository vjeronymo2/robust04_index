			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments were considered in a final revision of Circular A&hyph;110 which was issued for governmentwide use in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 29, 1993. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule because of the previous request for comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number of comments already received and considered by OMB and the Federal agencies, and due to the limited flexibility to revise the rule provided by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Deviations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain specific statutes governing the Department take precedence over some requirements of the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110. All deviations have been written in a standard format to provide both the basis for the exception and information on where the exception has been implemented in DOT guidance. A summary of proposed deviations appears below. Where nonregulatory guidance is cited as the implementing instruction, it does not supersede regulatory requirements nor is it intended to request formal comments on the specific procedures nor provide regulatory clearance for the guidance. Some DOT operating administrations have developed nonregulatory guidance for administering financial assistance awards to recipients. Section 19.6, Availability of material reference in this part, has been added to Subpart A_General to reference where copies of these directives may be found and obtained. Each DOT deviation is discussed below. In addition, the revised OMB Circular affects the management of subgrants in two FTA programs run by States and this is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Deviations Based on Statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection 23(i) is added to 19.23, Cost-sharing or matching, to clarify that local share for Section 18 operating assistance must be derived from sources other than Federal funds or revenues of the system; and up to half of the local share may be derived from other Federal funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 24(i) is added to 19.24, Program income, to clarify the special requirements for determining program income for FTA section 16(b)(2) and section 18 grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 30(b) is added to 19.30, Purpose of property standards, to clarify that real property (including land) and equipment acquired under the Act can be transferred without compensation to another organization for another public purpose under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 44(f) is added to 19.44, Procurement procedures, to note the additional procurement requirements imposed on certain programs in the areas of Buy American, contracting for architectural and engineering services, exclusionary or discriminatory specifications, and cargo preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Nonstatutory Deviations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 19.5, Subgrants. The March 11, 1988, common rule for grants to State and local governments clearly provides for States to use their own procedures for managing subgrants to governmental subrecipients, but is silent on the treatment of nongovernmental subrecipients. The Department had interpreted the rule to allow States to use State procedures for all types of subrecipients. The November 1988, notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have merged the common rule for State and local governments with the requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations would have allowed States to use their own procedures for managing subgrants to all types of recipients. Revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 clearly does not provide this flexibility to States. The FTA section 18 and section 16(b)(2) programs provide grants to States which have local government and nonprofit subrecipients which perform similar functions. Prohibiting States from using State procedures could complicate the State administration of the programs. However, the increased flexibility provided in the rule should eliminate most of the issues that have caused problems for the States in the past. The Department does not have sufficient detailed information to support a deviation request from OMB that would allow States to continue to use their own procedures to manage subgrants to nongovernmental subrecipients for FTA section 18 and section 16(b)(2) programs. If after reviewing this rule, grantees can provide detailed examples of how the new requirement will complicate the grant process without a subsequent gain in control, the Department will consider requesting a class deviation from OMB as provided in &sect;19.4, Deviations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Transportation has determined that this rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866, nor a significant regulation under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. The regulations should create savings for recipients by reducing the costs of administering grants. Because of this, the Department certifies that this regulation is nonsignificant under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

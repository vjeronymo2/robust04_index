			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / NUT calls on Patten to halt compulsory tests THE largest teachers' union yesterday called on Mr John Patten, education secretary, to call a temporary halt to all compulsory testing in English and Welsh schools. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, speaking as teachers' unions prepare for their annual conferences, said it would be unfair to proceed with the tests if the government was planning a review of the national curriculum and its testing arrangements. This year's tests are already being boycotted by the NASUWT, the second-largest teaching union after an overwhelming vote in favour. The NUT will ballot its members next month on a boycott of the new English tests for 14-year-olds. However, Mr McAvoy predicted that the union's annual conference, which opens in Brighton on Saturday, will support a call to widen the boycott. Last night a Tory MP joined the criticism of Mr Patten. Mr Hugh Dykes, Tory MP for Harrow East, said: 'I hope Mr Patten will see the logic of suspending the 14-year-old test and looking at some of the similar problems elsewhere.' The moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, in conference at Cardiff this week, looks likely to join the boycott of the tests. Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, has warned Mr Patten that mounting pressure on his union's members to boycott the tests will be difficult, if not impossible, to withstand. Both head teachers' unions have warned ministers that they cannot guarantee that the tests will continue if boycotts spread. This would threaten the collection of data for schools' performance league tables. A newly formed group of head teachers, the National Co-ordinating Committee on Learning and Assessment, is also threatening to support the boycott of all national tests and to set alternative exams. Mr Patten will address the ATL conference on Wednesday, and is expected to resist calls for a halt to the tests. However, he is likely to stress that the national curriculum and tests - criticised as overloaded, over-elaborate and too time-consuming - will be reviewed to make them more manageable for teachers, yet challenging and rewarding for pupils. Mr Patten is relying on heads and school governors to see that the government tests go ahead as planned. Mr David Pascall, the departing chairman of the National Curriculum Council, last week urged the government to review the tests and slim down the national curriculum.</p>

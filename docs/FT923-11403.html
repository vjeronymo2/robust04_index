			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fare wars blamed for further loss at USAir USAIR Group, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars 750m in return for a potential 44 per cent equity stake, yesterday reported increased second-quarter losses of Dollars 84.9m after tax. This compares with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 56.8m in the same period of 1991, and takes USAir's net loss for the first half of 1992 to Dollars 147.9m. The combined BA-USAir operation will link the world's biggest international air network with the third-biggest US domestic network. It will carry more passengers than any other airline. Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's president, blamed recent domestic fare wars for the poor results. 'Industry-wide fare reductions that began early in the second quarter sharply eroded the positive momentum that we had developed in the first quarter of the year,' he said. His remarks echo those made last week by American Airlines which, although it returned an operating profit, was also hit by the widespread price-cutting. In the wake of domestic fare wars during the early summer, most analysts have been braced for losses from the nation's biggest carriers. USAir ranks as the sixth largest and has little international business to offset cut-throat competition at home. The quarterly loss was scored on slightly higher revenues, at Dollars 1.7bn against Dollars 1.66bn, and came after net interest charges of Dollars 60.1m compared with Dollars 60.4m. Nevertheless, USAir reported higher operating losses for the second quarter, at Dollars 43.7m compared with Dollars 27.9m in the same period of 1991. The operating loss at the airline subsidiary alone was Dollars 53.5m, against a Dollars 45.3m loss. Revenues rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 1.58bn, and the passenger load factor rose from 58.4 per cent to 59.9 per cent. The yield on scheduled services fell from 16.98 cents to 16.21 cents.</p>

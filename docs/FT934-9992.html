			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Japan's battle for the back room: The new government is wrestling the bureaucrats for control of the ministries The shirt-sleeved samurai of Tokyo's public administration are sharpening their swords for a behind-the-scenes power struggle that is changing the way Japan is governed. Having spent most of the postwar years building up Japan's economic might across the world, they are now engaged in a different battle, right in their own corridors. This time, the challenge comes from the new Japanese government, whose plans to cut regulations and reform the political system have jolted the traditionally cosy relationship between politicians and bureaucrats. The upheaval triggered by the end of nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic party, plus economic recession, has exposed weaknesses in the old consensus, once seen as a strength. An indication of just who is on top will come today with the publication of an interim report from a government panel set up by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The panel - under Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation - was asked to advise on how the existing deregulation plans - which spell anathema to several departments and ministries - could be beefed up. So far, the early rounds of the struggle have left the strongest departments on top. But in the long term, the bureaucrats look as if they will have to get used to sharing more power with the politicians. The bureaucrats' public image is poor, tainted by international trade rows, foreign policy mishaps and construction industry scandals. The newly appointed Socialist construction minister is trying, for the first time, to hold officials publicly responsible for failing to prevent bribery. The government's image, by contrast, has never been better, as testified by Mr Hosokawa's record popularity ratings of just over 73 per cent. However, Mr Hosokawa will need more than style to make up for the fact that he does not have the LDP's formidable back-room power structure, which collapsed after its July election defeat. Mr Hosokawa's unstable seven-party coalition replaced a network of LDP policy committees, which used to restrain individual ministries by arbitrating between them and keeping tabs on new legislation from the earliest drafts. Under the LDP system, politically appointed ministers were frequently rotated, giving them little time to master their dossiers and hence little chance to make trouble. Many of the coalition government's ministers are even newer to their jobs than their LDP predecessors, so creating a temporary vacuum that the public administration is doing its best to fill before a more stable government comes along. To the worry of other government departments, the first victory in the battle with the politicians went to the powerful finance ministry, which succeeded in getting one of its former officials, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, chosen as finance minister. The finance ministry also succeeded in setting spending ceilings for all other departments for next year's budget, a process formerly carried out only after consultation with the LDP committees. The move is thought to have limited the new government's freedom to draw up spending packages to stimulate the flagging economy. 'The collapse of the dual structure that was composed of the LDP and government organs . . . will inevitably strengthen the ministry's power. We are worried about that,' says a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Senior finance ministry officials do not see it that way. 'Only we have the expertise . . . It is necessary to compensate for the weakness of political leadership,' one says. The next victory - which might prove short-lived - went to the ministries which administer the bulk of Japan's more than 10,000 official regulations: transport, construction, post and telecommunications. The ministries successfully resisted LDP attempts to cut red tape and are trying to continue that way. However, there is one sign that new ministers are getting their way. The new transport and construction ministers meet often to try to co-ordinate policy in areas like urban development and infrastructure spending, where their departments were sometimes at loggerheads. This co-operation is the exception at the moment. When Mr Hosokawa asked ministries to come up with a package of deregulation measures in September, they produced a mere 94 ideas. They are now striving to curb the government's efforts to push deregulation further. Mr Hosokawa rejected as too vague the government panel's draft proposals and sent it back to the drawing board. Early bureaucratic triumphs could prove merely tactical. One consequence of reform - which is likely to be agreed by this government - will be to encourage a breed of more competent politicians. First, they will be elected more on policies than on their ability to channel business opportunities and cash to supporters. And those policies might not correspond with the public administration's ideas. Second, bureaucratic influence in parliament will be curbed. Mr Hosokawa has reduced the number of senior officials allowed to reply to parliamentary questions on ministers' behalf, and aims eventually to throw them out of the chamber. The extent to which Japanese parliamentarians used to behave as if government were in the hands of the public administration is illustrated by a former director-general of the LDP defence agency (Japan's equivalent of a defence ministry). He once referred a question to an official on the grounds that 'the matter is important'. That should become a joke of the past. The progress being made by the Hosokawa government in wearing down finance ministry opposition to a cut in income taxes is another example of the fragility of bureaucrats' initial victories. Another area where the political class is on the offensive is over plans, now in the early stages, to reduce the number of government ministries and agencies from 21 to just six. That idea was put forward last week by a panel on administrative reform, whose report is otherwise short on detail, an indication of the extent to which bureaucrats have managed to water it down. Nevertheless, the surviving recommendations were received with delight by Mr Hosokawa, who promises to carry them out in full. Japan's bureaucracy was already approaching a watershed before the emergence of these latest pressures to surrender some of its power. A prime example is Miti, admired worldwide as the planner of Japan's industrial strength. Now that the car and electronics industries are near maturity, Miti is looking for a new role and a new growth industry, so far without success. Some believe the ministry has partly lost its touch by being late to appreciate the importance of microcomputers. 'Miti's basic role was to encourage Japanese industry by deploying industry policy. But now there is an export surplus and the market is saturated at home, so there is very little for Miti to do,' says Mr Naohiro Amaya, a former Miti vice-minister, the top bureaucratic job there. The agriculture department is also looking for a fresh role. Its traditional job of defending the rice industry and ensuring Japan's food self-sufficiency is being fast eroded. The ministry appears paralysed by the growing pressure on Japan to phase out its ban on rice imports, as a condition of concluding the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. However, it would be wrong to undervalue the Japanese bureaucracy's skills. A career serving national interests in the public administration is still seen as the ideal for the majority of Japan's brightest and best young people. The heart of the problem is that the interest the bureaucrats are supposed to serve, beyond defending their own ministries' power, is becoming less clear. 'Until recently, their goal was clear cut, to catch up with and surpass western economies. Now that the bureaucracy has carried out this target . . . it is time for Japan to set new goals,' Mr Amaya says. 'This is not as easy as making good cars. Nobody can tell you how to do it. There is no blueprint.' It is uncertain whether the outcome of the present power struggle will make Japan any better at setting new goals for itself. Mr Hosokawa's government clearly hopes that it will. As Mr Amaya says: 'It is the first move in a long game of trial and error.'</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Treasury spells out preference for private sector: Unions attack competitive tendering - Full employment campaign launched / Pressure on utility watchdogs CIVIL SERVICE departments tendering for government work may lose to the private sector even when they can do the job as well and as cheaply, it emerged yesterday. Treasury advice to departments on competitive tendering says the government's policy is to restrict the size of the public sector. 'In general the presumption is that services should be provided by the private sector, rather than the public sector,' the advice says. 'The fact that a public body can provide a service as quickly and as cheaply as an outside contractor is not in itself a reason for extending public-service activity,' it continues. Contents of the memo were leaked by Civil Service unions yesterday as they launched a campaign to publicise what they see as the harmful effects that will result from competitive tendering. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS Civil Service union, said 400 services in 28 departments were covered by market-testing arrangements launched a year ago to pave the way for competitive tendering. Some 50,000 jobs in government departments were at risk, he said. The unions believe their members may be forced to accept inferior conditions in order for the departments to compete and they plan to warn the public that they too will suffer. Mr Brett said that if parts of the Health and Safety Executive were contracted out, its ability to hold multi-disciplinary operations - for example in the wake of disasters such as the King's Cross fire - would be reduced. Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF Civil Service union, said contracting-out in the Inland Revenue would mean that companies' tax records would be handled by other companies and possibly competitors. The unions said market testing was proving expensive. In the Home Office, a budget of Pounds 1.6m had been set aside and 40 people were working on market testing. Included in what the unions say is a comprehensive list of areas being tested for marketing are large parts of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces and the private-letter section of the Foreign Office. The TUC yesterday backed a resolution to campaign to 'ensure our members are in the best position to fight the threats to all public-sector jobs'. The resolution commits the TUC to make a campaign against privatisation and contracting-out a 'top priority'.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax and unemployment Sir, Samuel Brittan asserts that 'the proximate explanation for this hard core (of structural unemployment) is that pay and related costs make workers unprofitable to employ'. Actually, all that has happened is that more and more women have sought to join the working population, particularly since 1970. One reason is the high level of average and marginal taxation and national insurance suffered by those in 'low paid jobs'. Hence, many of the hard core of unemployed collect benefit but also work for cash. The 'discussion' of full employment could usefully move on from monetary policy, labour market details and social security to changes in tax thresholds, including the pernicious national insurance contribution.

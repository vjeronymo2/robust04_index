"We have  not been backtracking or wavering. We have simply taken a short  breather to study the results of the 12 December elections and  to be sure that we have understood them correctly."    Even after his appointment to the number two job at the  State  Department, Strobe Talbott retains his position as architect of  policy on the CIS countries.    Critics consider Talbott's erroneous forecast of the Russian  Duma election results to have been a blunder.    "What happened 12 December was something we had not  expected," Talbott admits. "But I do not think many Russians  expected it either.... Our policy needed clarification. This  has been done."    This interview took place on the eve of President Bill  Clinton's departure for Europe. Certain critics have rebuked  the presidential team for leaving some important tour issues  unresolved until the last minute -- from the vague proposals on  Bosnia to the question of whether or not representatives of  pro-Communist factions in the new Russian parliament should be  invited to the reception at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.    But Talbott clearly hinted that the United States has  already  gotten over its analytical pause, has cleared up its conceptual  blank spots, and is again relying on a consistent program --  "although nobody is ever 100-percent happy."    Using very cautious expressions and invariably accompanying  his conclusions with riders to the effect that "it is not for a  U.S. official to give Russian citizens and Russian leaders  directions about how they should run their economy or their  policy," Strobe Talbott gives two main reasons for the  pro-government blocs' election failure.    "No democracy can fail to be concerned about how humane the  government appears to its citizens. All U.S. presidents have to  be concerned about this. Leaders may be sincerely convinced  that everything they do is exclusively in people's interests.  It may even be directly in people's interests. Nonetheless,  leaders need public support. If a leader and his policy do not  meet with society's support, they will fail. This is not such a  big message, but we want to bring it to the Russian side's  attention, because it is the truth about how a democracy works."    The second reason for the Russian Government's difficulties,  Talbott believes, lies in the means used to implement the  economic reforms.    "I have learned from the Russian press that a considerable  number of those who voted for the Liberal Democratic Party were  middle-aged people scared of losing their jobs. But this is  something with which we are very familiar."    Strobe Talbott said that certain observers had attached to  his words "less shock, more therapy" a meaning that they did not  have. Russian citizens will merely suffer if the reforms are  delayed.    Another reason why the "Partnership For Peace" program has  undergone no changes since the 12 December elections is because  the U.S. Administration interpreted Zhirinovskiy's success as a  failure by the democratic government to explain its policy and  as a reaction to specific mistakes in the implementation of  democratic transformations -- but by no means as evidence that  three-quarters of Russian citizens like Zhirinovskiy's views.    There has been increased criticism of "Partnership" in the  United States itself and particularly in East Europe in the wake  of 12 December. The fact that the program lays down no specific  timetable or conditions for new states to join NATO is seen by  critics as playing up to an ever-present Russian chauvinism.    Talbott considered it necessary to emphasize that the  program  "is an excellent prospect for Russia, which gains many  advantages."    The program does not exclude any European country -- either  neutral countries like Austria and Sweden, or former Warsaw Pact  members, or those which have emerged from the ruins of the USSR.    "I met with President Clinton yesterday and we talked about  the Russia trip," Talbott said in conclusion. "One of the  points which struck him as very important on this long trip is  to sit down in a small group with President Yeltsin and hear his  view of the future."</p>

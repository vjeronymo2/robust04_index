			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong export growth behind Halma's 20% advance A strong export performance continued to benefit Halma as the safety and environmental technology group increased annual pre-tax profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 25.1m. Sales rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 135.3m in the year to April 2 with overseas sales representing a record 55 per cent of the total - up from 48 per cent last time. Mr David Barber, chairman, said: 'Within the period under review there was little evidence of growth in our key European markets and, in the absence of such assistance, the very satisfactory progress actually achieved by the group stemmed substantially from our own efforts.' Profit as a percentage of sales increased from 18 per cent to 18.5 per cent and overall return on capital employed was maintained at 45 per cent. Net cash increased from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 9.9m in spite of capital expenditure of Pounds 6.8m and a further Pounds 5.8m spent on businesses acquired for cash. During the last 15 months, eight companies or businesses were acquired. A number of smaller businesses were purchased and have now been integrated within other group companies. Halma said all of the acquired companies or businesses had continued to trade very satisfactorily. Mr Barber said the group's most successful activities continued to be in fire and gas detection, water treatment and in electronic safety devices for lift doors. Despite the generally unhelpful trading conditions, 17 of the group's 48 operating companies were able to establish new profit records during the period. Mr Barber said: 'The group has weathered the last three years of economic difficulty with relatively little adverse impact on its growth pattern. 'Since it now seems probable that the current year will offer a somewhat better operating climate in a number of our key markets, I believe that further successful progress can be confidently anticipated.' Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 8.52p (7.45p). A recommended final dividend of 1.44p gives a total of 2.373p (1.977p) for the year, an increase of 20 per cent. COMMENT Halma continues to match and even exceed the high expectations caused by its impressive track record to date, hence yesterday's share price increase from 204p to 210p. The group continues to grow both organically and by small bolt-on acquisitions. The increase in cash may partly indicate a scarcity of good enough acquisitions opportunities; Mr Barber will only buy businesses that will not dilute the group's impressive return on capital. All this quality comes at a price, and forecast earnings of nearly Pounds 30m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 21 - a 50 per cent premium to the market. The shares cannot be described as cheap at this level, but their rating premium has fallen compared to other engineering stocks where recovery has been factored in - but which might prove far less able to exploit resumed growth.</p>

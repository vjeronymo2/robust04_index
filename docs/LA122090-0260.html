			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 COACHES WARM UP WITH INSULTS  </P> <P> It wouldn't be Philadelphia-Dallas week if Buddy Ryan and Jimmy Johnson didn't  exchange insults.  </P> <P> Philadelphia Coach Ryan insists he can't even remember Johnson's name.  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Johnson thinks Ryan must be getting senile.  </P> <P> Dealings between the two haven't been civil since Johnson accused Ryan of  placing a bounty on some Dallas players in last year's Thanksgiving Day game,  which Ryan's Eagles won, 27-0.  </P> <P> "They have a bad Thanksgiving Day and their coach, whatever his name is,  instead of just taking the heat for a bad game plan, he made it into a bounty  bowl," Ryan said.  </P> <P> "Maybe Buddy is getting senile, I don't know," Johnson countered. "I guess it's  good for our guys to understand the mentality of the team we are playing."  </P> <P> Dallas, which lost to Philadelphia 21-20 earlier in the year, visits Veterans  Stadium on Sunday with a possible wild-card playoff berth at stake.  </P> <P> If Dallas wins and Detroit beats Green Bay, the Cowboys would earn the third  NFC wild-card berth. Philadelphia has already clinched a wild card.  </P> <P> Johnson, who is 0-3 against Ryan, said he understands the philosophy involved  in Ryan's verbal insults.  </P> <P> "He enjoys needling people and getting under your skin when he has the upper  hand," Johnson said. "You didn't see a lot of quotes early in the season when  he was losing. He clinched a playoff spot, and now you hear him."  </P> <P> Johnson said Dallas will have a more competitive team than the one beaten 20-10  in Philadelphia last year. Johnson and the team were snowballed by the fans  when they left the field.  </P> <P> "It was a dark season, not just that day," Johnson said of the 1-15 record of  his rookie campaign.  </P> <P> "It was a miserable year, particularly knowing you didn't have a chance to win,  but now we are more confident and know we will win if we have prepared  ourselves," Johnson said.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Prison policy not an open and shut case: Jail privatisation is far from being a fait accompli BRITAIN'S second privately run jail opens this month, and Prison Service officials have started formulating recommendations to the government on the extent and pace of a further, sustained programme of private-sector involvement in prison management. But Mr Derek Lewis, the former television executive who became director-general of the Prison Service last month, is concerned about the degree to which private-sector issues are dominating public discussion about prisons. He says it is 'absolutely wrong' to see his appointment as a step towards widespread privatisation. When Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, opens this month it will be the first privately managed prison to accommodate convicted prisoners. It follows the opening of the Wolds remand prison, Humberside, last year. The private sector is also bidding to manage Strangeways, Manchester, and will be invited to bid for the new Doncaster prison under the government's market testing programme. All are either new or refurbished buildings. One of the tasks facing Mr Lewis and his colleagues is to find ways of extending market testing to established, operational prisons. The spate of escapes and other problems when Group 4 took over Britain's first privately managed prisoner escort contract last month demonstrated the difficulties of switching an existing service from the public to the private sectors overnight. Mr Lewis will recommend which types of prison are likely to be suitable for private management, and suggest how to ensure that private-sector involvement is sustained. 'The last thing anyone wants is something that is going to be here today and gone tomorrow,' he said. The appointment of a director-general from the private sector when the government is opening the service to private management aroused concern among prison staff and penal reform organisations. But Mr Lewis said he had been given no brief to engineer widespread privatisation. 'It is inconceivable, for as far ahead as I can see, that public-sector prisons will not remain the dominant element of the prison service. The private sector has existed in the US for 10 years and represents no more than a few per cent of the prison places.' He believes Britain's limited experiment in private management has already proved a powerful agent for change in the traditionally centralised prison system, and hopes it will continue to act as a stimulus and test-bed for new ideas. 'But it is quite wrong to see the private sector as anything other than one element in a broad programme to improve the prison service as a whole. 'By comparison with the private sector there is an enormous amount more activity going on in the rest of the prison service,' he said. 'This includes a progressive programme of devolution to governors so that they have responsibility and accountability for the performance of their prisons. And we are developing a code of standards against which we can measure the performance of each prison on a systematic basis. This is a sea-change so far as the prison service is concerned.' Mr Lewis has ambitious ideas for performance measurement, by establishing comparisons between Britain's prisons and successful systems elsewhere in the world. He regards the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and parts of the US system as good-quality services to share experience with Britain. He has just completed a tour of US and Canadian prisons and believes that, while Britain is in the lead in developing constructive relationships between prisoners and officers, industrial programmes in North American prisons are better developed. He said: 'They are further down the road in increasing levels of wages for prisoners and creating a virtuous circle of incentives. Progress in work is an important factor in determining release dates in North America. That seems to create a pretty powerful set of positive incentives, whereas our incentives seem to be much more negative - if you misbehave you are punished by loss of remission.' Mr Lewis believes Britain might gain from adopting the greater staff mobility found in the US and Canada, where probation officers sometimes spend part of their careers as prison officers. He said: 'It gives better understanding between functions, and eventually produces managers who are much better equipped because they understand a number of activities at first hand.'</p>

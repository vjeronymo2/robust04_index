			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MY DATELESS DIARY: AN AMERICAN JOURNEY BY R. K. NARAYAN  (PENGUIN: $6.95)  </P> <P> From Alexis de Tocqueville to ALF, foreigners traditionally have offered the  most insightful comments on American mores and foibles. During the early '60s,  Indian novelist R. K. Narayan traversed the United States, carefully recording  his bewilderment at such curious American phenomena as cafeterias and the New  York subway system. He's bemused by the cheerful vulgarity of a woman who  expects facile answers to complex metaphysical questions, dismayed by the  crudely made brew American restaurants call coffee and charmed by the reclusive  Greta Garbo. A chapter on Los Angeles includes notes on meeting Aldous Huxley  and various studio executives, descriptions of the vanished charms of Pershing  Square and dismayed reactions to the smog and traffic. Highly entertaining  sketches of the United States as seen through Indian eyes.  </P></p>

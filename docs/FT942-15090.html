			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: Maverick tastes THE CULTURE OF COLLECTING edited by John Elsner and Roger Cardinal Reaktion Books Pounds 25, (pb Pounds 10.95), 312 pages In one of the liveliest essays in this book, John Forrester quotes Freud's suggestion that an old bachelor collects snuffboxes in order to pursue his need for a multitude of conquests. Freud saw his own passion for collecting antiquities as extravagant and reckless - a redeeming trait on which he could draw when defending himself against charges of 'petit-bourgeois correctness'. The editors of The Cultures of Collecting are at pains to emphasise that they are concerned with an activity more wild and maverick than mere 'orthodox connoisseurship'. Noah, 'the first collector', is invoked as a figure obsessed with possessing a complete category in each and every of its variations. In Roger Cardinal's essay, Kurt Schwitters is portrayed as a collector untrammelled by established boundaries: Cardinal repeatedly notes the disgusting, filthy and possibly smelly oddments that he assembled for his collages. Many of the illustrations support this sense of a disregard of limits. Anthony Alan Shelton, analysing Renaissance collecting, includes among his striking visual images an engraving of a museum in Naples, in which shells, fish and other such exhibits cover the entire ceiling and spare wall-space. Nicholas Thomas provides an intriguing account of collisions between raffishness and respectability in late 18th-century perceptions of exotic objects. The concept of curiosity, so central to the pleasure offered by such objects, could only with difficulty be rescued from imputations of sexual licence. Elsner and Cardinal, however, choose as their introductory essay a translation of part of Jean Baudrillard's Le Systeme des objets, which hardly encourages a view of collecting as engagingly flamboyant. Assembling objects is, Baudrillard argues, a discreet variety of sexual perversion, a form of fetishism, a retreat from personal relationships. The main problem with this as a starting-point for further discussion is that it deprives the impulse to collect of the singularity that interests the reader in the first place. Like any other human desire, this impulse turns out to be all too easily and directly linked to sexuality and the fear of death. Fortunately, other essays, in examining specific assemblages of objects, establish such connections in more oblique and beguiling ways, such as Susan Stewart's exploration of the complex, poignant process through which a late 18th-century American artist used both his paintings and his museum of natural objects to come to terms with the deaths of four of his infant children.</p>

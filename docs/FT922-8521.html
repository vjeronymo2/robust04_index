			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: Plea is a sign of growing competition Sir, I had just finished telling a New York conference that competition was developing in the UK electricity industry, when I read your report about National Power's plea to the new energy minister, Mr Tim Eggar ('Power chief sees threat to coal sell-off', May 5). If Mr Eggar wants the two major generators to buy more coal from British Coal than they seem inclined to, he should avoid offering any bribe which might damage emerging competition in generation. Much of that competition will come from clean, efficient gas-fired power stations and it is ironic that National Power's chief executive should be asking the regulator (Offer) to question the economics of its competitors' gas fired projects. What he did not say is that National Power is building several such stations and that these will also displace coal-burning plant. Perhaps National Power's special pleading is a sign that the business is becoming more competitive. David Porter, chief executive, Association of Independent Electricity Producers, Herodsfoot, Liskeard, Cornwall PL14 4QX</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Unions reject chemical industry's 4% offer UNIONS representing 20,000 chemical process workers have rejected an offer by employers which would lead to minimum pay rates rising about 4 per cent. The employers agreed to provide 3.76 per cent in new money. Consolidation of other payments would lead to a 4.16 per cent rise in the minimum rate, taking it to Pounds 3.88 an hour. Negotiating through the Chemical Industries Association, the employers rejected union claims for a cut in the 39-hour week and an increase in holidays. They agreed to establish a group to look at equal opportunities. Increases in minimum rates do not necessarily lead to comparable increases for all workers as the industry practices two-tier bargaining through which local negotiations supplement national talks. Until recently most companies followed the percentage rise pattern set by the national talks. The association believes there has been more variation during the recession. RMT, Britain's largest rail union, is likely today to reject British Rail's 4 per cent pay offer for 100,000 staff.</p>

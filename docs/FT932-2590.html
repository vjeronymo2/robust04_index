			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Ukrainians to have final say on future THE Ukrainian parliament, in an effort to appease striking miners, yesterday voted to hold a referendum of confidence in both the president and parliament. The agreement came a day after President Leonid Kravchuk unilaterally assumed personal control over the government in an effort to stem Ukraine's spiralling social and economic crisis. The presidential decree, issued late on Wednesday night, also appointed the reformist prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, to head an 'emergency committee' to run the economy. Mr Kuchma's appointment suggests that he and Mr Kravchuk may have reached a political compromise after being locked in a bitter power struggle for the past month. The ex-communist dominated parliament has rejected the additional powers and some MPs said they would challenge the president's decree in today's scheduled parliamentary session. 'This is against the constitution,' said Mr Stepan Khmara, a radical nationalist MP from western Ukraine. 'Parliament will do its best to overthrow it.' Another MP, from the east of the country, compared Mr Kravchuk's decree to the failed communist coup in Russia in August, 1991. Meanwhile, the referendum, to be held on September 26, will ask voters if they have confidence in the president and parliament. Early parliamentary or presidential elections are likely to be called in the event of a no vote. Both Mr Kravchuk and the parliament are widely unpopular. However, the president, perhaps hoping for a re-run of his Russian counterpart's victory in the April referendum, supported the call by the striking miners for a nationwide ballot. Parliament has gone along with the idea more in the hope that agreement would end industrial action led by the miners in the east of the country which is further damaging Ukraine's already ailing economy. The miners, whose main goal has been to force parliament to hold a referendum, have not yet called off their action. The strike, concentrated in the largely Russian-speaking and potentially separatist regions, is being viewed in Kiev as the most serious threat to Ukraine since the Slav state became independent less than two years ago. The conservative parliament lived up to its reputation yesterday when it approved an additional 2 trillion (million million) coupons of credits, to be issued to subsidise meat and milk prices. The move, a concession to Ukraine's powerful agricultural lobby, is likely to further stimulate inflation, with prices rising by more than 30 per cent a month. Editorial Comment, page 15</p>

The study also indicates  that NAFTA, of which Mexico is a part, will cause difficulties  for Colombians exports to access the Mexican market because the  Mexican doors will swing open for very competitive U.S. products.    Should the agreement within the Group of Three (G-3), made  up  of Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico, not materialize, the  situation will worsen because our country will even lack  preferential access to the Mexican market. This is why the  study states that "the G-3 will have no value whatsoever unless  it is reinforced by the incorporation of Colombia into NAFTA"  and by the subsequent establishment of a Latin American economic  bloc.    The costs of excluding Colombia from NAFTA will be huge, not  only because the advantages of having access to one of the  world's largest markets would be lost, but because foreign  investors would prefer to conduct businesses in Mexico, not in  Colombia. According to the study, more than half of the capital  flows allocated to Latin American investments in the next few  years will go to Mexico because of the preferential access that  businessmen and exporters will have to enter the U.S. market.    Preliminary estimates indicate that Mexican exports to the  United States will increase by an additional 15 percent  annually; the Mexican economy will grow by an additional 11  percent; and real salaries will increase by 16 percent. The  study also reveals that products of the chemical and publishing  industries will be the Colombian products most hurt by Mexican  preferences for the United States because of the differing NAFTA  and G-3 schedules 3 to lift customs duties.    The report indicates that "the message is clear for Colombia  if we consider that the NAFTA inclusion conditions are  relatively flexible. Second, the integration agreement reached  so far must be included within the most ambitious plan, whose  ultimate goal is hemispheric integration." Colombia recently  asked to join NAFTA. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  said Colombia will probably be included on the list of countries  that want to join NAFTA. The list will be officially submitted  to President Bill Clinton on 1 May.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: EC agrees on EC-US compromise on farm subsidies THE European Commission last night agreed that the EC-US compromise on farm subsidies in the Gatt world trade talks was compatible with reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. After reviewing a document produced by Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish commissioner for agriculture who secured the breakthrough in last week's trade talks, the Commission approved without a vote the EC negotiating position. A 10-page paper is to be distributed to member states today which is also expected to set out the concessions made by the US in sectors such as services in the Gatt talks. EC concessions on agriculture will also be outlined. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president who clashed with Mr MacSharry in the run-up to last week's breakthrough, did not voice opposition to the EC-US deal yesterday. Instead, he rallied commissioners behind the MacSharry paper on the grounds that it was the best result attainable. 'There was a grudging consensus,' said one senior EC official. France has pushed strongly for the Commission to show that the EC's new international obligations on farm subsidies are incompatible with this year's CAP reform. Some officials in Brussels say publication of the detailed concessions on agriculture could upset negotiations to be conducted in Geneva, which are needed to wrap up a comprehensive Gatt deal.</p>

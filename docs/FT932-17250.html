			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Norway raises DnB stake to 70% THE Norwegian government has raised its stake in Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest, to 70 per cent from 55 per cent, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The move follows overwhelming agreement at the bank's annual meeting to write down the value of its ordinary share capital to zero as part of a deal agreed last November to prop up the bank. Acceptance of the proposal means the bank can receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars 217m) in fresh preference capital.</p>

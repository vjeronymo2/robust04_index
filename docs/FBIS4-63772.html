			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- Douglas Hurd, British secretary of  state for foreign affairs, arrived in Ukraine on an official  one-day visit. The guest met with Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's  minister of foreign affairs, President Leonid Kravchuk, and  other state leaders. "To us Ukraine is a very important European  state," Mr. Hurd told journalists at Borispol Airport.    Asked what national security guarantees Britain can provide  to Ukraine, Mr. Hurd said: "The fact that Ukraine has joined  NATO's Partnership for Peace program is your security guarantee."    The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Great Britain met and  held talks at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Speaking  to journalists, Anatoliy Zlenko said: "During our one-on-one  conversation we discussed opportunities for strengthening our  bilateral ties, focusing on issues facing the European Community  today. In particular, these issues concern the international  conference on the Pact of Stability in Europe [as received] to  be held in Paris, Ukraine's steps toward membership in the  European Union, and issues of primary importance for the  development of economic cooperation."    Anatoliy Zlenko expressed his satisfaction with Mr. Hurd's  visit to Kiev. "I am pleased to note," the Ukrainian minister  said, "that our relations are good enough to allow us to be  frank in our conversations."    Speaking of the possibility of international organizations  (UN and CSCE) influencing settlement of the "Crimean problem,"  Mr. Hurd said that these issues will be studied, but he believes  Ukraine is capable of solving the problem itself.    During the meeting between President Leonid Kravchuk and  Douglas Hurd, the president said: "We are not demanding anything  special from Crimea. We are only demanding adherence to the  Ukrainian Constitution. Ukraine will under no circumstances use  force to solve the `Crimean problem': All issues must be  resolved only through negotiations."</p>

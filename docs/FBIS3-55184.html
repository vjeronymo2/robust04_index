INTERFAX has learned from a well-informed source that Russia's  Choice, the Communists, the Agrarians, and the Liberal Democrats  are ready to agree to the election of a speaker from one of the  smaller groups -- Yavlinskiy's bloc or Women of Russia -- so  long as the four deputies are elected from these four largest  groups.</p>

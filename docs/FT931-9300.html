			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Fuel tax better than tolls to ease road congestion Sir, Giles Keating's article, 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll' (Personal View, February 11), sees a number of benefits from road privatisation, namely reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and pollution, and the creation of a new industry in traffic management. He misses the point. Selective tolls in order to ease congestion are one thing, but tolls on the entire network are simply a tax on road use, and inefficient collection does not benefit the economy. Why incur large capital costs and waste 10 per cent of the revenue on collection (his estimate) when there are already well-established collection systems in place? A modest increase on fuel taxes, for example, would achieve the benefits suggested (apart from his contentious new industry one) with no incremental increase in collection cost. Indeed, from an environmental view it takes more from those who use and damage roads the most (motorways and local), which is surely right. Patrick Barr, 11 The Avenue, Claygate, Surrey KT10 0RX</p>

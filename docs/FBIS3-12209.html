Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League is very gravely  concerned about this sorrowful incident.    In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Majid said he issued  instructions to Ambassador Mahmud Abu-al-Nasr, head of the Arab  League Bureau in New York, to coordinate with representatives of  the Islamic Conference Organization, the OAU, and the Arab  countries at the United Nations to submit the issue to the  Security Council to decide what to do about this assault and to  draw the world's attention to it via the Security Council, the  highest international body.    The Arab League secretary general added that this act proves  again that the settlers flout security and public order in the  occupied territories while the Israeli authorities overlook  their crimes. He pointed out that this situation causes things  to escalate dangerously and threatens the peace process.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Israeli Government must  immediately adopt measures to protect the Palestinians from such  hostile acts and that the world community must bear its  responsibility and provide international protection for the  Palestinians living under occupation. He remarked that this is  necessary because Israel is unable to maintain order in those  areas in line with international agreements and the Human Rights  Charter.    'Abd-al-Majid stressed the importance of adopting measures  to  prevent a recurrence of these hostile actions.</p>

Meanwhile, former President No Tae-u, aware of mounting  public criticism against his former secretary for foreign and  national security affairs, is trying to contact Kim to persuade  him not to seek permanent residency in the United States,  sources said.    No, who had been indifferent to the issue until recently,  was  unsuccessful in his attempt to get in touch with Kim in the  United States, they said.    Kim left the country shortly after he was implicated in an  investigation of alleged irregularities in the Yulgok project,  and was reported in recent weeks to have applied for permanent  U.S. residency or even political asylum.    One aide to No said Tuesday he fears that the former  president may ultimately have to take responsibility if Kim  fails to return to Korea. That's why "we have been asking  around if people know the whereabouts of Kim, but so far they  are not known," he added.    It was disclosed belatedly that Kim's 27-year-old son and  his  wife suddenly left the country for the United States at the end  of last December and speculation abounds here now that Kim had  already made careful preparations to settle down in the United  States for good.</p>

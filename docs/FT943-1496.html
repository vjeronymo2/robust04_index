			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel sells Harmac stake MacMillan Bloedel, the western Canadian forest products group, has agreed to sell its remaining 51 per cent stake in Harmac Pacific, the Vancouver-based pulp producer, for CDollars 192m (USDollars 143.2m). Macblo and Harmac will together sell 76,500 warrants to a syndicate of Canadian securities dealers. Each warrant is exercisable into a unit consisting of 100 Harmac common shares and a CDollars 1,000 convertible debenture. Macblo will sell its Harmac shares for CDollars 15.125 per share, payable in three instalments. Each Dollars 1,000 principal amount of the debentures is convertible at any time after the exercise of the special warrants into 60.061 shares. Of the total proceeds, Macblo will receive CDollars 115.7m, and Harmac CDollars 76.5m. Harmac was formed earlier this year as a vehicle for Macblo to spin off the bulk of its pulp operations. Macblo sold 49 per cent of Harmac to the public last May. Mr Bob Findlay, Macblo's president, said the divestiture of the pulp operations would enable the company to concentrate on its building materials, packaging and groundwood paper businesses.</p>

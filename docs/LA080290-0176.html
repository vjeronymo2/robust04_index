			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COURSES: 'EARTH KEEPERS';  </P> <P> BACK TO NATURE;  </P> <P> THE VENTURA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION OFFERS CHILDREN'S CLASSES IN  SAVING THE PLANET.  </P> <P> If your child chides you for wasting water or tossing out a soda can, here's a  way to channel that environmental energy.  </P> <P> Ventura's Department of Parks and Recreation is offering a series of four  Saturday classes designed for children 6 to 11 years old who are tuned in to  saving the planet.  </P> <P> Called "Earth Keepers," the classes will teach children about the earth through  games, crafts, experiments, nature walks, videos, music and special guests.  </P> <P> The classes will be held at Arroyo Verde Park from 10 to 11:30 a.m., beginning  Saturday. Each class is $5, and children can enroll in one or all of them.  Parents are encouraged to attend the classes at no charge.  </P> <P> To register, go to the recreation department at City Hall, 501 Poli St., Room  226. Or register by telephone with a credit card by calling 658-4726.  </P> <P> The first class, entitled "Rain Forests in Danger," will teach children the  importance of the rain forests, why they are diminishing and what can be done.  They'll see a World Wildlife Fund video called "Rain Forest Rap." They will  also play some games, do a craft and take a nature walk -- all designed to help  them understand better what a rain forest is.  </P> <P> "There will be a lot of active things -- they won't just sit around," said  Sharol Nelson-Embry, senior recreation leader for the city.  </P> <P> Endangered wildlife will be featured in the second class, Aug. 11. The children  will learn which animals are on the endangered species list, why, and what is  being done to protect them. Nelson-Embry said live animals, possibly a hawk,  may be brought in for a demonstration, and there may be a slide show. The  children will sing environmental songs by the Banana Slugs String Band, which  was featured during Ventura's Earth Day celebration.  </P> <P> In the third class, the children will delve into water conservation in a  playful way. They'll divide into teams and compete in a quiz about water.  They'll do experiments to see how plants use water, and they'll work on a craft  project that relates to the water cycle. The high point of the session will be  a visit from "Water Woman," -- alias Lana Sherman of the city's water  conservation office -- who will appear in rain garb and talk about saving  water.  </P> <P> The last class on Aug. 25 is entitled "Saving the Planet." It will focus on a  number of practical measures that can be taken to preserve the Earth --  everything from recycling and pollution to planting trees.  </P> <P> Using trash, the children will create a piece of art. They will see a video,  "The Lorax," based on a Dr. Seuss book about cutting down trees. They also will  get a visit from "Recycling Pete," a special guest from a bottle company.  </P> <P> "These are designed as parent-child classes," said Nelson-Embry. "Parents can  come and help, and learn and interact with their kid."  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: Ventura's Department of Parks and Recreation is offering a  series of four Saturday classes, entitled "Earth Keepers," for children 6 to 11  years old.

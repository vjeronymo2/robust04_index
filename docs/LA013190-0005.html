			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRAT WINS 'ABSENTEE BALLOT' ASSEMBLY RACE  </P> <P> Democrat Sal Cannella defeated Republican Richard Lang in a special state  Assembly election Tuesday in the northern San Joaquin Valley that attracted  widespread attention because of the unprecedented heavy use of absentee  ballots.  </P> <P> With all precincts reporting, Cannella had 31,000 votes or 53%. Lang, who  garnered 27,000 votes, late Tuesday conceded the race for the 27th Assembly  District seat, which includes Stanislaus County and part of Merced County.  </P> <P> Election officials estimated that about 60% of the voters who took part in the  contest cast mail ballots. That is a record in California legislative  elections, according to the secretary of state's office, and is more than  double the percentage of absentee ballots cast in state special elections  during the last five years.  </P> <P> Absentee ballots could be returned to the election departments or polling  stations in both counties until the polls closed at 8 p.m. About 30% of the  district's registered voters cast ballots Tuesday, officials said.  </P> <P> The aggressive pursuit of absentee ballots is becoming an increasingly common  campaign tactic, and political consultants consider the 27th District contest  to be a model for how California elections will be waged in the future.  </P> <P> Cannella, 47, a former machinist, has been Stanislaus County Supervisor since  1982. Lang, 52, who resigned as principal of a high school to run for the  Assembly, has been a Modesto City Council member for 13 years.  </P> <P> Tuesday's special election was called to fill the vacancy left when former  Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Democrat, won election to Congress last fall. Condit  replaced Democrat Tony Coelho, who resigned amid controversy over his personal  finances.  </P> <P> With Cannella's victory there now are 46 Democrats and 33 Republicans in the  state's lower house.  </P> <P> Voting by mail well in advance of the election is an effective campaign tool,  because these are votes that cannot be swayed by final-hour appeals from the  opposition. And campaign managers can track voting results well in advance of  election day and adjust their strategy according to early absentee returns.  </P> <P> Traditionally, absentee ballots were only used by people unable to visit the  polls on election day. But restrictions on mail ballots were lifted about 10  years ago. And in this election, campaign officials attempted to persuade all  voters to apply for absentee ballots. Both campaigns identified voters using  computerized data banks and sent out absentee ballot applications to party  members.  </P> <P> The applications, which included campaign pitches from other politicians, were  already filled out with the voter's name and address. All voters had to do was  sign the application and mail it to receive an absentee ballot.  </P> <P> Both campaign staffs followed up with phone calls and door-to-door visits to  ensure that voters sent in their applications and then mailed in their ballots.  </P> <P> The previous record for percentage of mail ballots cast was 39%, in the 1987  special congressional election in San Francisco between Democrat Nancy Pelosi  and Republican Harriet Ross, said Melissa Warren, a spokeswoman for the  secretary of state.  </P> <P> But one of the reasons the percentage was so high in that contest was because  so few total votes were cast, said Michael Yaki, an aide to Pelosi, who won the  election. There was a voter turnout of only 24%, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR OF LAWSUIT TO CLOSE 'SINATRA'  </P> <P> Nick Edenetti will close his "Sinatra" show at the Las Palmas Theatre in  Hollywood next Saturday in response to a request from theater owner Paolo  Greco, who feared legal action against the theater from Frank Sinatra.  </P> <P> Greco said he recently discovered a Dec. 5 letter to the theater from Sinatra  attorney Robert Finkelstein, asking him to cease "unauthorized exploitation of  Mr. Sinatra's name, likeness and voice."  </P> <P> Finkelstein had written a similar letter to Edenetti, which had been publicized  at the time. But Edenetti continued doing his show, and he said he had not  heard from the attorney since that date.  </P> <P> Edenetti said that Greco ordered the show closed because of the letter from  Sinatra's lawyer. Edenetti said he contacted Finkelstein on Thursday to inquire  if legal action was still planned against his show -- and he was told that it  was.  </P> <P> "It's our policy not to make any public statements," Finkelstein told The  Times.  </P> <P> Edenetti said he had invested more than $250,000 in the show and expected it to  begin breaking even around Valentine's Day.  </P></p>

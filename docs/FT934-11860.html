			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Treason charges on Hurd dropped A CHARGE OF treason against Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has been dismissed as 'misconceived and totally without foundation' by the Crown Prosecution Service. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, made the disclosure last night in a parliamentary written answer. He told Sir Teddy Taylor, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Southend East, that the CPS had written to the clerk to the justices at Hexham, Northumberland to inform them of the decision last week. Yesterday's developments came about six weeks after a last-ditch attempt to throttle the Maastricht treaty was made by laying seven charges of treason against the ministers who signed it - Mr Hurd and the former Treasury minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death penalty. The men behind the move were businessman and Conservative political economist Mr Rodney Atkinson - brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Mr Norris McWhirter, chairman of the Freedom Association. Mr McWhirter threatened a judicial review if the CPS did not act. Meanwhile, the government last night named the 24 local authority members who will serve on the EC's Council of the Regions. The move implements a requirement forced on ministers by a defeat during the tortuous passage of the Maastricht Act.</p>

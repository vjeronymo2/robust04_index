			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> RAND HONORS STUDENTS  </P> <P> As part of its "Adopt-A-School" program, the RAND Corp. this week honored 22  Santa Monica High School students who participated in the think tank's  three-month Distinguished Scholars Program.  </P> <P> Four of the students in the program, which teaches students the skills of  public policy analysis and is taught by doctoral candidates in the RAND  Graduate School, were cited for exceptional performance and received cash  awards.  </P> <P> Andrea Kantor received a $150 award and Henry Hecking, Joshua Levine and Marvin  Lai received $100 awards.  </P> <P> All 22 students were required to research and write a paper addressing some  aspect of one of four topics: the environment, the pro-life/pro-choice  controversy, the changing Soviet Union, and income distribution and poverty.  </P> <P> "It's not hard to get a high school student to make recommendations about how  to solve a problem," said Richard Robinson, who coordinated the program while  working on his own dissertation, "but it's hard to get them to think about why  they're making those recommendations. We hope the program taught them how to  look at the context of a public policy issue and how to develop appropriate  measures for alternative solutions."  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Church more than doubled at Pounds 565,000 CHURCH &amp; Co, the shoe maker and retailer, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 244,000 to Pounds 565,000 in the six months to June 30 on sales up 11 per cent to Pounds 33.1m. The company attributed the advance to a sharply improved performance at Church Footwear and Joseph Cheaney, the UK manufacturing subsidiaries and at A Jones, which operates all the Church and Jones shops in the UK. The situation overseas, however, continued to be difficult. The US and Canadian companies sustained losses in highly competitive trading conditions and moves were under way to strengthen Canadian management. Profits from Belgium were marginally lower and the French retail company incurred a small loss. The interim dividend is maintained at 3p on earnings per share of 2.8p (1.9p). A Jones benefited from improved trading conditions for UK shoe retailing and achieved a turnround from losses of Pounds 26,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds 279,000. Sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 14.8m.</p>

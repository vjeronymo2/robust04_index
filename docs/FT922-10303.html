			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / How green is my valley (now): A garden festival will open today on a former steelworks site IT WILL be 'the major holiday attraction in Britain this year'. So says Mr Philip Weekes of the Ebbw Vale garden festival, which starts today. Mr Weekes, a former regional director of the National Coal Board, is chairman of the festival in the former steel town where Gwent edges into the Brecon Beacons. He says the event will help to show that what was once a coal and steel centre can now sustain a quite different sort of life. Ebbw Vale will be the last in the series of five big garden festivals held after an experiment launched a decade ago in Liverpool's docklands by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary. About a third of the Pounds 60m cost of mounting the festival on land which was once the home of a steelworks has been met by the Welsh Development Agency for reclaiming wasteland. While British Steel still has a rolling mill nearby the days of industrialisation have long gone. However, Ebbw Vale's location is likely to work against it. By the time it closes on October 4, the number of visitors is likely to be far short of the 3m-plus that visited each of the previous festivals in Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, Glasgow and Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear. It may be lucky to attract even 2m visitors because access is extremely poor. There is no passenger railway link, and Ebbw Vale lies some 20 miles north of the M4 along a narrow road. On days when more than 30,000 visitors are expected, long traffic delays are likely. The festival is likely to encounter the same difficulties in covering its costs as the previous four festivals. Mr Weekes admits that raising sponsorship has been 'difficult'. Local corporations such as Hoover, Welsh Water, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and the development agency as well as national groups such as British Steel and British Coal all have pavilions or have contributed in other ways. But the festival management would have liked more. This will also be the festival in which the horticulture industry has played the smallest part. The organisers boast of 300,000 trees and 450,000 shrubs, but this is essentially a garden festival without any significant contribution from the gardening industry. Garden festivals originated in Germany after the Second World War and were adopted by Mr Michael Heseltine after the 1981 riots in Liverpool as a way of helping run-down industrial areas. The success of garden festivals is measured by the long-term impact on the area in terms of investment, image building and job creation as well as numbers of visitors. The Stoke-on-Trent festival, held on the site of the former Shelton steelworks, attracted 3.5m visitors and managed to win a record Pounds 130m of investment after the festival. Of the four festivals held so far, Glasgow has been the most successful in terms of numbers, with more than 4m visitors. But the long-term benefits there totalled only Pounds 85m. Considering the after-use value of the Liverpool festival, the Department of the Environment says: 'In net additional terms, (the) benefits are very small'. Gateshead has yet to be evaluated. Wales has been remarkably successful in attracting inward investment and it is hoped big companies will come to the area as a result of the festival. More than Pounds 50m of investment in offices, houses, shops, leisure facilities and small industrial plants is expected, with up to 1,100 jobs eventually being created. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, who has enthusiastically backed the festival, says confidently: 'This will be the best of the five. The Welsh Development Agency has already built 20,000 sq ft of space and these will be available immediately after the last visitor has left.' Neither Liverpool nor Stoke-on-Trent covered the costs of staging their garden festivals, but Mr Weekes and his team are convinced they can do better. 'This will be the most exciting of the festivals,' he says. 'And when it is all over we shall leave behind not just something of benefit to the community but also a new view of Wales in the minds of those who have visited us.'</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / US income up for seventh straight month Personal income in the US rose 0.4 per cent in August, the seventh straight monthly increase, but failed to keep pace with a 0.9 per cent jump in spending, the government said yesterday. The spending increase was the largest since it rose by 1.3 per cent in February. The Commerce Department also reported that disposable income - income after taxes - rose 0.5 per cent in August. Financial markets were mixed on the news. Treasury bond prices fell slightly, and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6 points, later ending the day 11.44 down at 3,843.19. The spending increase was greater than many analysts expected. During July, personal income increased 0.5 per cent, while spending rose 0.3 per cent. Income last fell in January, when it slipped 0.6 per cent. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, was up for the fourth straight month and six of the last seven. The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans' savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income  - was 3.8 per cent in August, compared to a revised 4.2 per cent the previous month. The Commerce Department previously pegged the savings rate at 4.1 per cent for July.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: All-Share changes WHEN the FT-Actuaries All-Share index first saw the light of day in 1962, it contained sectors such as shipbuilding, rubber manufacturing, and discount houses. Thirty years later, the British economy has changed greatly, thanks to the growth of service industries, the decline of manufacturing, and the privatisation of utilities. The indices that carry the FT name have changed too, and from January 1994 they will change again, with the introduction of such new industry sectors as gas distribution, medical ancillaries and support services. The work of reclassification is huge. It has been accomplished largely as a result of a partnership, cemented last year, between the Financial Times, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and the London Stock Exchange. This agreement gives the FT-SE 100, the All-Share and the rest of the shared family of indices a consistent set of rules, overseen by independent committees of market participants. One of these groups, the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee, has carried the burden of re-assessing the industry sectors for the UK market. They have achieved three significant improvements. First, each individual industry sector has been redefined to meet the activities of today's companies, rather than those of yesterday. Second, the stock exchange's much more detailed classification has been incorporated into the new conceptual framework, so it now forms the bottom tier of industrial 'sub-sectors'. Third, the old 'economic groups', the broad industrial categories such as capital goods, the consumer group, the industrial group and so on, have been radically overhauled, to yield groupings which cluster together industries that move in step through the economic cycle. Not every one will be happy with the changes, at least at first. Some companies will dislike their new homes; some investors will be unhappy at the loss of familiar sectors. The committee is happy to listen to those companies which believe they have been misclassified. And back histories of the new sectors, already calculated, give the new classification an instant pedigree. Most important, perhaps, the reclassification is based on a consistent set of principles, now published explicitly. It reflects the desire to make the governance of the indices transparent and independent. The sponsors of the indices - the FT, the stock exchange and the actuaries - are keen to acknowledge their debt to the people who did the work, the members of the classification committee. The investment world will benefit from their efforts for years to come.</p>

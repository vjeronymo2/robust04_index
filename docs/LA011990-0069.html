			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: COUNCIL'S CLASS WAR OVER REFORM  </P> <P> A casual observer might not recognize the Los Angeles City Council's hostility  to the proposed municipal ethics law as class warfare, but that's just what it  is.  </P> <P> The law would create a city ethics commission to enforce rigorous new rules  governing campaign financing, and define and prohibit conflicts of interest. It  would apply to a number of top city officials, including the council members.  </P> <P> The hostility comes more from the council members' dislike of Westside  reformers than from their fear of being watched by ethics cops. The symbolic  target of their hostility is an affluent neighborhood around San Vicente  Boulevard that happens to be the home of several prominent and rich activists  in reform politics -- Brentwood.  </P> <P> To council members, who consider themselves the blue-collar workers of  politics, Brentwood means affluent goat-cheese-and-sun-dried-tomato-loving  dilettantes imposing their arrogant notion of a moral code of behavior on men  and women struggling to survive on the assembly line of public life. "The  Brentwood perspective," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called it.  </P> <P> There are, of course, other reasons why council members oppose the proposed  ethics patrol. Some council members walk perilously close to the outer limits  of ethical standards. Lobbyists for politically generous land developers are  welcomed in council offices while unknown constituents beg for appointments.  But that's not the whole story.  </P> <P> The ethics code was written by a citizens' committee appointed by Mayor Tom  Bradley after he got caught in political scandal. The commission head, Geoffrey  Cowan, a wealthy lawyer and political reform veteran, assembled a diverse group  to do the work. It is not a commission of the rich.  </P> <P> But much of the actual drafting of the code was done by a group of Westside  attorneys who have been fighting for political reform for years. For Cowan, Bob  Stern, Tracy Westen, John Phillips and a few others, this was a long-awaited  chance to clean up a city political system they have long considered corrupt.  Council members know them -- and resent their scorn.  </P> <P> Rather than follow the example of the Ten Commandments or the Constitution --  strong but general language -- the attorneys, in lawyer-like manner, tried to  spell out remedies for every possible political sin.  </P> <P> Confronted with this detailed set of rules, written by people they can't stand,  it's no wonder even the most ethical council members rebelled. Three examples  illustrate the point:  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter was elected as a reformer after slogging through the  neighborhoods of Crenshaw, Mar Vista, Venice and Westchester. With strong  grass-roots support, she defeated a better-financed incumbent.  </P> <P> Galanter has a reputation for being an honest public servant. That's why she  objects to the idea of being under perpetual scrutiny when she hasn't done  anything wrong.  </P> <P> That same feeling motivated Councilman Joel Wachs, who joined with Yaroslavsky  in winning approval of an amendment narrowing one portion of the code. Rather  than banning all gifts and honorariums, the code now bars council members from  accepting them from lobbyists or those dealing with the city.  </P> <P> Wachs was elected as a reformer in 1971, long before reform became fashionable.  With his father's money and a large number of volunteers, Wachs beat a a  well-financed, entrenched incumbent supported by developers.  </P> <P> A third example involves a veteran council staff member who, like Wachs and  Galanter, is considered to be an upright person. Cindy Miscikowski is the top  aide to Councilman Marvin Braude, an ethics reform advocate who represents  Brentwood. Her husband is Doug Ring, an influential lawyer-lobbyist for land  developers.  </P> <P> Ring, testifying before the council Wednesday, said the proposed code would  force him to disclose the names of all his clients -- and those of the 29 other  members of his firm. That's because the statute requires disclosure of income  earned by an official's spouse. "I'd have to cease to participate in my law  firm or cease to participate in my marriage," said Ring.  </P> <P> Since Miscikowski is popular with council members, Ring's testimony had an  impact. It fed the resentment of council members that they were being pushed  around unfairly.  </P> <P> That resentment fueled the council's last two days of debate and the result was  a weakened campaign reform proposal.  </P> <P> The reformers may have mastered the legal side of the ethics question. But they  forgot that victory goes to those who understand that politicians are driven by  the same complex motives that drive the rest of us.  </P></p>

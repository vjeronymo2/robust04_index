			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Info' fund put on hold - At a glance The launch of the Infostructure investment trust by BZW and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is being postponed until the new year because of the continuing poor market for new issues. The trust plans to specialise in emerging markets' companies involved in advertising, telecommunications, software, broadcasting, and other elements of the 'information infrastructure'. David Cohen, of SGST, said that although the trust might have achieved its stated minimum target of Pounds 40m this autumn, he thought investors would be more confident in 1995.

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN OLD WARRIOR;  </P> <P> MCLARNIN, 81, RECALLS HARD DAYS OF BOXING  </P> <P> They shared hard times, those tough, rock-hard young men of America's  Depression, and they fought one another savagely.  </P> <P> Their names alone evoke a richness of the American melting pot and the American  dream: Canzoneri, Ross, McLarnin, Petrolle, Apostoli, Zivic . . . and maybe the  greatest of them all, Henry Armstrong.  </P> <P> They're nearly all gone now, the great welterweights and middleweights of the  Depression era. Tony Canzoneri, Barney Ross, Billy Petrolle, Fred Apostoli,  Fritzie Zivic and Armstrong . . . all gone.  </P> <P> Still with us, however, is Jimmy McLarnin, two-time welterweight champion, who  at 81, is happy, wealthy and wise.  </P> <P> He has lived in the same house on a quiet, leafy Glendale street the last 40  years.  </P> <P> Jimmy McLarnin is older than the memories of practically everyone who attends  boxing shows in Southern California today. He fought in Los Angeles before  there was an Olympic Auditorium. Calvin Coolidge was President when McLarnin  was a hungry, 16-year-old making his debut at Vernon Arena in September, 1924.  </P> <P> Today, his only concessions to age are arthritic hands, and a nearly empty  house. His wife of 52 years, Lillian, died last year. His four children live in  the northwest and British Columbia, and Jimmy talks of selling the old Glendale  house and moving closer to his children. "I'm in good health; I'm thankful for  that," he said the other day. "I watch my diet. I'm at 150 pounds now, three  pounds over my fighting weight. And I walk two to three miles every day."  </P> <P> McLarnin talked about the old days, about a special bond the young battlers of  the 1930s America shared.  </P> <P> "Of all the hundreds of fighters I came in contact with in my life, I can say I  can't think of a one who I didn't like and who didn't turn out to be at least a  halfway decent human being," he said.  </P> <P> "Boxing is a whipping boy for a lot of people, but look at all the guys who  made something of themselves with boxing. Look at Jack Dempsey. He was a bum, a  hobo. And he became a champion, and a pretty decent human being.  </P> <P> "The fighters in those days . . . we all came up hungry together. None of us  had it easy coming up. Our fathers worked like dogs. In a way, we loved each  other. I mean, you'd try to beat a guy's brains out in the ring, but before and  after a fight, I admired all the guys I fought. They'd gone through everything  I had to go through."  </P> <P> The old fighter showed a visitor his trophy room. He leafed through a stack of  old photographs. He pulled out a faded photo of a group of about 15 young boys,  all staring intently into the camera.  </P> <P> "I'm in this picture," he said. "It's a group of newsboys in Vancouver, when I  was a little kid. Can you find me?"  </P> <P> It was easy. Last one on the right, second row. There was an unmistakable  fierceness to the little lean face. The glare from his stare leaped out, from  70-odd years ago.  </P> <P> McLarnin laughed, and showed some old photos from his golf days at Lakeside  Golf Club.  </P> <P> "That's Bing Crosby. That's Pat O'Brien. Here I am with Spencer Tracy. . . . I  got my handicap down to three at one point. I was livin' pretty good in those  days, after I retired from fighting, in 1936."  </P> <P> McLarnin says he doesn't pay much attention to the boxing scene today.  </P> <P> "There are so many champions, I can't keep track of what's going on," he said.  </P> <P> James Archibald McLarnin turned pro in Vancouver when he was 15 and had 77  bouts in 13 years. Within 16 months in 1933 and 1934, he won and lost the  welterweight championship twice.  </P> <P> At Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, he knocked out Raffaele Capabianca Giordano --  known then as Young Corbett III -- of Fresno, winning the title the first time.  </P> <P> McLarnin lost the championship a year later to Barney Ross, won it back in the  rematch and lost it again in the rubber match.  </P> <P> In 1936, he lost and won decisions with Canzoneri, won a decision over Lou  Ambers, and retired.  </P> <P> The list of McLarnin's opponents reads like a page from boxing's Who's Who. He  fought 'em all, as they say. But the old champion was stumped when asked to  single out the toughest man he had fought.  </P> <P> "Gosh, so many great fighters," he said. "I could never say one guy was better  than the others. But I will say that Billy Petrolle hit me as hard as anyone  ever did. He was a tough, tough guy. He hit me so hard in the second round of  my fight (in 1930) with him that afterward I couldn't remember a thing from  Rounds 2 through 7."  </P> <P> McLarnin lost a decision to Petrolle in 1930, then defeated him twice in 1931.  </P> <P> "And Louis (Kid) Kaplan -- oh, could he hit. He knocked me down three times in  1927 and broke my jaw. After the fight (won by McLarnin on a knockout), I  remember my teeth didn't fit together the same, but I didn't think much about  it.  </P> <P> "Three years later, a dentist asked me: 'How did you break your jaw?' Kaplan  had broken my jaw and I'd never known it.  </P> <P> "Maybe the meanest guy I ever fought was Bud Taylor. He was a vicious . . . ,  really tough. I fought him in 1925, when I was just a kid and had no business  in there with him. I remember the first time I fought him, in Vernon, it was my  biggest payday by far at the time, $1,500. He beat me twice and I won one on a  foul.  </P> <P> "Barney Ross was a really tough opponent. He was a great boxer and had a great  chin. I can remember getting him right on the chin with some of the best shots  I ever hit anyone with and he didn't even blink.  </P> <P> "The greatest fighter of my era, but a guy I never fought, was Harry Greb. I  fought on an undercard of his in Oakland, in 1924. He was blind in one eye, and  fought you kind of twisted sideways, so he could see you. In his prime, he  might have been the best there ever was. He was a middleweight and heavyweights  wanted no part of him."  </P> <P> In talking of the old days, McLarnin frequently refers to the hard work it took  to be a world-class fighter. It was a work ethic acquired from a hard-working  father, he said.  </P> <P> "My father was a beautiful man," he said. "He was as hard-working and as  talented a man as I ever knew. My father could do anything. He never had a lot  of money, but he raised six sons and six daughters and showed all of us what  hard work is."  </P> <P> McLarnin was born in Inchacore, Ireland, and was 3 when his father booked  third-class passage to Canada in 1910.  </P> <P> "We went first to Saskatchewan, where my father got a section of land and  raised wheat for 15 cents a bushel," McLarnin said.  </P> <P> "We later went to Vancouver. My father was in the lumber business, the  furniture business and he was a butcher. He could even fix shoes."  </P> <P> In his mid-teens, McLarnin fell under the influence of a popular Vancouver  boxing instructor, Charles (Pop) Foster, and thus began a relationship that  endured for 40 years.  </P> <P> McLarnin has a framed portrait of Foster on the wall of his den. When Foster  died in 1956, he left $200,000 to McLarnin.  </P> <P> "Pop really cared about me, and he brought me along very carefully," he said.  "No fighter ever had a better manager than I did. I was a natural right-hander  and he never had to help me with the right. But he spent two years with me  getting my left jab ready before I turned pro."  </P> <P> One of Foster's tips earned McLarnin his welterweight championship.  </P> <P> "Young Corbett was a great fighter, but he made one mistake -- he took me for a  pigeon," McLarnin said.  </P> <P> "Corbett was a defensive fighter, but Pop had noticed he had a habit of leaning  forward slightly just before he threw his right hand. So we planned to let him  do that a few times early in the fight, sucker him in, then try to catch him  with a left hook.  </P> <P> "And that's exactly the way it happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> March 29, 1933. New, three-bedroom homes in West L.A. were going for $3,200. A  new Ford V-8 cost $490. It cost 25 cents to see "King Kong" at the RKO  Hillstreet.  </P> <P>  A crowd of 50,000 saw Babe Ruth hit three home runs against the Chicago White  Sox at Yankee Stadium the day before, and 15,000 saw Jimmy McLarnin win the  welterweight championship at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> The old champion is on his feet now, dancing softly across the carpet. He  flicks out left jabs, demonstrating the set-up punches for that knockout.  </P> <P> "He did it once (he leans forward), I watched him carefully -- then I let him  do it again," McLarnin said, from his fighting stance.  </P> <P> "And when he did it the third time -- Bing! (he throws a hard, quick left hook)  I got him. A perfect punch, a left hook right on the chin. He went down flat,  got up but could hardly stand. I knocked him into the ropes, and the referee  stopped it."  </P> <P> McLarnin smiled broadly at the memory, which has always been a sweet one for  him because his 71-year-old father, Samuel McLarnin, was at ringside that night  in 1933.  </P> <P> But then McLarnin grew frustrated at not being able to remember the referee  (George Blake) who awarded him the title that night.  </P> <P> The day after the fight, The Times started the story -- "McLarnin Is Ring King"  -- on Page 1, and described near-riotous conditions when deliriously happy  McLarnin fans tried to storm the ring to reach their new champion.  </P> <P> Fifty-six years later, both challenger and champion from that night are still  alive. Corbett is 84, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and lives in a rest  home near Fresno. His wife attributes his illness to head injuries suffered in  an auto accident in the 1950s.  </P> <P> McLarnin earned between $700,000 and $800,000 in Depression dollars in his  fighting days. His biggest purse was $60,000 for the final fight against Ross.  He earned $50,000 in 1929 for beating Sammy Mandell in Chicago. During the  1930s, he said, he never earned less than $20,000 for a fight.  </P> <P> And earn it he did, he said, proudly. Always, the work ethic.  </P> <P> "I got a dollar for my first fight and $25,000 for my last one, and in between  there was a lot of tough, hard work," he said.  </P></p>

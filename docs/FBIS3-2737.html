			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, March 11 (XINHUA) -- The "Three North"  (northeast, northwest and north China) afforestation project  carried out over the past 15 years has begun to produce great  economic benefits for the areas involved.    The "Three North" forest belt extends from the Ozbel  mountain  pass in China's far northwest to Binxian county in northeast  China's Heilongjiang Province, with 13 provinces, municipalities  and autonomous regions involved.    Statistics reveal that the "Three-North" areas have been  blessed with an annual increase of over three billion kg of  grain harvest thanks to the trees that protect farmland in these  areas, which used to suffer from serious soil erosion and  sandstorms.    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the  State Council decided in late 1978 to build the giant forest  belt in the northern part of China, which is designed to protect  42.4 percent of China's landmass.    According to the plan, beginning from 1978, China is to take  72 years to plant 35.6 million ha of trees and raise the forest  cover percentage from 5.05 percent to 14.95 percent in the areas  involved.    Over the past 15 years, with 3.232 billion yuan from the  central government and related departments, local farmers have  put in 1.5 billion work days and have planted about 13 million  ha of trees, enclosed six million ha of hillsides and drifting  sand to facilitate afforestation, besides carrying out aerial  seeding on 60,000 ha of land and planting 5.5 billion trees.    Moreover, trees have been planted along 11 million ha of  farmland in the Three-North areas. The efforts have greatly  improved the ecological environment in the localities involved  and enabled a steady and high output in rural and pastoral areas.    Because of the building of the forest belt, the output of  forage grass has increased by 20 percent in pastoral areas,  which are able to feed two million more head of sheep a year.    The afforestation drive has also played a positive role in  controlling soil erosion on the loess plateau, according to  forestry officials.    Local forestry departments have listed the work of combining  afforestation, industry and trade as an important step for  deepening reform.    Incomplete statistics show that more than 3,000 industrial  "green" projects have been established in the Three-North areas,  creating 90.5 million yuan in extra income a year.    Li Jianshu, director of the Three-North Forest Belt  Construction Bureau under the Ministry of Forestry, attributes  the success to the fostering of a selfless spirit among workers,  the adoption of a multi-channel fund-raising system and wide  application of practical scientific techniques. At the same  time, flexible policies have been adopted to encourage more  individuals to plant trees in addition to government and  collective efforts.</p>

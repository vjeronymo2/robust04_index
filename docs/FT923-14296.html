			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bill targets use of tax havens AN ATTEMPT to prohibit transactions between British organisations and overseas tax havens will get under way in the Commons this afternoon. Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, is to promote a backbencher's bill to prevent the secrecy of such regimes contributing to financial fraud. The measure would prevent any trustee, director of a public company or director of a management company of a collective investment scheme from carrying out any transactions with organisations based in or controlled from a tax haven. Banks and investment companies that had close links with business in a tax haven would lose their authorisation. 'The whole Maxwell affair and many other financial scandals could have been prevented if we had laws prohibiting financial transactions with tax havens such as Liechtenstein, Panama and the British Virgin Islands,' Mr Shaw said yesterday. The bill would introduce severe penalties for anyone breaking the prohibition. If someone had been the cause of people's losing more than Pounds 1m and that money had not been recovered, the maximum fine would be Pounds 3m as well as a prison sentence of up to 30 years. Although the bill is unlikely to be defeated today, it stands no chance of becoming law, because the government is prepared to block it at the next stage of its progress. Ministers argue that the measure amounts to penalising jurisdictions with low tax rates - not all of which have lax supervisory arrangements. They also fear that sanctions against tax havens that are UK dependent territories might damage their offshore finance sectors. Mr Shaw's bill specifically defines a tax haven in terms not of its tax rate but of its laws on disclosure of financial information if money is lost, and on the prospect of recovering such money. Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Shaw was promoting the measure, but welcomed it as 'something a Labour government should have done years ago'.</p>

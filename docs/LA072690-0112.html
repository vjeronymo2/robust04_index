			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS DEBATING WHEN TO REPLACE  CHAFFEE  </P> <P> After a second session behind closed doors, the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors Wednesday failed to make a final decision on whether Robert L.  Chaffee, who resigned last week as chief of the county's Department for  Children's Services, should remain in office until October or be replaced  immediately by an interim director.  </P> <P> However, the board is leaning toward hiring an interim director, and is  seriously considering asking a retired judge to take the job, according to  Supervisor Ed Edelman and an aide to Supervisor Michael Antonovich.  </P> <P> Neither Edelman, who has been pressing for an interim director, nor the  Antonovich aide would name the judge, and both said that the judge is not  certain he can accept the job. "We don't have a definite commitment" Edelman  said. "The point is we are moving in that direction, which is the direction  that I favor."  </P> <P> Chaffee resigned last week amid mounting criticism of his agency.  </P></p>

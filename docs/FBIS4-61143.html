			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["BS-Press" report: "Traffic Is Moving Again Along the </F> Zugdidi-Mestia Highway"]    [Text] The press service of the Georgian Ministry of  Internal Affairs [MVD] has stated that, as a result of  operations conducted by the police in western Georgia, the  Zugdidi-Mestia highway has been opened up to traffic. During  the last year and a half, it has been under the control of armed  supporters of the ex-president [Zviad Gamsakhurdia] and local  bandits. During all this time, food products and other goods  were delivered to Mestia -- the center of Svanetia -- by  helicopter.    Colonel Korneli Chiladze, deputy minister of internal  affairs, is supervising measures to guard the Zugdidi-Mestia  highway. As the MVD press service points out, a big factor in  the success of the operation was the support given to the police  by the local population.</p>

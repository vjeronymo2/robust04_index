			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 3i increases net asset value by 6.7% to 334p 3i, the recently floated venture capital group, yesterday reported a 6.7 per cent increase in net asset value per share to 334p in the six months to September 30. Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said that the group, which came to the market in July, had continued to concentrate on its core business activity of investment in small and medium-sized companies in the UK and continental Europe. 'Our business in these areas has been very active compared to the same period last year,' he said. 3i is paying an interim dividend of 2.8p. Sir George Russell, chairman, said this represented an increase of 7 per cent on last year's interim - paid prior to flotation - together with bringing forward 0.75p of the final in order to reduce disparity between the interim and final dividends. The total return - a combination of dividend revenue less costs and net interest, realised investment profits and the appreciation of the unrealised portfolio - was Pounds 140m compared with Pounds 151m, representing a six months return on shareholders' funds of 7.6 per cent. Mr Macpherson noted that the total return to shareholders had been achieved in a business climate, 'that has been satisfactory for investment and disinvestment, but which has seen declines in most UK stock market indices, and some evidence in recent months of a levelling off in the rate of improvement in confidence amongst businessmen, compared to the steady improvement which we saw during the previous year.' Pre-tax revenue rose by 12 per cent from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 42.2m. This was helped by a surge in fees and commissions, which jumped from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 13m mainly reflecting the much higher levels of gross investment and a first time contribution from the management of a fund for continental European investments. Gross dividends from equity investments rose from Pounds 34.8m to Pounds 35.4m, despite the reduction in ACT credit from 22.5 per cent to 20 per cent. Within the total return, after-tax revenue rose by 17 per cent from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 33m. The group made realised capital profits, after losses and provisions, of Pounds 61.5m compared with Pounds 30.6m a year earlier. However unrealised growth in the value of investments appreciation was lower at Pounds 88.9m, against Pounds 136.3m. 3i invested Pounds 246.2m during the first six months, compared with Pounds 132.9m. Investment in the UK was particularly high and the group invested Pounds 230m in 321 businesses in the six months, compared with Pounds 116m in 245 businesses in the 1993 period. Much of this was in management buy-outs and buy-ins.</p>

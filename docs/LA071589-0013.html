			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAST-FEEDING IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> While students in China are facing machine guns in the name of liberty and the  Supreme Court in Washington is deciding questions of, literally, life, death  and the American flag, our own defender of the Constitution, Gloria Allred, is  prosecuting a civil rights case on behalf of a woman who did not want to be  told by a restaurant that she would have to breast-feed her child discreetly or  in the restroom.  </P> <P> After fighting this case for five years, and losing, Allred naturally held a  press conference to announce another appeal. Perhaps if the press stopped  covering her nonsense she would go away.  </P> <P> I. NELSON ROSE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

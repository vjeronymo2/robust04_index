			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / BASF in Siberian venture: Polyethylene plant to use cheap natural gas BASF of Germany and Gazprom of Russia yesterday announced they would construct a substantial ethylene and polyethylene complex in west Siberia, costing between DM1.2bn and DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m). The plant, to be located at Novyi Urengoi, will have a capacity of 340,000 tonnes of ethylene a year and 300,000 tonnes a year of low-density polyethylene. Construction should start in 1995 and be completed two years later. The announcement is a disappointment for Union Carbide of the US, which had been tendering for the project. The Russian complex will have a cost advantage because it will use cheap natural gas for its raw material rather than the more expensive naphtha used by most western polyethylene manufacturers. The plant will also add significantly to overcapacity afflicting the west European petrochemicals industry. BASF is due to start production at its 600,000 tonnes-a-year complex at Antwerp at the end of this year. BASF insisted the production would be used to meet Russian domestic demand. According to Gazprom, Russia consumes only 5kg per capita of polyethylene. Financing for the project has yet to be decided. Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, said BASF would own less than 50 per cent of the plant. The group has been reluctant to be an equity partner in a project so far from Germany. German engineering groups Linde and Salzgitter were named by BASF as candidates for constructing the ethane cracker and LDPE plant respectively, although Mr Strube said as much as possible would be conducted by Russian sub-contractors. BASF and Gazprom, which already have a joint venture in methanol at Arkhangelsk in northern Russia, are also considering building a natural gas pipeline from the Siberian peninsula of Yamal to western Europe. Analysts believe the gas, marketed through BASF's Wintershall subsidiary, could be used to pay for some of the German company's contribution to the project.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: BASF Bulk petrochemicals have always been a cyclical business, but on the evidence of yesterday's interim results from BASF the cycle is in danger of getting out of hand. The problem is one of chronic over-capacity rather than exceptionally weak demand: the result is that margins are under intense pressure and profits are down 37 per cent. The company sees no significant improvement until 1997. This view may reflect a peculiarly German perspective on the economic cycle, but Hoechst and Bayer are no more optimistic on the immediate prospects. The big producers will hope that September price increases stick this time around, but with additional ethylene capacity coming on stream in Europe in the second half the odds seem stacked against them. Additional spending on environmental protection, particularly in Germany, and the weakness of the dollar only adds to pressure on the bottom line. Unlike its main German competitors, BASF is not cushioned from the chemicals cycle by a large and profitable pharmaceuticals business. The consumer division based on magnetic tapes is, if anything, faring worse than plastics. Whether the dividend can escape unscathed may hinge on the tax treatment of substantial restructuring costs expected in the second half. Little wonder the company is looking for new sources of earnings. Research spending on pharmaceuticals has risen and heavy investment in piping Russian natural gas into Germany continues. The project could still pay a handsome return, although its outcome hangs on political stability in Moscow until supply contracts have been signed with North Sea producers.</p>

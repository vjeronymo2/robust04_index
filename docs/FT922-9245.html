			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Walesa seeks resolution to Polish crisis PRESIDENT Lech Walesa is today expected to outline his views on how to resolve the crisis which led to the resignation of the Polish finance minister earlier this week. International Monetary Fund officials meanwhile continued their talks on Poland's economic future in a meeting with Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister. The continuing talks are partly aimed at demonstrating that a new IMF agreement is still possible, despite Wednesday's parliamentary vote for higher government spending, which led to the resignation of Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister. Mr Michel Deppler, the deputy head of the IMF's European Department, said that the Fund team will stay in Warsaw until its scheduled departure date of May 12. Mr Mark Allen, the IMF representative in Warsaw, added that the talks were based on 'the understanding that the Polish Government's objective is to contain the fiscal deficit this year to 5 per cent of GDP and to reduce it in subsequent years'. He added that an agreement would be possible once it was clear that this aim could be achieved. Agreement with the Fund is essential if Poland is to be able to draw on a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) extended facility granted last year. This was later suspended when the government allowed the budget deficit to overshoot its agreed target. President Walesa is expected to address parliament today when he could formally propose that he be granted greater constitutional powers to nominate and dismiss the cabinet. The government at present is appointed by parliament. But he has said that he will stop short of demanding Mr Jan Olszewski's resignation, appealing for 'more dynamic government' instead. Mr Walesa meanwhile signalled continuing confidence in Mr Olechowski, whom he has mentioned as one of the possible candidates for the post of prime minister. Parliament yesterday opened a debate on a series of draft laws which provide for cuts in welfare payments, pensions and unemployment benefits originally designed to keep the budget deficit within limits acceptable to the IMF.</p>

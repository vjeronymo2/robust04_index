These principles have three focal  points: cooperation in the political, economic, and military  fields.    He added: We hope that cooperation among us in the political  field will increase. As for economic cooperation, we will  continue discussing the agreements reached in the recent meeting  held by the finance ministers. Concerning military cooperation,  it is carried out on a bilateral level among the eight  countries. He said: We are happy to meet in Damascus in order  to renew the principles of the Damascus Declaration that were  announced in Damascus.    In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Shaykh Hamad  Bin-Jasim Al Thani said: We, in Qatar, are concerned to have  the Damascus Declaration as a nucleus for understanding and a  new Arab order. During this meeting, we will hold discussions  with the rest of the ministers on certain developments in the  Arab arena as well as other developments to serve the Damascus  Declaration countries and the Arab nation.

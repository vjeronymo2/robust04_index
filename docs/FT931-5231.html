			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Stage set for Antwerp - Antony Thorncroft finds the new Cultural Capital of Europe looking a treat some might say the poisoned chalice - is passed on. In the High Renaissance Town Hall of Antwerp on March 26 Madrid hands over to the Flanders city the sobriquet 'Cultural Capital of Europe'. Antwerp must make of it what it can. Some cultural capitals, (Berlin, Glasgow) are credited with using the arts to strengthen the long term prosperity of the city; others (Dublin, Madrid) are reckoned to have muffed their chances. Antwerp, city of Rubens, Van Dyck and Jordaens, a cocky, attractive, regional metropolis, is taking its responsibility to culture seriously. The opening weekend says it all. The centrepiece production in the beautifully restored Bourla Theatre is not some European classic by Shakespeare, Moliere or Schiller, but a new play about Sarajevo, 'a lament for a city' by the Bosnian director Haris Pasovic. The mayor of Antwerp was not too pleased with the choice but the director of Antwerp 93, Eric Antonis, has firm views on the need for the arts to provoke society. He is not seeking large audiences for the 700 odd events in the Festival. He just wants to make sure that the audience is challenged. 'The arts are the research department for society. After 1993 I want the people to agree that the arts have a place'. Not that the opening weekend is didactic. To satisfy the popular appetite for high culture a major show of the work of Jacob Jordaens, a earthy contemporary of Rubens, is guaranteed to pack them in; there are classical concerts in the churches; and the streets, to say nothing of the 2,000 bars, will be heaving with wandering bands, embracing thousands of musicians. The Antwerp poet Paul Van Ostayen wrote a poem in 1928 entitled 'The Occupied City' and this will be writ large, literally, over a city besieged by the arts, mostly al fresco. There are two nicely contrasted strands to Antwerp 93. One looks outward, exploiting Antwerp's position as the second port of Europe, a city which has always been open to new ideas - and new conquerors. So there is a wealth of foreign arts ventures. Not big name orchestras, nor national opera companies, nor famous dance troupes, but projects like the Ark, a converted barge which will be home and performance space to artists from 14 cities in the grip of change like Los Angeles, St Petersburg and Marseilles. A young director from each has been invited to bring over a team to devise shows that convey the flavour of their current cultural life. In the same creative turmoil Antwerp is commissioning four new operas, pulling in contributions from composers, lyricists, designers, etc, who have never worked together before. It is also planning to publish the work of 100 selected European writers, in many languages, converting intellectual workshops into a permanent record, an expensive post-modernist folly. It is commissioning 10 new sculptures for one of the city's parks. This is all avant-garde stuff, but Antonis is keen to make things which 'would not be done by others if we didn't do it'. This extends to early music: Flanders enjoyed an intellectual peak around 1500, and polyphonic music features boldly in the programme. Of course the paymasters at city, region, and national level are worried that Antwerp 93 might seem elitist. So Antonis is equally concerned to bring it all down to street level, to make the festival's slogan, Open City, mean something. 'The city will be the stage'. In and around a Berber tent erected near the city centre there will be an opera with animals; there will be giant screens showing movies; a children's village will be erected. While committed intellectuals will pack the small venues the public will have the arts, or at least an experience, brought to them in the streets. This is the surface. Hidden beneath all this festival razzmatazz Antonis has been bold - and raised some eyebrows, and concern. He is not co-operating with the established cultural institutions in the city, the directors of the opera house, the celebrated Flanders dance company, the art gallery. They will be active anyway. He has upset the local politicians by extending the Open City concept to cover Antwerp's architecture, including modern developments. Architects will be encouraged to look hard and their findings will be published. This could arouse controversy. Antonis has brought together a team of outsiders, free from local influence and traditional loyalties. His resources have gone towards new initiatives. In the same way no new arts buildings have been constructed to act as a lasting memorial for Antwerp 93. Instead the existing city has been given a complete overhaul. More money, around Pounds 60m, has gone into this refurbishment than the Pounds 19m invested in the arts programme. The cathedral is free of scaffolding for the first time in 60 years. Antwerp looks a treat. It is unprecedented for a European City of Culture to be so removed from political influence; to be handed over to an arts professional to do with it what he will. Antonis, whose background is in running arts centres and theatre companies, is quite happy for visitors to pour into Antwerp, and around 3m are expected. But his first aim is to create a high quality project which adds something to the arts and cultural life of Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium and Europe. The project is its own reward. If it has spin offs, they are likely to be in the continuation of the festival of contemporary opera, in the unusual initiative of a festival of music for the under-eights. It is refreshing with such a big and costly arts venture to hear the old certainties re-stated. 'We want to change minds. We are anti-commercial. If the situation in the city improves as a consequence of Antwerp 93 that is fine, but it is not our starting point.' The freedom of the artist to challenge society is obviously alive and well in Antwerp.</p>

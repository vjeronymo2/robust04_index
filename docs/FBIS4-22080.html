			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 21 (AFP) --  The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS claimed responsibility  Thursday for ambushing two Jewish settlers who were wounded on  the Gaza Strip.    HAMAS announced in a statement that Wednesday's shooting was  the "first, swift response against continued Israeli arrests of  its members."    Israel has arrested nearly 500 Islamic fundamentalist  suspects, according to Palestinian sources, in a bid to break up  the HAMAS network. About 240 were detained on the Gaza Strip  alone this week.    Meanwhile, clashes continued on the strip. Soldiers shot and  wounded three Palestinians in Gaza City and two more in nearby  Jabaliya refugee camp, Palestinian sources said.    Military officials said two settlers driving a car near the  Gush Katif settlement were shot by Palestinian gunmen on  Wednesday evening.    "Two of our fighters ambushed a car carrying two settlers  ...  the bullets of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam were awaiting them and our  fighters opened fire on them using M-16 guns." 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam is the HAMAS military wing.    The typed message warned that the operation, carried out by  the "clandestine unit number 7," will be followed by others  "with the dawn of every day, until the end of all occupation of  our land."    HAMAS carried out two bus bombings this month killing 12  Israelis in retaliation for the Hebron massacre of 30 Moslem  worshippers by a Jewish settler.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / More councils contract out services to private sector MORE THAN half of all local authorities have contracted out provision of at least one of their main services to the private sector, and nearly a fifth have three or more services contracted out, according to the Institute of Public Finance. Nearly one in five contracts awarded under the government's compulsory competitive tendering policy has gone to the private sector. However, except for refuse collection, its share is markedly lower in terms of value, with private sector companies performing best in competition for smaller contracts. These findings come in a comprehensive report on the impact of competition for local authority contracts published today by the IPF, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. The report is summarised in a special survey on compulsory competitive tendering in today's Financial Times. Contracts worth Pounds 1.9bn a year have been awarded since the government obliged local authorities to start putting their main services out to tender in 1988. The first round of tendering for refuse collection, catering, street and building cleaning, and grounds and vehicle maintenance, is almost complete. Contracts start coming up for renewal in 1994. The IPF study of 513 local authorities across Britain reveals that 214 have contracted out none of their main services. But 143 have awarded one, or part of one, service to the private sector, while 68 have contracted out two and 91 - 18 per cent of the total - have contracted out three or more. Private sector competition appears to be intensifying. In refuse collection the proportion of contracts awarded to the private sector has risen from 14 per cent to 50 per cent since August 1990, in street cleaning from 10 per cent to 50 per cent and in non-school and welfare catering from 10 per cent to 50 per cent.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has ruled  out the possibility of another party joining the election. The  chairman of the IEC, Mr. Justice Johann Kriegler, said in  Johannesburg that if the CP [Conservative Party] reached an  agreement on entering the election, the IEC would be prepared to  count votes for the Freedom Front separately in some areas. An  IEC spokesman added that by four o'clock this afternoon the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] had still not submitted its candidates  lists.</p>

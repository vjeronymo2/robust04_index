			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States hold the 12th economic consultation in Washington  June 22, when the two sides will adopt a one-year working-level  report on progress in bilateral investment, trade, and  industrial and technological cooperation, the Foreign Ministry  announced Friday.    South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u will lead the  talks along with Joan Spero, U.S. undersecretary of state for  economic affairs.    While tackling the usual agenda, Seoul officials said they  will have to address further opening of the South Korean market  to American cars.    "This time, we are in a position where we have to explain  what we plan to do about this issue," a ministry official said.    The meeting will extend the South Korea-U.S. Dialogue for  Economic Cooperation (DEC), launched in 1993, for one more year  while adopting its report.    Bilateral issues include the auto market and a dispute over  the expiration period for imported U.S. sausages. The overall  agenda includes co-action at the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) and the World Trade Organization (WTO),  officials said.    Pak, meanwhile, will speak on Seoul-Washington trade  relations at luncheons with the Washington International Trade  Association and the Korea Economic Institute of America.</p>

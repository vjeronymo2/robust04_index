			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STIEB OUTDUELS HOUGH FOR 1-0 BLUE JAYS' VICTORY  </P> <P> The way Dave Stieb is stopping American League hitters, it's not surprising  that he is being accused of illegal pitches.  </P> <P> Stieb (13-3) gave up just five hits in seven innings Friday night at Toronto,  and Glenallen Hill hit his ninth home run in the third inning to give the Blue  Jays a 1-0 victory over Texas.  </P> <P> Opposing managers have complained about Stieb, who has pitched well in July.  But the veteran right-hander has survived glove, hat and uniform checks in four  July starts to post a 3-0 record, giving up only three runs in 28 2/3 innings.  In this game he walked four and had to work out of several jams.  </P> <P> "It isn't so much that I've pitched well," Stieb said. "It's more that the  defense behind me has been so good. That makes anyone a better pitcher.  </P> <P> "There is no way I'll start thinking of 20 victories. My goal is to win 14. I  would have had better success in this one if I didn't give up so many walks."  </P> <P> Duane Ward pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Tom Henke struck out two of  the three batters he faced in the ninth to earn his 21st save in 23  opportunities.  </P> <P> Except for Hill's second home run in the last three games, Charlie Hough (7-7)  had his knuckleball working. He gave up eight hits and struck out six in 7 2/3  innings.  </P> <P> "Actually, I was lucky," Hill said. "If that had been one of his good ones  (knucklers), I wouldn't have hit the ball at all. I just happened to get one  that wasn't doing any dancing. That's the knuckler I like."  </P> <P> Boston 1, Detroit 0 -- Tom Bolton (4-1) held the Tigers to four hits in 7 2/3  innings at Detroit to win for the first time on the road after seven losses.  </P> <P> Jack Morris (8-13) outpitched Bolton, who went into this season with a 2-7  record. But batterymate Mike Heath's wild throw set up the only run of the game  in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> It was the 19th unearned run this season off Morris, most against any pitcher  in the league.  </P> <P> The Tigers had the bases loaded with two outs in the eighth, but shortstop Tim  Nahering made a leaping catch of Cecil Fielder's line drive to end the inning.  </P> <P> "Bolton pitched just like he has all year," Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan said.  "He got behind hitters, but he was missing low, not high, where they could hit  it. Then (Dana) Kiecker and Murph (Rob Murphy) did the job."  </P> <P> The Red Sox remained just a game behind Toronto with their second victory in  seven games.  </P> <P> Before the game the Blue Jays obtained veteran left-hander John Candelaria from  the Minnesota Twins for infielder Nelson Liriano.  </P> <P> Chicago 7, Milwaukee 4 -- Carlton Fisk hit his 345th home run in a three-run  first inning at Chicago and the White Sox moved to within 2 1/2 games of first  place in the West.  </P> <P> Fisk has 324 of his home runs as a catcher and needs three to tie Johnny Bench,  the all-time leader.  </P> <P> Jack McDowell (6-5) won for the first time in five starts, giving up three runs  and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Dan Pasqua also homered for the White Sox.  </P> <P> Minnesota 9, Oakland 4 -- Catcher Brian Harper extended his hitting streak to  16 games with a two-run double in a six-run fifth inning at Minneapolis that  carried the Twins.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire and Felix Jose hit home runs for the Athletics, who have lost two  in a row.  </P> <P> Harper climaxed his big night by throwing out Rickey Henderson trying to steal  second base. It was only the third time this season Henderson was thrown out  actually trying to steal. Twice he has been picked off.  </P> <P> New York 3-4, Cleveland 0-1 -- Andy Hawkins, who had failed to win his last 12  starts, even losing a no-hitter, pitched a three-hitter in the opener. It was  the first victory for Hawkins (2-8) since May 6.  </P> <P> In the second game Jeff Robinson (3-6) pitched seven innings, and the Yankees  earned a sweep.  </P> <P> Roberto Kelly and Steve Balboni hit home runs in the opener.  </P> <P> Baltimore 9, Kansas City 2 -- Rookie Ben McDonald made his second consecutive  winning start in this game at Kansas City.  </P> <P> McDonald, who pitched a four-hit shutout in his first start, gave up two runs  and six hits in 6 2/3 innings Friday.  </P> <P> He also stopped George Brett's hitting streak at 16 games.  </P> <P> Leadoff batter Phil Bradley had four hits, scored two runs and drove in two to  spark the Baltimore attack.

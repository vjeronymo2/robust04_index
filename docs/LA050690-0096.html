			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: VISITORS TO LONG BEACH CAN TRAVEL BACK IN TIME  </P> <P> The Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, currently celebrating a yearlong "Voyage to  1939" entertainment festival, have designated June as "Senior Fun Days."  </P> <P> Seniors 55 years and pay $13 (regular adult admission is $17.50). Not only is  it a dollar better than the regular $14 senior rate and but there's an  additional bonus.  </P> <P> Seniors can bring the grandchildren (ages 5 to 11) for $7 each. That's a  savings of $2.50 off regular rates. When tickets are purchased, "Senior Fun  Days" should be mentioned to ensure getting the discount.  </P> <P> The grandchildren will especially enjoy the "Brighton Carnival," an on-shore  recreation of an old English traveling carnival.  </P> <P> Top draw of the many children's rides and attractions is a two-tiered,  turn-of-the-century carousel. There also are two Ferris wheels, plus puppet  shows, jugglers, carnival games and a diving show.  </P> <P> In addition to touring both the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, there are other  "Voyage to 1939" events and attractions.  </P> <P> These include a "1939 Auto Show," featuring mint-condition 1939 cars sharing  space under the Spruce Goose dome; two musical revues, and roving musical  groups.  </P> <P> Fireworks' shows will take place on Saturday evenings through June 15.  Afterward they are daily through Labor Day.  </P> <P> For those who wish to extend their stay, a package offers one of the former  liner's 365 first-class staterooms at $78 per couple now through June (regular  rates start at $95) and includes two general admission tickets. Reservations  are needed. Call (213) 435-3511, Ext. 1105.  </P> <P> For more information about Senior Fun Days, regular year-round senior rates or  even lower rates for senior groups of 20 or more, call (213) 499-1629.  </P> <P> Long Beach has a wide variety of accommodations that offer senior rates or  discounts for mature travelers. Most, however, are offered with the usual  senior discount caveat -- "subject to space availability." Mid-week stays are  the best bets and reservations are usually essential.  </P> <P> Among the choices are:  </P> <P> Sheraton Long Beach, the city's newest hotel with 430 rooms, across from the  Convention Center; 25% discount.

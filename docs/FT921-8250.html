			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading POSITIVE political and economic sentiment helped stock index futures rise in thin but steady trading, writes Christopher Price. The March futures opened at a healthy 2,532, with a number of factors weighing on the market, namely the scope for interest rate cuts following Friday's inflation figures, good weekend polls for the government and positive overnight trading news from Tokyo. The market moved steadily ahead to midday, with dealers reporting interest from US buyers. But with Wall Street's closure, many independent dealers had taken a day's holiday and March stalled until the late afternoon. However, it found strong support at the 2,550 level that provided a spring board for a late burst which generated a squeeze. March closed at 2,565, up 35 on the previous session, and around 15 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover was a low 3,053 lots. Wall Street's holiday also depressed business in the traded options market. Volume was a poor 22,825. The FT-SE 100 index option had 3,441 contracts dealt. Thames Water was the busiest stock option, with the May 360 puts dominating the day's total of 2,837 lots traded.</p>

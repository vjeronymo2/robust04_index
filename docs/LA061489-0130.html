Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA AUTO BURGLARY RING BROKEN BY 5 ARRESTS, DEPUTIES SAY  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said this morning that they have broken  an auto burglary ring with the arrests of five teen-agers who were caught  breaking into cars in Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> Residents in the area of Whites Canyon Road and Stillmore Street called the  Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday and reported that  cars in the neighborhood were being burglarized by a group of young men, Deputy  Van Mosley said. A short time later, deputies arrested three 17-year-old boys  and Jim Ngo and Binh Chau, both 18, on suspicion of burglary.  </P> <P> All the suspects are from the San Gabriel Valley. Information from them and  evidence found during the arrests led deputies to obtain warrants to search the  teen-agers' homes Tuesday evening, Mosley said. The searches were conducted in  Monterey Park, Alhambra, La Puente and Rosemead, and deputies recovered several  master keys for cars and a variety of stolen merchandise, including 33 car  stereos and 18 speaker sets, Mosley said.  </P> <P> At a home in Monterey Park, Chau's 22-year-old brother, Alex Chau, also was  arrested on suspicion of burglary and receiving stolen property.  </P></p>

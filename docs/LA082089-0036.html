			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q AND A: HOW TO SPOT ANXIOUS HOME SELLER FOR BEST PRICE AND  FINANCING HELP  </P> <P> QUESTION: My husband and I desperately want to buy a home. But we only have  around $15,000 for the down payment and closing costs. We know that isn't much,  but we keep hearing about people who buy a home for little or no cash. As we  are not eligible for a nothing-down VA mortgage, we talked to a lender about  FHA and 90% financing, but we were turned off by the costs and terms. One of  our friends recently bought a beautiful home where the seller carried back the  entire first mortgage for 20 years. Any suggestions how we can find a similar  deal?  </P> <P> ANSWER: The home sale market has slowed down recently in many cities. I think  the reasons include a softening of economic conditions and many prospective  home buyers are waiting in hopes that mortgage interest rates might decline  further.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, I suggest you jump in and buy a home from an anxious, motivated home  seller who must sell. Forget the sellers who are testing the market in hopes  they might get their outrageous asking prices.  </P> <P> To spot an anxious home seller, look for the obvious signals. First, ask the  realty agent, "Why is the seller selling?" Some obnoxious agents will reply,  "It's none of your business." Personally, I refuse to do business with those  uncooperative agents because it is the buyer's business to know why the seller  is selling, so the purchase offer can be tailored to meet their needs.  </P> <P> Second, get excited when you spot a vacant house for sale. That means the  seller is probably making mortgage payments on two houses and will listen to  any reasonable offer.  </P> <P> Third, look for homes being sold by retirees. I find retired people often own  their homes free and clear, so they can carry back the first mortgage at a  reasonable interest rate with no loan costs. For example, several years ago I  bought a rental house from a retired lady who told me the $1,083 monthly  payment she received from me was more money than she ever earned before.  </P> <P> In today's market, if you offer a seller an interest rate of 9% to 10%, that is  higher than can be earned on most alternative safe investments.  </P> <P> Insure House for the Cost of Replacement  </P> <P> Q: I recently bought a new house. Before buying I called my insurance agent who  recommended a $94,000 policy. But my mortgage is for $124,500. The lender will  not accept my $94,000 policy. However, my insurance agent refuses to insure for  more because he says his company won't write policies for more than the home's  replacement cost. What should I do? The lender threatens to buy their own  policy at a cost of $20 per day.  </P> <P> A: Don't let that arrogant lender push you around. You are only required to  insure the premises for its replacement cost. The amount of the mortgage is  irrelevant. Ask your insurance agent to contact the lender to educate him that  insurance replacement cost is all that is required.  </P> <P> In some states, it is illegal to insure for more than the structure's  replacement cost because over-insurance encourages arson.  </P> <P> Buy Title Insurance for Vacation Home  </P> <P> Q: We are considering buying a vacation cabin in a rural county. The realty  agent seems very anxious to sell it to us. He offered to give us a free "chain  of title" report. He said we will need it when we get the mortgage. Although my  wife and I have bought several homes, we have never heard of a chain of title  report. What is it, and do we really need it?  </P> <P> A: No, you don't need a chain of title report. It is merely a history of the  property's title from its earliest recorded deed to the present time. While it  might make interesting reading, a chain of title report is not needed to obtain  a mortgage.  </P> <P> But you will need to obtain title insurance for the mortgage lender. Depending  on local custom, title insurance is either arranged by a local attorney, the  mortgage lender or by a title insurance or escrow company. Since the property  is rural, you also may need to obtain a survey to locate the property's  boundaries.  </P> <P> Incidentally, when you make a written offer to buy that vacation cabin and if  you need a mortgage to finance your purchase, be sure your offer contains a  mortgage finance contingency clause.  </P> <P> Obtaining a mortgage on vacation or second homes is not always easy. Before you  make your offer, please consult at least one lender to find out the mortgage  terms, because the interest rate is usually higher than for urban homes and the  loan-to-value ratio may be only 50% to 75%.  </P> <P> Paying Extra Principal Trims Life of Mortgage  </P> <P> Q: We are paying an extra $50 every month, which is applied to the principal of  our 30-year, $100,000, 8.75% interest-rate home loan. We are into our second  year of the mortgage and have been told that doing this only really matters in  the last five years of the loan. But other friends say the extra payments in  the beginning years shorten the length of the mortgage, plus saving us  interest. Please clarify.  </P> <P> A: Extra principal payments will substantially shorten the life of your  mortgage, thus saving you significant interest. I calculate your regular  monthly payment at $786.70 for 30 years. By adding $50 per month to your  monthly payment, you will cut the mortgage term to about 23 1/2 years, thereby  saving you about $46,931.48. That's pretty dramatic.  </P> <P> But if you can add an extra $100 per month and pay $886.70 each month, you will  cut your mortgage to 20 years and save $70,404 in interest. Don't let anyone  talk you out of making those extra payments each month.  </P> <P> Try Portfolio Lender for More Flexibility  </P> <P> Q: The first-mortgage conventional loan limit is $187,600. When does this limit  go up, and what will be the new amount?  </P> <P> A: You are referring to the Freddie Mac-Fannie Mae maximum home mortgage.  Freddie and Fannie are the major home loan buyers in the secondary mortgage  market.  </P> <P> Their maximum loan limit is set each January, based on average home sale  prices. However, try to avoid dealing with local originating lenders who only  sell their mortgages to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae because they are the toughest  lenders, with rigid loan standards.  </P> <P> Much easier lenders are "portfolio lenders" who keep their loans in their loan  portfolios rather than selling their loans in the secondary mortgage market.  Many of the larger S&amp;Ls and banks are portfolio lenders that can be very  flexible as to maximum loans and borrower qualifications.  </P> <P> Tenant Improvements Belong to Landlord  </P> <P> Q: About two years ago, with permission of our landlord, we installed new  wall-to-wall hallway carpet in our apartment. It cost us about $500. When we  were preparing to move out at the end of our lease, the building manager  cautioned us not to remove the hallway carpet. She said if we did, we would  have to pay for refinishing the hardwood floors. Since we left the carpets,  shouldn't we be paid the $500 cost by the landlord?  </P> <P> A: No. When a residential tenant makes permanent improvements, in the absence  of an agreement with the landlord for removal at the end of the rental, if the  improvements cannot be removed without damaging the property they become the  landlord's property. The building manager was correct that if you had removed  the carpets you would have to pay for restoring the floors. Ask your attorney  for further details.  </P> <P> Avoiding Profit Tax Requires Planning  </P> <P> Q: I live in half of my two-family duplex and rent the other half to tenants.  My purchase price was about $35,000 and the building is worth at least $175,000  today. If I sell, can I use that "rollover residence replacement rule" you  often discuss to avoid profit tax if I buy a $175,000 single-family house?  </P> <P> A: Owners of residential rental real estate who live in one unit and rent the  balance of the property to tenants can qualify for the "rollover residence  replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. But this tax-deferral benefit  only applies to the net (adjusted) sales price of the unit you occupy.  Incidentally, the "over 55 rule" $125,000 home-sale tax exemption also applies  to the value of your unit, but not to the rental portion of the property, if  you are eligible.  </P> <P> If your duplex sells for $175,000 net and the two units are of equal value,  your residence unit's sale price will be $87,500. If you buy a replacement  principal residence costing at least $87,500 within 24 months before or after  the sale, then you can defer tax on the about $70,000 profit from your  residence unit's sale. However, you will owe tax on the $70,000 profit on the  sale of the rental unit.  </P> <P> Make a Written Offer; Seller Might Say 'Yes'  </P> <P> Q: The homes in our town seem to be terribly overpriced. I noticed they don't  seem to be selling as fast as they did a few months ago. But the prices haven't  come down. How can my husband and I find a home to buy that is fairly priced in  today's marketplace?  </P> <P> A: When you find a home you want to buy, make a written purchase offer. The  asking price is only the seller's "dream price." Some correctly priced homes  sell for their full asking price, but others sell for thousands of dollars  less.  </P> <P> Until you make a written offer at the price and terms you want, you will never  know if the seller will accept. Or the seller may counteroffer at a price you  like. To find the bargains, look for sellers, such as those who are anxious to  sell due to divorce, job transfer, death or financial problems. Your realty  agent can usually steer you to the best bargains, but also read the newspaper  classified ads every day, especially on weekdays when the most anxious sellers'  homes are advertised.  </P> <P> Don't Accept Appraisal That You Don't Like  </P> <P> Q: Shortly after we contracted to buy our home, we applied for a mortgage with  the S&amp;L where we have our savings accounts. But the appraisal was about  $12,500 below our purchase price for the home. The S&amp;L would approve our  loan if we would raise our down payment by $12,500. When I protested, the loan  officer tried to intimidate me into accepting the loan. So we went to the bank  where my company does business and we had no trouble getting the mortgage we  needed. However, the loan fee was about $1,100 higher. I am thinking of suing  the S&amp;L for the extra cost. Do you think I should?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Presuming you can handle the matter yourself without an attorney, you  have everything to gain and nothing to lose. However, your big mistake was not  protesting that low appraisal. If I am unhappy with an appraisal, I protest  loud and clear if I can prove the appraiser is wrong.  </P> <P> Borrowers are unaware that appraisers are often instructed by lenders to  appraise very conservatively. One of the worst examples occurred when an  appraiser valued my residence at $50,000 less than I knew it was worth. I  refused to accept the low appraisal. The loan agent then hired another  appraisal company which came in with a valuation $50,000 higher and I obtained  the loan I wanted. As a result, that lender not only earns interest on my first  mortgage, but on my home equity loan too.  </P> <P> Believe it or not, most lenders want your loan business. If they don't make  loans, they don't earn profits. Of course, if your property is in a bad part of  town where the lender unofficially "redlines," then the lender may have  instructed the appraiser to come in with a very low value, so you will take  your business elsewhere. Please let me know if you win your $1,100 lawsuit.  </P></p>

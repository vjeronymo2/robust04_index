			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 49ERS SIGN EX-GIANT JIM BURT  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers today signed former New York Giants nose tackle Jim  Burt to fill the void created when Michael Carter went down with a right foot  injury in Sunday's 23-10 victory over the Jets. Burt, who played with the  Giants through the 1988 season, is best known by 49er fans as the player who  put Joe Montana in the hospital during the 1986 NFC Championship game at the  Meadowlands.  </P> <P> Burt, 30, who has a history of back problems, retired under pressure from the  Giants in the off-season. San Francisco Vice President John McVay said he  expects Carter to be out three or four weeks.  </P></p>

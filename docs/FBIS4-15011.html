			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's  national security aide, has announced that the Statute of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service actually marks the end of a  series of constant transformations of the special services.  This structure, necessary for society and the state, Yu.  Baturin pointed out, will be protected "from emotional,  incompetent, and time-serving changes" so as to create  corresponding conditions for normal work in the new situation.  In this connection, the Russian president's aide dismissed  attempts by certain foreign circles "to influence the leadership  of Russia with the aim of radically reforming Russian special  services."</p>

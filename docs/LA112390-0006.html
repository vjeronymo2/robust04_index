			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON FREE TRADE;  </P> <P> A HAND FOR MEXICO, A SLAP FOR US;  </P> <P> IT'S NOT TRUE THAT U.S. WORKERS WILL REAP SECONDARY BENEFITS. MEXICAN WORKERS  WON'T BE HELPED MUCH, EITHER.  </P> <P> A U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement would confirm present trends -- opening  Mexico's economy to U.S. investment and the relocation of U.S. manufacturing to  Mexico. Already, half a million workers in Mexican maquiladora plants make  products for export to the States. Mexican rules restricting foreign (i.e.,  U.S.) ownership of factories have been nearly abolished. U.S. automobile firms  now operate more technologically sophisticated plants in Mexico than they do at  home. Much of California's furniture industry has relocated to Tijuana.  Japanese and Korean consumer electronic firms have gained easier access to U.S.  markets by establishing low-wage (but high-quality) factories in Mexico.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, and partly as a consequence, the U.S. manufacturing sector shrank  from 23% of domestic employment in 1979 to 18% last year. This employment loss  can only grow with free trade. So why does the Administration pursue an  agreement?  </P> <P> Advocates offer two rationales, neither of which stands much scrutiny. First,  they claim that free trade would open Mexico's market to American sales,  creating economic growth at home. They speak of "80 million consumers" in  Mexico, warning that without free trade, Japanese or Europeans, not Americans,  could capture this enormous market. But low-wage markets are no bonanza.  Mexican wages average $1 an hour and have been declining. "Consumers" earning  only $1 an hour don't consume very much beyond the basic necessities.  </P> <P> Expanded free trade will probably further depress Mexicans' purchasing power  because it will restrain traditional government industrial-protection policies  and foster maquilarization of wages throughout the economy. It is no accident  that wages in Mexico's maquila export sector (as low as 60 cents an hour) are  substantially below wages in firms serving Mexico's domestic market.  </P> <P> Free-trade proponents claim that 80% of every peso paid to maquila workers is  spent either in U.S. border communities or on U.S. products. Thus, they argue,  U.S. manufacturing in Mexico benefits us as well. This makes little sense. When  a $10-an-hour job in Detroit is replaced by a 60-cents-an-hour job in Tijuana,  it is ludicrous to suggest that U.S. workers benefit because 48 cents is then  spent in San Diego.  </P> <P> Free-trade supporters also argue that moving basic manufacturing to Mexico  supports higher-paying jobs at home. "Every time you put a plant in Mexico, it  creates new jobs in the United States because we are the suppliers, the  transporters and the managers of the plants in Mexico," said Commerce Secretary  Robert A. Mosbacher Sr. in Los Angeles last month.  </P> <P> The Mattel Corp. recently announced that it would expand its toy assembly in  Mexico, employing several thousand more Mexican workers. This, it claimed,  would benefit California because the assembly operation would depend on skilled  injection-molding jobs here.  </P> <P> This argument is contradicted by two decades of experience. Almost invariably,  manufacturers claim that only basic assembly will relocate. Yet just as  invariably, once Mexican basic manufacturing is running smoothly,  higher-skilled jobs follow. Why shouldn't they? Mexican workers are no less  skilled than their American counterparts (and robotization is more advanced in  some Mexican manufacturing). Mexican universities and technical schools  graduate increasing numbers of managers, engineers and skilled workers. And  there are substantial inventory, transportation and quality savings gained by  locating supply and design operations close to assembly plants they support.  </P> <P> The maquila sector now hosts high-tech firms as well as assembly plants.  Westinghouse, for example, makes the F-16's guidance systems in Chihuahua. When  Mexico's border industrialization zone was established 20 years ago, its main  activity was sewing garments. Today, 39% of all maquila plants make  electronics; apparel represents only 9%.  </P> <P> In truth, we are pushing a free-trade agreement more for political than  economic reasons. The Bush Administration is more responsive to manufacturers  seeking Mexico's low wages than to their U.S. workers facing layoff. It is more  open to financing ventures that seek Third World manufacturing profits than to  competing claims of a starved infrastructure and technological advance at home.  The Administration also is responsive to retailers who expect low-cost imports  to generate higher profits. While that's true in the short run, declines in  U.S. purchasing power resulting from the loss of high-wage manufacturing could  spell doom for mass retailers. It is ominous that the average hourly wage in  the United States has declined almost 10% since 1980, due in part to  replacement of high-wage manufacturing by service and retail employment.  Farsighted retailers can take no comfort from this statistic, whatever  temporary benefit they gain from cheap imports.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, characteristically more interested in foreign than  domestic policy, sees an opportunity to bolster Mexico's President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari, who has staked considerable prestige on the quest for free  trade, hoping it will stimulate U.S. investment in Mexico and remove  temptations that U.S. investors might feel to send excess capital to developing  markets in Eastern Europe. However, both Bush and Salinas would be well advised  to pay more attention to the benefits of higher wages in both nations, and less  attention to short-term profits gained from competitive impoverishment.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Jastanih: "Saudi Territory Has Large </F> Reserves of Mineral Deposits"]    [Text] Mr. Muhammad Dahlawi [name as transliterated],  deputy assistant for mining investments in the Saudi Ministry of  Petroleum and Mineral Resources, in an interview with AL-HAYAH,  said that Saudi territory has considerable reserves of deposits  of many minerals and that geological survey work is still being  carried out after initial studies gave evidence of the existence  of many industrial and non-industrial minerals in various parts  of Saudi Arabia.    He added that, during the next phase, there will be further  development of the previous exploratory studies that will focus  on some minerals such as gold. Initial exploratory studies have  shown evidence of the existence of some 800 gold deposit areas  in Saudi Arabia. Concluding studies concerning two other  projects are also expected to be completed soon. The first of  these is the project dealing with the exploitation of aluminum  bauxite, the initial costs of which are estimated at about $45  million and the production capacity of which would be in excess  of 100 million tons. The second project deals with the  exploitation of zinc, along the lines of [other such] projects  recently submitted for approval.    He said that the initial geological survey studies have  indicated the existence of some rare minerals, and that studies  dealing with these minerals would require specialized  exploratory operations in order to show evidence of the  existence of mineral ores in a form that can be beneficially  exploited.    The General Directorate for Mineral Resources has already  put  out 11 publications dealing with the minerals that have been  discovered in Saudi territory, some of which have already been  exploited and some of which soon will be exploited commercially.  These publications contain complete information concerning  mineral ore reserves--where they are located, their uses, the  nations that produce them, and their prices on the international  market. The Saudi Directorate for Mineral Resources started  putting out these publications in March of 1989. It started with  magnesite (MgCO3), then continued with kaolin, gold, phosphate,  limestone, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), copper, chiseled and  decorative stones, zinc, glass sand, silica sand (SiO2), and  gypsum.    Recently the directorate published a complete atlas dealing  with industrial minerals in Saudi territory and distributed it  to both Saudi and foreign companies interested in mining  projects.    Saudi Arabia's objective in doing this is to encourage the  private sector (domestic) to embark on large-scale mining  investments, and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources  is taking part in the furnishing of economic feasibility studies  for many of the projects that are being submitted for approval  for commercial exploitation.  <H5>  Iron and Phosphate Projects </H5>   According to Saudi officials, there is a trend toward  completing the base of the mining industry and achieving more  development in Saudi Arabia during the coming years by means of  various mining projects.    According to Dahlawi, two iron and phosphate projects were  recently submitted for approval after economic feasibility  studies concerning them were completed. Companies that will bid  for the iron project will first study the feasibility studies  undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources which  present investors with a number of options. The first of these  involves the construction of a plant for the production of iron  balls on the Red Sea coast, with a production capacity of up to  2.2 million tons, and which will cost $550 million. The second  option involves the construction of a plant for producing 4  million tons, which would cost $750 million. The third option  would involve the construction of a plant to produce 3 million  tons that would cost $600 million.    He pointed out that the economic feasibility studies  undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources have already  determined which markets will take the final mineral ore  product, which would be extracted and used in direct reduction  plants that would utilize the latest modern technology available  in the world both in the Arab world and in the nations of East  Asia.    It is a known fact that Saudi Arabia currently imports more  than 4 million tons of iron from Sweden, Brazil, and some other  countries, the total value of which is between $50 and $52 per  ton.    Dahlawi, during the interview, brought up the subject of the  talks that were held between the Directorate of Mineral  Resources and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) and  said that the latter is prepared to offer loans to investors for  the mining industry projects currently being submitted for  approval.    He went on to say: "Everything having to do with the loans  will be the subject of a detailed discussion between the Fund  bank [SIDF] and the company that undertakes the project."    As we know, SIDF participates in almost all industrial  projects in Saudi Arabia whose total value is at least SR400  million.    Dahlawi expects a good response on the part of some  international firms to join with Saudi partners in investing in  the exploitation of iron, especially in view of the existence of  markets for the sale of the final product. He said that Wadi  al-Sawawin's production of iron meets the requirements of Saudi  Arabia and the Gulf nations combined and saves about 60 percent  of the import bill for iron ore for Saudi Arabia alone.</p>

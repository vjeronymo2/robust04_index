			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (6): Disinterested protectors of the public good - Central banks / Independence is the fashionable nostrum of the day The reputation of central bankers as a professional caste has seen a renaissance over the past 15 years. Once regarded as hard-faced proponents of financial orthodoxy - a not wholly undeserved reputation in the light of their performance in the 1930s - they are now increasingly seen as disinterested protectors of the public good. Such is the trust in these new Platonic guardians that elected politicians have been prepared to delegate to them the conduct of monetary policy, sometimes within a framework of minimal accountability. Central banking independence, in whatever form, is the fashionable economic nostrum of the day. This remarkable turnround owes as much to the dismal experience of monetary policy under the management of politicians as it does to the central bankers' own recent record. The great disinflationary successes of the 1980s and 1990s were, after all, achieved at considerable cost. Paul Volcker's experiment with money supply targetry at the US Federal Reserve caused havoc in the economies of primary producers, while draining the developed world of liquidity. The first world survived and prospered, largely thanks to the Reagan administration's global exercise in fiscal expansionism; but it took a huge and protracted joint effort with the International Monetary Fund to put Latin America back together again. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's heroic efforts to preserve monetary stability in the face of the fiscal strains arising from reunification look as though they may shortly be successful. Yet the victory will have been won at the cost of a painful shock to the rest of Europe, where countries that linked their fortunes and currencies to the D-Mark experienced a severe loss of output. Yet, the real villains of the piece in the first three decades of the post-war period were arguably not the politicians but the economists. It was they who claimed that there was a trade-off between inflation and employment, and that it was possible to attain full employment by expanding demand. As people's expectations began to adjust to the inflationary consequences, the longer term trade-off between inflation and employment disappeared. Politicians still had an incentive to reflate for electoral advantage since this continued to have a short-term, if waning, impact on output. But the long run impact on anything other than inflation was negligible. As well as destroying the political legacy of Keynes, this perception, which became the conventional wisdom after the oil shock of the mid-1970s, changed the objectives of monetary policy. If the expansionary escape route from unemployment no longer existed, economists were forced to conclude that the most that demand management could achieve was to stabilise the price level. The attempt to lower the natural rate of unemployment was left to fiscal policy and to supply side measures which sought to change the structure of markets. At much the same time central bankers were struggling to come to terms with the technicalities of monetary control in the post-Bretton Woods world of fluctuating exchange rates. They sought a mechanistic alternative to the discretionary manipulation of short term interest rates; an alternative, moreover, which would help ward off the political pressures which ensured that interest were invariably raised too little, too late. There followed a series of experiments in money supply targetry which foundered in the 1980s on the rock of an increasingly unpredictable velocity of circulation. Today, the central bankers have been forced back on to discretionary changes in interest rates in their tireless pursuit of price stability. Yet the discretion is tempered by changes in the structure of the relationship between central banks and governments, which include numerous moves towards independence. Technical problems remain because of the long time lags involved in monetary policy. Interest rate changes are being made in response to forecasts of inflation in 18 months to two years' time. The question is whether this approach will prove any more effective than what went before. Academic research suggests that independent central banks do preside over lower rates of inflation, though there is little difference in growth and employment when compared with less independent systems. Equally important, central banks tend to be granted independence in those countries where there is a powerful constituency for stable prices. Does such a constituency exist across the whole of the developed world? Tightening policy in the midst of an expansion hurts debtors. It also hurts those who invest in expectation of future growth and inflation, as well as primary producers and the economically weak. The beneficiaries are creditors, those manufacturers who need longer-term stability in order to plan and the economically strong. That suggests a political divide between the small business people, the farmers and the poor on one side, and the rich, the elderly and big business on the other. Yet the evidence does not point to a predictable left-right alignment on independent central banking. In New Zealand it was introduced under a Labour government. The new South African government, which carries residual baggage from the failed communist experiment, has opted for an independent central bank. Even in the UK there are advocates of independence in the Labour ranks. The reason is that left-leaning governments stand to gain most from such a move because they have the greater problem of credibility with markets. That said, demography points to a strengthening of the independence movement in Europe where populations are ageing, because approaching retirement makes people more anxious to preserve the value of financial assets. The European Monetary Institute may in due course satisfy that aspiration. The risk in all this is that expectations will be pitched too high, or that there will be a re-run of the 1930s. Where independent central bankers have no mandate or instinctive inclination to address problems of deflation they may be slow to respond to a sustained contraction in demand. US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has admittedly emerged superbly from just such a challenge. Whether his successor, or his opposite number in some future European monetary union, will prove half as good on either inflation or deflation is another matter.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Laws of marketplace also apply to brewing industry Sir, While your reporting of the effect of tax changes on the strength of beer has been admirably fair, your editorial, 'Weak beer' (June 8) made curious reading. It was surprising to see complaints about a failure to keep consumers informed, and a reference to furtive product changes, in response to very public announcements by brewers of these changes. Most remarkable was your editorial line that it is wrong for a producer industry to pass on tax increases to consumers in, to use your own words, a modern competitive business. Your general business readership, not to mention your own financial journalists, may be interested in this doctrine. The laws of the marketplace, and the relationship between costs and price, are no different for brewers than for any other business, including newspapers. Your comments would be better directed at the root cause of the problem, the over-taxation of beer even before the recent change of taxation system. Robin Simpson, director, The Brewers' Society, 42 Portman Square, London W1H 0BB</p>

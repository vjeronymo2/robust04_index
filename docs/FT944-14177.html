			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Jail term for Cantabria chief Mr Juan Hormaechea, the conservative chief executive of Cantabria in northern Spain, yesterday became the first head of a Spanish regional government to face jail over corruption charges. After a long legal battle, Mr Hormaechea - a controversial local populist and former mayor of the port of Santander, capital of the Cantabria region - was sentenced by a Santander court to six years for embezzlement linked to construction contracts he awarded in 1991. His imprisonment was delayed, however, pending his appeal to the supreme court in Madrid. The sentence is an embarrassment for the opposition Partido Popular (PP). The party had backed Mr Hormaechea when he was first elected chief minister in Cantabria's 1988 regional elections as an independent on the PP ticket, and has since failed to persuade him to resign. In 1992 Mr Hormaechea, who was already facing judicial investigation, formed his own party to fight the regional elections and was re-elected chief minister with PP support.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) agreed on Wednesday to join forces with  each other in the Diet to fulfill their duties as the two main  opposition forces. The accord emerged at a meeting between SDP  Diet affairs committee chairman Koken Nosaka and his LDP  counterpart Sadatoshi Ozato.    Nosaka proposed that the SDP and the LDP hold such a  gathering now that the SDP became an opposition force again  after eight months in the ruling coalition, Ozato told a news  conference.    While the LDP was in power for 38 years until last August,  the SDP formed the core of the opposition camp.    The SDP decided on Tuesday to quit the governing alliance to  protest other coalition partners' formation of a unified  parliamentary group, named Kaishin (innovation). The party was  the largest contingent in the coalition.    Nosaka and Ozato will meet again on Thursday morning to  discuss how specifically the two parties can cooperate in  handling political matters to be discussed in the current  regular Diet session and beyond, Ozato said. Ozato added that  the two men agreed to cooperate in order to resist "fascist"  moves and protect parliamentary democracy.    The LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman also noted the two  parties may ask new party Sakigake, which had earlier decided to  leave the coalition, to join their policy talks.    In a separate news conference, Nosaka said he and Ozato  confirmed the need for "faith and trust" in their two parties'  tie-up over Diet deliberations.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A baseball card expert in Pittsfield, Me., raised doubts about the authenticity  of a Honus Wagner baseball card that turned up there, saying it looks too thin  and too bright to be real.  </P> <P> An authentic card in good condition featuring the Hall of Fame shortstop from  the early 1900s could be worth $10,000 to $100,000.  </P> <P> Arlo Quint, 12, said he had unearthed the Wagner card and three others while  digging for worms in his back yard. The cards were in an old tooth powder can.  </P> <P> The Wagner card surfaced about a month after a boy in Stockton Springs, about  30 miles away, found a Honus Wagner card under similar circumstances.  </P></p>

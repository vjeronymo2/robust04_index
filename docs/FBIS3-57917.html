			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "`Impetus' Turns Against PSOE"] </F>   [Text] Madrid -- Disappointment and skepticism are the two  words that could define the state of mind created in the  People's Party, the United Left, and Convergence and Union [CiU]  by the successive meetings held with the PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] in order to guide the "democratic impetus."    According to members of the three above-mentioned parties  participating directly in the meetings with the Socialists, the  results are proving so slight that, on the one hand, they show  the weakness and uncertainties of the team headed by Carlos  Solchaga. On the other hand, they are creating serious doubts  about whether the PSOE wishes to go beyond creating a "smoke  screen" with which to maintain the image of a fluid dialogue  with the opposition while making changing and confused  proposals, depending on the interlocutor and the matter which is  specifically being negotiated with each.  <H5>  "We Could Quit Tomorrow" </H5>   "We could quit tomorrow," a member of the CiU delegation  told  YA. "Progress is very slow: The PSOE has no real desire for us  to cooperate in the legislature, but rather to surmount  obstacles on an ad hoc basis in order to avoid a rift that could  mean their starting to lose votes in the Congress [of  Deputies]," the same source stated.    In the opinion of the CiU, the "democratic impetus" has  become a cosmetic operation for the PSOE. Leaders of the  Catalan coalition are indignant about the Socialists  backtracking on the reform of the Senate. "They told us at one  of our meetings that they would convince the People's Party, so  that there would be no problems in accepting our amendments  aimed at the comprehensive use of Catalan in the Senate, and  then we find that they are telling the People's Party just the  opposite: that they will try to convince us."    According to the same sources, "this switch has now occurred  in other matters. Since [CiU leader] Pujol and [Basque  Nationalist Party Chairman] Arzalluz said `no' to Gonzalez over  joining a coalition government, and since the prime minister met  with [People's Party Chairman] Aznar and promised him we know  not what, the Socialists have turned toward the People's Party."  "They seem," they added, "to have had enough with putting  through the budgets, but the legislative term is very long, and  if they continue to do so much double-dealing, we could break up  the game."    The suspicions aroused in the CiU by the PSOE agreement with  the People's Party on Senate reform are equaled within the  People's Party, where it is believed that CiU is taking "its  degree of egoism" to unacceptable lengths. Only yesterday, Jose  Maria Aznar asserted in Salamanca that Gonzalez failed in  accepting the nationalist demands in order to ensure that it  would stay in power rather than meeting the country's own needs.    According to parliamentary party sources in the upper  chamber, the People's Party has made the Senate reform "a matter  of honor." "We will not even accept the PSOE's abstaining in the  vote on CiU's amendment on the use of the official languages."  "The agreement," they continued, "is to approve in full the  text on which we have agreed. If they deviate from that, they  can consider the `impetus' finished." Curiously enough, these  sources agree with CiU in describing as a "smoke screen" the  Socialists' real aim in the "democratic impetus" meetings,  which, in Aznar's own opinion, "are showing that Gonzalez does  not know how to govern in a minority."  <H5>  United Left Pessimistic </H5>   Only yesterday, the PSOE and the United Left tackled another  meeting on the "impetus," which leaders of the coalition led by  Anguita said they were setting about with little optimism. The  disquiet caused by the suspension of the bilateral meeting  scheduled for the first few days in December -- the suspension  that was ordered by Felipe Gonzalez after he received a letter  from Julio Anguita that was highly critical of his conduct --  persists in the United Left.    According to Francisco Frutos, the United Left cherishes no  hope that the PSOE will be prepared to make the change the  coalition demands in the economic and labor spheres, and so the  "democratic impetus" cannot go very far. Other United Left  leaders have told YA that "the choice of the government and the  PSOE is very clear -- to rely on the conservative nationalist  parties; we cannot sit at that table."    People's Party, CiU, and United Left sources stated that the  mutual suspicion and distrust of the PSOE could end the  "impetus" soon.</p>

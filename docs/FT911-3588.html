			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Israel Chemicals falls to Dollars 78.2m ISRAEL Chemicals, the country's biggest and most profitable state-owned industrial group, reported a drop in net profits in 1990 to Dollars 78.2m from Dollars 86.3m in 1989, a record year for the group. Sales were up Dollars 76m to Dollars 1.23bn, but a fall in world prices for potash, Israel Chemicals' core product, a drop in phosphate sales to eastern Europe, and the shekel's relative strength against foreign currencies were blamed for the reduced earnings. Net return on capital was 14 per cent, maintaining Israel Chemicals' traditional position as the leading performer among the state's industrial holdings. The group, which exploits Israel's main natural resources from the Dead Sea area, has been slated for privatisation for some time, but a planned private placement of a majority stake with foreign investors was blocked by political objections. A partial flotation on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is the preferred option of most ministers, although no decision has been taken. Israel Chemicals now relies heavily on international markets. Last year, exports were up by 7 per cent at Dollars 646m, a little over half of total sales. The drop in earnings came mainly from two of the group's core Israeli production companies, Dead Sea Works and Negev Phosphates. Profits were up at Dead Sea Periclase, which makes magnesia and hydrochloric acid, Rotem-Amfert, which makes sulphuric and phosphoric acid, and at Giulini Chemie, a West German subsidiary making phosphate salts and aluminium sulphate. Israel Chemicals intends to pay a dividend to the government of Dollars 12m, after Dollars 50m in 1989.</p>

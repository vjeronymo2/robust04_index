			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Thailand agrees to amend constitution NINE government and opposition parties agreed over the weekend to amend Thailand's constitution in an attempt to end a month-long crisis, but the country's largest protests in two decades continued. The protesters accepted the proposed changes but wanted the government to set a clear timetable, particularly for an amendment that would prevent the appointment of a non-elected prime minister. Crowd numbers reached 100,000 in late night rallies on Friday and Saturday and about 50,000 last night. General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister and target of the protests, said he had no objection to the amendments but did not specify when the changes would take place. Protesters, objecting to the military domination of politics, continued to call for his resignation. He was the architect of last year's coup d'etat and was appointed prime minister after the March 22 general election, even though he did not stand. Critics say the five-party coalition that backs him was created by military power brokers. The weekend passed peacefully despite some potentially explosive situations, with the government appearing determined to avoid violence. The English-language newspaper Bangkok Post said this was because of a special request from King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is highly revered.</p>

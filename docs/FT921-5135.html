			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / IoD reports continued fall in business optimism BUSINESS optimism among company bosses fell in the first two months of this year, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. A survey of 322 directors from all sectors of business showed that last month only 43 per cent were more optimistic about their company's prospects than they were six months ago, compared with 48 per cent in December and 56 per cent in October. Those who were less optimistic rose from 12 per cent in October to 24 per cent last month. Economic optimism also declined, but by less than between October and December. Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the IoD, said: 'Confidence peaked last October, the month after the last interest rate reduction, and has been declining ever since.' Mr Morgan said the Budget might boost business but he did not expect to see any significant change in expectations until uncertainty was removed by the general election. Insufficient demand emerged as the main worry among directors, with 43 per cent rating it above cashflow problems. The 28 per cent reporting an upturn in orders reversed a rising trend, from the 38 per cent in December. Optimism varied throughout the three regions into which the IoD divides the country. The north - which includes Scotland - registered much greater optimism about company prospects than the Midlands - which includes Wales - or the south, which covers the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia. The Midlands was the only region where optimism about the economy rose between December and February. Those saying they were more optimistic rose from 35 per cent to 37 per cent compared with a fall from 40 per cent to 33 per cent in the north and from 36 per cent to 30 per cent in the south. Investment levels fell from an upturn in October to levels recorded through most of last year. In February 45 per cent of directors reported their companies to be investing, against 44 per cent in December and 56 per cent in October. Labour's proposed minimum wage would raise unemployment by at least 150,000 and add more than Pounds 2.5bn a year to employment costs, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The CBI said Labour's plans threatened to destroy a number of industries which are already struggling in the recession. There was particular concern about textiles, clothing footwear, tourism and agriculture. The economy is about to pick up, according to a survey of business opinion by the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, a trade body which represents industrial buyers. Its index of economic trends, stood at 50.8 last month, compared with 47.2 in January. IoD Business Opinion Survey, February 1992.

No. 15&hyph;17496) located in Knott County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to use a single overhead pipe system with 1/2 inch orifice automatic sprinklers located on 10 feet centers to cover 50 feet of fire-resistant belt or 150 feet of non-fire-resistant belt with actuation temperatures between 200 and 230 degrees fahrenheit with water pressure equal to or greater than 10 psi. The petitioner states that the sprinklers would be located 10 feet apart so that the discharge of water will extend over the belt drive, belt take-up, electrical control, and gear reducing unit. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

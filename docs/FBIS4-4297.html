			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Xin (2799 2946): "Enterprise Bonds Should </F> Be Standardized"]    [Text] Thus far, Heilongjiang Province has issued 2.43  billion yuan in bonds of local enterprises. These bonds have  ensured the supply of funds urgently needed by some enterprises  to expand their scale of production and to renew their equipment  and to open up a new money-lending channel for enterprises.  However, along with the fact that the bonds of some enterprises  have become due one after another, the cases of being unable to  cash the bonds have emerged time and again.    It is learned that the bonds of enterprises that became due  last year are being cashed in a rapid manner through the  consultation of enterprises, local financial departments, and  bond issuing departments.    However, the outlook for cashing this year's bonds is not  optimistic. Last year, the province issued 20-odd kinds of  local enterprise bonds, and most of them were of the one-year  short-term bonds. Therefore, enterprises' task of repaying debts  was very arduous. According to the analysis of the bonds of 52  enterprises issued by the provincial industrial and commercial  bank on a commission basis, two thirds of enterprise bonds will  be unable to be cashed when they become due.    There are many reasons for the failure in cashing enterprise  bonds, such as the poor management of enterprises, the slow  selling of products, the delayed completion and commission of  projects, the slow turnover of funds, and so on. Meanwhile, the  weakness in the linkage between bond issuance and bond  management also constitutes a major reason for the failure in  cashing bonds.    Enterprises should assume responsibility for investors.  Motivated by the principle of being responsible for investors  and adhering to the promise made before the issuance of bonds,  enterprises, as bond issuers and debt holders, should make best  use of the hard-won funds to accelerate the completion of  projects and increase economic returns in order to ensure that  the capital and interest of bonds will be cashed by the  scheduled time.    Banks and other bond issuance agencies should strengthen  supervision over and management of bonds. At present, some bond  issuance agencies in the province are careless in checking the  asset credit of enterprises before their bonds are issued and  take a laissez-faire attitude after the issuance of bonds. Some  enterprises use these funds to repay their own debts or divert  these funds for other purposes, instead of using them to renew  equipment as promised before the issuance of bonds. At the  moment, there is not a single organ in the province that manages  bonds in a unified manner. Stock dealers, banks, financial  departments, and pertinent departments of local governments  should form a joint force to strengthen the dynamics of bond  management in order to ensure that the bonds issued by  enterprises will be cashed on schedule.    On the occasion that many financial institutions are going  hither and thither to resolve the problem of being unable to  cash bonds, the bonds of Daqing Lianyi Chemical Industrial Plant  and Nanguang Zhiye Corporation issued by the Heilongjiang branch  of Guangda Bank on a commission basis have been cashed by the  scheduled time. This bank's strict management of bond issuance  has given us the following enlightenment. First, before the  bonds are issued, a bank should conduct a strict examination of  the asset credit of enterprises, as well as the managerial  efficiency, project feasibility, leading bodies, and development  prospects of enterprises, and an enterprise should not be  allowed to issue bonds unless its bond repayment rate reaches 20  percent or higher. Second, after the bonds are issued, credit  personnel should be dispatched to learn how these funds are used  and how the projects are being built in order to ensure the  appropriate use of these funds. Banks and enterprises should  report situations to each other frequently, and banks should  supervise and urge enterprises to get prepared for transferring  the funds for repaying the bonds 10 days before the expiration  of bonds.    Relevant persons offered the following several  countermeasures for resolving the failure in cashing bonds:  First, for the enterprises whose efficiency is relatively good  but whose funds cannot be circulated for a short while, bond  issuing agencies should pay the bonds for them and the  enterprises should repay the agencies. Or, new bonds can be  issued to pay the old bonds. Second, those enterprises that are  really unable to repay their bonds should declare bankruptcy to  repay the debts.</p>

Talks on a permanent end to the eight-year conflict have been  stalemated since a cease-fire in August, 1988. IRNA noted that Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein failed to address simultaneous withdrawal of his troops and the  repatriation of thousands of prisoners of war -- key Iranian demands.  </P></p>

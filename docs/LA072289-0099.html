			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ATHLETES GET MARCHING ORDERS  </P> <P> Imagine the problem facing the U.S. Olympic Committee and organizers of the  U.S. Olympic Festival who were planning Friday night's opening ceremonies held  at the University of Oklahoma: How to cajole more than 3,500 athletes into  behaving themselves in front of a national television audience -- and former  President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Of the eight previous multi-sport Olympic Festivals, this one in Oklahoma is  the first to have such a concern. Because of criticism regarding the manner in  which the American team marched into Seoul Stadium during the opening  ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic Games, USOC officials have been attempting to  indoctrinate a new generation of athletes in proper marching technique.  Starting here Friday night.  </P> <P> The Seoul gaffe, captured in detail by television and beamed around the world,  still embarrasses some U.S. officials. What the world saw was American athletes  wearing Mickey Mouse caps, carrying "Hi, Mom" signs, breaking rank and running  off the track and even going into the stands. Worse, as the delegation grew  ever more ragged, it caused a traffic jam among other nations marching in.  </P> <P> However, it was not unlike American entrances at other Olympics. What many in  the U.S. delegation regarded as exuberant, youthful behavior was seen by many  in the Olympic family as a display of boorish manners.  </P> <P> "We simply had no idea," said one USOC official here of the world reaction to  the Seoul spectacle.  </P> <P> They found out soon enough, though. An official in the International Olympic  Committee wrote an angry letter to the USOC delegation. The letter suggested  that the Americans' rowdy display had offended their Korean hosts.  </P> <P> The USOC got the message. Starting here, American athletes are being taught to  behave themselves while marching.  </P> <P> Before Friday night's ceremonies these young athletes, most of whom have not  competed internationally, were given a warning regarding what one official  called "horsing around."  </P> <P> The suspense was over early. The East team emerged from the northwest tunnel  and strolled around the perimeter of the field in a peppy but orderly fashion.  In fact, the East team's officials were in more ragged formation than the  athletes, a scene that held true as all four regions marched in to a medley of  tunes by John Phillip Sousa.  </P> <P> While the official admonitions appeared to have reined in the athletes during  the march into the stadium, little could be done to mollify bored athletes as  they stood around the infield during the early portion of the evening's show.  No lecture could have prevented the impromptu line dancing, handsprings and  mugging for cameras.  </P> <P> No one seemed to mind. After all, some allowances must be made for human  nature. And youth.  </P> <P> By festival standards, Friday night's show was the most glitzy and, quite  probably, the most expensive. The crowd was the festival's largest ever for  opening ceremonies, 76,014. Comedian Bob Hope was merely a warm-up for the main  act, Reagan, who saluted the athletes and asked them to "Win one for the  Gipper."  </P> <P> Triple Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner carried the festival  flame into Memorial Stadium, clad in her signature one-legged tights.  </P> <P> As far as these football-field-as-stage extravaganzas go, this one lacked none  of the standard gimmicks.  </P> <P>  -- Air Force jets buzzed the stadium. Skydivers carrying smoke devices landed  on the 20-yard line. Hot air ballons. Fireworks. Laser light shows.  </P> <P>  -- The Oklahoma High School All-Star Band blared out songs that sought to  "Salute Oklahoma's role in America's westward expansion." Which meant they  played songs like the themes to TV's "Rawhide" and "Wild, Wild West".  </P> <P> Whatever the act or whoever the star, the message never drifted far from  evening's central theme -- Oklahoma. And those who have lived in it and still  do and why. Famous Oklahomans such as James Garner, Patti Page, Mickey Mantle  and Curt Gowdy were brought out to tremendous applause. Singers Roger Miller,  Reba McEntire and the Oak Ridge Boys performed to tremendous applause.  </P> <P> In fact, everything on the program was met with tremendous applause.  </P> <P> The loudest applause was saved for the entrance of the South team, favorite  sons here. In a remarkable development, the state's most favorite son was among  those who escorted the South team. Former Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer  was introduced, and the crowd went wild. That was fanned when another celebrity  escort, former Sooner running back Billy Sims, spontaneously grabbed Switzer in  a bear hug.  </P> <P> Switzer, who recently resigned while his football program continued to wilt  under intense scrutiny from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., walked  quietly amid the tumult.  </P></p>

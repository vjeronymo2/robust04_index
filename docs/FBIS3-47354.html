Large-scale farming is needed to cut the cost of rice  production in Japan, said the officials at the Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry [MAFF].    Later this month the government is expected to compile the  extra budget for the year ending next March 31 as part of its  economic stimulus package.    The extra money is needed to deal with the government's  decision in December to partially open Japan's rice market, the  officials said.    The government made the decision when it accepted a proposal  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the  GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of global trade talks.    Under the proposal, Japan will be exempted from  tariffication  of rice imports for a grace period of six years, in return for  which it will import 400,000 to 800,000 tons of rice a year as  "minimum access" to imports.    The ministry is seeking to expand the scale of rice farming  by increasing the minimum size of a paddy field to one hectare  from the present 30 acres, the officials said.    Mechanization will also be promoted on rice farms through  government-subsidized loans.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poll news leaves Footsie at 1992 low EVIDENCE from opinion polls that Labour has established a significant lead over the Conservative party triggered a predictable, but nevertheless heavy, slide in UK share prices, which closed at their lowest levels so far this year. The falls compounded a difficult day in international stock markets which saw another hefty fall on the Tokyo market and a poor showing by Wall Street during the afternoon. The FT-SE 100-share Index plunged through the 2,400 level but later rallied to close well above the day's worst with a net fall of 31.5 at 2,408.6. The steep drop in share prices accompanied big falls in the gilt-edged market and a rise in the three-month interbank rate as markets pondered the chances of an increase in UK interest rates - currently at 10 1/2 per cent - after next Thursday's general election. The slide in equities took place during the busiest trading session on the stock market this year. Seaq turnover totalled 701.6m shares, compared with a previous high of 606.1m recorded on February 27. Yesterday's figure, however, was given a substantial boost by a series of big placings and at least six mostly small-size programme trades. Marketmakers, most of which were thought to be carrying long positions, took evasive action from the outset, chopping prices back to head off any attempted sizeable selling. The Footsie opened 56 points down at 2,384.1, subsequently proving to be the day's lowest, and quickly embarked on a determined rally as a number of institutions moved in to pick up cheap stock. Dealers said 2,400 had been the trigger for a flurry of support. The buying petered out mid-morning, however, with the index standing 26.7 off. The afternoon session proved equally difficult for traders, with a weak Wall Street opening prompting fresh bouts of selling of leading UK stocks. Some senior marketmakers were dismayed at the latest turn of events. One said the market had to absorb big lines of stock following heavy selling by UK institutions. 'The market has been spooked and it looks odds on a Labour administration,' said one. 'The mood is dreadful and there is still plenty of downside. I just hope the overseas funds do not start selling,' he added. Other dealers, however, said they had recorded more big institutional buy trades than sales. 'There was an element of panic but it seems the market has found a pretty good trading level,' was one view. The drama of a falling market tended to mask some hefty share placings and a series of corporate events. United Newspapers was the most heavily traded stock as bought deal specialist Smith New Court, in tandem with Cazenove, swooped to purchase the 8.7 per cent stake of some 17.25m shares held by Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian entrepreneur, and placed the shares in the market, taking a 4p a share turn in the process. Smith also bought and sold a block of 3.5m shares in Lasmo, the oil group, making a profit of 3p a share. Utilities, retailers and property and building issues, undermined by fears of a rise in interest rates, were among the worst affected areas.</p>

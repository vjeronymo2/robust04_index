			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Poll on Slovak sell-off sought Mr Michal Kovac, Slovak president, yesterday called a referendum for October 22, three weeks after national elections, to decide whether to require all Slovak citizens buying state property in the country's privatisation programme to state the source of their funds. The move was forced on the government by the parliamentary opposition, who claimed that a similar law passed by the government earlier this week did not go far enough. The law already passed, requiring potential buyers to give documentary evidence of the origins of their funds, was made just ahead of a second round of sell-offs due to start next month. The referendum is being used as a political weapon by the former prime minister, Mr Vladimr Mecr, who lost a confidence vote in March.</p>

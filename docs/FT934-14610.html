			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fate of Groupe Bull chairman in balance THE FATE of Mr Bernard Pache, 58, chairman and chief executive of Groupe Bull, the state-owned French computer manufacturer, was in the balance last night. There is sharp disagreement between the industry ministry and the finance ministry over whether Mr Pache should be replaced or allowed to oversee his plan for the recovery of the loss-making company. The French cabinet has yet to take a decision. According to sources close to the government, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has decided that Mr Pache, chairman for little more than a year, should be replaced by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, a former head of the French packaging company Carnaud, who has a reputation for vigorous management methods. Mr Longuet is believed to be exasperated by slow progress in the transformation of Bull from a loss-making company which is out of touch with its market to a suitable candidate for privatisation. Groupe Bull would not say that Mr Pache was to be replaced. One senior executive said: 'There is a long distance between one minister's desk and the Council of Ministers,' implying that the French government would not automatically rubber stamp Mr Longuet's decision. If Mr Pache, formerly the French coal board chairman, is replaced by Mr Descarpentries it will leave Bull for the second time, and at its most vulnerable point, in the hands of someone who has little experience of the computer industry. The company is in desperate straits, having lost FFr15bn (Dollars 2.65bn) over the past three years. Mr Pache's recovery plan, which is likely to be published next week, will call for up to FFr9.2bn of state aid. Negotiations between Mr Pache and Mr Longuet over the size of the capital injection required are thought to have held up earlier announcement of the recovery measures.</p>

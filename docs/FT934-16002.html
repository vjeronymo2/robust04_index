			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Irish PM welcomes peace initiative by Hume THE IRISH government responded positively yesterday to the peace initiative of Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. The initiative, launched 11 days ago in Belfast, is aimed at ending the paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume spent almost two hours explaining the initiative to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister. Mr Reynolds said afterwards: 'John Hume gave us a document setting out the broad principles, which all of us agree could be a just and a lasting peace process to be established and worked upon. We will evaluate what we have heard today with our colleagues in government and we will consider how, in our discussions with the British government, this can contribute to the building of a peace process.' Government officials confirmed that the document was the same report referred to by Mr Hume and Mr Adams in their joint statement launching the peace initiative. The foreign ministry said: 'We will certainly contemplate discussing it with the British government as part of a wider process leading to a settlement (on Northern Ireland)'. Mr Reynolds said the document itself would not be presented to the British government. Mr Hume said: 'I gave a very detailed briefing on a strategy for peace that I believe now exists and I am quite happy with the (government) response.' Neither he nor the Irish government is likely to release any further details of the initiative. Mr Hume appealed to the media for patience, saying: 'The less speculation and more confidentiality the better. As they showed in Norway (in the Middle East peace process) secrecy helped create agreement there.' The Northern Ireland Office did not wish to comment, but Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, was deeply suspicious of the secrecy surrounding the initiative. 'Is it reasonable that we should be expected to react positively on the basis of some hypothetical document that in fact was probably cobbled together on the way back from John Hume's trip to America?' he asked. The Irish cabinet is to discuss the proposals next Tuesday. Mr Reynolds said on Wednesday he believed any negotiated settlement should be put to a 'simultaneous' referendum north and south of the border, but he reaffirmed the Unionists' effective right to veto any new constitutional arrangement for the province, as established in the 1985 Anglo-Irish treaty.</p>

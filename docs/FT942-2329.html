			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Pension funds Last week's decision by the European Commission to shelve the deregulation of pension fund management is a big setback to the creation of a single market in the European Union. It is possible that liberalisation can still be achieved if the Commission brings proceedings to enforce the free movement of capital promised by the Treaty of Rome. But that will take years, at high cost to taxpayers and pension fund members of countries that maintain controls over fund management. The cost to taxpayers arises from the higher bond yields that will be required to finance budget deficits in such countries. Controls on pension fund investment ensure a captive market of buyers for government bonds and share issues involved in privatisation programmes. But funds can generally be raised more cheaply from the global savings pool. The cost to pension fund members comes in the form of increased risk resulting from inadequate portfolio diversification. Diversification improves the return that funds achieve by giving access to growing markets. It is also a less risky strategy than investing in a single country. These are benefits that no European country can afford to neglect as pension costs rise with the ageing of populations. Capital market restrictions are likely to prove ineffective in the long run. The financial services industry will find ways to create synthetic exposure to foreign markets for pension funds. So will the sort of cross-border mergers in insurance and pensions seen this week with the purchase by Commercial Union of French insurer Groupe Victoire. But it would be better to purge Europe of pension fund investment restrictions and reap the benefits of an integrated, efficient European capital market.</p>

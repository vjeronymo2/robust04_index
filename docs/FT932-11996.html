			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Scheme to woo corporate investors outlined LLOYD'S aims to attract corporate investors next year but has reduced its expectations for the growth of its capital base. The plan expects a capital base of between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 12bn by 1997, compared with a minimum target of Pounds 13bn proposed by the Rowland task force in January last year. Corporate investors - 'incorporated Names' as they are called in the business plan - will be structured as limited-liability companies dedicated to underwriting at Lloyd's, with minimum paid-up capital of Pounds 1.5m. They will be required to hold capital equal to 50 per cent of their underwriting limits (the amount of premium they are able to receive). This will usually be fully paid-up, although in some cases Lloyd's will accept letters of credit. Incorporated Names will pay 1.5 per cent of their underwriting limit to the central fund - which is used when Names are unable to meet their obligations - compared with 0.6 per cent for individual Names. Lloyd's will aim to provide incorporated Names with a pre-tax return on capital of more than 25 per cent, made up of an average underwriting profit of 10 per cent of underwriting limit - 20 per cent of paid-up capital - plus income from investments. The plan warns: 'This is a demanding target for Lloyd's. It is likely therefore that the admission of incorporated Names will increase the pressure on underwriters to achieve higher returns than in the past through a combination of better underwriting disciplines and tighter control on costs.' Rules governing participation of individual Names are also modified. Names with assets of least Pounds 500,000 and income above a specified level will have their 'funds at Lloyd's requirement' cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent of stamp capacity. Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements (Mapas) are to be introduced - a unit trust or pooling arrangement allowing investors to spread their participations across a wider spread of syndicates. Participating Names will also need to deposit fewer funds with Lloyd's (25 per cent of stamp capacity). The upper limit on underwriting - presently Pounds 3m - is to be removed and for the first time Names will be able to place deposits in US dollars. Lloyd's is also concerned to manage its capital base to avoid the oversupply which depressed premium rates in the late 1980s. Incorporated Names will be required to bid for the new capacity the council makes available each year. Lloyd's is also to introduce risk profiling, changing the deposit and solvency ratios depending on the risks of the business in which syndicates and Names specialise.</p>

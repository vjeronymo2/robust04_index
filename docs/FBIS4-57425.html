			<p>BFN     [Text] More job losses in the pipeline for Trinidad and  Tobago, this time at (Petrotrin). Chief executive officer (Keith  Owah) says the company's wage bill must be reduced from 47  percent of the company's operating costs to at least 35 percent.  (Petrotrin) was formed last year by a merger of (Trintopec) and  (Trintoc), and the new management is seeking to divest the  nonpetroleum assets of the two companies. (Nicole Huggins) tells  us more in this dispatch:    [Begin recording] [(Huggins)] The refining operations of  (Petrotrin) have lost as much as $15 million annually over the  past seven years. Output stands at less than 50 percent  capacity, and with international oil prices expected to remain  soft -- between $15 and $17 per barrel -- (Patten C.U. Keith  Owah) sums up the company's strategic plan in one word:  survival. Part of the plan is the sale of the Point Fortin  refinery. Mr. (Owah) says there have already been informal  statements of interest, but serious offers are expected, maybe  by the end of the month. Most refineries are running on  technology that is 30 years old, but Mr. (Owah) says he is  fairly optimistic that an interested party will be found.    [(Owah)] In South America, you have countries with surplus  crude and no adequate refining capability. Even in North  America, you may find people, who are importing crude to process  in the U.S., who might find Trinidad a good geographical  location to begin investing in upgrading a refinery. So the  point is that even though it is an old refinery, it is  relatively safe in terms of refinery configuration. There is a  good base on which to build an upgraded refinery.    [(Huggins)] The company is also looking at divesting the  nonetroleum assets of (Trintoc) and (Trintopec), from catering  services and hospitals to agricultural holdings. The  Point-a-Pierre refinery is in the process of being upgraded, at  a cost of TT $1.5 billion, and a venture partner is now being  sought.    [(Owah)] I do not think today, we can say exatly what form  that alliance will take, but it could be from one extreme -- an  equity partner -- to another extreme, where you simply have an  alliance with someone providing raw material and (?taking  product), and that kind of thing. Our objective is to minimize  our risk.    [(Huggins)] The upgrade is scheduled for completion by the  first quarter of 1996, at least. The divestment of assets and  the restructuring of the company are expected to lead to further  cuts in the workforce over 1994-95, and those who remain may not  have to accept much less, but will have to produce much more.</p>

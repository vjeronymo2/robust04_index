			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors cut gold holdings, says report EUROPEAN AND North American investors cut their gold bullion holdings by nearly 300 tonnes in the first half of this year, according to the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. That is equivalent to six months output from South Africa, the world's biggest producer, it points out. The 'ease with which metal has so far been tempted away from these investors' at a time of low and flat gold prices is one important reason that prices have not been rising in spite of a substantial fall in supply and continued record demand, says MMRS in its latest World Bullion Market report. Looking ahead, it suggests that, while low interest rates and higher gold prices in recent weeks may be restraining further gold disinvestment in North America, 'the opportunity cost of holding gold in Europe remains significant.' Although gold's price went up in dollar terms in July its price in most European currencies was virtually unchanged because of a weakening dollar. So 'major disinvestment from Europe could well continue through the foreseeable future'. MMRS also suggests that much of the growth in demand for gold in recent years has been in high carat, low added-value jewellery and bars in the developing Asian economies. The consultancy group believes that any substantial price increase would result in a concurrent drop in demand from this area of consumption, causing prices to ease again. The report estimates that western world gold production remained stable in the first half of this year and that supplies from the former eastern bloc countries dropped by half to only 135 tonnes. Taking other components into account, MMRS suggests that total gold supply in the western countries is likely to fall by 7 per cent during the whole of 1992 to 2,470 tonnes. Meanwhile, demand has remained high and 'assuming no further large sales by central banks' the market should be in deficit for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, MMRS concludes that 'while the bear market might have ended, it is far too early to suggest that recent dollar price gains are the start of gold's long awaited revival'. It believes the gold price will move sideways for a while, 'laying the foundations for a slow recovery towards the mid-1990s'. World Bullion Market, quarterly.

This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in tension ties. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension ties and the resultant rapid decompression of the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters support the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed 1,000-flight cycle compliance time for low-time airplanes be revised to require that the inspection be performed ``upon the accumulation of 20,000 total flight cycles or within 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever comes later.'' The FAA does not concur. Since cracking has been found on airplanes that had accumulated less than 20,000 flight cycles, the FAA reasoned that requiring inspection of all airplanes within 1,000 flight cycles, regardless of the total number of flight cycles, would be prudent to preclude the propagation of cracks in airplanes in the Model 747 fleet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying that pressurization cycles of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight cycles relative to the proposed compliance thresholds. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that operating at cabin pressure differentials of 2.0 psi or less is applicable to only one operator. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions in an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Further, this commenter does not compile data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined; instead, it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD. Furthermore, since there are numerous factors that affect the calculation of flight cycles, such as total number of low pressure cycles, amount of thrust, number of gross weight flight cycles, etc., the FAA has determined that these mitigating factors could be best evaluated through requests for alternative methods of compliance, as provided for in paragraph (c) of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the FAA and Boeing review the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), which requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program include inspections that will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI). This commenter states that the proposed inspection of the tension ties may be included in the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. The FAA concurs and has reviewed the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. This AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks that were detected while performing inspections specified by the Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) program, which was required to be implemented by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01. The purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program of a sample number of airplanes, which will detect the potential for cracking in specific areas of the airplane that are critical for safety of flight. Whenever cracks are found in an SSI during an inspection in accordance with the SSID program, the FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition within the applicable fleet. This AD is issued in response to such a finding. Therefore, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01 to remove the requirement to inspect the tension ties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

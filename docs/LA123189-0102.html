			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: ECHEVERRIA'S 21 POINTS GIVE HER USD CAREER LEAD  </P> <P> Candida Echeverria made a pair of free throws late in an 84-62 victory over  Arizona State Saturday night to become the University of San Diego's all-time  leading women's basketball scorer.  </P> <P> Echeverria, a senior guard, scored 21 points and led the Toreras (9-1) to their  eighth consecutive victory at the USD Sports Center.  </P> <P> Her 18th and 19th points, free throws with four minutes 18 seconds left, tied  and broke the USD record of 1,010 points set by Debbie Theroux in 1983-86.  Theroux is now an assistant for Coach Kathy Marpe.  </P> <P> "She deserves it," Theroux said. "She works hard for every point she gets. We  still have a half a year to go, so I'm sure she's going to add quite a bit to  it."  </P> <P> USD shot 46% from the field to just 27% for Arizona State, which lost for just  the second time this season and is now 7-2. It was the first time USD has  beaten the Sun Devils in four attempts.  </P> <P> USD went up by as much as 17 points in the first half and led at halftime,  44-32. ASU drew to within 51-41, but seven in a row for USD -- four on two  17-foot jumpers by Angie Straub -- essentially put it away.  </P> <P> Echeverria, who played only 26 minutes, had 13 points in the first half but did  not score in the second until 7:11 remained. A 15-foot shot from the left  baseline and a driving layup off an assist from Paula Mascari (16 points) put  her within one of the record.  </P> <P> Echeverria was set up for the record when she took a pass on a fast break and  was fouled attempting a layup.  </P> <P> In the Toreras' first game, Echeverria broke the school mark for free throws in  a career.

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: ITT could take effective control of Ciga next week ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, could take effective control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, next week, in spite of having a direct stake of only 17.4 per cent. After Ciga's annual general meeting yesterday, the Italian company's directors are to meet next Tuesday, when they are likely to agree a reshuffle, allowing up to three ITT representatives on to the Ciga board. But Italian fund managers made clear at the shareholder meeting that the US company would not be able to ride roughshod over smaller investors' interests. Their strong stand could herald a new role for Italian funds, which have mainly been passive investors in large Italian companies, unlike their counterparts in the UK and US. ITT built up its stake in Ciga, through its Sheraton International unit after failing to acquire the company, previously controlled by the Aga Khan. A rights issue in March was expected to be a failure, delivering Ciga into the hands of its creditor banks, which would then sell a controlling stake to ITT. But the rights issue was a success, raising L1,003bn (Dollars 625.7m) for Ciga to help reduce its heavy borrowings. ITT's delegate at yesterday's assembly - Mr Francesco Gianni, a Milan lawyer  -confirmed afterwards that ITT's stake was not a speculative investment. At the meeting, he also voted on behalf of a fund, Arca, which owns 2.7 per cent of Ciga, but he stressed those shares were owned separately. Mr Gianni suggested that because of legal technicalities, ITT would not be obliged to bid for a further 17.4 per cent of the company, as is usually required by Italian rules when an investor gains effective control of a company. Consob, Italy's stock market watchdog, will have to decide what ITT's next step should be. The second largest individual shareholder in Ciga, Bankers Trust International, with a 6.65 per cent stake, was not represented at the annual meeting. A group of funds holding some 15 per cent of the Ciga's shares voiced support for ITT yesterday, but abstained from the formal vote on the 1993 balance sheet to show their autonomy.</p>

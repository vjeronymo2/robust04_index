			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Yeltsin turns up with a smile and apologies - Russian leader shrugs off earlier slights to Japanese sentiment over Kurile Islands dispute TO THE RELIEF of his Japanese hosts, who must have been wondering if he would ever touch tarmac in Tokyo, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin yesterday arrived for the Group of Seven summit with a wry smile and an expression of regret for previous appointments he was unable to keep. Twice in the past year, Mr Yeltsin has cancelled bilateral visits. But the Russian leader was confident that in attending a multilateral conference he would not be forced to make concessions on the territorial dispute with Tokyo over the Kurile Islands, off northern Japan. On landing, Mr Yeltsin said he 'regretted' having been unable to pay an official visit last September and expressed gratitude to the Japanese government and people for their 'understanding of the circumstances' which had forced him to cancel. That visit was called off under combined pressure from conservative opponents who accused him of planning to sell off Russian territory, and from Japanese expectations of real progress in retrieving the Kuriles in return for economic aid. Yesterday Mr Yeltsin assured his Japanese hosts that they would 'always find in the new Russia an honest and constant partner'. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, later said the Russian leader's statement was appreciated by the Japanese people. In Japan Mr Yeltsin is almost as unpopular as Mr Miyazawa's cabinet, which has an approval rating under 10 per cent. A Japanese foreign ministry official said the two countries agreed that preparations would begin for the much-postponed bilateral visit to take place in mid-October. But the Japanese appeared to be setting themselves up for a new disappointment when a foreign ministry official said Mr Yeltsin had to expect substantive negotiations on the territorial issue. 'In talking about improving relations, we take a position that the improvement will come with the settlement of this dispute,' a foreign ministry official said. 'He (Mr Yeltsin) also has some understanding that this is the issue.' Although strengthened by his victory in the April constitutional referendum, Mr Yeltsin still faces considerable domestic opposition to any territorial concessions, particularly now that Russia itself is in danger of breaking up. Only yesterday, the Far Eastern region centred on the key port of Vladivostok declared itself to be a republic within Russia. The four Kurile Islands were occupied by Soviet troops in the final days of the second world war, and the two countries have been unable to sign a peace treaty because of the dispute over their ownership. Mr Miyazawa told the Russian leader that Japan understood his domestic difficulties, but that their differences must be settled on the principles of 'law and justice' - a formula also used by Mr Yeltsin but with a different meaning.</p>

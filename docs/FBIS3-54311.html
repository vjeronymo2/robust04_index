			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Amman SHIHAN in Arabic, in its 22-28  January issue publishes on pages 8-9 an approximately 2,500-word  interview with Jordanian Health Minister 'Abd-al-Rahim Malhas,  who says he has effectively resigned his post to protest the  government's leniency toward "the pharmaceuticals mafia," and  those "who allow them to break the law."    In the interview, the minister explains the violations  committed by importers of foodstuffs and medicines and accuses  them of importing material unfit for human consumption and low  quality and "rotten" food. He also notes that these importers  and merchants have strong connections and "money to buy people,  newspapers, and everything else." He also hints at differences  with the prime minister over the way to handle the dispute with  the merchants and importers.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Perkins' Japanese venture to build compact diesels in UK Perkins, the Peter-borough-based diesel engine producer, is to create a joint venture with Japan's Ishikawajima-Shibaura Machinery (ISM) to develop and build compact low-emission diesel engines in the UK. The joint venture company, in which Perkins will be the majority shareholder, will build up to 50,000 compact diesel engines a year by 2000. Additional jobs will be created at Peterborough for a dedicated facility due to begin production in early 1996. It will, said Perkins, combine the best in European and Japanese technology. Perkins has been distributing ISM's engines worldwide since 1987, but believes that a joint venture will help it sharply increase its share of the market for compact engines, where demand is rising. Both companies believe a European manufacturing base will enable delivery times to be reduced significantly. ISM hopes to keep the effect of the production shift on its Matsumoto plant to a minimum by increasing other business. The 5-50 bhp engines from the venture will be the smallest ever produced by Perkins. The deal will complement the strategic alliance announced earlier this year by Perkins and Iseki, another Japanese company, to build a range of 50-75 bhp engines at Peterborough, starting in 1995.</p>

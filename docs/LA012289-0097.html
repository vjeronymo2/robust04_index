			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LEBANESE FEUDAL ELITE -- PASSING OF AN ERA BRINGS MIXED FEELINGS IN TROUBLED  LAND  </P> <P> They were wealthy, educated, cosmopolitan in their taste for the finer things  of life.  </P> <P> Lebanon's feudal elite ran the country as a private club, with a restricted  membership and an etiquette handed down from father to son.  </P> <P> Christian or Muslim, they were often landowners on a grand scale or members of  the intelligentsia with enough family money to buy themselves a newspaper to  run or a safe seat in Parliament.  </P> <P> Some were ruthless, ready to use violence to safeguard their  states-within-a-state to the extent of calling the U.S. Marines to come ashore  and help out.  </P> <P> Even today, especially in rural areas, the surviving elite of the old Lebanon  are still revered.  </P> <P> But Lebanon will not see their like again, and their passing evokes mixed  feelings.  </P> <P> Some regard this fading generation as including people who invited foreign  intervention and were largely to blame for the civil war that broke out 13  years ago and still shows no sign of ending.  </P> <P> "These effete people designed the system that got us into this mess," said a  senior militia officer, a man in his 30s from a poor family and with a radical  view of Lebanon's ills.  </P> <P> For others, particularly the middle class, a decline of the ancient regime and  a diminution in stature of the surviving gentry leave a vacuum in leadership.  After all, had not several statesmen emerged from the old national elite?  </P> <P> Taqi Eddine Solh, a former premier who died last month at age 79, was regarded  as a gentleman of the old school and very much a moderating influence.  </P> <P> Scion of a prominent Sunni Muslim family, he was educated at the American  University of Beirut and began a career as a journalist.  </P> <P> Twice premier, he was one of the architects of the 1943 National Pact, which  sought to contain the fires of communal competition by dividing top  governmental jobs along religious lines, so everyone got a share.  </P> <P> That was the theory. In practice, many Lebanese say, some got a lot more than  others and the system simply papered over the cracks instead of building a real  sense of identity.  </P> <P> The last surviving politician who helped formulate the pact is Shia Defense  Minister Adel Osseiran, a landowner from southern Lebanon and, at 83, a man  still admired for his personal charm and gentle approach to intractable  problems.  </P> <P> A very different man was former President Camille Chamoun, who died last year  at age 87.  </P> <P> A hard-line champion of Christian prerogatives, his attempts to draw Lebanon  into the Baghdad Pact -- a British-sponsored buffer against a tide of Arab  nationalism personified by the late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser --  precipitated the country's first civil war in 1958.  </P> <P> Chamoun's response was to invite the United States to intervene, and U.S.  Marines landed at Beirut.  </P> <P> A northern warlord politically active at least until a few months ago is former  President Suleiman Franjieh. His close personal friendship with Syrian  President Hafez Assad dates back to 1957, when Franjieh sought refuge in Syria  after a gunfight with another northern clan in a village church.  </P> <P> Also a Maronite Christian, he ran again as candidate in Lebanon's presidential  election in August at the age of 78 -- but Christian deputies opposed to Syrian  influence in the country boycotted Parliament, and the vote failed to take  place.  </P> <P> Instead, outgoing President Amin Gemayel handed over the reins of office --  what little there was of it -- to a Christian army officer of modest origins,  Michel Aoun, who set up an administration to rival a Muslim-led Cabinet in West  Beirut.  </P> <P> Gemayel may be the last of his Maronite family to play a prominent role in  national affairs.  </P> <P> His father, Pierre Gemayel, formed the Falangist party in 1936.  </P> <P> In 1982, Amin's younger brother Bashir was elected president in the wake of the  Israeli invasion.  </P></p>

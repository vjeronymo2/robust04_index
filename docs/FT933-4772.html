			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: BHP mines a different seam with Fosters - Broken Hill found a new direction in a hostile bid BROKEN HILL Proprietary, a unique blend of businesses that add up to Australia's biggest company, boasts it is doing better than most of the world's 'pure' oil, mining or steel groups. But can it repeat the trick with beer? There is no reason why not, says Mr John Prescott, chairman and chief executive. BHP has been tightening its grip on Fosters, the world's fourth-largest brewing group, after paying ADollars 1.6bn (USDollars 1.06bn) last year for 37 per cent stake and putting four people on the board. BHP's connection with Fosters arose from the complex defence BHP mounted in 1988 when the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian corporate raider, made a determined run at BHP. Eventually freed from Mr Holmes a Court's clutches, BHP was left with an indirect holding in Fosters. BHP then took a direct stake in the brewer to protect its investment. Mr Prescott says this has stabilised Fosters' balance sheet and its board. Fosters has been encouraged to sell non-core assets. 'Clearly our aim is to build up the value of the Fosters investment to its book value. 'But why stop there? If we have been successful with building Fosters' fortunes from where they were last year to a stage where we have put the value of the investment above its book value, why should we quit?' Mr Prescott says Fosters has been very good at marketing its products. But BHP can help it develop other management skills, divisionalise and devolve management responsibility like BHP, and achieve international ambitions. How does BHP, one of the world's top five mining companies measured by profitability, one of the top ten oil companies and one of the very few profitable steel producers, rationalise this move towards becoming a conglomerate? Mr Prescott explains: 'We don't intend to become a conglomerate but we do intend to take a broad view of our skills base and where that skills base might lead us.' BHP has been upgrading the planning function in all its divisions and looking ahead to the year 2,010. Mr Prescott says that by then the group will not simply be a larger version of BHP. 'We need to do more than grow our existing businesses; we need to get our profitability on to a higher plane.' This talk about profit and returns is quite unlike the BHP of old. Some analysts suggest it needed someone like Mr Holmes a Court to ginger up BHP, which owned some of the richest chunks of Australia and seemed able to turn a profit in its sleep. But in the mid-1980s, before Mr Holmes a Court appeared on the scene, BHP had already begun to 'go international'. The process started with the 1984 acquisition of Utah Minerals International, bringing with it North American coal and copper interests. Then BHP began mining copper and gold at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea, and at the begining of the 1990s brought Escondida, one of the world's best copper mines, into production in Chile. All this brought a big change in outlook. BHP today is prepared to go to the best oil fields and mines in the world rather than wait for them to be found in Australia. Mr Prescott points out that, while two thirds of the group's business originates in Australia, only 20 per cent is paid for in Australian dollars. 'BHP is not a proxy for investment in Australia,' he says. Last year BHP's pre-tax profit totalled ADollars 1.89bn. The minerals (mining) division made a ADollars 738.2m profit (up from ADollars 653.8m); the petroleum division made ADollars 509.5m (ADollars 381m) and the steel division ADollars 323.2m (ADollars 189.5m.) Spending, boosted by the purchase of Fosters' shares, reached ADollars 4bn. BHP has ADollars 5bn of approved projects to take it into the next century and another ADollars 3bn in the advanced planning stage. Everything BHP does has to be low-cost, 'at the bottom of the cost curve'. Any asset that is non-performing, in terms of return on capital and cash generation and growth potential, will be considered a non-core asset. 'We have quit some things that people thought were fundamental to us because they failed to meet these criteria,' he says. BHP assumes that there will be very limited economic growth in the OECD countries, that economic cycles will continue and that the demand for the minerals it currently produces will grow more slowly than world economic growth. 'When you have billions of tonnes of iron ore and coal in reserves and hundreds of millions of tonnes of copper, you ask yourself wouldn't it be more profitable creating a market for all that rather than exploring for more?' He says BHP must 'find new platforms for growth. We must find new things to do. We might have to move outside the types of opportunities we have hitherto engaged in to reach the growth we look for.' In 1984 BHP doubled in size with the acquisition of Utah. Could it do the same again, particularly as many assets are going cheap at this phase of the recession? Mr Prescott says BHP could tackle an acquisition of any size. 'The balance sheet is strong enough to tackle anything we might contemplate.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- "Commanders of  the Moldovan Military units periodically raised at the  Ministry's consultations the necessity for resuming the courses  of military training at schools," stated to BASA Grigore  Guritanu, from the Defense Ministry. He argued that recruits  are poorly prepared for military service. Military training in  Moldova was suspended in 1990. Guritanu pointed out that the  Defense Ministry has received letters from former teachers of  military training proposing to resume these courses. He  mentioned that the Defense Ministry has not yet begun to design  projects on this matter. In his opinion, to adopt such a  decision would mean large financial expenses not only for  teachers' salaries but for restoring supplies which have lately  drastically diminished. "Decisions on such matters are made at  the Governmental level. As to the Defense Ministry, it would  welcome the resumption of military training in schools, but it  does not have the necessary financial resources for this," said  Guritanu. Valeriu Senic, chairman of the Parliamentary  Commission for Education, stated to BASA that the concept of  general education is being elaborated: therefore, it is too  early to say if military training will be resumed in schools.  "In my opinion, all problems connected to the preparation of  recruits can be settled in the physical training classes. But I  will not oppose the resumption of military training in schools,  if it is legally introduced," said Senic.</p>

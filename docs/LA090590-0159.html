			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TELETHON RETURNING TO HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Jerry Lewis said he will return to Hollywood next Labor Day with his Muscular  Dystrophy Assn. telethon after raising a record amount in pledges this year.  </P> <P> Association officials said the 21 1/2-hour show, which ended Monday, raised  $44.1 million to fight 40 neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple  thousands each year, most of them young people. Last year's tally was $42.2  million.  </P> <P> The telethon regularly breaks its pledge records, but ratings in recent years  have dropped. Viewing figures are to be released in two or three days.  </P> <P> Producers moved the 25th annual telethon to Los Angeles after 17 years in Las  Vegas to reduce costs and update the show's image.  </P></p>

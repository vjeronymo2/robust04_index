			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Binder firms see merger backing The four largest regional partnerships within BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest accountancy firm, have expressed tentative support for a merger with Arthur Andersen, the fourth largest, it emerged yesterday. Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and the partnership covering London and Leeds all expressed support for the idea of a merger, proposed by Andersen earlier this month. These four represent more than two-thirds of Binder's total partners and more than 70 per cent of staff and fee income, making approval for the merger highly likely if the final terms are favourable. The remaining partnerships are still considering the proposals, with Scotland currently most opposed. The others are East Anglia, Northern Ireland, Bristol, Poole, Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Those involved in the discussions, which include topics such as partner equity and responsibility for any litigation, are hoping to present outline 'heads of agreement' for the merger to all Binder's partners next week. In a memo to senior partners on Monday, Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's managing partner, said that the initial proposals would allow the firm to maintain a separate identity within an enlarged Andersen, and continue to practise under the Binder Hamlyn name. He stressed that any merger would not lead to material changes in personnel, the manner in which clients were served, or fees charged.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> UNDISCLOSED GRANTS FOR ARTS RAISE ISSUE OF FAVORITISM  </P> <P> Are public grants awarded by the much-heralded Los Angeles Endowment for the  Arts subject to private political pressures, either real or imagined?  </P> <P> That unfortunate question surfaced Saturday, when documents obtained by The  Times showed that $352,000 in previously undisclosed discretionary grants had  been awarded to 32 area organizations by the city's Cultural Affairs  Department. By far the largest of these awards -- $50,000 -- was made to a  museum whose regular application had been turned down for funding by a duly  appointed peer-review panel, but whose board of trustees includes a prominent  city councilman. The undisclosed grant was also for substantially more money  than any award made by the peer-review committee.  </P> <P> Misconduct has been adamantly denied. The Cultural Affairs Department has  explained that a late-term increase in its budget, received long after regular  applications had been reviewed by review panels, made additional funds  unexpectedly available for awards. Department staff, reportedly responding to a  request from the City Council, decided to distribute those funds to a variety  of organizations, including unsuccessful applicants, chosen by themselves and  by City Council recommendation.  </P> <P> These discretionary grants may well have been made with perfectly benign  intent. Heaven knows, there are dozens of worthy cultural organizations that  desperately need the money. And from the list of both peer panel and  discretionary grants I've seen, the unusual $50,000 grant at issue is for a  program of the very highest merit, both in its own right and in comparison to  those the panel did recommend for funding.  </P> <P> Still, the episode leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. The reason is that even  the appearance of cronyism jeopardizes the integrity of the new Los Angeles  Endowment for the Arts and of the system of peer-panel review that is its very  lifeblood.  </P> <P> Peer-panel review means an independent jury of peers selects grant recipients  on the basis of disinterested evaluations of merit. Cultural Affairs Department  staff obviously cannot be regarded as impartial observers; nor could the City  Council or any other political office. Like my own impression of the relative  merits of specific grant recipients and rejects, their opinions are largely  academic -- and ought to remain that way.  </P> <P> The July 11 announcement of peer-panel awards came at a crucial moment in the  cultural life of the nation. The peer-panel system is at the center of the  political assault on the National Endowment for the Arts. Chairman John E.  Frohnmayer's cancellation of grants awarded by peer-review to four  controversial performance artists is widely seen as an appalling capitulation  to the endowment's political opponents.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the situation would seem to be quite different. At first  glance, it appears grants are being distributed more widely, not withheld. But  distributed to whom? Discretionary grants are not, after all, given to  everyone; ipso facto they're "withheld" from some.  </P> <P> The important question is: Who is doing the giving and withholding? A jury of  artistic peers? Or politicians and insiders?  </P> <P> In the past, arts grants administered by the Cultural Affairs Department were  widely perceived in the visual arts community to be a joke. With panel  recommendations regularly ignored, the department's grant allocation was  commonly regarded as a fund for councilmanic districts, all under the  unassailable guise of cultural beneficence.  </P> <P> But the July 11 press conference announcing recipients of the L.A. Endowment  peer-panel awards, at which Mayor Tom Bradley loudly blasted political  interference in the NEA's system of peer-panel review, signaled something  unusual. Clearly, the outcry over the political manipulation of the national  endowment was being used to assert and bolster the necessary independence of  the youthful local program. Things appeared to be looking up.  </P> <P> Now, they're looking out of whack.  </P> <P> Because the Los Angeles Endowment is in its infancy, unforeseen hazards should  be expected to arise. And only time brings experience. Refinements of procedure  ought to develop out of practice rather than theory.  </P> <P> For example, it now seems silly to have big, internationally known institutions  like the Museum of Contemporary Art competing head-to-head for exhibition funds  with, say, the Boys and Girls Club of Venice, as was common in the current  round of grant deliberations. It's apples and oranges.  </P> <P> And because independent peer-review is crucial to the process, it is important  that, in the future, panelists be drawn from outside Los Angeles as well as  from within. The breadth of informed decision-making should be maximized,  parochialism minimized.  </P> <P> In the resolution of these and other issues more than one solution may be  appropriate. In its happy dilemma over unexpected surplus funds, doling out  discretionary grants was not the only resolution available to the Cultural  Affairs Department. An emergency peer panel -- composed, say, from the chairmen  of those that did the initial review of applications -- could have been  convened to figure out what to do. Or, each organizational recipient of a  peer-panel grant could have been given an unrestricted windfall, based on a  percentage of its individual grant equal to the ratio of surplus funds to total  grants.  </P> <P> Surely, still other solutions existed. But the one chosen was inapt.  </P> <P> A disinterested rather than discretionary method should have been found.  Discretionary grants open wide the door to favoritism. If indeed the city has a  legitimate interest in geographic distribution of its cultural funds, or in the  health and welfare of this or that specific institution, then clear and  accountable structures for addressing those aims need to be developed. Ad hoc  handouts just won't do.  </P></p>

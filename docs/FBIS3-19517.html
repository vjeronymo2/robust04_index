Disillusionment follows the honeymoon,  which was rather long.    However, the crash is all the more violent now: They reveled  in the honeymoon for two years, then they promised each other  that a divorce was not what they wanted. Well, if big powers  love each other, then their situation is different from that of  small people.    Only a short meeting took place in Vladivostok, but it was  special: For the first time, it was dominated by the prosaic  bridging of rifts.    Quite a lot has to be mended. Spies are moving around.  Russia is now pursuing a domestic policy course that is rather  different from what Washington wants and Kozyrev, who has been  so obsequious so far, even states now that one does not want to  be a junior partner in foreign politics. Moscow is looking  askance at NATO's Partnership for Peace, it interferes unasked  in Bosnia, and it again remembers insolently that the Middle  East talks are under its auspices. This catalogue of sins is  remarkable.    But the following is strange: Although there is trouble in  this marriage, the world has not deteriorated. On the contrary,  as long as Washington decided alone, little good was achieved.  Now this is different -- at least partly. In Russia, where the  crash cure was mitigated, the situation is no longer so  explosive. There is some hope in the Balkans and the PLO is  again prepared for talks.    The cooling down of relations is normally a gloomy affair.  Sometimes, however, it can be beneficial, even if one lives  together with someone without being married.</p>

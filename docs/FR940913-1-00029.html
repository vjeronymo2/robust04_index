Section 582.5 would be revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;582.5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Information form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information made available pursuant to &sect;582.4 shall be presented in writing in the English language and in not less than 10-point type. It shall be presented in the format set forth below, and shall include the complete explanatory text and the updated data published annually by NHTSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> MARCH [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, UTILITY VEHICLES, LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS, AND VANS ON THE BASIS OF DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided the information in this booklet in compliance with Federal law as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The booklet compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks and vans on the basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does not indicate a vehicle's relative safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table contains the best available information regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance premiums. It was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) in its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Insurance Collision Report,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the United States in terms of the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE YEARS TO BE INSERTED]. NHTSA has not verified the data in this table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative terms, with 100 representing the average for all passenger vehicles. Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher (worse) than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average. The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED], and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust the ``base rate'' for the collision portion of their insurance premiums, the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that your total premium will vary more than ten percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company does not use the HLDI information, your premium will not vary at all in relation to these rankings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, different insurance companies often charge different premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore, you should contact insurance company agents directly to determine the actual premium that you will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Please Note <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver characteristics (such as age, gender, marital status, and driving record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many miles are traveled, and how the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact insurance company agents directly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of different vehicles. However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury protection and medical payments coverage if the insured vehicle has features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air bags and automatic seat belts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness are available from NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP test results demonstrate relative frontal crash protection in new vehicles. Information on vehicles that NHTSA has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424&hyph;9393.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [INSERT TABLE TO BE PUBLISHED EACH MARCH BY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If you would like more details about the information in this table, or wish to obtain the complete Insurance Collision Report, please contact HLDI directly, at: Highway Loss Data Institute, 1005 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22201, Tel: (703) 247&hyph;1600.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22545 Filed 9&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Riigikogu [parliament] protests resolutely  against the position taken by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev which holds that the Baltic states are within Russia's  sphere of interest and attempts to justify the continuing  unlawful presence of Russian military on Estonian territory.  Such statements are in conflict with the CSCE final act of 10  July 1992, in which Russia pledged to withdraw her troops from  the Baltic states' territory as soon as possible. The statement  also conflicts with interests of international security and  peace. For this reason the regulation of all relations between  Estonia and Russia has come to a halt. A swift and  unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops cannot be based on  haggling. The Riigikogu proposes to both president and  government to protest resolutely (?against) the Russian  Government. The statement was issued today by 30 Riigikogu  members and handed over to the ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency]  by Vardo Rumessen.</p>

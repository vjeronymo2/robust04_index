Colvin] </F>   [Text] East London Feb 27 SAPA -- It could be up to two  years before an African National Congress [ANC] government is in  a position to deliver on its election promise of houses for the  people, the ANC's secretary-general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, said in  East London at the weekend. Ramaphosa also sharply criticised  the government's economic and peace efforts and warned the  right-wing the ANC would not tolerate attempts to disrupt the  election.    He highlighted the ANC's concern about the possible  confusion  which the late introduction of the double ballot could cause on  election day. Addressing an election rally in Duncan Village on  Saturday, Ramaphosa told the crowd the ANC was still confident  of fulfilling its promise to construct one million houses in  five years.    "We have looked at the budget and we are certain we can  achieve our goals," he said. However, it was possible houses  would not be available "in the first or second year of  government".    Ramaphosa told the cheering crowd that any attempt by the  right-wing to use violence to disrupt the election would be met  by counterforce. "We have already brought the np government to  its knees. We will not be pushed around by people like  (Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  Leader Eugene) Terreblanche.    "If they (the right-wing) use force we are also prepared to  use counterforce," he said. Explaining the ANC's willingness to  continue negotiations with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said:  "We have a responsibility to ensure the new government operate  in a peaceful environment. That is why we sit down with people  like the FA and grant them their demands."    However, while the ANC was willing to concede to the setting  up of a volksraad [citizens councils] for Afrikaners in  Parliament, it would never agree to the creation of a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland].    Similarly, while the ANC realised that King Goodwill  Zwelithini should be given some powers to rule over the Zulus,  it was not prepared to allow the incorporation of natal into  kwaZulu. "We want the king in a place where we can respect him  as a king. But Natal is not going to be independent of the rest  of South Africa. We will never agree to that."    On the double-ballot issue, he said many people were under  the misconception that they were obliged to vote for another  party when electing the regional legislature. "The second ballot  is still for the ANC it is not for the NP [National Party] or  PAC [Pan- Africanist Congress]," he added.    To the delight of the crowd, Mr Ramaphosa took time out to  [as published] State President F W de Klerk's conservative style  of dress. "Mandela dresses like a true president. De Klerk is  always wearing a tie even when he goes out to campaign," he said  to hoots of laughter.    "De Klerk is just a commoner. Mandela is a true president.  You can see that by the way he walks, speaks, dresses and eats."</p>

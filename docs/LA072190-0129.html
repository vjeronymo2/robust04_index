			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / WORLD BEAT: MANO NEGRA: VIVE LE ROCK  </P> <P> It's generally been considered an irrefutable law of nature that the French  can't rock 'n' roll. Well, pardonez moi, but Paris' Mano Negra rocked so  impressively Thursday at the Roxy that the group may need a new law unto  itself.  </P> <P> Some have called the band the French Clash, others the Gallic Chili Peppers.  Neither comparison is really accurate, but they hint at the boisterous,  neo-vaudevillian stage attitude of the eight-piece band -- which did Bobby  Fuller's "I Fought the Law," a song the Clash used to perform.  </P> <P> Mano Negra represents a clash of another kind -- the culture-clash  cross-pollination that has made Paris a particularly fertile musical ground.  Like it's folkier Parisian confreres in Les Negresse Vertes, Mano Negra blends  elements of several Mediterranean cultures (the group sings in French, Spanish,  English and Arabic) in a frenetic, kinetic, horn-and-guitars spiked musical  style best termed punk-world beat. Not insignificant in the mix is a rap-metal  hybrid (a la Holland's Urban Dance Squad) -- the band even rapped a version of  the country-skiffle standard "Rock Island Line." Vive le rock 'n' roll! STEVE  HOCHMAN  </P></p>

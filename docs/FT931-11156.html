			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Harder line in Mexican change PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has removed one of his new appointees in a move seen as consolidating a harder government line towards negotiations with opposition parties. Ms Beatriz Paredes, former number two in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), has been ousted as under-secretary at the interior ministry and made ambassador to Cuba. The government described the change, just 17 days after installing a new team at interior, as a progressive step. An official said the president was responding to criticism that there 'was excessive PRI presence in the interior ministry'. However, analysts saw the abrupt shift as further evidence of a hardening of the ministry's line against negotiation with opposition parties. 'Beatriz Paredes was viewed as a progressive force in the ministry. Her removal shows there is unlikely to be conciliation this year or next,' said Ms Denise Dresser, a professor at Mexico's technological institute (ITAM). The ministry's other under-secretary, Mr Cesar Augusto Santiago, former PRI electoral chief, will be kept on but, it is claimed, without responsibility for electoral matters. Most of the criticisms of the recent appointments at interior ministry were directed at him, rather than at the respected Ms Paredes. The government's claim to be concerned about maintaining the appearance of impartiality in government officials was not helped by the appointment of Mr Emilio Chuayffet as the PRI candidate to be governor of the state of Mexico.</p>

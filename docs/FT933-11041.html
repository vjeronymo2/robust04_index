			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Court rejects Rees-Mogg Maastricht claim LORD REES-MOGG yesterday lost his High Court attempt to block ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In a short and precise judgment the court rejected his claim that the government was acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval. Lord Justice Lloyd said that the court did not doubt the issues were 'of great moment' but it was 'an exaggeration to describe it as the most important constitutional case for 300 years'. The former editor of The Times was not in court to hear the decision. His son Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg said that his father had been unable to break a long-standing engagement in Switzerland. He said that his father and his financial backers, who include the international financier Sir James Goldsmith, would consider the judgment in detail before deciding whether to appeal. Mr Rees-Mogg denied that by bringing the action his father was merely making political mischief. 'It's been done as an important constitutional issue. There's no question of my father doing it merely to cause trouble, none at all.' Lord Rees-Mogg was ordered to pay the government's legal costs. Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not know how expensive the legal challenge had been, but added, 'it's not cheap'. Giving the court's judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd, sitting with Lord Justice Mann and Mr Justice Auld, said Lord Rees-Mogg had advanced three arguments. First, by ratifying the social protocol the government intended to increase the powers of the European parliament without parliamentary approval as required by the 1978 European Parliamentary Elections Act. Second, by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering the content of EC law without parliamentary approval. Finally, by ratifying Title V of the Maastricht treaty, which deals with a common foreign and security policy, the government would be transferring part of the royal prerogative to the European Council without statutory authority. The judge said that the first argument failed because section 1(2) of the 1993 European Communities (Amendment) Act contained a clear and unambiguous approval by parliament of the Maastricht treaty as a whole, including all the protocols. The protocols were ancillary or incidental to the Maastricht treaty and ratification of the treaty would automatically involve ratification of the protocols. On the second issue, Mr David Pannick QC, for Lord Rees-Mogg, had argued that by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering community law under the Treaty of Rome, which was now the fundamental law of the UK, and parliament alone could change UK law. Although the UK had opted out of the social chapter, the government had agreed to authorise the other 11 member states to effect it through EC institutions - and that could have an indirect effect on UK domestic law, Mr Pannick said. But the judge said that a possible indirect effect on domestic law was 'far too slender a basis on which to hold that parliament has impliedly excluded or curtailed the crown's prerogative to alter or add to the Treaty of Rome'. Lord Justice Lloyd said the third argument was 'the most interesting; but also the weakest'. Because Title V was an inter-governmental agreement it was possible for the court simply to accept that since no question of domestic law was involved it had no jurisdiction to consider the matter. But assuming the issue was justiciable, even if Title V was read 'with an eye most favourable to Mr Pannick's argument, it cannot be regarded as a transfer of prerogative powers,' he said. Title V did not entail an abandonment or transfer of prerogative powers; but an exercise of those powers, he added. It should be read in the same light as the UN and Nato charters.</p>

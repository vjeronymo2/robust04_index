			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Divided states seek UN entry The new Czech Republic and Slovakia yesterday applied for UN membership, writes AP from New York. UN officials said the two republics could be admitted as early as mid-January. The new nations split their 74-year-old homeland at midnight on new year's eve. Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, is expected to apply for UN membership early this year. Officials said they knew of no formal application but Macedonian officials had said they intended to apply. Greece has been trying to block Macedonia's recognition, saying it has usurped the name of Greece's northern province. Greece yesterday cautioned the UN Security Council's five permanent members not to make a hasty decision, warning such recognition could undermine regional stability.</p>

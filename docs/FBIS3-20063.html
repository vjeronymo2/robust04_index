			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interwiew with Pascal Boniface, the founder and director of </F> the International and Strategic Relations Institute (IRIS), by  Sylvaine Pasquier; place and date not given: "Defense: Beyond  the White Paper"]    [Text] L'EXPRESS broadens the discussion with Pascal  Boniface.    Francois Mitterrand said: "It suits me." The white paper on  defense, which Edouard Balladur made public on 23 February,  seems actually to favor cohabitation rather than being  visionary. Regarded as committing France's strategic options  until 2010, it is careful not to resolve the issues troubling  politicians and experts, especially in the nuclear and the  military service sectors. As it stands, the choices to be made  by the administration that will ensue from the 1995 presidential  election have a good chance of being different, Pascal Boniface,  the founder and director of the International and Strategic  Relations Institute (IRIS), stresses. He teaches at the School  of Political Science and heads the third cycle of strategic  studies at the Paris-Nord University. He is the author of some  15 books, among them, The Army: A Survey of 300,000  Unappreciated Soldiers, Long Live the Bomb (Edition No. 1),  and The International Relations Atlas (Dunod). He is  responsible for the publication of The Strategic Year  (Dunod). The world in the face of new threats and the defense  policy are discussed in this interview.    [Pasquier] We expected from the white paper on defense, the  first since 1972, a redefinition of France's strategic options.  But should we be surprised that the cohabitation has neutralized  most of the debates?    [Boniface] Such an era does not lend itself well to radical  changes in the defense establishment. Already, at the time of  the previous cohabitation, between 1986 and 1988, in matters  such as the Strategic Defense Initiative or the role of tactical  nuclear arms, the views of the president of the republic  prevailed each time the government tried to change the system,  which is normal since he is the head of the Armed Forces. Today  as then, the prime minister--who, by nature, favors cohabitation  and is eyeing the presidency--is in the worst position to  undermine presidential supremacy.    [Pasquier] In that case, was it crucial to wait?    [Boniface] In fact, nothing, no political nor legal rule,  required that the white paper express a consensus, since it is  the product of the government itself. So we have an  intellectually acceptable document, but one that will not be  memorable until 2010, despite its expressed ambitions, for it's  a safe bet that the administration that emerges from the next  presidential election will face very different choices. For the  time being, they remain hidden.    [Pasquier] Do you that the analysis of post-cold war  international landscape will remain relevant within the time  frame covered by the white paper?    [Boniface] On that subject, the white paper has succeeded in  its mission, which was to take into consideration the  disappearance of the former Soviet enemy and the diversity of  the new threats. The appearance of regional conflicts, such as  the one caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia, as well as  terrorism, drug traffic, and financial flows; all these issues  will remain topical beyond 1995. Undoubtedly what will take  longer to become outdated will be an organized system of crisis  scenarios or possible risks. Be that as it may, in the matter of  defense, plans are made 20 or 25 years ahead, whereas it is  difficult to foresee international developments beyond five or  at the most 10 years.    [Pasquier] What is the best suitable response to the new  conflicts?    [Boniface] Conventional means, undoubtedly, and the white  paper recognizes this. As part of peacekeeping operations and in  order to restore stability, there will actually be a greater  need for this type of force, capable of being deployed rapidly  and far. This means that the portion of the budget relating to  conventional forces must increase. However, the nuclear sector  remains the ultimate defense guarantee with regard to French  territory and its vital interests. In my opinion, it is rightly  so. France's objective interest is to be a nuclear country.    [Pasquier] For what reason?    [Boniface] It has a sanctuary to preserve, unlike the United  States. It is the only superpower in the world now, and no state  would risk attacking its territory. The conventional arsenal at  its disposal protects it from any serious threat. As far as that  goes, it believes that the nuclear sector could become a  handicap instead of remaining a trump card. It would hinder, for  example, its possible desire to intervene in Iraq or North  Korea. Furthermore, it is not out of the question that, someday,  the United States might demand total nuclear disarmament. As for  France, it is much more vulnerable. It must own the means to  discourage any adversary from attacking it. Deterrence is  therefore extended without changes.    [Pasquier] It may surprise us that the white paper does not  settle the debate over the nuclear units. Should two of them be  favored, the submarine and airborne forces, and the Albion  plateau base shut down, as advocated by some?    [Boniface] The parties facing one another at least agree on  the submarine unit. Discreet, efficient, and indestructible, it  is truly the "pinnacle of deterrence." The M-5 missile program,  launched in 1992, will equip the nuclear submarines of the new  generation around 2005. The problem is that the development of a  land version intended for the Albion plateau base will then be  considered, with the president of the republic very much in  favor of the project. Opponents of the project call the M-5 an  error in all aspects, including budgetary, and they are  demanding the modernization of the airborne unit, that is to say  the long range air-to-surface missile (ASLP) that France must  now assume on its own since Great Britain withdrew. The goal of  some of the supporters of this option is the development of  weapons with either a miniature load or one with modular  capability, allowing more precise fire and a greater  flexibility.    [Pasquier] Using what argument?    [Boniface] They see an outdated deterrence by the weak of  the  strong remaining powerless in the face of eventual opponents  having at their disposal unsophisticated and limited arsenals.  The ASLP missile as such is not synonymous with a surgical  strike. It all depends on the nuclear head with which it is  fitted. Let us specify, moreover, that some day the  plane-missile combination could be deployed in our allies'  airports. It is therefore the foremost European weapon. But the  danger, to be avoided at all costs, would be to give in to the  temptation of opening a Pandora's box, that is to say, to use  these nuclear weapons as conventional ones. It is true that the  white paper expresses no opinion on the subject. It reasserts  the two requirements of deterrence: On the one hand, a strategic  strike which causes damages beyond repair; on the other, an  "ultimate warning" strike to force the opponent to stop. It is  obvious that both the president of the republic and the prime  minister oppose this doctrinal shift which would lead to the  lowering of the nuclear threshold and therefore to the risk of  escalation. France undoubtedly needs arms of extreme precision,  but conventional.    [Pasquier] Is this "flexible" nuclear alternative a recent  development?    [Boniface] Are you kidding! It is as old as the atomic  weapons themselves. At the beginning, the military imagined it  as a device more powerful than the others, causing more decisive  damage, at less cost, and requiring fewer air raids and smaller  payloads. Two concepts have always existed in oppostion to one  another: one political, the need to prevent war; the other,  operational, the need to win it. Deterrence "by the strong of  the insane" is only the last misleading version of an old  scarecrow.    [Pasquier] How are the two camps divided, between the Right  and the Left?    [Boniface] There are not, on the one side, Socialists who  would put on the old boots of Gaullism and, on the other,  Gaullists who would no longer have hang-ups with regard to the  use of nuclear weapons. It is all the politicians, as well as  the experts, who are divided. It would be dangerous to consent  to such a drift, for it would surely prevent us from building a  European deterrence--a prospect opened by the white paper.    [Pasquier] Why?    [Boniface] This nuclear doctrine is related to the  Schlesinger doctrine of selective reprisals, adopted by the  United States in 1979. As it is, our nonnuclear European  partners have rejected it vigorously. They are not now going to  adopt a French version offering the same type of reasoning,  whereby they accept nuclear deterrence and would be ready, some  day, to follow us on this path.    [Pasquier] But first the members of the European Union  should  "define common interests..."    [Boniface] Right. It is a way of saying that such is not yet  the case. This preliminary view can therefore pass for an  official negative acknowledgement or, at least, a waiting  position. But the white paper stresses that, in the future,  deterrence will have to be considered in a European context,  which assumes negotiations. Only one organization lends itself  to it, the West European Union (WEU), and not NATO, which  includes non-European members. As it stands, there are currently  bilateral talks on this subject between the two nuclear  countries, France and Great Britain, as well as Franco-German  consultations. But we are still far from a real multilateral  discussion--which is a must, for a true European deterrence does  not mean the extension of the French and British guarantee to  the other European countries, but a joint nuclear program  formulated by the partners as a whole.    [Pasquier] Are we on the way to an indefinite ban on nuclear  testing?    [Boniface] Via the white paper, France is even considering  the formulation of a treaty for an all-out test ban, on the  condition that it be universal and verifiable. Duly noted.    [Pasquier] You must admit that, straight away, the  "universal" feature curtails ambition.    [Boniface] To be sure, this softer stand provides an out.  But  some proliferating countries would undoubtedly accept to sign  such a treaty, for they have little need for tests in order to  develop an unsophisticated bomb. This would not hinder the  pursuit of their nuclear program. Moreover, let us not forget  that the nonproliferation treaty is to be renewed in 1995: If  the nuclear countries were to give no guarantees, the countries  without bombs would feel cheated. As it stands, they are very  attached to the test ban. The link with nonproliferation is not  technical, but indeed political. If France values its  deterrence, giving up secondary features in order to protect  essential ones is a better plan.    [Pasquier] The moratorium had already unleashed bitter  controversies on the Right. What then?    [Boniface] I noticed that the president of the republic and  the prime minister have a common position on the  issue--different from that of Jacques Chirac. Roger Baleras, the  director of military applications of the Atomic Energy  Commission, believes that it would take another eight to 20  tests before France can dispense with them, figures picked up by  the majority as a whole. The battle will be fought over this  issue, perhaps before the presidential election.    [Pasquier] Are the unavoidable budget restrictions already  burdening strategic requirements?    [Boniface] Everywhere, equipment orders are being revised  downward, which does little to remedy the crisis in the arms  industries. Let us be clear: If we want to have a European  defense in the future, we must maintain proficiency at all  costs. It is very difficult to gather highly skilled  technological teams. When we let them go, there is no certainty  that they can be regrouped at a future date. Military expenses  on the other side of the Atlantic amounted to 7 percent of the  GNP in 1985; they will soon go to 4.5 percent. However, the  relative share of development expenses hardly dropped. In order  to protect skills, there even are cases when a weapon will be  developed in small quantities or not at all, a less expensive  approach than persisting in manufacturing expensive and already  obsolete weapons.    [Pasquier] Are you referring to the Leclerc tank?    [Boniface] You are the one mentioning it. When a country  becomes dependent on foreign suppliers, everything goes well as  long as relations are good. But when we are refused access to  some technologies, or when the bill becomes too high, on that  day, we find ourselves stripped of everything.    [Pasquier] Does France still the means to produce its  equipment?    [Boniface] Obviously, the Leclerc and the Rafale are  respectively the last French tank and combat plane. The conquest  of foreign markets will, alone, make it possible to bear the  financial cost of these programs. The successor of the Rafale  will have to be a European plane, given the lack of  alternatives. The manufacturers have understood the situation so  well that they have forged ahead of the politicians by setting  up a system of cooperation, already European, paper, it  specifies that, at the European level, there must be no  industrial stalement with regard to major programs.    [Pasquier] Are we as concerned about Europe when it comes to  the military service?    [Boniface] In fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can  predict that n fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can  predict that the next French exception will be that of the  draft. Our partners, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, are  either canceling it or, like Spain and Italy, challenging it or,  sometimes, even ignoring it, as is the case in Great Britain. If  France remains the only one to maintain the principle, it could  pose a problem in the context of an integrated defense policy.  Supporters and opponents of military service can be found in in  all the parties but the PCF [French Communist Party]. Be that as  it may, the white paper, on a very specific point, has stopped  defending tradition: It is concerned with finally giving the  military its say.    [Pasquier] But the French generals in Bosnia did not nor are  they remaining silent.    [Boniface] Because within the United Nations, it is possible  to escape from one's national hierarchy. But in France, without  exceptions, all of those who tried to speak were sanctioned. We  still observe MacMahon's rule: "I remove from the promotion list  any officer whose name I have read on the cover of a book." When  it comes to the military, a kind of speaking deterrence is  practiced. We often regret that soldiers are not sufficiently  interested in strategic problems. But they do not even have the  right to discuss them! The paradox is that, in this country  anybody can express his opinion on defense issues, except the  military. The time may have come for the political officials to  remedy the democratic deficit prevailing in the barracks. Let  them recognize the soldier's civil rights, and not only his  right to vote. Let also stop the practice of transferring  officers to a different town every three years. The British  army, which is not, I believe, the worst in the world, has no  need for this constant moving in order to function.    [Pasquier] The conflict in Bosnia has brought France nearer  to the Atlantic alliance. But does the future of European  security pass by the United Nations or the WEU?    [Boniface] France can no longer be suspected, as in the  past,  of wanting to destroy the alliance. On the contrary, it  participates fully in the peace keeping missions, as can be  noted in the former Yugoslavia. NATO, in its reasoning and its  structures, has currently, and in the near future, a vital role  in the European security. For all that, the future must not be  abused--meaning the WEU which will assert its influence in the  medium and long term. If France were to fully rejoin the  Atlantic alliance--many are thinking about it, even if few are  expressing it--it would bolster the desire of some Central  European countries, for example, to join NATO rather than the  WEU. As it stands, tomorrow, their security could be subjected  to the good will of a reticent U.S. Administration.    [Pasquier] Does Russia appears to you as a factor of  instability in Europe?    [Boniface] There is in fact a Russian problem, and the  United  States is largely responsible for it. It went from one extreme  to the other. Shortly after the Gulf War, it viewed Russia as a  blank spot on the map. It is now doing everything to support it.  But if Russia no longer has the power to act, it still has the  power to harm. For all that, not to the extent of seriously  worrying Poland or Hungary, at least I do not think so, despite  the clamors of a Zhirinovskiy. The same is not true of the  so-called near abroad border countries. Over the past year,  Moscow has interfered in Tajikistan, pressured Ukraine and  Belarus, brought Georgia back into the Russian fold, and relied  on the Armenians and the Azeris. The Westerners are disclaiming  any responsibility about this and Russia, in the name of a  backhand Monroe Doctrine of sort, is asserting its prerogatives  in this area. It is in the process of rebuilding a strategic  Soviet Union. Meanwhile, in some regions, above all in Crimea,  where citizens of Russian origin are the majority, the  possibility of seeing a Yugoslav scenario duplicated by Russia  and Ukraine is not to be ruled out.    [Pasquier] Does Western helplessness toward the conflict in  the former Yugoslavia indicate a difficulty in grasping this  type of threat?    [Boniface] It is both simpler and more alarming: The  politicians realized that utopia was out of place in domestic  policy; and that there was no instant remedy to unemployment and  the economic crisis. They then transferred utopia to the  international theater. Miracle solutions flourished on the soil  of foreign conflicts. An operation is launched in Somalia and we  make believe that developing problems in Africa will be solved  because of it. We demand air strikes against Serbian positions  around Sarajevo and we make believe that the different  communities of the former Yugoslavia will resume a harmonious  cohabitation. Contrary to the analysis whereby leaders govern by  overbanking on a televisual emotion, essentially short-lived, we  are reduced to jumping out of the frying pan into the fire!</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO UPSETS SANTA MONICA, 81-79  </P> <P> El Camino College could have stayed home and cruised through its first-round  playoff game against a 16-15 Riverside team.  </P> <P> Instead, a last-minute change in the seedings made 23rd-seeded El Camino  (21-10) have to play its game of the season to post an 81-79 upset of  10th-seeded Santa Monica (26-9) in front of a small but rowdy Westside crowd.  </P> <P> "We finally beat another quality team," said El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin,  whose team finished in a three-way tie for third in the South Coast Conference.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Coach John McMullen would not comment except to say he was happy  to play a tougher team in the first round. Originally Santa Monica was to play  Long Beach (15-15).  </P> <P> McMullen's team played well, but the Warriors were clearly hungry for a win.  Five El Camino players scored in double figures, and the team played fierce  defense.  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Larry Lockley led the Warriors with 21 points, and forward  David Keeter had 13 before fouling out of the game with 11:48 remaining. Frank  Beatty also had 13 points, and Steve Leary and Keith Brown scored 12 and 11  respectively.  </P> <P> El Camino took a 44-40 halftime edge on Lockley's baseline jumper at the  buzzer.  </P> <P> The Warriors benefited from the early ejection of Santa Monica freshman point  guard Chico Langston, who threw a punch at El Camino guard Allen Caveness.  </P> <P> The Warriors kept the lead until midway through the second half, when Santa  Monica's Jason Shea hit a three-pointer to put the Corsairs ahead, 61-60. El  Camino tied the score at 64-64 with 8:35 remaining and regained the lead on two  Steven Leary free throws with 6:30 left.  </P> <P> El Camino advances Wednesday to play L.A. City College, which defeated Mira  Costa, 81-72, on Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Canada's CDollars 5.2bn Hibernian oil projects delayed for a year THE start-up of Canada's CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.4bn) Hibernia offshore oil project's has been delayed by at least one year to November 1997, says Mr Jake Epp, federal energy minister The federal and Newfoundland governments are urgently trying to find investors to take over the 25 per cent interest held by Gulf Canada, the upstream energy company controlled by the Reichmann brothers of Toronto, which said it was quitting Hibernia last week. 'We are looking at all options and new tax incentives to attract new partners, even smaller companies,' said Mr Epp. He said no potential investors have come forward. About CDollars 2bn of construction and equipment contracts have been awarded for Hibernia, located nearly 200 miles east of St John's, Newfoundland, and a further Dollars 500m were due this spring. These contracts may be delayed and mothballing of the project cannot be ruled out. Under a 1990 agreement, Gulf has 243 days to find a buyer for its 25 per cent interest or the other partners, Petro-Canada (25 per cent), Mobil (28%) and Chevron (22%) must buy Gulf out pro rata. Analysts estimate Gulf's investment is worth about CDollars 200m. The federal government is committed to CDollars 2.7bn.</p>

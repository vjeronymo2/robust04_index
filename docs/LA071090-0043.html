			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR'S CABINET EASILY SURVIVES 1ST NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE  </P> <P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Cabinet easily survived its  first test of no confidence Monday when Parliament rejected five motions over a  housing shortage and new Jewish settler guard units in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza.  </P> <P> A close vote had been anticipated in the 120-member Knesset, where a coalition  headed by Shamir's right-wing Likud Party has a narrow majority of 62 seats.  </P> <P> But following a five-hour debate, the five motions of no confidence were  defeated, 60 to 51.  </P> <P> Monday's motions focused on a housing shortage at a time when thousands of  Soviets are emigrating to Israel. In the past month, hundreds of homeless  Israelis have pitched tents in public parks to dramatize the issue.  </P> <P> Also on the agenda were motions against the government's recent decision to set  up civil guard units in the occupied territories.  </P></p>

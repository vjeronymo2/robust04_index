			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (2): Single market speeds traffic - Pan-European operations FORMAL creation of the European Community single market at the beginning of this year has already speeded up many cross-border transport and distribution operations. But the development of widespread pan-European distribution services and networks seems likely to take rather longer. Earlier fears that some countries might not be ready to cope with the new transport environment created by the single market have generally proved wide of the mark, say distribution service operators. In fact, they claim, removal of previous border controls and the disappearance of some 85 per cent of Community transit declarations has accelerated the flow of goods. That improvement has been particularly noticeable on long-distance road movements. Overall transit times between the UK and southern Italy, for example, are said to have been cut by as much as 24 hours, producing cost savings of up to Pounds 300 per journey. The real key to those sort of improvements, says Mr Geoffrey Simms, vice-chairman of the international group of the UK Road Haulage Association (RHA), has been harmonised customs procedures and faster clearance. 'The dismantling of border controls has had an impact. However, speedier procedures for customs clearance have had a much greater effect,' he says. 'Prior to European harmonisation, RHA members could waste as long as a day waiting for clearance from customs. This has been radically cut with European harmonisation - particularly in France, Italy and Spain - and is a major benefit to the haulage industry.' Road-based distribution service activities should further benefit from recent agreement among EC transport ministers on the format of the remaining directives needed to complete the single market for road transport operations. Specifically, they decided on a common tax for trucks using EC roads, clearing the way for the full implementation of road cabotage under which hauliers from one member state can pick up and deliver goods within another. In that context, EC transport ministers agreed in June that the number of cabotage licences issued within the Community should rise from the current figure of 18,500 a year to 30,000 in 1994 and then by 30 per cent annually until full liberalisation in 1998. As a result, intra-EC road transport should become much more efficient and - in theory - cheaper. However, while road transport operations are benefiting from the advent of the single market, Europe is still generally some way from becoming one large 'domestic' market as far as distribution is concerned. For the moment, most goods still tend to be distributed on a national basis. But, says Mr Michael Browne, BRS professor of transport at the University of Westminster, that situation is likely to change as cross-border trade increases. 'We can expect to see the growing internationalisation of carriers' activities, with a company providing full national distribution services in more than one country. Companies with a customer base that includes multinationals manufacturing in several European countries will need to decide their best strategies,' he says. The influence of manufacturers on the future course of European distribution industry development is also cited by the RHA's Mr Simms, although he does not envisage immediate large-scale rapid changes in that area. 'The question of whether Europe will really become one large 'domestic' market is to a large extent dictated not by the hauliers but by the manufacturers who own or supply the goods being transported,' he comments. 'It is also dictated by the fundamental traditions which characterise the European market. Whereas international haulage between countries is a reality, most countries continue to operate their own domestic distribution systems. And because such distribution systems are so fundamental, there will be no immediate change in this arena.' Reinforcing the argument that many European distribution activities are likely to remain primarily nationally-based, at least in the near-term, is a pronounced lack of cross-border retailing operations. Even those retailers which have established operations in several countries still tend to organise their distribution activities on a country-by-country basis. That point is confirmed by Mr Ronnie Irving, managing director of international distribution activities for UK-based logistics service company Christian Salvesen Distribution (CSD). He says leading logistics service companies realise they must provide different services to retailers in different countries. 'For example, the business profile CSD has in France is very different to that in the Benelux countries and our operations in Spain are quite different to those in Germany. This is a fact which, I believe, will remain for many years to come,' says Mr Irving. Elaborating on that point, he claims the single market has not changed the logistics scene in terms of its effect on secondary distribution in the retail sector. 'What the Single Market has changed, however, and continues to change, is the way manufacturers look at their logistics and how they view supply chain management,' he adds. Manufacturers would continue to reduce the number of production points they had in the EC. Instead of having two or three factories manufacturing all the products in their range in each EC country, they would take advantage of economies of scale by producing only certain lines in certain countries and then transporting those products to the countries of consumption. Most distribution industry observers go along with that picture of future European distribution, at least over the next few years. The important thing for distribution service providers, they add, is to develop a clear strategy to cater for that scenario. 'More and more companies supplying logistics services realise that their future requires them to develop a European strategy. While some have sought to build a Europe-wide logistics network, others have been more cautious and have concentrated on their core skills, transferring these when possible to new markets,' concludes Mr Browne.</p>

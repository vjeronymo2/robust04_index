			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP TEAM IS LEFT TO ASSESS DAMAGES AFTER REFEREE'S CALL  </P> <P> A Southern Section Division II football playoff game on Saturday night at Santa  Barbara High has left Canyon Country Canyon on the short end of a controversial  call by the officials, the receiving end of a bill for damages to the visiting  locker room and apparently without recourse to overturn Santa Barbara's 28-27  overtime victory.  </P> <P> Canyon coaches, claiming that game officials awarded Santa Barbara a "fifth  down" after time had expired in the Division II semifinal, said that they will  file a protest with the Southern Section office today. Commissioner Stan  Thomas, however, said that the victory would not be overturned.  </P> <P> "There is (an appeals) process that can be acknowledged for ineligible  players," Thomas said. "But there are no appeals to the mechanics of  officiating. I know that Canyon is very upset -- and probably rightfully so.  But, unfortunately, it's a dead issue."  </P> <P> Thomas declined to comment on the game's officiating.  </P> <P> With 10 seconds remaining in regulation and Santa Barbara, trailing, 21-14,  quarterback Poncho Renteria fumbled the snap from center on fourth down at the  Canyon one-yard line. A late flag was thrown, however, and Canyon was ruled  offside.  </P> <P> With four seconds to play, officials spotted the ball at the one-foot line.  Time expired, however, before Santa Barbara could get off a play.  </P> <P> Canyon players celebrated, but the officials, ruling that the clock should have  remained stopped, awarded Santa Barbara another play. Renteria then passed to  wide receiver Derek Elbert for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Both teams scored a touchdown in overtime, but the game ended when Canyon  kicker Chris Wilson missed the point after.  </P> <P> National High School Federation rules state that the clock should be started  after yardage is assessed on a dead-ball foul.  </P> <P> "If I interpret the rules correctly then the game should have been over,"  Canyon Coach Harry Welch said.  </P> <P> Canyon players and coaches left the field in a rage. Afterward, in the Canyon  locker room, Santa Barbara coaches found two broken doors, a broken trophy  case, a broken blackboard and a broken drinking fountain. Coach Lito Garcia  said that a repair bill would be sent to Canyon.  </P> <P> Welch said that Canyon would pay for the damage, but added that the situation  was aggravated by Santa Barbara players and fans, who allegedly followed Canyon  players into the locker room and challenged them. Canyon players and families,  Welch said, also were harassed as they boarded their buses.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Tokyo stocks go mad for March: But has the market really turned around, asks Emiko Terazono 'THE stock market has turned around,' proclaimed a full-page advertisement yesterday from Daiwa Securities, the leading Japanese broker, which offered seminars to instruct punters on the rejuvenated Tokyo market. As the Japanese financial year draws to a close today, Japanese brokers have had their confidence revived by an unexpected share price surge. The Nikkei index has gained 12.3 per cent in the month on a rally triggered by active government intervention; yesterday it closed at 18,963.16. But suspicions are there that the surge could be Tokyo's annual bout of 'March madness'. Volumes and prices tend to rise as the fiscal year ends, as companies try to maximise gains on stocks held or, this year, minimise losses. The economic background remains gloomy. Retail sales are still weak, with February's chain-store sales down for the sixth month running. The Long Term Credit Bank forecasts capital spending will fall 4 per cent next fiscal year, the biggest drop since 1971; the labour market shrank 0.4 per cent last month, the first time since December 1985. An increasing number of economists, emboldened by the recent stock market rise and some positive economic figures are now trying to paint a rosier picture. 'The economy has stopped its decline,' says Mr Hirohiko Okumura, Nomura Research Institute's chief economist. February money supply growth turned positive for the first time in six months, and two consecutive months' decline in the manufacturing inventory-shipments ratio foreshadows a rise in industrial output. Some analysts say a 1.1 per cent car sales rise last month may point to a consumer demand turnaround. Media reports have helped fuel such optimism. 'The economy shows signs of bottoming out,' said the widely-read Nihon Keizai Shimbun this week. Such articles were followed by stories entitled 'Spring has come for stock market' and 'Consumers tired of being thrifty'. But stock markets gains seem to be driven more by a rise in liquidity due to lower interest rates. The rise will aid profits and companies which hold loss-making stock investments. Kajima, the construction company, yesterday said a rise of the Nikkei average over 19,000 would post a Y2.5bn (Pounds 14.7m) profit on its share portfolio instead of a previously projected Y5bn loss on earlier share price estimates. Japanese share promoters claim investors discount an economic recovery in the new fiscal year. Overseas investors, including Europeans, and US pension funds, are also active buyers. Some brokers say investors seem to be buying merely in fear of missing the rally, rather than believing in an economic recovery. Investors feel assured of a bottom around 16,000, by underlying government support. Considering the stock market level relative to corporate earnings, share prices seem dear, with trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 66 times. Most analysts expect companies' profits to fall for the new business year starting tomorrow, although a recovery may start during the second half. Mr Okumura says the recovery of the economy will depend on the fiscal support package expected to be formulated before Premier Kiichi Miyazawa heads for the US next month. A successful support package may boost the economy 2.5 per cent, but 'if the fiscal support flops, Japan may face zero economic growth'. However, growing hopes over the size of the economic fiscal package are increasing pressure on the finance ministry which is putting together the support measures. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has said this will be far larger than the Y10,700bn package announced last August, and figures of up to Y20,000bn are suggested. However, finance ministry officials warn that the package could be smaller.</p>

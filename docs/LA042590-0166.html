			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'CAPITAL NEWS' SERIES SUSPENDED BUT WILL RETURN, ABC ANNOUNCES  </P> <P> Producers of the ABC series "Capital News" were told Tuesday that the series  will be canceled after next Monday night's episode.  </P> <P> A spokesman for ABC Entertainment, however, said the series has been put "on  hiatus" and will return later this year.  </P> <P> The decision was apparently based, in part, on another poor performance Monday  night, when "Capital News" averaged an 8.2 rating and a 15% audience share at  10 p.m., behind NBC's new "Shannon's Deal," at 10.2-19.8, and "Newhart" and  "His &amp; Hers" on CBS, which together averaged an 11.2-21 in that same time  slot.  </P> <P> The MTM production will have aired four times, including a two-hour pilot. Nine  additional programs have been completed.  </P> <P> Christian Williams, the former Washington Post editor who was executive  producer of the series along with David Milch, said Tuesday: "It was an  overwhelming rejection. Viewers just didn't sample the show."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'GREYHOUND THERAPY' DETAILED AT OFFICERS' TRIAL  </P> <P> Testifying in the criminal trial of two fellow patrolmen, San Diego police  officers and supervisors Wednesday described in detail a policy of clearing  transients off downtown streets, with one lieutenant with more than 30 years on  the force saying the Police Department commonly refers to the practice as  "Greyhound therapy."  </P> <P> A second supervisor, who works as a police agent and acting sergeant on the  downtown beat, said the roundup policy was prohibited in the department's  conduct manual, but added, "I don't know of any supervisors who haven't  witnessed the practice" and allowed it to continue.  </P> <P> A third officer, with 10 years of patrol duty, testified that the policy was  condoned by the chief's office and high command because police administrators  were tired of seeing homeless people on downtown streets while driving to  headquarters.  </P> <P> "They were aware of it," Officer David Hoffman said of the chief, deputy chiefs  and commanders on the seventh floor of police headquarters who want the  homeless, transients and illegal aliens removed from the city's main commercial  district.  </P> <P> He said downtown merchants continually pressure police commanders to move the  homeless out of their store doorways and off their sidewalks, and that business  people and office workers are always complaining to police about the many  homeless people lining the streets.  </P> <P> "The supervisors at particular meetings said this came from upstairs, which  meant to me the seventh floor of the building," Hoffman said. "The chiefs and  commanders probably saw it themselves when they came to work, and they were  probably offended by it too."  </P> <P> The testimony was heard in the weeklong San Diego Superior Court trial of Lloyd  J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf, now on voluntary leave from their jobs as  police officers on the downtown beat. They are charged with robbing and  kidnaping three undocumented workers last August and, if convicted, could be  sentenced to a maximum of life in prison.  </P> <P> As part of their defense, Hoff and Schaaf contend that they never kidnaped or  robbed the three illegal aliens. Rather, they insist that they were following  the common police practice of "Greyhound therapy" when they drove two of the  undocumented workers out of the downtown and that they never had contact with  the third.  </P> <P> Hoff, in his first public comments about the case, took the stand briefly  Wednesday afternoon and said that, in one of the alleged incidents, he and  Schaaf drove two of the illegal aliens to an isolated spot on the railroad  tracks.  </P> <P> "We knew that several, if not a great amount of transients, including illegal  aliens, sleep along those tracks," Hoff said. "And it was my belief they would  not object to being taken there."  </P> <P> Although that description fits the practice of rounding up transients as  described by the other officers in the courtroom, police administrators at  headquarters declined Wednesday to state whether such a policy exists.  </P> <P> Lt. Greg Clark, a police spokesman, said Tuesday that the chief's office hoped  to issue a statement about the matter on Wednesday. But, on Wednesday, he said  police officials have decided to wait until after the trial before publicly  discussing the situation.  </P> <P> However, Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney who is prosecuting Hoff and  Schaaf, read in open court from the police conduct manual, telling the jury  that officers cannot detain or transport law-abiding citizens against their  will.  </P> <P> Citizens "must be permitted to go on their way" if officers stop them and  cannot find probable cause that they committed a crime, Rooten said in reading  from the manual.  </P> <P> But Police Agent Perry Hooper, an 11-year veteran of the force, said officers  and supervisors violate that portion of the manual every day in dealing with  the transient problem downtown. And he said officers are never disciplined for  the misconduct.  </P> <P> "Are you telling us that policy was violated? Have you seen violations of this  policy in the downtown area?" Rooten asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, I have," Hooper answered.  </P> <P> "And you are a police agent?"  </P> <P> "Yes, I am."  </P> <P> "And you have two stripes on your arm?"  </P> <P> "Yes, I do."  </P> <P> Other officers said the pressure stems from recurring offenses downtown,  particularly auto burglaries, drug deals and transients urinating and  defecating on sidewalks and doorways. They said merchants, residents and office  workers are tired of the criminal activity and nuisances.  </P> <P> Hoffman, for instance, said police commonly move the transients out of the  downtown shortly before dawn as a courtesy to people arriving for work.  </P> <P> "We were asked to clear the people from the streets, so that people coming to  work wouldn't see them," he said. "It was done all the time."  </P> <P> Some of the officers appeared reluctant to identify the police supervisors who  condoned the practice. The officers either said they could not recall which  supervisors approved the policy, or named only those colleagues who no longer  work for the department.  </P> <P> For example, Hooper said he was sure that "more than 20" supervisors approved  the policy. But then he said he could not remember their names.  </P> <P> However, Lt. Ron Seden, the executive officer in the Central Division -- which  covers downtown -- said the roundup policy was being used and sanctioned even  when he joined the department 31 years ago.  </P> <P> He said the practice is so pervasive that, often, city police move transients  into other jurisdictions, such as National City or the unincorporated areas of  the county, and that officers in those areas then move the transients back into  the city.  </P> <P> "That's what we refer to as Greyhound therapy," he said. "That's the practice  of moving individuals to other jurisdictions."  </P> <P> The policy has caught the attention of the local ACLU. Legal director Betty  Wheeler said in an interview this week that a lawsuit may be filed to stop the  roundup policy because it appears to be unconstitutional.  </P> <P> "It's flatly improper for the police to be rounding up and moving people, and,  if that is going on, then it should come to an immediate stop," she said. "And  the people who are responsible for the policy and practice should be informed  immediately that that's not permissible, and all appropriate corrective steps  should be taken."  </P> <P> In other court testimony Wednesday, Officer George Maglaras testified that he  detained one of the alleged victims earlier this year, but was ordered to  release him when a police supervisor realized that the illegal alien was  involved in the case against officers Hoff and Schaaf.  </P> <P> Officer George N. Maglaras said there was no doubt when he stopped Rolando  Carrera-Reyes that he was "speed-balling on heroin and cocaine." But, he said,  Lt. Leroy Staley ordered him to release Carrera-Reyes because the illegal alien  was an alleged victim of Hoff and Schaaf.  </P> <P> "He told me it might appear the Police Department was harassing this  individual, and I tended to agree with him," Maglaras said.  </P> <P> "Would it be fair to say this person got a break most people don't?" asked  defense attorney Everett Bobbitt.  </P> <P> "Yes," the officer conceded.  </P> <P> The trial continues today at 9 a.m.  </P></p>

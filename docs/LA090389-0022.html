			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRESS AND 'GROUP-THINK'  </P> <P> Spin is merely another word for bias, something journalists pretend they don't  have. Bias is nothing new; it's just more uniform and more obvious these days,  thanks to poorly educated reporters and editors.  </P> <P> And since these fledgling reporters have no sense of history, today is the  beginning of mankind for them.  </P> <P> That's why they're so gullible, so addicted to socialistic causes, and so naive  as the think anyone cares about their shallow opinions.  </P> <P> For the press -- especially the TV press -- one swallow does indeed make a  thousand summers and molehills are daily to be made mountains.  </P> <P> MIKE COLBY  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP TEAM LOSES ON APPEAL; JUDGE SCOLDS BOOSTERS;  </P> <P> OILERS LOSE IN APPEAL BY CIF; SAVANNA WAITS  </P> <P> Twenty-four hours before the big game, the Huntington Beach High School  football team was thrown out of postseason championship play Thursday by  appellate judges who sternly lectured the Oilers' booster club attorneys on the  importance of playing by the rules.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Anaheim's Savanna High School, also barred Tuesday from the playoffs  because of an allegedly ineligible player, was in a lower court Thursday to  seek reinstatement and expects a decision today.  </P> <P> In light of the Huntington Beach ruling, however, Savanna's chances don't look  good. "All we can do (is) sit and wait and pray and keep the fingers crossed,"  said Rebel coach Fred DiPalma.  </P> <P> In the Huntington Beach case, a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of  Appeal in effect unanimously sided with Sunset League officials who had  disqualified the Oilers from the playoffs last Saturday for using an ineligible  player in its games.  </P> <P> Technically, the appellate justices stayed an Orange County Superior Court  judge's ruling on Tuesday that had returned the team to the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We were given hope and then had it taken away," Huntington Beach football  coach George Pascoe said. "Something has to be done about . . . how this sort  of thing is handled."  </P> <P> Booster club attorney Edward J. Paul argued in vain that the rule, which  requires an athlete's parent or guardian to live in the school district, had  been unintentionally violated in the case of starting tackle David Roman and  should have been caught by school administrators.  </P> <P> Consequently, Paul said, students, the football team and the Roman family are  suffering.  </P> <P> "Maybe what's suffering is respect for rules," interjected Associate Justice  Edward J. Wallin during a hearing held in the Santa Ana court. "What you're  really attacking is the whole CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) book  of rules, aren't you?"  </P> <P> "The rules are extremely clear as to what the consequences will be if an  ineligible player is fielded," Wallin asserted.  </P> <P> The justices said they were reluctant to get involved in sports disputes, which  Wallin reasoned could ultimately mean "we'll have games every Monday and Friday  and litigation Wednesdays through Thursdays." He added:  </P> <P> "Maybe in January or February, when we finally get though all the appeals, we  can finally have CIF trophies presented right here."  </P> <P> "Pretty soon," Wallin continued, "a coach will want to start the season with  good assistants, a good trainer and a good lawyer. A good lawyer who can work  fast will be more important than a fast tailback."  </P> <P> Another booster club attorney, James Baze, said he was "more disappointed for  the children of the Huntington Beach High School football team than for anyone  else."  </P> <P> But CIF-Southern Section attorney Andrew Patterson said the ruling "maintains  stability in interscholastic athletics."  </P> <P> At least, said Coach Pascoe, the matter was finally resolved.  </P> <P> "This week, the kids have been through everything," Pascoe said. "First we're  the No. 1 seed (in the league). Then we're out. Then the principals say we're  in. Then, the CIF says we're out. Two days ago we're back in and today we're  finally out."  </P> <P> "That's a lot for a 17-year-old kid to deal with. I'm 35 and I'm having trouble  dealing with it," Pascoe added.  </P> <P> Booster Club president Reno Bellamy suggested that the Southern Section  officials should "get smart and rewrite that blue book of theirs."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he said, "we thought it was a good cause and we had to fight for  them. And we took them all the way."  </P> <P> The controversy centered on Roman, 17, who was declared ineligible when  officials discovered as postseason play approached that he had been living with  an older brother and not his mother since transferring from Maryland this year.  </P> <P> In the court action by Huntington Beach's booster club, Orange County Superior  Court Judge Thomas N. Thrasher ruled Tuesday that even though Roman's brother,  Tony, 24, is not his legal guardian, he fulfilled the spirit of the CIF rule as  a "de facto guardian."  </P> <P> Moreover, Thrasher said, the boy's mother had intended to move to Huntington  Beach but was unable to sell her house in Maryland.  </P> <P> In Thursday's appellate hearing, however, Justice Wallin said that if the  intention to move within a school's boundaries was all that was required, "I  guarantee you you'll see a lot of houses up for sale about every August and a  lot of fine football players moving around."  </P> <P> In a sworn declaration filed in appellate court, CIF-Southern Section  Commissioner Stan Thomas said schools would have no incentive to abide by the  rules if exceptions were allowed after violations were detected.  </P> <P> "Under those circumstances, the schools would be free to 'take a chance' and  play a youngster, then if questions are raised later, to seek eligibility at  that time," Thomas reasoned. "The CIF seeks to deter this kind of conduct."  </P> <P> Justice Wallin drew a parallel with the Southern Section's rules and the game  of football.  </P> <P> "There are lots of rules in football, too, that have nothing to do with play,  but they are rules," Wallin said. "Lining up offsides when you're a wide  receiver doesn't make much difference, but it's a five-yard penalty."  </P> <P> As a result of the court action, Fountain Valley High School will play Fontana  High School tonight in place of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> In the Savanna High School case, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner  Julian Cimbaluk postponed a decision until today.  </P> <P> A third legal effort failed Thursday when La Puente High School in Los Angeles  County lost its bid to be reinstated to the playoffs. La Puente had been  disqualified by its league officials because of an ineligible player. Pomona  Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss denied the school's request for reinstatement,  in part, because it was not filed in a timely manner, a school spokesman said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Coach Dick Bruich of Fontana High, the top-rated football team in  the Southern Section, said: "We spent two days preparing for Huntington, two  days for Fountain Valley. We spent today preparing for Huntington.  </P> <P> "The way I look at it, you got to live with whatever situation is dealt you;  you don't settle in court. The rule book spells out everything."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Chris Foster, Steve Lowery, Elliott Teaford and Rose Ellen  O'Connor contributed to this report.  </P> <P> COSTLY PENALTY -- Emotions ranged from joy to despair among high school  football players after another busy day off the field.

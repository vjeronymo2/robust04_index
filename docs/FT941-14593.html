			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer up 20% to Fl 122m Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based international trading group, said preliminary results for 1993 show a 20 per cent rise in net profit before extraordinary items to about Fl 122.5m (Dollars 68m) from Fl 102.2m in 1992. Total net profit, including a previously reported Fl 42m extraordinary gain on the sale of land in Singapore, rose by more than 55 per cent to Fl 161m from Fl 103.1m. Hagemeyer, which is 63 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, said sales rose to more than Fl 3.9bn from Fl 3.4bn in 1992, and it predicted a further rise to above Fl 4.5bn for the current year. 'The upward trend in earnings is expected to continue,' the company said. Final figures for 1993 are scheduled to be published on February 24. For 1994, the company expected to book more than Fl 75m in extraordinary profit from an amicable agreement with Matsushita of Japan that it would stop importing and distributing the Japanese company's products in Singapore, starting in April. Matsushita plans to integrate Hagemeyer's distribution activities for the National, Panasonic and Technics brands into its own regional marketing and sales company. The changes in Singapore will have no effect on Hagemeyer's agency relationship with Matsushita in the Netherlands or its relationship with JVC, which is majority-owned by Matsushita, in Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. Hagemeyer said it planned to use the extraordinary gain in 1994 to buy out ABN-Amro Bank's 50 per cent holding in a joint venture set up in late 1993 to finance Hagemeyer's acquisition of Newey &amp; Eyre, one of Britain's largest electrotechnical wholesalers, from BTR. The move to buy out the financing vehicle had been expected, but the extraordinary gain has helped accelerate the timing of Hagemeyer's full consolidation of Newey &amp; Eyre.</p>

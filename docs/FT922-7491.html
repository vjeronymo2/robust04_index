			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Oftel may face power vacuum A POWER VACUUM at the top of Oftel is likely for several months at a time when it has to finalise a new price formula for BT, the telecommunications group, and a new telephone numbering system. The telecommunications regulator is expected to face the vacuum after the departure next month of Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, to head the Office of Fair Trading. The government has yet to announce a successor and observers think it unlikely that a replacement can be found so quickly. Mr Bill Wigglesworth, Oftel's deputy director-general, is expected to fill the post in the interim. The possibility of Sir Bryan's running both Oftel and the OFT is understood to have been rejected by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Wigglesworth has been with Oftel since its establishment in 1984. Although he is not considered as tough as Sir Bryan, Oftel officials say he would rise to the challenge. When Sir Bryan leaves Oftel, the BT price formula and the numbering system are likely to be the two most important items of unfinished business. Sir Bryan has yet to reach agreement with BT on a new price formula. Even if BT agrees, it seems unlikely that all the details could be settled before the middle of next month. If BT refuses to accept Sir Bryan's plans, he is thought likely to refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission before he goes to the OFT. Sir Bryan is also understood to wish to clarify Oftel's plans for a new national numbering system before he departs. A plan he announced last September has been held up after objections from the Telecommunications Managers Association, which represents large users, that it would cost industry Pounds 3bn.</p>

Around 88 per cent of voters in the small central Asian  state  had cast their ballot with four hours of polling remaining, a  member of the central election commission told AFP.    Polling stations closed at 8.00 p.m. (1400 GMT) with  preliminary results Sunday night.    Pre-vote opinion polls showed Akayev would win his gamble  with between 60 percent and 70 percent backing for his reform  programme.    The only head of state among the five former Soviet  republics  in central Asia not to have been a communist leader, Akayev  announced the vote amid a social and economic crisis for his  radical reform programme launched in July 1992.    The reforms, instigated in conjunction with the  International  Monetary Fund by a man with a reputation as a good democrat,  have undermined Akayev's popularity.    Average monthly salaries now stand at 135 soms (around 15  dollars), just 35 soms above the estimated absolute minimum  necessary for survival.    When the reforms were launched, Akayev predicted that the  economy would stabilise by the end of 1992. But by the end of  last year annual inflation was still running at around 1,600  percent, while national income had fallen by 17 percent during  the year.    Observers said that Akayev's decision to call the referendum  had also been influenced by criticism that his initial election,  in October 1991 with 95 percent of the vote, lacked legitimacy.    Victory would mean the continuation of his bid to drag the  country's 4.5 million inhabitants out of poverty.    It would also strengthen Akayev's hand in his three-way  battle for political supremacy with the communist-dominated  parliament and with opposition forces within the legislature  calling for fresh elections.    Topchubek Tursunaliyev, who heads the opposition Free  Kyrgyzstan party, accused Akayev of calling the plebiscite to  "avoid the elections of which he is afraid."    "The president and parliament were elected under the Soviet  constitution of 1977 and have no legitimacy since Kyrgyzstan  adopted its own constitution last May," Tursunaliyev added.    Opposition forces including the Free Kyrgyzstan party also  denounced "corruption and the mafia, which are rife here and are  in the process of turning Kyrgyzstan into the Sicily of central  Asia."    Akayev himself admitted last week that the country was  wracked by widespread corruption, which he said had completely  overrun the Interior Ministry.    A Western diplomat here added: "Akayev is a genuine democrat  but he is not in complete control over what is happening in this  country."</p>

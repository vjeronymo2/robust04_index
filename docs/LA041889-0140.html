			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WALESA MEETS WITH JARUZELSKI  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Communist Party chief Wojciech Jaruzelski met  today for the first time in more than seven years, a day after the trade union  was legalized.  </P> <P> "I feel satisfaction. We have come a very difficult and long way," Jaruzelski  told reporters after the meeting. "Reconciliation is a process, not an act," he  said, and he cited the broad agreement on political and economic reform reached  between communist authorities and the opposition.  </P> <P> "Today we only put another seal, in a way, on that accord," he said.  </P> <P> Walesa left the meeting without talking to reporters.  </P></p>

To this end, the outcome of EHF treatment of 66  patients with limb injuries complicated by would infection with  the help of the Yav-1 device under optimum operating conditions  is discussed in detail. The patients were divided into two  groups: 49 injured and 17 control patients. The irradiation  duration varied within 30-60 min, and therapy consisted of 10-15  procedures whereby the wound or chest area (or both) were  exposed. The electromagnetic irradiation duration must be  sufficient for the development of adaptation reactions (AR) in  the organism, or activation or training. The morphological and  functional changes in the course of adaptation reactions under  radiation, the dynamics of the organism's adaptation reactions  under EHF therapy, and the dynamics of the organism's adaptation  reaction changes during EHF therapy as a function of exposure  localization are summarized. The use of adaptation reactions  makes it possible to substantiate the selection of exposure  duration and method and the number of treatment sessions for  patients with limb wounds complicated by purulent infection.  This helps to manifest the therapeutic properties of EHF  treatment more fully. It is noted that the above method does not  exhaust all possible millimeter wave treatment methods.

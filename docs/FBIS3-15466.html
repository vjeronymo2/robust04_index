			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report: "People Are Saying That...Russia </F> Is Again Preparing for State of Emergency"]    [Text] As has already been reported, last Thursday  Russia's Security Council approved a federal program to combat  crime. From reliable sources it has become known that the  Russian Federation's Ministry of Internal Affairs has sent a  secret circular to the provinces which contains the instruction  "to prepare for the suppression (!) of crime in conditions of a  state of emergency." According to certain information, similar  documents have been drafted in all power structures.    Professional criminologists questioned by a KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA correspondent assure us that formulations like  "suppression of crime" [podavleniye prestupnosti] have not been  encountered in official papers since wartime. In the opinion of  those people we talked with, the next fews days should see a  number of legislative initiatives designed to provide a legal  foundation for emergency measures.</p>

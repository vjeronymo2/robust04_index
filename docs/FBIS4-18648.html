			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China/Italy: Shanghai Mayor in </F> Rome"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 5 -- Bilateral trade was the  leading topic Tuesday [5 April] when the mayor of Shanghai,  Huang Ju, was received by Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi and Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta at the Rome  government's offices.    Future Italian programs and investments in China and  "greater  collaboration with the aim of consolidating positions gained"  were discussed, a government communique said after the meeting.    Italian exports to China last year amounted to four trillion  lire (2.45 billion dollars), mostly in industrial machinery, and  China in 1993 jumped from 20th to 14th place among Italy's  export markets, the communique said.    Mayor Huang Ju later had talks with Italian Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta focussing on prospects for the "particularly  dynamic" area around Shanghai and possible "Italian  participation in the development of the Pudong area," a foreign  ministry communique said.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Bofors ruling is reversed The Indian Supreme Court yesterday suspended a judgment by the Delhi High Courtwhich would have halted investigations into the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 260m) Bofors arms bribes scandal, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The move ensures that six secret Swiss bank accounts frozen with the help of the Swiss authorities, are not unfrozen, following the High Court's ruling that there was nothing proven against Mr Win Chadha, the former Bofors agent in India, and 13 others accused of receiving bribes from the Swedish arms company for a large order in 1987.</p>

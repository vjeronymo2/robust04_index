			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Observer: Up front So BT, Britain's biggest company, is promising a series of classical concerts, galas and a special issue of new phone cards to mark its 10th anniversary as a public company. BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance says that the 'unwieldy telephonic dinosaur that came blinking into the light 10 years ago has evolved into a streamlined world class player . . . we've got a lot to celebrate. 'For most people the biggest change is summed up in our prices - in real terms they have halved over the decade,' says Sir Iain. But a few cynics will be more interested in what has happened to the chairman's salary. It has risen nearly eightfold to Pounds 663,000.</p>

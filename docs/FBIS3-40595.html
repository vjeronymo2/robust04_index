God alone knows if the assassination was  intended to postpone the elections or whether it was caused by  personal enmity. At any rate, the general impression is that the  individual who was murdered did not have bitter personal  enemies, but, even so, he was not spared. It is hard to  understand the merciless fashion in which he was shot. The  government resorted to the usual phrases and comforted the  family with the promise that the murderers would not be allowed  to go free under any circumstances. The problem here is that the  murderers will have to be caught first; otherwise, the question  of letting them go free does not arise at all. In Peshawar  memorial prayers were held for the late Ghulam Haidar Wain  [though the funeral was held elsewhere] in which large numbers  of people from various political parties took part. Black arm  bands were worn, and the people expressed their dissatisfaction.  But a few minutes later, life resumed its normal course as  though nothing unusual had happened. This time one sees strange  election scenes in Peshawar. In certain precincts, posters are  being displayed against certain candidates telling them not to  come to that locality because they had not carried out any of  their campaign promises. Except for a few precincts where new  candidates have entered the arena and created some activity, the  election campaign generally has not been very animated in the  Northwest Frontier Province. As regards election holidays, most  people have decided to spend the time away from their homes.  School and college vacations have started. To give the finishing  touches to the election program, large meetings were held in  Peshawar's Jinnah Park and political parties demonstrated their  strength. Local residents did not take any major part in these  meetings, but people were brought from outside in buses,  trollies, and trucks. The first large meeting was held by Qazi  Hussain Ahmad's Islamic Front followed by Benazir Bhutto and  Mian Nawaz Sharif. The people were given time to think. A day  earlier, Qazi Hussain Ahmad addressed a large gathering in  Mardan in which he accused the People's Party and the Muslim  League of being gangs of thieves and plunderers with identical  aims. It should be remembered that when this same Qazi Hussain  Ahmad joined the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad], he declared that  the Urdu meaning of the Muslim League was Jamiat-I-Islami and  that both parties had the same basic characteristics. At any  rate, it cannot be denied even today that when the war for  Pakistan was being fought, Jamaat-I-Islami was the largest  opposing party [sic]. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that both Nawaz  Sharif and Benazir Bhutto were trying to outdo each other in  currying favor with the U. S., that both supported the  capitalist usury system under the aegis of the U. S., and that  they had joined Moin Qureshi with the intention of mortgaging  Pakistan totally to the U. S.. It should be remembered that Qazi  Hussain Ahmad is running for election in Malakand, and he has  made campaign speeches in various places there. He pointed out  that disorder, murder, theft, and plunder were increasing daily  and no one's life or property were safe which proved clearly  that both the past two governments and the present caretaker  government had failed. He said that corruption had continued to  increase under the Benazir and Nawaz governments up to the  present time and the reason was that the precepts of the Koran  and the hadith were ignored. He said that the Islamic Front  would end injustice, disorder, and oppression in the country and  establish a beneficial social order under the leadership of  honest individulas, and that, in order to put an end to  oppression, the people should join the Islamic Front and  confront plunderers and feudal landlords and thus prevent the  old ruling class from regaining power and strengthening the  Western system instead of Islam. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that  certain individuals accepted the United States as the sole  superpower and tried to scare the Islamic Front, but that the  latter was sure that soon the United States would suffer the  same fate as the Soviet Union, a fate which everyone had  witnessed. He said the struggle of the Islamic Front was not  against Benazir, Nawaz Sharif or Wali Khan, but against the  United States and its exploitative capitalist system and the  supporters of that system. On the whole, the Islamic Front will  not succeed in gaining more than five national assembly seats  from the entire Northwest Frontier Province.    Meanwhile, the big fish of the drug business were suddenly  arrested in three MPOs and put in the Frontier Province's large  jails. Our readers have read about them here, and we have been  informing them about the [activities] of these enemies of  humanity. We have been receiving letters from inside and outside  the country complaining that we were not writing enough against  these elements. One of these letters is from Mr. Manzoor who has  written us from Norway. While governments and officials now and  then proclaim their strength, the fact remains that these  elements [drug dealers] have set up shadow governments in almost  every part of the world, and it is quite easy for them to wipe  out humanity from the face of the earth. Even today, there are  individuals including members of legislative bodies who are  engaged in drug dealing, but the government is powerless to  bring them to justice. A former minister and major drug dealer,  Amanullah Kandi, was convicted in a Karachi court, but to this  day it is not clear how he was transferred from Karachi jail to  the central jail of Dera Ismail Khan, his native town, and who  had a hand in helping him escape from that prison. Recently, a  journalist went to interview him, but the journalist's camera  and the tape of the interview were confiscated by government  officials. In spite of strong reassurances by the government,  [Kandi] has eluded capture. Meanwhile, Peshawar high court's  full bench has thrown out the appeal entered against the  disqualification of Rahnuma Nadir Khan Zaka Kheel running  against National Assembly Speaker Gauhar Ayub Khan from Haripur  precinct NA13, and the disqualification of Mehmand Agency's Haji  Qadar Gul Mehmand (former MNA) accused of drug dealing, and of  Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan. These individuals had been  barred from participating in the elections by the returning  officials and later by the election appellate tribunal. Haji  Qadar Gul Mehmand and Haji Ibrahim Khan were arrested by the  local police on charge of selling drugs and these two  individuals are still in jail. The full bench consisted of  justice Abdul Karim Kandi; justice Sayed Ibni Ali; justice Abdul  Rahman Khan; justice Khiar Khan and justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal.  The candidacy papers filed by petitioner Sayed Sultan Shah were  rejected because he did not pay the money owed.    The [candidacy] papers of Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel who was a  candidate for the national assembly from Khyber Agency were  rejected on grounds that he had fought against government  officials during construction of Qamar road in Tirah and had  harmed national security; he was barred from running in the  elections. National Assembly hopeful from Mehmand Agency, Haji  Qadar Gul Mehmand and Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan, who  were charged with drug dealing, had their papers rejected and  were barred from participation in the elections. The two men  were arrested by the local police, and they are still in jail.  Following the rejection of their election petitions, these two  individuals appealed to the election tribunal, but their appeal  was also rejected. They entered four separate writs in the  Peshawar high court against the tribunal's decision barring them  from election participation. On Thursday, the high court's full  bench rejected their writs. These candidates cannot take part in  the elections. The attorney general of Pakistan, who prosecuted  the case for the government, took the position that elections  did not merely imply voting on a certain date but were a gradual  process in which it was necessary to file candidacy papers,  assign election symbols, qualify or disqualified candidates to  run. The attorney general said that the election tribunal had  decided as to whether these individuals were qualified or not.  After elections took place under article 225 of the  constitution, these individuals could challenge their  disqualification in the next election tribunal. Consequently, it  was not within the jurisdiction of the court to hear the  petitions of these individuals. Referring to the 1989 Javid  Hashemi case in the Pakistan Supreme Court, the attorney general  said that the Supreme Court had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal  and instructed him to take his case to the election tribunal  after elections were over. Lawyers for petitioners Haji Ibrahim  Khan and Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel raised the point that at that  time Supreme Court Justice Naseem Hasan Shah's decision was  contrary to the decisions of the rest of the justices. At this  juncture, the chief justice said that the majority of the  Supreme Court justices had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal.  Justice Nasim Hasan Shah said if the majority agreed on a  decision, he would go along with it. The attorney general  pointed out that the Sindh High Court had made a similar  decision in the Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi case and ruled that the  high court did not have the jurisdiction to hear Jatoi's appeal  and that the decision could be challenged in the election  tribunal to be set up after the elections. Haji Qadar Gul's  lawyer said that his client's langi had been revoked. Langi is  an honor awarded to certain prominent individuals in the  agencies and is usually given to those favored by the  government.</p>

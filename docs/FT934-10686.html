			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Pledge by Howard on prison overcrowding THE GOVERNMENT will take whatever steps are necessary to solve short-term prison accommodation problems, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, told prison governors yesterday. Prisons are becoming increasingly crowded and emergency facilities such as military camps are likely to be needed soon. At the Conservative party conference last month, Mr Howard unveiled a tough law-and-order stance which is likely to lead to still more people receiving custodial sentences. Mr Howard, addressing the Prison Service conference in Blackpool, announced proposals to strengthen governors' powers to punish indiscipline and to enhance the role of work in prisons. He said work should stretch prisoners and teach trades and skills that were needed in the community. Mr Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the Prison Governors' Association, said governors regarded much of what Mr Howard had said about prison regimes as simplistic. Providing the resources to offer prisoners a full and demanding day would require a reversal of recent policy, when many prison workshops had been closed - apparently as a cost-cutting measure - and new jails built without them. Home Office figures yesterday showed that recorded crime in England and Wales rose by 3.8 per cent to a record 5.7m offences in the year to June. However the rate of increase has slowed substantially, from an 11 per cent rise in 1991-92. But violent crime rose by 4 per cent and robberies by 14 per cent. Meanwhile, the Audit Commission says in a report today that police forces need to develop clearer management frameworks for tackling crime. The public-spending watchdog says in a report that the framework should include establishing the priority to be given to crime among other policing demands. It says such factors as the likelihood of an arrest, the vulnerability of the victim, and the cost of a crime to an individual or the public should help determine the degree of police response to an incident.

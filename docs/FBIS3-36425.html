The strategic goals are consolidation of  independence and transformation of Belarus into a neutral state.    In his words, the republic attaches great importance to a  recent visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton which laid down the  basis of further bilateral cooperation in the political and  economic spheres.    He also praised negotiations of Vyacheslav Kebich and  Stanislav Shushkevich with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The speaker said further  Russian-Belarusian integration with the future unification of  their monetary systems is a vital necessity without which  Belarus will collapse.    The formation of Russian-Belarusian economic union will take  several months due to the need to sign 40 agreements.</p>

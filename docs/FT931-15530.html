			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland rises as door opens to foreigners Finland stood out with a 9.1 per cent gain in local currency terms, while poor performances in Japan and on Wall Street left the FT-Actuaries World Index 1.1 per cent lower in the first trading week of 1993. The abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership of Finnish shares and a change in the tax regime in favour of equities have provided further reasons to buy into the Helsinki stock market. It received a boost late last year by the devaluation of the markka, which should greatly improve Finland's international competitiveness. Mr Christian Diebitsch at Kleinwort Benson also points to the successful conclusion of the 1993 wage round and the government's survival in recent local elections for his house's positive stance towards Finland. The country is also expected to enjoy modest growth in GDP this year after two years of falls. The prospect of a devaluation in the punt prompted a 6.8 per cent rise in Ireland in local terms, though in sterling terms the rise was only 3.6 per cent. Other gainers on the week included Norway, up 4.9 per cent in response to a cut in interest rates, while South Africa added 4.1 per cent thanks to a strong rise in De Beers in the wake of better-than-expected 1992 diamond sales. Japan declined 1.5 per cent in spite of the announcement on Thursday of the engagement of the Crown Prince Naruhito which raised hopes that the royal wedding would have some positive impact on the economy. Analysts at Nomura Research Institute say that even if there is a rush of copy-cat marriages in Japan, say of 10 per cent, creating an extra Y500bn (Dollars 4bn) of demand, this would only account for about 0.1 per cent of GNP. US equities suffered a similar fall, weighed down by unease about developments in the Middle East and unexpectedly weak employment figures for December.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                % change     % change in              % change in local currency**      sterling**  US Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of  Start of     Start of                                         1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -3.10   +0.79   -15.12    -3.10     -6.47         -4.74 Belgium      +1.61   +2.41    -0.17    +1.61     -2.00         -0.20 Denmark      +3.40   -1.36   -24.82    +3.40     +0.71         +2.58 Finland      +9.14   +5.28   +16.76    +9.13     +2.54         +4.45 France       +0.24   +4.83    +3.67    +0.24     -2.38         -0.58 Germany      -0.65   +3.44    -6.43    -0.65     -3.52         -1.74 Ireland      +6.83  +12.45    -7.43    +6.83     +3.63         +5.55 Italy        +2.55   +9.98    -6.20    +2.55     -1.10         +0.73 Netherlands  +1.08   +1.56    +6.15    +1.08     -1.86         -0.05 Norway       +4.86   +0.47    -9.19    +4.86     +1.45         +3.33 Spain        +2.75   +3.47   -10.02    +2.75     -0.71         +1.12 Sweden       +2.97   +6.84   +18.73    +2.97     -3.60         -1.82 Switzerland  -0.67   +3.98   +19.02    -0.67     -4.34         -2.57 UK           -1.07   +3.98   +14.67    -1.07     -1.07         +0.76 EUROPE       -0.06   +4.09    +6.03    -0.06     -1.94         -0.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -3.04   +0.46   -11.65    -3.04     -6.91         -5.20 Hong Kong    +0.46   +6.01   +24.52    +0.46     -1.36         +0.46 Japan        -1.50   -2.75   -22.85    -1.50     -3.59         -1.81 Malaysia     -1.67   -1.41   +15.58    -1.67     -2.78         -0.98 New Zealand  -2.19   -0.12    -5.64    -2.19     -4.60         -2.82 Singapore    +0.91   +6.78    -2.39    +0.91     -2.30         -0.49 Canada       -1.54   +0.04    -7.92    -1.54     -4.12         -2.35 USA          -1.53   -0.94    +2.82    -1.53     -3.31         -1.53 Mexico       +3.59   +5.46   +22.08    +3.59     +2.18         +4.07 South Africa +4.07   +4.32    -7.97    +4.07     +1.43         +3.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -1.07   +0.04    -4.57    -1.07     -3.01         -1.20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on January 8th 1992.

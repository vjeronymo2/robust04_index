			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPA holders near lock-in deal GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, based in Shannon in the Republic of Ireland, appears to be close to achieving a one-year 'lock-in' agreement with its larger shareholders. The agreement would follow the company's planned flotation in June. Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said yesterday that 'the major shareholders are fully agreed' on a deal which would allow them to dispose of no more than 15-20 per cent of their present stake in the first year after the flotation. Such an agreement is vital for GPA to ensure stability in its share price, although in the negotiations GPA had apparently been hoping to 'lock in' a minimum of 85 per cent. The shareholders are Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, Air Canada, Aer Lingus, the Prudential Assurance Company of America and The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which together hold 48 per cent. In a statement yesterday Aer Lingus would not confirm finalisation of the deal, saying only: 'Aer Lingus has reached an agreement in principal with GPA regarding (the flotation). We have made substantial progress in our discussions on the detail of the agreement, and we hope to finalise these discussions shortly.' However the company said that the figures given by Mr Foley 'are the figures we are talking about'. It said it was negotiating on a bilateral basis with GPA, and not in concert with the other shareholders. Aer Lingus has been hoping to use the flotation as a means of releasing some of its holding in order to finance the renewal of its ageing Boeing fleet. The company also wants to purchase two or three 767s, to open a new route to the west coast of the US. The company will be floated simultaneously in London, Dublin, New York and Tokyo. Mr Foley said that the final flotation price would be pitched at a level 'to obtain the minimum we want from each market'.</p>

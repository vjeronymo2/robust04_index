			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Miran Subic: "Our Soldiers in Austria"] </F>   [Text] Kranj, 18 June -- History is being made today as the  Slovene Army is about to step on Austrian soil without  commotion. The "Chamois" (so named for their unit insignia) from  Upper Carniola will not be there as a purely military force but  to cooperate with the 7th Chasseur Brigade from Klagenfurt,  thereby contributing to good relations between the two states.    Ten privates and 22 commissioned and noncommissioned  officers  will take part in the 48-km long Rosenthal March. This is the  first time that Slovene uniformed army personnel are  participating in such an event abroad.    Next week, 16 Hungarian officers will arrive at Bohinjska  Bela to familiarize themselves with tactics and the use of  mountain and alpine equipment in mountainous terrain. Although  mountainous warfare is not especially developed in Hungary, this  kind of training is a valuable form of international cooperation  (in keeping with the saying "Hungary does not have a sea,  however, it does have a navy"). Our excellent alpinists will  take part in training, which will culminate in our Hungarian  guests "capturing" Mount Triglav.</p>

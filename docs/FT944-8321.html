			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Labour attacks ministers over spending on wine Labour yesterday accused ministers of having an 'obscene sense of priorities' after disclosing that the government had spent more than Pounds 570,000 on wine for official gatherings in the past five years at an average of Pounds 5.26 a bottle. Mr Alan Milburn, a Labour MP, said the purchasing was done by a quango called the Government Hospitality Fund Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine, under the auspices of the Foreign Office. The quango, headed by Sir Ewen Fergusson, a former Ambassador to France, cost Pounds 1,500 a year to run. Mr Milburn accused the committee of wasteful expenditure at a time when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was calling for public expenditure restraint. He said: 'With huge spending cuts being planned, it is an obscene sense of priorities to lavish large sums of public money on buying wine to dish out at receptions.' Mr Milburn said the money spent on wine could have bought 500 cataract extractions or 100 coronary artery by-pass operations. The Foreign Office said the average spending of Pounds 110,000 a year 'does not necessarily mean that money was actually used in the last year, because some wine is bought and then stored'. It said there were 500 functions last year across government departments. Such entertainment, involving people from all walks of life, was in 'direct support of government activities and objectives', it said, citing diverse examples such as the promotion of exports and an achievement award ceremony for disabled people. Nor were members involved in decisions on purchasing, which was the responsibility of officials of the fund.</p>

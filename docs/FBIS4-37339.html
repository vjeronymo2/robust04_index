			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 18 (AFP) -- PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  has asked the United States and Europe for more funds to help  set up the new Palestinian authority in the autonomous Jericho  area and Gaza Strip.    While delaying his trip to Jericho because of his  organization's financial difficulties, 'Arafat also asked for  speeding up the transfer of 42 million dollars promised in  emergency aid, the PLO news agency WAFA said Saturday [18 June].    'Arafat made the requests in separate talks Friday and  Saturday with ambassadors John McCarthy of the United States and  Jean-Noel de Bouillane de Lacoste of France as well as with  envoys from Greece, Germany and Belgium.    The international community has already promised 2.5 billion  dollars to help launch Palestinian autonomy, including more than  600 million dollars for this year, but the PLO has complained  that donors are hesitant.    A Palestinian official said 'Arafat is angry at the slowness  in disbursing the 42 million dollars which international donors  promised on June 11 in Paris to cover a deficit in the operating  budget of the new authority.    Self-rule was launched on May 4.    A representative of the World Bank involved in the transfer  of the sum is in Tunis, but only "for consultation" and "not for  handing over the money," the official said.    A new meeting of donor nations is planned for July 10-11 in  Paris, where the PLO leader is expected on July 6 to receive a  prize from UNESCO.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said he told  'Arafat  here last Saturday that the PLO leader should be patient while  ways are found to make sure the money is not wasted.</p>

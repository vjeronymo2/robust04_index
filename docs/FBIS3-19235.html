			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Switzerland and France have criticized each other's  approach to European transport policy. Swiss Transport Minister  Adolf Ogi said France was being tough on Switzerland by opposing  Swiss attempts to resume transport negotiations with the  European Union. Mr Ogi, speaking after talks in Crete with his  French counterpart Bernard Bosson, said Switzerland would  nevertheless continue to press its case.    Mr Bosson told reporters that Swiss policy was  contradictory.  He said Switzerland had voted to ban foreign heavy goods  traffic from its north-south transit roads, while at the same  time demanding free access for its own heavy goods vehicles on  French territory. Mr Ogi and Mr Bosson are in Crete for a  European transport conference.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The impact of the mainland's Chientao [Qiandao]  Lake incident on cross-strait ties has continued to grow.  According to a survey, more than 80 percent of Taiwan's people  are dissatisfied with the Chinese Communists' ways of handling  the case. However, nearly 40 percent of Taiwan's people believe  that Taiwan Government and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]  have failed in their performances. Most people advocate  boycotts against the Chinese Communists. Because of this  incident, people have considerably changed their attitude toward  the "Taiwan independence" issue that has been sensitive all  along. Please listen to a (Kang Yu-feng) report:    [Begin (Kang) recording] The mainland's Chientao Lake boat  tragedy has posed major variables on the development of  cross-strait ties.    The Gallup Poll Company conducted a survey of Taiwan's  people  who graded performances of the Chinese Communists, Taiwan  Government, and the SEF in handling the case. The highest and  lowest marks were 100 and zero, respectively, and 60 is the  passing mark. The results showed that 83.9 percent of the  people failed the Chinese Communists, including 56.6 percent  giving them a zero mark; that 38.6 percent and 34.7 percent of  the people failed Taiwan Government and the SEF respectively;  and that 74.2 percent believed the Chinese Communists are  hostile toward Taiwan. Consequently, to express our  dissatisfaction toward the Chinese Communists, quite a high  proportion of the people have advocated boycotts, including a  total stop to sightseeing, visiting relatives, investing, and  trading on the mainland, and cutting off contacts and talks  between the SEF and the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait [ARATS].    Taiwan University Political Science Department Professor Li  Ya- ling specially urged the Chinese Communists to be alert to  such reactions of Taiwan's people.    [Li] I personally believe the mainland's Chientao Lake  incident was mishandled by the mainland bureaucrats. It was not  in accordance with the government policy. Our survey will be a  very good warning to the mainland. The handling of the  cross-strait ties does not merely depend on high-level policies.  Their bureaucrats' personalities can have very grave impact.    [(Kang]) According to the current survey, because of this  incident, 27 percent, an unprecedentedly high proportion, of  people -- in comparison to past years -- have favored the Taiwan  independence issue that has been sensitive all along.    The National Chengchi University Political Science  Department  Professor Li Kuo-chung said if the Chinese Communists cannot  properly handle the Chientao Lake incident, the cross-strait  ties will gradually drift farther apart.    [Li Kuo-chung] Any single incident may [words indistinct] or  influence cross-strait ties or even have an impact on Taiwan's  people on their identifying with Taiwan's destiny; namely,  Taiwan's independence. It is very probable that because of a  single incident, such as the Chientao Lake incident, the  proportion of Taiwan's people identifying with Taiwan's  independence will rise remarkably. If the Chinese Communists  cannot properly handle this incident, I believe the cross-strait  ties may gradually drift farther apart.    [(Kang]) According to the survey, most Taiwan people thought  that in the near future, the current conditions of cross-strait  ties will remain unchanged. However, everyone is very unsure  about the long-term future of the cross-strait ties. This is a  point that really warrants our attention.    This is (Kang Yu-feng) reporting from Taipei.

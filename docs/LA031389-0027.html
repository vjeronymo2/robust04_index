			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PALOMINO OFFERS SLICE OF KERRVILLE FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The annual Kerrville Texas Folk Festival, now in its 18th year, has a  reputation as a place to find new talent -- an image boosted by the recent  success of Michelle Shocked, who was "discovered" there in 1986.  </P> <P> But much of the show Saturday at the Palomino packaging a dozen Kerrville  regulars showed that Kerrville's old talent shouldn't be overlooked. With each  act taking the stage for three songs, the presentation virtually outlined the  history of contemporary American folk music with a casual warmth and  comfortable homeyness.  </P> <P> Hamilton Camp and Carolyn Hester -- two of many Los Angeles-based performers on  the show -- each provided a link to the early-'60s folk boom with personable  sets that linked their pasts to the present.  </P> <P> A second generation was also well-represented, with Lucinda Williams (an L.A.  club regular now, but a Kerrville performer as far back as 1974) and Texan  Butch Hancock standing out. Williams worked in the country and blues branches  of American folk with power and confidence, while Hancock -- best known for  songs recorded by Joe Ely -- shone as the evening's top wordsmith.  </P> <P> Appropriately, the outstanding set came from a relative newcomer, Boston-based  Patty Larkin. With a commanding voice, accomplished songwriting touch and  well-timed wit, Larkin (though not exactly a rookie) barely eclipsed young  rock- and country-influenced Texas folkie David Halley as the evening's find.  </P> <P> Rod Kennedy, Kerrville executive director, announced during Saturday's show  that he hopes to establish a three-day Kerrville-style songwriters' festival in  Los Angeles next year. This year's Texas festival will be held from May 25 to  June 11. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We also expect States to monitor decisions made by specific qualified providers to assure the accuracy and integrity of the determinations and to take any corrective actions that may be necessary. Therefore, we are proposing to require States to monitor presumptive eligibility decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to amend the Medicaid regulations to incorporate the provisions of section 9407 of OBRA '86, section 411(k)(16) of MCCA, and section 4605 of OBRA '90 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revise &sect;&sect;431.864 and 431.865 to specify that excess erroneous payments for purposes of disallowance of Federal financial participation do not include erroneous payments for ambulatory prenatal care covered under the State plan, and provided to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period by a provider eligible for Medicaid payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add &sect;&sect;435.250 and 436.250 to specify optional coverage of pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;435.907 to clarify what constitutes a formal Medicaid application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add a new &sect;435.911 to specify the screening and application requirements and procedures for making presumptive eligibility determinations. Existing &sect;&sect;435.911 through 435.914 would be redesignated as &sect;&sect;435.914 through 435.917, respectively, to allow the incorporation of the new &sect;435.911. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add a new &sect;435.912 to specify the application requirements for pregnant women following the presumptive eligibility determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amend &sect;&sect;435.1001 and 436.1001 to clarify that FFP is available in the necessary administrative costs the State incurs in determining presumptive eligibility for pregnant women and in providing ambulatory prenatal care to presumptively eligible women. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revise &sect;440.1 to add the statutory basis for providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add &sect;440.172 to define ambulatory prenatal care and qualified provider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Add &sect;447.85 to specify the availability of Federal financial participation for payments for ambulatory prenatal care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Enhancement of Pregnancy Outcomes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As we have discussed earlier in two sections of this document, Congress has expanded mandatory and optional Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women as part of an overall effort to combat the problem of infant mortality and incidences of low-birth weight through provision of needed health services to low-income pregnant women. In addition, we believe that we must focus State attention on the need for special vigilance in cases of high-risk pregnancy in order to maximize the cost effectiveness of the increased Medicaid investments. Examples of high-risk pregnancies include those in which the women have a complicating medical condition, complications that may result from genetic factors, or a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is much evidence that many adverse birth outcomes are preventible through timely and appropriate intervention by health and social services agencies, with the potential for reducing infant mortality, the use of high-cost neonatal intensive care services, and the incidence of long-term care services associated with extended or lifelong disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to add &sect;435.935 to the Medicaid regulations to require States to define a high-risk pregnancy, to describe the methods they will apply to identify high-risk pregnant women, and to specify steps that individuals, groups, and organizations involved in the service delivery system will take to ensure that these women will receive services designed to enhance pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child. The purpose of defining these terms is to assist States in their efforts to see that pregnant Medicaid recipients receive the full range of medical and related services appropriate to their risk status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Zimbabwe orders electricity cuts Zimbabwe ordered nationwide cuts in electricity use yesterday because of southern Africa's withering drought, Reuter reports from Harare. The state-run Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), told all companies to reduce power consumption by up to 30 per cent and severely curtailed household electricity use. ZESA said companies and families exceeding their rations could face stiff fines and disconnection. But the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries branded ZESA's unprecedented measures as too little, too late in a country which gets its electricity mainly from hydro-electric plants on rivers shrunken by the worst drought this century.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Finelist raises Pounds 15.9m in flotation Finelist, the vehicle components distributor, yesterday announced a placing price of 130p to raise Pounds 15.9m from its forthcoming flotation. Most of the funds raised by the placing, involving 12.2m ordinary shares, will be realised by the current management and venture capital shareholders, 3i and NatWest Ventures, which together helped the company build up its portfolio of 73 UK outlets. Mr Chris Swan, chairman, said existing investors would be selling 7.97m shares worth Pounds 10.4m, of which management shareholders are expected to receive Pounds 3.5m. Following the flotation, directors and their families will retain a 21.1 per cent stake - held mostly by Mr Swan, who expects to control 19 per cent. The company, trading principally under the Autela name, will receive Pounds 4.9m, of which Pounds 2.9m will be used to reduce gearing and redeem preference and A ordinary shares. 'The remaining Pounds 2m will be used to expand. We have the infrastructure and people in place to handle another 20 sites,' Mr Swan said yesterday. He predicted that pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 would reach Pounds 2.3m, well ahead of the previous year's Pounds 1m. COMMENT Brokers BZW and sponsors NatWest Markets have opted for a price below the prevailing rate for the distributor sector, so analysts expect a premium on first day dealings next Monday. Although the placing leaves Finelist with a relatively modest Pounds 2m to play with, the company - valued at Pounds 28.3m - should emerge from the process debt free and well placed to expand.</p>

Kazakhstan is a country which has  unequivocally stated that it has joined the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and the Lisbon protocol on this issue,  and its intention to eliminate the nuclear weapons it has on its  territory." Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told this  to the special correspondent when replying to a request to  comment on the report in the Iranian newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI  about an alleged "Kazakhstan's special stance" in respect of the  nuclear weapons it has.    "It is rather difficult for me to comment on that  newspaper's  report or even on the ambassador's statement until I have  official information on this issue," the minister said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 30 (XINHUA)--The 75th Guangzhou  Export Commodity Fair closed today, setting a record transaction  volume with an increase of 12 percent.    Officials in charge of the fair gave no account of the  concrete transaction volume, but the transaction of new and fine  light industrial and petrochemical products, machinery and  electronic products made the greatest increases.    The fair registered the attendance of 49,863 overseas  businessmen from 145 countries and regions, 2,839 persons more  than the last fair.    In spite of the effect of the recent Qiandao Lake tourist  boat accident, 4,075 Taiwanese businessmen, 14 percent more than  the last fair, came to the fair, organizing officials said.    The number of Japanese businessmen decreased by 3 percent to  2,802, partly due to the inactive internal economy of Japan.    The transaction volume between Chinese commodity exporters  and Hong Kong and Macao businessmen accounted for 33.3 percent  of the total, the officials said.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Clarke faces the cutting question: Conflicting views over an interest rate cut that the chancellor must weigh When the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England hold their monthly monetary meeting today, it is assumed that Mr Kenneth Clarke will be much more keen on an interest rate cut than Mr Eddie George is. Many believed that February's  1/4 percentage-point rate cut to 5.25 per cent was a compromise between Mr Clarke (who wanted a  1/2 -point reduction) and Mr George (who wanted no cut). The first, and most compelling, reason for Mr Clarke to cut rates is the forthcoming tax increases, such as the additional 1 per cent on National Insurance contributions, and the restriction of the married couple's allowance. Economists differ about the likely impact of these increases on the recovery, but there are signs that consumers are already cutting their expenditure. Annual growth in retail sales fell to 2.5 per cent in February, the slowest year-on-year rate since May. Consumer confidence slumped to a four-year low in March, according to a Gallup poll. The chancellor may feel that a cut in rates is needed to provide a clear benefit to consumers and offset the psychological effect of the tax increases. Halifax building society has announced that a further  1/4 percentage-point cut in base rates would prompt a mortgage rate reduction. Mr Clarke must also be considering the Conservative party's prospects in May's local, and June's European, elections. Under the new monetary arrangements, with the Bank setting the timing of rate cuts, interest rate adjustments are not supposed to be 'political'. Nevertheless, the markets are cynical enough to look for political motives. Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, says: 'For Clarke, the closer we get to May and June, the more he can be accused of making a political cut.' That might provoke the chancellor to push for an early cut. If the governor, as expected, urges caution, he will have some plausible reasons. February's cut was badly received by the markets, due to an accompanying report which warned of the risk of rising inflation. The Bank's anti-inflationary credibility was damaged, and Mr George is unlikely to want it to suffer further. Since February, bond markets have become much more pessimistic about prospects for interest rates and inflation. World bond markets have tumbled and the gilt market has particularly suffered. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist of Yamaichi International (Europe), points out that the Treasury has made much of the inflationary expectations in the gilt market. These have deteriorated sharply and now imply an inflation forecast of 4.5 per cent. 'If the Treasury really thinks the market is worth listening to, it's hard to justify a cut,' he adds. Furthermore, futures prices indicate that traders expect base rates to rise to 6 per cent by the end of 1994. And the pound has dipped sharply against the D-Mark, falling at one point below DM2.50. A badly received rate cut might provoke a sterling crisis. Some good news on inflation is needed to change market sentiment, but February's numbers, while not disastrous, were worse than expectations and followed a worrying increase in the annual rate of growth in average earnings. However, Mr Barty of Morgan Grenfell says: 'Probably the Treasury and the Bank don't share the market's worry about inflationary pressures. Taking the January and February inflation numbers together, they were better than expected.' The government's target range for underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) is 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and it is aiming for the lower half of the range by the end of this parliament. The annual rate in February was 2.8 per cent, still in the range's upper half, and a cut in rates might cast further doubt on the anti-inflation resolve. In the face of these arguments, analysts think the duo will compromise; the Bank will sanction a cut, but only if it gets good inflation news. March's inflation figures are the key, says Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. He expects the Bank's measure of core inflation to fall to 2 per cent. 'If it does, the authorities can cut. But if those inflation figures are bad, you can kiss a rate cut goodbye until the summer.' Observer, Page 21</p>

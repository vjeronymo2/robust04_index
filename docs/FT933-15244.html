			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Too close for Owners' comfort / Considering the resignations at a travel operator TO THE UK travel industry, yesterday's resignations at Owners Abroad were as big a shock as waking up in a holiday hotel to find the roof had blown away. Those who had not yet heard that Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger Allard, managing director, were stepping down reacted with disbelief. After allowing the news to sink in, most thought it wiser not to comment. Owners Abroad's account of events leading up to its warning that full-year profits were likely to be half of market expectations is potentially a landmark event for the industry. Independent travel groups will point to events at Owners Abroad as evidence that the growth of the largest travel groups is damaging to everyone, even the well-established companies. For the big groups, the fear is that the resignations will increase pressure on the competition authorities to limit the links between tour operators and travel agents. Mr Klein yesterday identified the links, which the Office of Fair Trading is currently examining, as one of the principal reasons for his downfall. Mr Klein said yesterday that the group's problems began after Easter. By the end of April, he said, Owners Abroad had sold 55 per cent of its 1.6m summer holidays at full price. After that, three factors caused the group's position to deteriorate sharply. These were severe price competition, customers' preference this year for Spain rather than the eastern Mediterranean, and 'directional selling' or travel agents favouring the holidays of the tour operators which own them. Many in the industry will entertain another suspicion. Owners Abroad's profits for the year were never going to be that good anyway but its prospects were puffed up to maintain the group's independence. Earlier this year, Owners Abroad successfully fought off a takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator. Owners Abroad managed to persuade key shareholders to reject the bid on the grounds that it could do better on its own. Mr Klein argued that a proposed tie-up with travel agents Thomas Cook was a better option. Last night, Mr Klein categorically denied that shareholders had been misled. However many in the industry will continue to ask questions. This is not the result of personal antagonism towards Mr Klein and Mr Allard. Mr Klein, a solicitor who joined Owners Abroad in 1982, is more amiable and approachable than the heads of most other travel groups. Mr Allard, famed for his inability to complete any sentence he starts, is reckoned to know more about the selling of charter airline seats than anyone alive. Much of the scepticism will come instead from an examination of the three reasons advanced for the group's crisis. The first was that the group was damaged by severe price competition. Mr Klein last year said the severe price competition in 1992 was a non-recurring event. Last night, he said it had recurred in 1993. Owners Abroad, he said, had misread what the market wanted. 'We thought people would want quality. We thought people would want to go to a better type of hotel. But all those things have to be paid for. It appears people don't want to pay for it.' Mr Bruce Shepherd, retail sales director of AT Mays, the only large travel agents' chain which is not owned by a UK tour operator, said last night he found Mr Klein's view difficult to understand. Owners Abroad had a range of holiday brands, from Sovereign, at the top end of the market, to several budget holiday names. Both sorts of offering appeared to have their appeal, he said. Owners Abroad shareholders are entitled to feel that stiff price competition is hardly a new travel industry phenomenon. If Owners Abroad thought its holidays were too expensive, perhaps it should have advised shareholders to accept the offer from the determinedly down-market Airtours. The second reason advanced for Owners Abroad's problems, that it had concentrated too heavily on the eastern Mediterranean and not enough on Spain, does not say much for the group's management. It is true that Cyprus is experiencing difficulties. Having proved too popular last year for the good of the island, Cyprus has this year set its prices too high for many recession-hit travellers. Greece has suffered from a new departure tax. Regardless of such transitory problems, no well-run holiday company should have regarded the eastern Mediterranean as a safe region on which to pin one's hopes. The Gulf War had already demonstrated the vulnerability of holiday destinations so close to centres of potential conflict. It is the third reason advanced by Mr Klein, that the channels of distribution are increasingly monopolised by a small number of tour operators, that has to be taken the most seriously. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, has made no secret of his aim of using his recently-acquired Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail outlets to push the tour operator's own holidays. For the first time, Thomson has begun to use its Lunn Poly chain in the same way. When the OFT's investigation was announced last month, Mr Klein was quick to ridicule it. Last night, unsurprisingly, he appeared to think it had a point. If large companies like Owners Abroad found it difficult to sell through the tied agents, how would small operators manage? 'It's potentially very damaging. The small guys are going to have a very difficult time,' Mr Klein said.</p>

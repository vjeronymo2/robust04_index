			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / 'Mr Clean' to fight fraud at UN THE UNITED NATIONS last night appointed a senior investigator to examine persistent charges of fraud, waste and corruption in the organisation. Mr Mohamed Aly Niazi, an Egyptian who served for 23 years as a UN internal auditor before his retirement, will fill the newly-created post of assistant secretary-general for inspections and investigations. He is said to be 'obsessed with honesty' and is already running an inquiry into UN handling of multi-million dollar bids for commercial contracts for peacekeeping and other services. Eight officials were suspended recently after suspicions of impropriety in the award of a contract to a company providing helicopter services for the UN. Mrs Madeleine Albright, US delegate, has been pressing for appointment of a UN inspector-general with wide powers. That question is expected to be addressed by member states at the general assembly session beginning next month. Allegations of mismanagement and lax controls over the UN's world-wide operations are blamed in part for the US Congress's failure to authorise payment of Dollars 786m (Pounds 527.5m) in arrears for the regular budget and peacekeeping.</p>

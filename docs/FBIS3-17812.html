Shumeyko considers  it possible to establish such a union on a new basis, not just  recreate the former Soviet Union.    Shumeyko's opinion is that it is possible to create a new  union on the basis of the already existing CIS institutions:  The Council of the Heads of State, the Council of the Heads of  Government, and the Interparliamentary Assembly.    He also believes that it is essential gradually to establish  "supranational institutions which would administer such a  union." One can speak about the creation of common armed forces,  a common monetary system and that there is no need for borders,  Shumeyko remarked, being of the opinion that it is time to moot  these ideas in society.    Speaking about his recent visit to France, the Federation  Council speaker pointed out that he had been particularly  gratified by the trip to Strasbourg and the decision on Russia's  accession to the Council of Europe.    Shumeyko announced that a peace-making group of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, led by Kyrgyzstan parliament chief  Medetkan Sherimkulov, leaves Moscow for the Transcaucasus on  Thursday. The delegation will include representatives from a  number of CIS countries and the Russian Federation Council  committees.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Enlargement talks after treaty sealed THE EC will open accession negotiations with applicant countries from the European Free Trade Association (Efta) immediately after its own Maastricht union treaty is ratified. This was the upshot of the Lisbon summit's deliberations on enlargement, the first top-level discussion by EC leaders since the Community's plans for a single market and currency started to attract a queue of would-be members. The UK had hoped to separate the opening of enlargement talks from the complications arising from Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. This would have meant that preliminary negotiations with the four Efta applicants - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland - could have started under Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this year. But Britain's partners prevailed in their view that Maastricht must be ratified, at least by all EC states bar Denmark, before 'official' talks with Efta can begin. However, the Commission and the UK-led Council of Ministers are 'invited to speed up preparatory work needed to ensure rapid progress,' before the next summit in Edinburgh. EC leaders chose diplomatic language to ease any disappointment on the part of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta. These three poorer, southern countries have been told they must stay in the EC's waiting room, even though they all applied to join the EC before any of the Efta states. The Lisbon communique underlined that the Community sees Turkey's role 'in the present European political situation as of the greatest importance'. With no apparent dissent from Greece's prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitzotakis, the summit called for intensified economic co-operation with Ankara 'including a political dialogue at the highest level'.</p>

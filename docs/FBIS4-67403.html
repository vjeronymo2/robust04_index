			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Condition of Baltic Sea </F> Improving Steadily"]    [Text] The condition of the Baltic Sea is improving, and  discharges of heavy metals and so on have declined. From the  list of so-called hot spots--particularly critical sources of  effluent--drawn up by the Helsinki Commission for Protection of  the Baltic Sea (Helcom) a couple of years ago, 13 such spots  have already been deleted. Hopes are good that it will be  possible to eliminate more hot spots over the next few years,  says Helcom, which concluded its meeting in Helsinki on Friday  [11 March].    The 13 critical sources of effluent that have already  succeeded in reducing their discharges to a considerably lower  level are in Finland and Sweden but also in Latvia and  Lithuania, which have been able in particular to reduce their  discharges of polluted municipal refuse. Latvia is not a member  of Helcom, but will join within a few months.    The Finnish hot spots are mainly industrial, and all  factories are working to reduce their effluent levels. The two  factories removed from the critical list at the end of last year  were Kaukas in Lappeenranta and Enso-Gutzeit in Kaukopaa. Since  that time, Metsa-Botnia in Kasko has also been removed from the  list. Two of the hot spots that Finland is having the most  trouble doing anything about are sewage from the municipalities  in the region of the capital and fish breeding in the  archipelago waters.    At its meeting, Helcom adopted a recommendation concerning  the reduction of polluting effluent from the fish farms.  <H5>  Money Available </H5>   When Helcom designated the hot spots around the Baltic Sea,  it estimated that cleaning them up would cost a total of 10  billion ECU's or about 63 billion markkas. About one-fourth of  that amount has already been allocated to various projects,  according to Fleming Otzen, Helcom's general secretary.    "We now know what needs to be done at most of the critical  spots, and new measures are being adopted all the time," says  Otzen. There are still nearly 120 hot spots in the Baltic Sea  area, most of them in countries that belonged to the former  Eastern bloc.    The situation in the Baltic Sea has also improved because  many East European states have been forced to shut down  factories due to the lack of money and raw materials with which  to keep them operating. The lack of money has also led to a  decline in the use of artificial fertilizer by agriculture.  According to Otzen, Helcom now has a good opportunity to  introduce better technology in factories of that kind before  they begin operating again.  <H5>  Investment in Protection of Environment </H5>   Also adopted at the meeting in Helsinki were three  recommendations concerned solely with protection of the  environment. The first of those recommendations deals with the  100- to 300-meter restricted zone that will prevent construction  on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Finland has accepted that  recommendation, but with the reservation that construction with  a special permit and construction in planned areas will be  allowed.    A recommendation regarding a network of nature reserves was  also adopted at the meeting. That network will consist of 62  different areas in the Baltic states, and it corresponds almost  completely to the national nature reserves already in existence.  But now that Helcom has adopted this recommendation, an  individual nation will not be able to abolish a nature reserve  without Helcom's approval.    The third recommendation dealing directly with protection of  the environment calls for drawing up a so-called red book of  threatened marine biotypes--that is, natural areas and  species--in the Baltic Sea area. An initial survey will be  conducted in each individual country.    The issue of chemical weapons being dumped into the Baltic  Sea was also discussed at the meeting. Earlier reports to Helcom  listed the known locations where dumping has occurred, but  information on possible Soviet-era dumping in Russian and Baltic  territorial waters is still lacking. In any case, it is safer to  let the chemical weapons stay where they are than to try to  bring them to the surface, says Otzen.    "Fishing in the Baltic Sea area is so active that we now  have  a very good picture of where chemical dumping has taken place,"  says Otzen. "This means that we are not necessarily going to  find any more old Soviet weapons."</p>

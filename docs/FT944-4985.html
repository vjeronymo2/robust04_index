			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Personal View: Labour and education key to growth When the leaders of the Latin American and Caribbean nations meet President Bill Clinton at the Summit of the Americas in Miami this Friday, they will press for closer trade ties. They will rightly argue that the future of their market-oriented reforms will depend on the region's ability to continue generating rapid exports growth. This, in turn, requires an assurance that protectionism in industrial countries - and especially in the US - will be kept in check. After implementing one of the most dramatic unilateral trade liberalisation reforms of modern times, the Latin American countries want to be rewarded by obtaining better access to large international markets. Achieving a sustainable rapid rate of exports growth, however, will take more than trade agreements. It will also require the governments of the region to implement a series of 'second-generation' reforms aimed at continuously increasing productivity gains. In particular, these new reforms will have to deal with two fundamental problems: outdated labour market legislation and dismal education systems. Labour market legislation is thoroughly antiquated in most Latin American countries (as with so many areas, the pioneer reformer, Chile, is the clear exception), imposing astonishing restrictions to labour mobility. Taxes on employment are high, reaching almost 50 per cent of wages in some countries. Severance payments schemes reduce flexibility, discourage on-the-job training, and discriminate against younger workers. There is now abundant evidence from the rapidly growing economies of east Asia that success in international markets requires flexible labour markets. This allows companies to readjust their use of labour to maximise their competitiveness. But perhaps the most serious aspect of labour relations in Latin America is that public sector unions still exercise a tremendous political influence in many countries - especially in the health and education sectors. They use this influence to obstruct any attempt to introduce accountability, reform their operations and improve the delivery of public services. For example, the Chilean education minister was recently ousted because his plan to improve the dilapidated quality of secondary education was strongly opposed by the vociferous teachers' union. Reforming labour legislation - and 'reinventing' the trade union movement as truly democratic, inclusive and non-confrontational - is one of the most difficult challenges that the countries of Latin America will face in the future. Education reform is another fundamental priority. The limited coverage of Latin American education systems, their lack of emphasis on science and technology, and their generally low quality, stand in the way of improved productivity. A recent World Bank study found that the average quality of primary education in Latin America is dismal. It quoted an international comparative study on reading abilities of nine-year-olds which found that Venezuelan students ranked last out of a sample of 27 countries. Another study among 13-year-olds, carried out in 1992, looked at the quality of science and mathematics education, and found that Brazilian students from Sao Paulo and Fortaleza were outperformed by students from South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Jordan, China, and by every developed country in the sample. Only Mozambican students recorded lower test scores than the Brazilian students. Finally, a 1992 study on mathematics and science education for 13-year-olds in five Latin American countries - Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela - found that, with the exception of elite schools, test performance was in most cases significantly below that of Asian countries such as Thailand. Improving the quality of education will require strengthening management, reallocating education resources, an increase in funding and making teachers accountable - especially to parents. In many cases, it will also mean decentralising education, giving a greater role to the private sector. Teachers should be trained using modern techniques, their skills periodically renewed and their salaries set according to performance. Only if Latin American countries improve the flexibility of their labour markets and performance of their education systems will they systematically be able to expand productivity, accelerate growth and move towards prosperity.

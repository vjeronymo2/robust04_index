			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Modest rise at Aerospace Eng Aerospace Engineering, the precision product manufacturer for the aerospace and electronics industries, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 109,000 to Pounds 127,000 for the six months ended October 31. Turnover was from continuing operations and totalled Pounds 7.72m against Pounds 13.6m last time which took in Pounds 5.03m from discontinued operations. Operating profits for the half year were substantially lower at Pounds 313,000, against Pounds 689,000. The pre-tax figure was helped by a Pounds 50,000 profit on a property disposal and lower interest of Pounds 236,000, compared with Pounds 580,000. Comparatives have been adjusted in accordance with FRS 3. Earnings per share were 0.12p (0.19p) while the interim dividend is maintained at 0.25p. Mr John Davis, chairman, said the pace of recovery was slower than desired and 'consequently the current year continues to be difficult'. He pointed out that the performance in the aerospace sector had been mixed, while within the electronics division, sales of microwave and conventional circuit boards continued to be strongly influenced by the new European GSM market for digital cellular phones.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / US-Australia air dispute worsens MR Bob Collins, Australia's transport minister, yesterday added fuel to an air war between Australia and the US, by accusing US-based Northwest Airlines of falsely reporting passenger loads on flights from Japan, Reuter reports from Canberra. Australia has ordered Northwest this week to cut one of its three New York-Osaka-Sydney flights by June 30, saying Northwest was in breach of an agreement restricting it to a maximum 50 per cent of capacity with passengers from Japan. In a tit-for-tat move, the US ordered Australia's Qantas Airways to withdraw from three of 10 weekly Sydney-Los Angeles non-stop services by the end of June. Mr Collins said figures show Northwest had consistently breached the agreement for flying passengers to Australia. 'The figures show that since Northwest began its three weekly flights in October 1991 up until April 1993, Osaka-Sydney passengers have averaged 75.6 per cent of those on the board,' Mr Collins said in a statement. However a Northwest spokesman said the figures were 'warped' and that Northwest had never claimed to comply with the order because it did not recognise it under a 1952 treaty. Mr Collins also rejected an earlier claim by the airline that it had signed the agreement under duress. Australia argues that Northwest is operating its flights at the expense of Qantas.</p>

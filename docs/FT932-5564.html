			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Nissan chief joins car lobby executive MR IAN GIBSON, chief executive of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is to join the executive committee of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the main UK motor trade association. This paves the way for his possible election to president of the society, the first time that the UK industry would be led by a senior executive of a Japanese manufacturer. The emergence of Nissan in the higher echelons of the main lobbying organisation of the British motor industry is likely to prove controversial among west European car producers, which are campaigning for a tight monitoring regime for Japanese vehicle exports to the European Community. France and Italy in particular insist production from Japanese plants in the UK should be taken into account when the EC and Tokyo negotiate the level of direct Japanese vehicle exports to Europe. The UK government says that there should be no limit on Japanese vehicle production in Europe and that output from Japanese plants in Europe must have free circulation in the EC. Nissan, Honda and Toyota have all located their first European car plants in the UK. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain and a public critic of Japanese involvement in the European motor industry, is to become a vice-president of the society at its annual meeting next week. In evidence to MPs earlier this year Mr McAllister attacked the 'extremely low levels of engineering and manufacturing integration' of the Japanese transplant assembly facilities in Britain. He said Ford was concerned about the 'potential erosion of the UK's manufacturing and technological base which could result from excessive reliance on Japanese transplant factories'. He added: 'Besides creating excess capacity which, given a market of finite size, is likely to displace equivalent jobs in existing producers, and having generally lower local content levels, which displaces jobs at both manufacturers and suppliers, their products and components are wholly designed and developed in Japan and must give rise to real concerns for the UK's technological base.'</p>

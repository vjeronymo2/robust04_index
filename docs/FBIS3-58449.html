In a two-and-a-half-hour talk,  Joerg Haider swore into the "Third Republic" and "our kind of  freedom" over 5,000 party members from all over Austria.    Following a short introduction by Klagenfurt's Deputy Mayor  Reinhart Gaugg, Haider made the situation clear to the euphoric  audience within the first five minutes: "The time of cheerful  election campaigns is over, this is a time of historic  decisions."    Apart from discussing Austria's role in Europe, "the awkward  mental position that our country is in has to be stopped." A  crossroads has been reached: "Either we develop into a society  where everybody has to be a member of either of two parties,  where everybody, starting from school headmaster to lipizzaner  has to have a party membership card, or we go toward a Third  Republic, toward democracy, where the citizens have the say, and  not the parties."    The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] -- "it is giving up and  it  even likes it" -- is conceded a key role by Haider, though: "It  must have the power to say we are no longer prepared to continue  in the present way into a socialist future."    He said that he, himself, had a slight attack of political  weakness; but with the help of his "faithful family, good  friends, and strong assistants" he has again found pleasure in  his job: "I will not be forced down by their hatred, I will not  keep quiet when confronted with their lies, I will not tolerate  the fact that the opinion of the people is increasingly being  ignored -- this is my challenge."    This challenge also means Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, the  head of the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]: The  coming years will be characterized by a "major confrontation"  between Vranitzky and himself, Haider. "The glitter of a yuppy  society is not one of our visions," Haider said.    Haider also emphasized the "enormous difference" between  nationalism and national socialism, and almost warningly he  said: "There is absolutely no point in trying to flirt with the  brown [Nazi] left-overs." Haider went on: "We have to clean up  this country politically." In 1998, at the latest, the "blue  [FPOe] flag of freedom will be flying from the red-and-black  [SPOe-OeVP] strongholds."    He was also quite generous in criticizing the investigations  into the letter-bomb attacks: The special unit established by  Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak is on a "dead track." Haider  accused the government of conducting the investigations in a  manner "hostile to the state," because it creates the impression  abroad that Austria is a country of neo-Nazis.</p>

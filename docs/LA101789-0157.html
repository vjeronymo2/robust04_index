			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> EX-CHAMP ALI URGES BLACK JESUS  </P> <P> Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was quoted today as  saying black Christians should have their own black Jesus.  </P> <P> Ali, in an interview with the Sun, said the traditional portrayal of Jesus,  angels and saints as white was meant to reinforce white supremacy and make  blacks feel inferior.  </P> <P> "The reason is because the whites didn't want their children to see a (black  man) up there on the cross," he added.  </P> <P> "If they continue with their icons, then black people should put up their own  of a black Jesus, black saints and black angels. To them, Jesus is black,  should be black. But to God he is no color."  </P> <P> The Sun quoted a Catholic Church spokesman as saying that he would not take on  Ali in the ring but that he was wrong. "Jesus was Middle Eastern," the  spokesman said.  </P></p>

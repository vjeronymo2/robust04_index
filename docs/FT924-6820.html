			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Union Discount talks to bidder UNION Discount, the troubled discount house group, is in talks with a potential bidder that could lead to the takeover of what is one of the City's oldest independent financial institutions, it was announced yesterday. Cater Allen, London's second biggest discount house behind Gerrard &amp; National, was strongly tipped yesterday as the potential bidder. The company, which already owns nearly 3 per cent of Union's shares, refused comment. The terse announcement from Union that it was in the 'very preliminary stages of discussions which may or may not lead to an offer being made' was prompted by a leap in the group's shares. They ended at 71p, up 10p on the day, compared with a peak two years ago of 500p. Union, one of a shrinking band of discount houses, which play a pivotal role in the Bank of England's dealings with the money markets, has been brought low in recent years by a disastrous move into leasing and property lending. Its ill-fated diversification stemmed from the mid-1980s when, along with other City specialists, it tried to move into a wider range of activities to reduce its reliance on its core business. Leasing was responsible for losses of Pounds 5.7m in the first half of the year, out of a total of Pounds 14.8m, with the core discount house business returning a loss of Pounds 4m. The group was forced to take on substantial property interests after a loan to a property company went bad. It finally sold an Edinburgh property, known as Apex 123, for Pounds 15.5m two weeks ago at a loss of nearly Pounds 1m. Discount house shares jumped a week ago as the market digested the impact of September's upheaval in financial markets on the results of King &amp; Shaxson, another specialist money market dealer. However, the reorganisation at Union, under way since Mr George Blunden took over as chief executive earlier this year, is believed to have led it to take a cautious approach to the markets. As a result, it is thought to have benefited far less from the market upheaval than its rivals. Mr David White, deputy chairman of Cater Allen, which announces results today, said yesterday: 'We're not making any statement. It's been suggested on one or two occasions in the past, and we didn't make any statement then either.'</p>

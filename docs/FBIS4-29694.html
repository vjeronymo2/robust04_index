			<p>CSO     [Text] Kansai Electric Power has completed the  next-generation energy residence, "The Horone," and, with solar  batteries and storage batteries installed, has begun  corroborative testing. It is an all-electric residence designed  with a coffee shop on the first floor and so that a family of  four can live on the second floor, and Kansai Electric Power  will verify efficient use of energy incorporating solar  batteries, an electric storage and heat storage system, and a  reverse current system. The New Energy Development Organization  (NEDO) has been commissioned for the corroborative tests and  will continue them for a year jointly with the Electric Power  Central Research Institute. The first floor of the building is  scheduled to be affranchised as a coffee shop.    The output of the solar batteries will be a maximum of 4  kilowatts. All the electric power used in the daytime cannot be  supplied by solar batteries, but it serves to reduce the peak  load. Electricity is stored in storage batteries using  relatively cheap late night power, hot water heat and cold heat  are stored in a heat storage tank, and used in air conditioning  and heating during the day.    This equipment is controlled by an independent energy  management system, which forecasts power load by anticipating  the next day's weather and family activity schedule and  automatically selects the most appropriate use of solar  batteries and storage batteries.</p>

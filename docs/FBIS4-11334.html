			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Maria Elena Gil: "To Consolidate a </F> Space in the Caribbean"]    [Text] [No dateline as received] April signaled a high  point in Cuba's foreign policy in the Caribbean. The  establishment of an embassy for the Eastern Caribbean in  Barbados, the normalization of diplomatic relations with  Grenada, and the establishment of ties with Antigua and Barbuda  helped to close Cuba's diplomatic circle with its closest  neighbors.    After years of mutual indifference, Cuba and the Lesser  Antilles began to pay more attention to each other this decade  as a result of the debacle in the socialist camp and the former  Soviet Union and the formation of large trade blocs, two events  that severely affected the foreign trade of many countries.    Deprived of 85 percent of its trade, which consisted of  barter agreements and other beneficial agreements with the USSR  and the rest of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe,  Havana saw the need to promote trade on a lesser scale but with  a greater variety of Latin American and Caribbean countries.    In fact, relations with the Caribbean Common Market  (Caricom)  date back to the late seventies. Through agreements with this  regional integration organization, hundreds of students from the  English-speaking islands studied at Cuban universities.    A particular thread of persuasions make up the web of  relationships between Cuba and the Anglo-Caribbean, a region  that gave ample proof of its independent spirit when four of its  most important members -- Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica,  and Barbados -- established ties with the island in the 1960's  and 1970's, during the full enforcement of the OAS prohibition  -- instigated by the United States -- that mandated the  diplomatic isolation of Cuba in the hemisphere.    In bilateral issues, the Caribbean nations were usually  cautious and exhibited their well-known British phlegmatic  nature -- a product of their colonial heritage -- before  establishing ties beyond formalities, at international forums  the Antillean group always voted with Cuba.    Subjects such as the defense of the Caribbean as a peace  zone, condemnation of the use of force anywhere in the world,  apartheid in South Africa, and [support for] independence  movements, united the Spanish and English-speaking Antilles into  a single bloc.    On a strictly economic plane, it became obvious Cuba needed  to join Caricom, which procrastinated implementing its own  decisions for full integration, something that even today lacks  a solid basis: free trade, a common currency, and the freedom to  travel and to contract labor from among the member states.    Some of the smaller states' prevalent fear of a presumed  overwhelming predominance of Cuba over the members of the  Anglo-Caribbean community gave way to a spirit of cooperation,  once it was proven that one side needed regional integration as  much as the other.    Although Cuba has twice as much territory and people as all  of the Caricom countries combined, it is struggling through an  economic and financial crisis that forces it to expand as soon  as possible into markets by offering its products and services  for which, especially in biotechnology and medicine, there is  still room in the Caribbean.    In addition, an initial obstacle -- how countries which  traditionally depend on tourism as a source of income could deal  with the take-off of the Cuban tourist trade -- was solved by  the admission of Cuba into the Caribbean Tourism Organization  (CTO).    Wisely, the smaller tourist island paradises in the region  --  Jamaica and the Bahamas taking the lead -- decided to share  instead of compete against Cuba, when faced with the  irreversible reality of the future rebirth of the Pearl of the  Caribbean as the area's preferred vacation spot.    Branwell Shepherd, a Jamaican businessman whose  Salasaventura  travel agency has a multi-destination tourism program with the  island, told PRENSA LATINA that "once the U.S. blockade against  the Cuban Government is lifted, the influx of U.S. tourists will  be unstoppable."    Under these circumstances, said Shepherd, the rest of the  Caribbean nations must be willing to reach mutually beneficial  agreements with Cuba, instead of lamenting over something that  is inevitable.    Sources at the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples  (ICAP), which handles most of the donations received by Cuba,  revealed that 50 percent of the donations received in 1993 came  from the Caribbean countries.    "We have raised our voice many times in defense of the  smaller countries' right to exist, and have expressed our  opinion at international forums. However, we have sometimes  neglected our relationship with the Lesser Antilles, our closest  neighbors, and this is now one of our most important political  priorities," Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA  last November during his tour of seven nations in the area.</p>

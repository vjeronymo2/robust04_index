			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deputy Minister of Defense for Rear </F> Services--Chief of Rear Services for the Armed Forces of Ukraine  Colonel-General Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko: "Answering for the  Vital Activity of the Troops"]    [Text] The maintenance of high combat readiness and the  necessary level of military discipline and organization in  formations and units is directly connected with the full and  timely satisfaction of the everyday material requirements of the  personnel. The necessary material base for the resolution of  these tasks exists within the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and it  must be constantly maintained in a viable state.    It is very hard to do that under contemporary conditions,  however, since the decline in production in the state is having  a negative effect on logistical supply for the troops as well.    Resolution of questions of rear support is becoming more and  more difficult owing to the limited financing of the Army. The  funds allocated do not provide for even the vital needs of the  troops. The indebtedness to enterprises and late payments for  the receipt of materials are leading to cutbacks in the output  of products that are needed by the Armed Forces. The Ministry of  Defense is squandering the industrial capacity of enterprises  that were created over many years, and it will be very difficult  to restore it.    A significant quantity of food products is being received  from suppliers without payment, as a consequence of which the  indebtedness of the Armed Forces is increasing. The suppliers  are in turn imposing penalties that total more than four billion  karbovantsi a day. And who is suffering the losses? The Armed  Forces once again! Funds cannot be allocated in this case for  the development of the material base of the troops or improving  the social conditions of the servicemen. The suppliers of  Kharkiv, Poltava, Luhansk and Chernihivsk oblasts are refusing  to supply the troops with meat, eggs and other foodstuffs. The  food reserves at central and district warehouses have decreased  sharply, which is leading in turn to disruptions in the supply  of foodstuffs to the personnel in accordance with established  supply norms. We thus see the way out for the resolution of the  tasks that face the rear services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  in the arrangement of logistical support for the troops with  food, mat&eacute;riel, fuels, medical equipment and medicines,  and  the resolution of a whole set of social problems that touch on  the interests of all categories of servicemen.    The leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, under these  difficult conditions, is taking every step with regard to  improving the supply of foodstuffs to the servicemen. Tobacco  products have been issued to the conscript servicemen as of 1  January 1994. Those who do not smoke are permitted to receive  monetary compensation in the amount of the value of the  corresponding class of cigarettes.    Concern for quality food for the servicemen is constantly at  the center of attention of the rear-support command at all  levels. The food is prepared in tasty and varied fashion in most  of the mess halls of military units.    A corresponding program is being developed with the aim of  further improvements in the organization of food, which provides  in particular for:    --the establishment of a unified day for the food service in  the Armed Forces of Ukraine (the second Wednesday of each  month). The monitored demonstration preparation of food,  exchange of experience in the preparation of various dishes,  especially Ukrainian cuisine, and the exhibition of dishes and  confectionery and flour items are all performed on that day;    --the model upkeep of mess halls, a rise in the standards  for  eating and the straightening out of the schedule of mess hall  operation;    --expansion of the assortment in the preparation of dishes,  so that dishes are not repeated more than twice in a week;  cutlets, meat patties and schnitzels are prepared no less than  two or three times; flour items are baked one or two times;    --a competitive inspection is conducted every year for the  best soldiers', sailors' and cadets' mess halls in garrisons,  formations, large units and military districts of the branches  of the Armed Forces of Ukraine;    --radical improvement in the training and placement of  cadres  in the food service. Only officers who have special education  are to be named to the positions of chief of the service, and  chiefs of the food service and mess halls are to be released  from all types of details;    --the salary of the chiefs of mess halls are set at grade 9;  the most responsible and conscientious warrant officers are to  be named to that position;    --the certification of the culinary personnel of military  mess halls by commissions of the military units is performed  twice a year after the training periods. Up to 50 percent of the  standard quantity of cooks may be women who have a motherly  attitude toward the soldiers and prepare dishes with higher  quality;    --increased everyday monitoring of the completeness of the  issue of food and the reaching of stipulated consumption norms  for the personnel. Every military mess hall shall equip a  monitoring corner in a suitable manner for this purpose. The  deputy commanders of units for rear support will conduct a  session with the supervisory personnel and rear-support  employees once every quarter with regard to monitoring the  organization of food and the preparation of dishes;    --the development and entry into force of the "Uniform  Requirements for the Organization and Upkeep of Military Mess  Halls" and the "Instructions for Monitoring Military Catering."    I would like to direct your attention herein to the fact  that  notwithstanding all of the difficulties, our conscript  servicemen are not eating all that badly. They receive 200 grams  of meat, 100 grams of fish, 100 grams of milk, 30 grams of  cream, 70 grams of sugar, 750 grams of bread, 900 grams of  vegetables and potatoes a day, and four eggs a week and other  foods as well.    Proper eating plays a large role in improving health care.  All of the medical treatment facilities are for that reason  supplied with fish, milk and dairy products, fresh vegetables  and fruits, pork, meat from livestock and poultry first and  foremost.    A vivid demonstration of the concern of the state for its  protectors is the fulfillment of the Law of Ukraine "The Social  and Legal Protection of Servicemen and the Members of Their  Families." The institution of the issue of a food ration also  testifies to this. The rear support for the Armed Forces is  making no small effort to fulfill that task, launching  broad-scale work on military sovkhozes and the subsidiary plots  of units. The food obtained thereby goes for the consumption of  the troops. Real improvements in food supply for the servicemen,  however, requires continuous and regular financing first of all.  We are thankful to the many representatives of the President and  the heads of the local industrial enterprises who are assisting  us with the provision of dishes and mess hall equipment and its  repair.    The enterprises of military trade play a large role in  improving the food situation. Fresh vegetables and fruits and  confectionery items are being found in the solders' pots first  and foremost.    The summer trade of cold drinks and frozen and baked items  will be organized at all military compounds as of May 1.    The medical service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is  working  on improving medical support for servicemen. A new standard  organizational structure is being instituted in the hospitals,  which provides for the offering of specialized medical  assistance. The possibility is being considered of offering it  to the members of the families of servicemen and employees of  the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The existing method of research for  flight medical evaluations is being reviewed, and fundamentally  new approaches to the individual assessment of the state of  health, psycho-physiological condition of pilots and specialists  of the flight operations control groups for each flight shift  are being developed. A database for all personnel is being  created under the program of medical support.    The physical plant of the service is also being developed.  The construction of treatment wings at military hospitals  located in Kovel, Kharkiv and Odessa is underway, along with  diagnostic wings at Vinnytsya and Rivne. A great deal of  attention is being paid to improving health-resort treatment.  The construction of a diagnostics and treatment center at the  Shklo military sanatorium is continuing for that purpose, along  with overnight wings at the Truskavetskyy and Yevpatoriya  children's sanatoria and a mess hall for 1,000 at the Frunzenske  sanatorium.    The medical personnel are also putting a great deal of  effort  into providing the military infirmaries, hospitals and sanatoria  with medicines and medical mat&eacute;riel, and acquiring new  diagnostics and treatment apparatus. The insufficient funding,  however, is impeding the resolution of those tasks.    As vexing as it may be to talk about, the bath and laundry  support for the troops has worsened considerably of late. The  units and institutions have nothing with which to pay off the  bath and laundry enterprises. And they have too few funds to  obtain detergents and equipment, or for the prompt payment of  wages to their employees or to pay for municipal services. But  what is more, the Armed Forces are indebted for more than 50  billion karbovantsi to the enterprises of light industry for  mat&eacute;riel received. The conscript servicemen are already  wearing out their uniforms, but the mills have not even been  paid for them yet.    The lack of funds makes it impossible to reach agreements  with enterprises for the manufacture of mat&eacute;riel for 1994,  although four months have already passed. The availability of  some types of mat&eacute;riel at warehouses makes it possible to  supply only the spring draft of young replacements and to shift  to the wearing of summer dress.    The military uniform has always been one of the most  important attributes of armed formations.    It can be reported today with all certainty that the new  uniforms for the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been created and  are being introduced.    They will be manufactured in the first half of this year for  graduates of military institutes and schools, and for generals  and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of  Defense. The capabilities of the textile mills and combines to  sew the uniforms for military trade provide for the sewing of  new uniforms for other categories of servicemen as well. The  lack of funds for the procurement of measured material, however,  is unfortunately restraining this process.    The papakhas for the colonels have been left thanks to a  host  of requests. It is, after all, a long historical tradition of  the Ukrainian Cossacks, and its replacement would have a  negative effect not only on the servicemen, but on other  segments of the population as well, as was indicated  unequivocably in the mass media. Many complaints were received  from some superior officers and servicemen with regard to the  introduction of leather overcoats for generals. I assure you  that the sewing of leather overcoat for generals is done only by  request and only for a fee.    A series of measures is being instituted to improve the  military uniform of cadets, which is, by the way, as close as  possible to an officer's. They will be issued everyday uniforms  in camouflage coloring as of 1 September 1994. Changes have also  been made in the insignia. A new brass buckle is being developed  in place of the "claw" buckle.    Shoes with high shins are being issued to conscript  servicemen instead of the canvas high-tops. The overcoats are  being replaced by a jacket from cape fabric, and the parade and  open jackets with a dress jacket.    The discharge of conscript servicemen into the reserves at  their request is permitted in parade dress, everyday field  uniform that they are wearing or, in special cases, in civilian  dress.    Servicemen who are entering service under contract in the  positions of soldier or sergeant are provided only with the  items of the field uniform according to the season during the  trial period.    The rear support of the Armed Forces is taking a series of  measures to improve the municipal-services support for  servicemen in extended service. The use of military bathhouses  and the services of the military unit support services combines  is permitted for them and the members of their families, as well  as hair cutting at non-regulation barber shops.    A very difficult situation has taken shape surrounding the  provision of the troops with fuels and lubricants. The lack of  funds for the procurement of the necessary quantity of fuel is  reducing the training of flight personnel and drivers, which is  having a negative effect on the combat readiness of the troops.  Air defense units stationed a distance of 10--15 km or more from  populated areas do not even have enough fuel to take the  children to school, or the servicemen to their service locations.    Another problem must also be kept in mind--200 various types  of fuels and lubricants are employed in the military hardware of  the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More than 150 of those types are  not manufactured at the enterprises of Ukraine. The State  Committee of Ukraine for Oil and Gas has refused to supply us  with them for the last two years. The supply of fuels and  lubricants has improved somewhat thanks to repeated appeals by  the Ministry of Defense to the Cabinet of Ministers. The  Ukrnaftoprodukt Association is ready to assume the entire  obligation of providing the Armed Forces with fuels and  lubricants. The ultimate resolution of this issue, however,  depends on the availability of funds that the Ministry of  Defense does not have at this time...    We are collecting funds in karbovantsi under these difficult  conditions so as to at least somehow support the vital activity  of the troops. We are leasing empty tank capacity, arranging the  output of lubricants using our own manpower, and obtaining fuel  through barter transactions. These measures, however, cover only  a paltry portion of requirements, and are not solving the  problem. Orders and directives have moreover been sent to the  troops along with recommendations on restricting the consumption  of fuels, economizing them, making widespread use of simulators,  and various types of reductions in the number of trucks in the  transport groups.    There are already tight restrictions on the use of passenger  cars. Limits have been introduced for the expenditure of fuels  and the service lives of motors, and an efficient system of  centralized shipment of cargo is being developed. The system of  logistical support is being reviewed so as to reduce the  distance of shipment of cargo and the consumption of fuel, and  new storage areas are being created at the bases of troop that  are subject to disbanding, along with other measures.    Hasty and poorly thought-out decisions are having negative  consequences in many cases. The commercialization of military  trade is an example of this. The sale and leasing of those  enterprises and stores has caused large losses, turning military  trade from profitable into beggarly. Only thanks to the  considerable efforts of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and  Edict No. 41/94 of the President of Ukraine of 10 February 1994  has this campaign been halted for the social protection of the  servicemen, first and foremost the conscript servicemen, as well  as to improve the trade and domestic support for the troops,  especially those at remote or closed locations.    The leaders of military trade, notwithstanding all of the  difficulties, have resolved the task of seeking out the goods of  prime necessity, starting with sewing needles and ending with  complex technical groups of goods. It is worth noting that most  of the collectives have met their targets for the trade and  domestic support of military formations.    The difficult situation has also had an effect on the  provision of servicemen in the Air Forces and the Air Defense  Forces with everything they need. The rear services have been  occupied there only with supporting flights and combat  readiness, while the question of material and domestic support  has always been relegated to the background. Two groups of  rear-support specialists of the Armed Forces have been created  today that are studying the actual circumstances of those  troops, and are taking steps to improve the living and domestic  conditions of servicemen and provide them with the necessary  mat&eacute;riel.    The rear-services inspectorate of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine  is working intensively. The theft of the people's property has  been curtailed thanks to its resolute and principled work, and  funds have been supplemented at the expense of those guilty of  waste, shortages and abuses. A number of officials guilty of  abuses of their official positions and excessive spending have  been relieved of their duties, and the criminal cases have been  turned over to the military procuracy.    The central bodies of the rear support for the Armed Forces  of Ukraine are staffed by highly qualified officers who are  capable of organizing the rear support for the troops.    I say to the parents of the servicemen not to worry about  your sons. We can assure you that there will be no disruptions  in food supply, medical care and the provision of  mat&eacute;riel.  If there are problems in some places with questions of  logistical support or complaints regarding the poor quality of  the food, we ask you to write to the address 252063, city  of Kiev, Dehtyarivska St., Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine  for Rear Services--Chief of Rear Services for the Armed Forces  of Ukraine. Or telephone at (044) 213-72-61.    I promise that immediate steps to end those problems and  improve the state of affairs will be undertaken.    I appeal to the leaders of local authorities at all levels  to  find an opportunity to allocate plots of land to servicemen for  their own gardening activity, so that they will be able to  provide their families with potatoes and vegetables.    The heads of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes of military units  are ready to provide accommodations and assistance in equipping  stores for the sale of their products at military  compounds--milk, meat, eggs, vegetables--which will be mutually  advantageous for both parties. We have agreed to take into the  Agriculture Directorate of Rear Services for the Armed Forces  the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that have lost faith in their  existence. Assistance will be granted on our part.    The leaders of the Ministry of Defense and Rear Services for  the Armed Forces of Ukraine are working nonstop. A constant  search is underway, as can be seen, for ways of solving complex  problems, increasing the maneuverability and steadfastness of  support and service units, and finding sources of extrabudgetary  financing for the measures being pursued in the Armed Forces.    I would like to emphasize, in summing up the aforementioned,  that the complexity of the problems that have arisen cannot  diminish our perseverance in the cause of building the Armed  Forces of an independent Ukraine.</p>

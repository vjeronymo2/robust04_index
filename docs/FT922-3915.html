			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Liberty board contests Concerto Capital plans THE BOARD of Liberty has thrown its unanimous weight against the proposals of Concerto Capital Corporation, the vehicle of South Africa's Myerson family, to change the fashion retailer's share structure - 'to enfranchise every shareholder', in the words of Mr Brian Myerson. In a circular ahead of the extraordinary meeting on June 26 requisitioned by Mr Myerson, Liberty directors said Concerto's proposals would not enhance the marketability of Liberty shares. They reminded shareholders that the ordinary shares had outperformed the FT-A Stores index by 147 per cent and the FT-A All-Share index by 131 per cent since Mr Harry Weblin became chairman in August 1984. In the same period earnings per share and dividends had grown by an average compound rate of about 20 per cent per year. Mr John Pugh, finance director, said the board 'was confident of support'. Mr Myerson said Concerto would be issuing a rebuttal of the company's points. He contended that the figures were misleading because of the rise in the share price since Concerto bought its 15.03 per cent stake of the voting shares from the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. He also said that, if taken over a five year period, dividend cover had declined from 5 to 2.9 times and earnings per share had fallen from 21p to 20.77p. The circular 'fudged the enfranchisement issue,' he claimed. Currently the 'inner' Stewart-Liberty family has 35 per cent of the voting rights and the 'wider' Blackmore and Moffatt families between 15 and 20 per cent. Liberty's share structure is 70 per cent voting and 30 per cent non-voting. Mr Myerson's proposals include the sub-division of the non-voting shares with half given voting rights. Ordinary shareholders would be compensated by a 1-for-2 scrip issue. Liberty said that this creation of three different classes of shares would lead to a reduction in investment interest.</p>

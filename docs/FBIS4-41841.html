			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The third hostage drama which  took place in the southern Russian city of Mineralnyye Vody over  the last six months ended successfully on Wednesday morning and  was the shortest among the three.    Two days after police announced a major crack-down on crime,  three gunmen seized a bus with some 40 hostages heading for the  southern city of Stavropol and demanded two helicopters and 5.8  billion US dollars.    The drama began at 16.00 hours Moscow time (13.00 GMT) and  ended early next morning.    The hostage-takers were seized in the rebel Russian republic  of Chechnya and the ransom retrieved. All hostages were safely  freed. This was the shortest drama. The first one which took  place last December 23 continued for four days, the second one  lasted 24 hours.    All the three had practically the same scenario. A bus with  hostages was seized, terrorists demanded a multi-million dollar  ransom, guns and drugs and tried to escape on a helicopter  somewhere in the mountains, preferably in Chechnya where crime  rate is extremely high.    All the three times the terrorists were seized, hostages  freed and ransom retrieved.    It is noteworthy that terrorists are no longer hijacking  planes abroad as it used to happen in Soviet years, but prefer  to remain in Russia with huge amounts of hard currency.    Russian commandos fighting terrorists had also changed their  manner of action. In Soviet years they did everything possible  to prevent a hijacked plane from crossing the border. Thus,  nine passengers were killed and the plane completely destroyed  when commandos stormed a hijacked craft in March 1988 which  landed in St. Petersburg for refuelling.    After the tragedy the anti-terrorist groups focused mostly  on  saving the lives of hostages rather than seizing terrorists.  However, this might have made terrorists no longer fear resolute  actions against them.    The three hostage dramas clearly show a new tendency in the  Russian crime record. It is also evident that the failure of  terrorists to escape does not stop their successors. Hardly  anyone can say for sure that the Mineralnyye Vody airport would  not face yet another hostage drama in future.</p>

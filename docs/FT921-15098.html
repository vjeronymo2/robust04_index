			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (1): UK companies are the big winners - The absence, this year, of the currency factor means that moves up and down the rankings are more 'genuine' than ever before THIS year's FT500 is a historic one: by its date of compilation, September 30, 1991, almost all the big European economies were linked by formal or de facto membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System. So for the first time in the FT500's history, the factors which decide whether companies move up and down the rankings largely exclude the currency factor which has been such an overwhelming influence in the past. The FT500 ranks companies by stock market value (that is, shares outstanding times share price). It therefore avoids the differences between national accounting standards that bedevil rankings based on profitability; and avoids the inconsistencies between industries that bedevil rankings by revenues. Of course, such a listing can only include publicly-quoted companies. Those economies where there are many large privately-owned industrial empires (such as Germany) or those where the state controls significant corporate power (such as France or Italy) are under-represented. The FT500 is a snapshot of the relative values investors put on Europe's big publicly-traded companies - rather than an overview of industry as a whole. The absence, this year, of the currency factor means that moves up and down the rankings are more 'genuine' than ever before: they represent true changes in the values attached to individual companies' businesses rather than the pattern of exchange rates at the moment the survey was taken. No individual company is ever able to throw off the influence of its domestic stock market. Thus, in a snapshot taken as the UK market reached a peak in September this year, UK companies are the big winners at the very top of the list. In this year's top 10, for example, Glaxo and British Gas all move up in ranking, as does the partly-British Unilever. Another Anglo-Dutch company, Royal Dutch/Shell handsomely retains its lead at the top of the rankings. It is not surprising that Anglo-Dutch companies did well: the UK (with the FT-SE index up 10.4 per cent in the period since the last FT500 cut-off date at the end of June 1990) and the Netherlands (where the market index was up 3.4 per cent) were the only two of the leading European markets to show a rise. Others fell, some sharply: Italy was down 28.5 per cent, Germany 14.5 per cent and France down 7.6 per cent. The 15-month period used on this occasion reflects the desire to make the FT500 more up to date at the time of publication. Stock market performances during the period contrast markedly with the results in the 12 months to September 1991 shown above. Nonetheless, the rise from 10th to third in the rankings of Glaxo Holdings of the UK represents a significant shift in the market's valuation of the company itself. In Italy, the weakest major stock market during the period, the biggest casualties included two of the country's biggest industrial stocks, Olivetti (down in rank from 178 to 375) and Compagnie Industriali Riunite (down from 207 to 435). They have another factor in common: they are both run by Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian entrepreneur, whose magic touch has deserted him for the moment. In last year's FT500, the big news was the way in which German companies had at last started to use takeovers as a way to gain size and climb up the rankings. This time, German takeovers were again in the news. Germany has yet to see a successful hostile takeover bid, but 1991's developments demonstrated a variation: the hostile but ostensibly 'friendly' takeover bid. Pirelli's attempt to push Continental, the German tyre-maker, into a merger was clearly failing before the end of the FT500's cut-off period. The performance of the various Pirelli entities in the FT500 - Pirelli Internationale fell from 269 to 333 in the ranking, and Pirelli SpA fell from to 257 to 362 - was an augury of Pirelli's decision to abandon the bid last December. Of those industry sectors which contain more than a handful of companies, four in particular stand out for strong performance. The 10 diversified manufacturing companies which featured in this ranking and last year's rose an average of 44 places; the 10 drugs companies rose 24 places on average; the 16 food processing companies rose 11 places; and the 22 electricity and water utilities (a sector with a heavy UK bias) rose six places on average. The biggest loser among sizeable sectors was diversified holding companies, a group with 28 members and an average drop in the rankings of 39 places. Other poor performers were the 20 building materials companies, which dropped 29 places on average. State-owned companies that have 25 per cent of their shares in the hands of the public are now eligible for inclusion in the FT500, a change from the previously required figure of 30 per cent. This brings a number of big French groups into the rankings, such as the French insurer UAP (ranked 52). Austria's state oil company OeMV comes in at 288 and in Germany, Lufthansa comes in at 188. A similar change of ruling applies to subsidiaries of big groups as long as 25 per cent of stock is in the hands of outside shareholders. Thus Allianz Lebensversicherung, the life insurance arm of the bigger Allianz Holding group (ranked 6th) comes in at 104. One of Sweden's key Wallenberg holding companies, Incentive, joins at 232. Gemina, the Fiat-controlled financial services group, comes in at 286. Other joiners include the TF1 television channel in France (348), controlled by the Bouygues construction group; Italy's family-controlled property group Italmobiliare (107); and the UK electricity utilities, privatised during the period. Some companies joined by virtue of growth: Sims Food Group, a little-known but rapidly growing British meat supplier, came in at 330. Two companies still in a nascent state, Eurotunnel and Euro Disneyland, both did well. Euro Disneyland, which opens this spring, rose from 159 to 121, and is valued at nearly Dollars 4bn. There were a number of other notable performances. The list of big gainers was dominated by UK companies, including the specialist materials group Courtaulds, which rose more than 50 places (from 205 to 152) in spite of the recession. Willis Corroon, the insurance broker formed by a merger between the UK's Willis Faber and the US's Corroon &amp; Black, rose from 431 to 224. A few of the biggest losers were also British. Asda, the food retailer, dropped from 217 to 461. Racal Electronics dropped from 96 to 351, thanks to demerger of its Vodafone cellular phone subsidiary, which joined the rankings at 65. As in earlier years, a number of famous names disappeared from the list. Swiss chocolate-maker Jacobs Suchard (formerly 125th) has dropped from the rankings after its takeover by Philip Morris. Italy's Montedison has left and come back again: the original company, formerly ranked 140th, was merged into Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria. That company then changed its name, to Montedison, and is ranked 231. There were two notable disappearances in the UK. STC, formerly number 202, sold its ICL subsidiary to Fujitsu in November 1990 then sold itself to Canada's Northern Telecom and vanished from the rankings. And Polly Peck International, which was ranked as high as 158th in last year's lists, is now in administration, with its shares suspended.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    US DOLLARS EXCHANGE RATES (MONTHLY AVERAGES SEPT 1991 &amp; JUNE 1990)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Currency                         1991       1990      % change Austrian Schilling            11.9240    11.8390          0.72 Belgian Franc                 34.9100    34.5800          0.95 Danish Kroner                  6.5465     6.4036          2.23 Finnish Markka                 4.1285     3.9531          4.44 French Franc                   5.7668     5.6602          1.88 German Mark                    1.6944     1.6829          0.68 Irish Punt                     0.6338     0.6275          1.00 Italian Lira                1267.2800  1235.0900          2.61 Luxembourg Franc              34.9100 Netherlands Guilder            1.9095     1.8936          0.84 Norwegian Kroner               6.6301     6.4669          2.52 Portuguese Escudo            145.0800   147.9100         -1.91 Spanish Peseta               106.3200   103.8800          2.35 Swedish Kronor                 6.1685     6.0833          1.40 Swiss Franc                    1.4809     1.4248          3.94 UK Sterling                    0.5795     0.5844         -0.84  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      500 CAPITALISATION BY COUNTRY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Dollars m United Kingdom              737978.895 Germany                     251129.258 France                      224065.100 Switzerland                 115235.700 Netherlands/UK               94216.100 Spain                        83840.300 Italy                        80102.600 Sweden                       72741.700 Netherlands                  41383.600 Belgium                      40207.700 Denmark                      23975.800 Norway                       13510.100 Sweden/Switzerland           10543.600 Austria                       7200.000 Ireland                       6136.900 Finland                       5720.100 United Kingdom/France         4899.100 Luxembourg                    4615.500 Belgium/Netherlands           2942.700 Portugal                       953.500  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

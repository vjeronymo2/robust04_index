			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: A Modernist of east and west - The work of Fumihiko Maki, winner of the Pritzker Prize He has been described as a 'New Modernist'; he is famous for his loud and frequent laughter; his architecture is thought by some to be in the realm of transcendental materialism; and today he joins the small band of architects to win the Pritzker Prize. Fumihiko Maki is an architect who is often seen as bridging the cultures of east and west because he was born in Japan in 1928 and from 1953 has spent a large part of his career in the US. This coveted prize is often described as the Nobel prize for architecture. It was the brainchild of Jay A. Pritzker, the president of the Hyatt Foundation, and it has been presented annually since 1979. It is generous - Dollars 100,000 - and the presentation ceremonies have been held at important architectural locations all over the world. The jury is international but inevitably there is a strong transatlantic flavour to the award. The list of laureates is interesting: Philip Johnson; Luis Barragan; James Stirling; Kevin Roche; IM Pei; Richard Meier; Hans Hollein; Gottfried Boehm; Kenzo Tange; Gordon Bunshaft with Oscar Neimeyer; Frank Gehry; Aldo Rossi; Robert Venturi; and Aalvaro Siza. Seven of the winners have been American and many more are prominent in the academic world of architecture which has a strong leaning towards the American schools. There is, I think, a feeling that the award should mark the whole career of the architect and so it is inevitable that it should have a certain predeliction for the masters of the modern movement and their immediate heirs. This year the jury states its view of Maki very clearly: 'He is a modernist who has fused the best of both eastern and western cultures to create an architecture representing the age old qualities of his native country while at the same time juxtaposing contemporary construction methods and materials . . . Maki has expressed his constant concern for the 'parts' and the 'whole' describing one of his goals as achieving a dynamic equilibrium that includes sometimes conflicting masses, volumes and materials. He uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of his design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses precise detailing to give his structures rhythm and scale.' Maki's buildings are not as well known in Europe as they are on the American/Japanese architectural axis. His major works are all in Japan, although he is now designing major office buildings in Munich and has a number of commissions in the US. He is, curiously, very famous for not winning the competition for the major new Getty museum in Los Angeles: his entry was much favoured by many members of that jury. An important visual arts centre project by Maki is currently under construction, which is literally on top of the Moscone Convention Centre in the Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco. As a student Maki was much influenced by the Bauhaus and after studying at the Harvard School of Design he worked for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in New York. When he returned to Japan in 1965 he became a founding member of a group that called themselves 'The Metabolists' . They had a terrifying philosophy of creating the largest possible megastructures as the solution to urban architectural problems. Their ideas embraced technology and vastness of scale as natural bedfellows and sometimes the results were built in Japan. The great Harumi apartment block designed by Kunio Maekawa is one of largest concrete framed blocks of flats, and it was admired by the Metabolists for the way it fitted hundreds of little traditional Japanese houses into a Corbusian block. Kikutake's Sea City and Tange's plan for a megastructure for the whole of Tokyo Bay were the most extreme examples. Many of the Metabolist's ideas were taken up by mad groups like Archigram in England or Paolo Soleri's collectives in Arizona. Today it all has a sad period feel and Metabolism is rightly seen as a dire example of a modern architectural megalomania. Maki clearly recovered from this moment of madness and in his famous Hillside Terrace apartments in Tokyo he demonstrates successfully the virtues of small-scale town planning. I saw recently his Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, which is a giant of a building but has a strange, anthropomorphic presence that is very powerful. His Spiral Building, which is part of the Wacoal Arts Centre in Tokyo, has an elegance and an invisible mastery of technology that is masterful. I particularly enjoyed the games he plays with the language of modernism in the Tepia Science Centre in Tokyo full of refences to De Stijl and reinterpretations of the dead language of cubism. The greatest influence on Maki is probably the late work of Eero Saarinen in the US. Both architects have the same fascination with new shapes and a certain clarity combined with innovation when it comes to structure. Contemporary Japanese architecture is not specifically eastern or western and I feel it is wrong to think of architects like Maki as important cultural 'bridges'. Architecture in Japan is undoubtedly contemporary but in a more timeless way than fashionable contemporary western architecture. Maki does for architecture what Japanese manufacturing has done for cars and electronics. He makes technology and structure work for the user; and so his architecture remains cool and often elegant as a setting for modern life. His best buildings have a quality of stability that is very rare and rewarding in modern architecture.</p>

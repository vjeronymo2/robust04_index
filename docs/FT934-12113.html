			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Black cabs at risk in licensing review THE black taxi cab, a familiar symbol of London around the world, could disappear as a result of a government review of taxis and minicab legislation, announced yesterday. Mr Steven Norris, a junior transport minister, called for the views of taxi users, drivers' organisations and others as part of a review of taxi and minicab legislation, much of it more than 100 years old. 'The law on taxis and private hire vehicles (minicabs) is a mess,' he said. 'It is antiquated, complicated, difficult to understand and enforce and totally unsatisfactory.' He called for an end to 'outdated or unnecessary controls.' The government is proud of the regulations, which have meant that the most modern taxis are accessible to people in wheelchairs. But the complete removal of all restrictions on the type of vehicle that can be used as a taxi cab is one of several options in a green paper published yesterday. A casualty of the review could be The Knowledge, the mental map of London's streets that taxi drivers in the capital often spend three years acquiring. The government questions whether drivers' knowledge needs to be so exhaustive. One of the main issues to be looked at under the review will be whether taxis and minicabs should continue to be licensed separately. The distinction between the two has become increasingly blurred. The different rules governing the two types of vehicle have been a source of anger, particularly for taxi drivers, who have more onerous regulations. One option is for the regime in place in London, where taxis and their drivers are tightly controlled but minicabs are subject to minimum regulation, to be extended to the rest of the country. Another is for the system operating in the provinces, where minicabs are more tightly controlled, to be brought into London. Mr Norris said the government had not made up its mind which system to adopt but the green paper declares a preference for a single regime to cover England and Wales. The review will also look at the special design of licensed taxis, the need for identification marks on minicabs, standards of driver fitness and the need for limits on the number of licences issued.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mixed signals on house prices Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said house prices rose 0.7 per cent last month. It said that, allowing for seasonal fluctuations, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in June, the first seasonally adjusted rise since October. The Halifax index conflicts with a survey published last week by Nationwide, the second-largest society, which said house prices fell by an average 0.5 per cent last month. Despite last month's price rise, Halifax said the Pounds 65,361 average cost of a home in the UK was 5.6 per cent lower than in June last year.</p>

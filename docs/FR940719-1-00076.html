			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It was also suggested to the Agency that where escapeways developed on or after November 16, 1992, (the effective date of the existing rule) pass across or under overcasts or undercasts, the height of the escapeway should be permitted to be less than 5 feet provided the height is sufficient to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency situation. The Agency has considered this suggestion but has adopted it because sufficient clearance should have been provided in these escapeways through proper planning and engineering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency received questions during informational meetings regarding the need for minimum requirements for door height. The Agency has reviewed its position concerning door heights and is proposing in paragraph (d)(3) to permit door heights of less than 5 feet under certain conditions. Door heights of less than 5 feet would be permitted provided the operator demonstrates by the stretcher test described above that persons, including disabled persons, can escape without delay. Passing this test assures that there would be no diminution of safety under the new provision. Allowing heights less than 5 feet in these doors is not expected to result in a delay. Normally, there are few doors in an escapeway and the distance to be traversed in a door is short. Also, since significant pressure differentials can exist in escapeways, doors which are less than 5 feet would be easier to open.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (d)(4)(i), and (ii) would be unchanged under the proposal, aside from editorial revisions. These paragraphs are retained to provide for situations where escapeways are permitted to be less than 6 feet in width.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of the proposal would apply to alternate escapeways only. As discussed above, paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) permit both escapeways to be less than 6 feet, but not less than 4 feet, in width under certain conditions. Paragraph (d)(4)(iii) would permit widths less than 4 feet in alternate escapeways when conditions warrant and a test is conducted to demonstrate the adequacy of the width. The conditions that could warrant lesser widths would include the locations where the alternate escapeway passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls or where supplemental roof support is required. The Agency would expect that when there is a need to determine whether adequate width is provided, the stretcher test discussed above would be applied. Under this provision, it is conceivable that escapeway widths less than 4 feet could be warranted by the conditions in the entry through which the escapeway is routed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has developed proposed paragraph (d)(4)(iii) based on comments received since May 1992 and on its own internal review. Previously, approval has been requested and granted for reduced horizontal escapeway widths using the above-described stretcher test. These approvals were based on the need to provide additional roof support and, in some cases, the need for passage through ventilation controls. Additionally, as newer portions of a mine age and may require additional roof support, the proposal would allow clearances of less than 4 feet in the alternate escapeway, provided the stretcher test is passed. The Agency solicits comments as to whether this proposed approach achieves the result of the standard while adequately addressing the safety issues of providing necessary supplemental roof support in the alternate escapeway. The Agency also solicits comments on whether the distance that the escapeway is permitted to be less than 4 feet should be limited and if so, what the limit should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the publication of the existing ventilation rule, some persons interpreted &sect;75.380(d) to require the width of mobile equipment to be considered when determining compliance with width requirements for escapeways. It is not the Agency's intent that mobile equipment be considered in this determination unless the equipment has been permanently abandoned in the escapeway or would be obstructing the escapeway for a significant portion of a shift. As an example, where a track entry is used as the primary escapeway on a longwall section, material cars would not be permitted to obstruct the escapeway since the obstruction would exist for long periods of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the informational meetings, a question arose as to the Agency's intent in eliminating the requirement that escapeways be routed to the ``nearest mine opening.'' It was not the Agency's intent to change this requirement from the previous standard. The existing requirement that the escapeway follow the most direct route to the surface would, in fact, require the route to go to the nearest mine opening. However, to eliminate any confusion that may exist, the proposal would revise paragraph (d)(5) and adopt language similar to that in previous regulation &sect;75.1704&hyph;2(a), that the escapeway follow the most direct, safe and practical route to the nearest mine opening suitable for the safe evacuation of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of factors affect whether or not the safest, most direct, practical route has been selected. These factors include roof conditions, travel height, fan location, physical dimensions of the mine opening, and similar considerations. For example, if bad roof conditions are present along the shortest direct route and those roof conditions are beyond reasonable control, then an alternate ``safest'' route designated by the mine operator may be appropriate. However, the presence of roof falls does not necessarily indicate that the passageway would not be suitable for evacuation. By way of another example, where coal seam thickness varies to the extreme, the shortest route may be through lower coal, making travel relatively slow and difficult. An alternate route through a high passageway may permit easier travel. Such an alternate route, although longer, may be acceptable. Similarly, there can be instances where the ``nearest mine opening'' may not be suitable for safe evacuation of miners. For example, an old mine shaft may not be safe for travel because of badly deteriorated conditions, such as a deteriorated shaft lining or deteriorated timbers, even though the shaft is still suitable for mine ventilation purposes. A mine shaft developed and equipped with a ventilation fan prior to the effective date of this regulation may not be suitable for safe evacuation of miners if alterations were necessary for compliance with new safety regulations that would adversely affect mine ventilation in the event of an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the existing standard, mine development projections would not have to be altered to provide additional rooms, entries, or crosscuts for the sole purpose of providing a passageway to the nearest mine opening. However, the construction of ventilation controls such as stoppings, overcasts and undercasts, or the installation of an escape facility may be required to provide the most direct, safe and practical route to the surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

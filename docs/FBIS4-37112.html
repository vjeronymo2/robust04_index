			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] Two days ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  instructed Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the Central  Command, to reinforce the presence of IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] troops in the Jordan Valley, particularly in the  vicinity of Jericho, in order to step up the security of the  settlements in the area. [passage omitted]    A government source said that at Rabin's instructions the  soldiers will help guard the settlements and prevent  infiltrations. "If it is necessary, the soldiers will also give  chase to infiltrators," the source added. [passage omitted]    There were several incidents in the territories yesterday.  Two Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets in clashes with IDF  troops in Hebron and Ramallah. Palestinian sources reported  that shots were directed at an IDF base in the Ramallah area and  that a firebomb was thrown at a police outpost in the city. The  policemen opened fire at the perpetrator, but he escaped.  Searches were launched in the area. Another firebomb was  thrown in Nabulus, but no casualties or damages were caused in  this incident either.    Palestinian sources in Dayr al-Balah reported several  incidents of stone-throwing at Border Police and settlers' cars.  Stone- throwing incidents also occurred in the Qatif Bloc and  the vicinity of Kfar Darom.    A military source noted yesterday that wanted men persist in  their efforts to hide in the autonomous areas of Gaza and  Jericho. The IDF has reinforced its patrols along the main roads  in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.    An evaluation report about the first month of activity of  the  joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols was issued yesterday. The  report notes that no extraordinary events were registered during  this period, except for a few shooting incidents. [passage  omitted]</p>

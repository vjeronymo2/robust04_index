			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 16 HURT IN EMERGENCY EVACUATION OF THAI JET  </P> <P> A Thai Airways International jetliner aborted a takeoff Wednesday from Bangkok  airport, and 16 people were injured during the emergency evacuation, officials  said.  </P> <P> The Airbus 300-600 with 252 people aboard was taking off for Tokyo when the  pilot noticed a fire-warning indicator and aborted the flight. As the aircraft  stopped, a smoke-warning indicator came on and the pilot ordered an emergency  evacuation, airline Vice President Chusak Baachaiyud said.  </P> <P> An investigation showed that a rupture in a high-pressure pneumatic duct caused  the aircraft's left engine to overheat. The sudden stop overheated the brakes,  causing the smoke warning.  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Key Honda executive resigns MR SOICHIRO Irimajiri yesterday resigned his position as executive vice-president of Honda Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, for health reasons. Mr Irimajiri, 52, was one of three leading executives at Honda responsible for a sweeping management reform at the company which was initiated last year. He was also a key architect of the expansion of Honda's US manufacturing facilities, serving as president of Honda of America Manufacturing from 1984 until 1989. Mr Irimajiri also resigned his position as president of Honda R&amp;D, although he remains on the board of directors of both Honda Motor and Honda R&amp;D. It was undecided whether Mr Irimajiri would remain on the board of the Rover Group, in which Honda holds a 20 per cent stake. Mr Irimajiri was understood yesterday to be in a state of exhaustion and was receiving treatment in hospital. His executive responsibilities are to be assumed by other Honda directors.</p>

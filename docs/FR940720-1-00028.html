The proposal would remove the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising limitation on loose supplements to bound publications and adopt a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective test for determining what material can be mailed as a supplement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would revise the regulations on pages with ``novel'' characteristics, giving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publishers more latitude in page design. The provisions concerning the mailing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and product samples have been liberalized. A new provision has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added specifying how advertising content of second-class publications is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured. A provision has also been added defining public service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcements. Finally, the proposal would reorganize and clarify a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional standards for second-class mail concerning addressing, mailpiece  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, rate eligibility, and postage payment. These additional changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> editorial rather than substantive in nature.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this proposal must be received on or before September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be mailed or delivered to the Manager,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Business Mail Acceptance, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8430, Washington, DC 20260&hyph;6808.

Beginning in September 1986, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postal Service published four proposed rules, culminating in a final rule that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published 2 years later. 53 FR 35813 (September 15, 1988). The final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that then-recent changes in technology_specifically the introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment making it practical to insert a publication into a sealed plastic wrapper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (polybag)_made it possible for publishers of bound second-class publications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include with their publications additional materials that are separate and distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the publication. A number of publishers were in favor of taking advantage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this new technology, but others were concerned that allowing separately prepared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material to be enclosed loose in a polybag at second-class rates would cause an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undesirable movement of printed advertising materials from third-class mail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second-class mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Postal Service noted the difficulty in reaching an appropriate balance between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conflicting concerns and interests in this area, and was hopeful that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking would resolve these issues. To counter arguments that second-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mail would be harmed by the inclusion of too much advertising in the form of loose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements riding along with bound second-class publications, the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted, among other things, requirements that a loose second-class supplement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its host bound publication must be enclosed in an envelope or wrapper, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the supplement must contain a minimum of 25 percent nonadvertising content,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the supplement must be marked ``Supplement to'' followed by the name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the publication or the publisher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although that rulemaking was at least partially successful in achieving its goals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience over the past 6 years indicates that further revisions may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Technological advancements, such as selective binding, continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the design of publications, and publishers continue to seek to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials with second-class publications that were not contemplated at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current regulations were adopted. Many publishers consider the 25 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonadvertising rule for loose supplements to be burdensome and inappropriate as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of curbing the influx of advertising in second-class mail. Many publishers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also consider the current restrictions on the use of pages with ``novel''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics and the inclusion of products and product samples to limit unduly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their creativity in designing publications that appeal to their readers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertisers. These publishers also point out that private delivery companies do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose similar restrictions on their delivery of publications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most significant problem with the current regulations from the Postal Service's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perspective is the difficulty in applying these standards. This problem is not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to customers, but exists for postal personnel as well, as is demonstrated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively large number of revenue deficiencies and decisions overturned on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeal that concern the mailing of supplements, novelty pages, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with second-class publications. This difficulty of application creates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional expense for the Postal Service in training and in mail acceptance, and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromises the ability of the Postal Service to collect consistently the correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postage on second-class mailings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity ahead 35% - Growth in distribution profits outweighs supply deficit EASTERN Electricity yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 143.1m for the 12 months to March 31, a 35 per cent advance on last year's pro-forma Pounds 130.6m. The group, the last of the 12 regional electricity companies to report, lifted earnings per share by 30 per cent from 29.8p to 38.6p. A final dividend of 11.85p is recommended, making a total for the year of 16.7p. This represents a 15.5 per cent improvement, the second highest in the industry. Unlike most regional companies which benefited this year because of the effects of undercharging in 1991, Eastern's profits were depressed by undercharging in both years. Without this effect, the increase would have been about 23 per cent. Because of this undercharging, as well as rising costs, bad debts and depreciation, the company's supply business, which buys and sells bulk electricity, incurred a loss of Pounds 9.7m compared with a profit of Pounds 14.6m the year before. Mr James Smith, chairman, said Eastern's pricing policy was designed to give customers excellent value for money. Average electricity bills in Eastern's area were the lowest in England and Wales, he said. Most of Eastern's income was earned by the distribution business, which made Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 114.7m). This was partly due to higher tariffs, but also to electricity sales growth of 1.8 per cent, above the average for the country. Costs in the electricity business fell by 3.6 per cent in real terms, saving Pounds 8m as 250 jobs were lost, mainly in the distribution business. The retail business made a trading profit of about Pounds 2m, but Pounds 5.6m of restructuring charges relating to the company's retailing joint-venture with Southern Electric, set up during the year, turned that into a loss. Similar restructuring charges depressed profits for contracting and generation, giving an overall loss of Pounds 9.3m for the company's non-regulated businesses. Next year the supply business should be in profit as the Pounds 12m lost from undercharging this year is not expected to recur. Retail may break even or make a small loss and the restructuring costs will not recur in the non-core businesses. Electricity sales are expected to grow by about 1 per cent. COMMENT Eastern's loss on the supply side implies bad management and the company is unlikely to recover this year the short fall from that undercharging. But it can console itself that the loss has depressed profits and the rate of return to levels more pleasing to the regulator. And although the company increased its prices by an above average 3.22 per cent this April, it still charges less per unit than other regional companies. Eastern also outshone most regionals on cost cutting. Shareholders may wonder whether the outlook for the underlying businesses justifies the substantial dividend increase. The cover at 2.3 times is low for the sector. The City forecasts pre-tax profits of Pounds 160m-Pounds 187m for the year to March 1993, putting the company on a p/e of 5.6 to 6.3. A dividend in the range of 17.5p to 18.25p is forecast.</p>

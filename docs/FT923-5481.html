			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The ins and outs of realignment Why all the talk about a realignment of the European monetary system's exchange rate mechanism? In the past few weeks investors have switched funds out of dollars and into D-Marks, weakening the values against the D-Mark of many of the other nine ERM currencies. One way to ease the strain would be to revalue upwards the D-Mark in the grid, devaluing the weaker currencies. What's behind the D-Mark's strength? The German Bundesbank has pushed up its short-term interest rates to their highest levels since the 1930s, to damp unification-induced inflation. The US's interest rates are extremely low, because it wants to help economic recovery. The big difference between German and US borrowing rates has given investors every reason to buy D-Marks. What about the September 20 referendum in France on European economic and monetary union? If the French vote No, as seems possible, the current timetable for Emu will be scuppered. If that happens there will be less external pressure on European Community countries to keep government borrowing and inflation low. In that case, expect large selling of the weaker ERM currencies, including the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Italian lira and sterling. Is a realignment really on the cards? That depends on your vantage point. The EC finance ministers last Friday ruled out a realignment. Germany is not seeking a D-Mark revaluation and the other 11 ministers do not want to devalue against the D-Mark, because they feel this would weaken their countries' long-term effort against inflation. So is this the end of the story? Possibly not. The last time, back in 1987, that the strong D-Mark exerted such severe strains in the ERM on the other currencies, the pressure for a realignment became irresistible. What happened? On January 12 1987 the EC was forced to recognise that large central bank intervention to depress the D-Mark, chiefly against the weak French franc, would not work. Politicians arranged a realignment in which the D-Mark, the Belgian franc and the guilder were all revalued upwards against the other currencies. Britain was not involved because it joined the ERM only in 1990. Right now, are there any other factors to worry about? In several European countries - particularly France, Italy and Britain  - economic activity is weak, yet interest rates remain high because of the tight credit policies of the Bundesbank. According to some economists a devaluation of these countries' currencies might allow them to cut interest rates to spur growth. So why doesn't Europe just go ahead and realign? Governments are worried that any move to devalue would be punished by the markets. Investors might think that, having devalued once, these countries might do it again. As a result, interest rates might have to go up, rather than down, because of the extra 'risk premium' that investors demand for holding specific currencies. What's likely to happen? EC governments will do all in their power to keep talk of realignment out of the markets until September 20, when the outcome of the French referendum will be known. If further pressures build up in the ERM in the meantime, expect large central bank intervention to sell D-Marks for other currencies and hold the line. What's the Bundesbank's position? The German central bank would not be averse to a realignment, as a stronger D-Mark would strengthen its anti-inflation drive. It might be in a position to press Chancellor Helmut Kohl to accept the case for a revalued D-Mark on the grounds that the Bundesbank might then be able to cut interest rates more quickly. What difference is there between now and 1987? Then, France wanted Germany to revalue its currency against the French franc, because the franc was suffering so much selling pressure. Now, France is firmly against any change in the franc's parity against the D-Mark because it has made good progress at pushing down inflation to German levels. What about the other countries? If the markets did force a realignment, there is a strong chance of a 'two-speed' ERM developing. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark - whose currencies are regarded in the markets as strong and which have generally kept their values against the D-Mark - might be prepared to accept a realignment, so long as their currencies were moved up with the German currency. Where would Britain stand? Along with Italy, Spain and Portugal, Britain might have to devalue against all the other countries. However, one way for the UK to avoid losing face might be for it to move at the same time to a narrow 2.25 per cent band instead of its current 6 per cent band, thus helping to improve confidence in sterling on the markets. And France? Expect some creative economics. France might be able to persuade Germany that its currency should be regarded as 'strong' - and so should have the same kind of upward revaluation as the D-Mark in any realignment - even though the French franc itself has recently been under pressure. What could help the EC ministers out of their plight? A big Yes vote by the French would reduce the ERM tensions. If that fails to happen, watch out for more currency fireworks.</p>

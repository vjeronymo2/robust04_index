			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: The bulls intend to go down fighting - Wall Street AFTER spending the best part of a week biting their nails over the outcome of the Nafta vote in the House of Representatives, US investors wasted little time celebrating Wednesday's decision. Instead, they immediately returned to what they had been doing for most of this month  - biting their nails over the implications of rising long-term interest rates. For several days the financial markets had been unsettled by the uncertainty over whether the House would approve the legislative changes that paved the way for implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade pact was viewed as positive for stocks, because it should boost exports, and for bonds, because removing trade barriers should help dampen inflationary pressures in the world. Although concern about the House vote showed more in bond prices than stocks, some analysts were fearful that defeat for the President on Nafta would have been sufficiently jarring to trigger a stampede out of stocks - the kind that might have heralded the end of the long bull market in US equities. By Tuesday, however, sentiment in the House seemed to be shifting the President's way, and optimism about the outcome fed through into the stock markets. On Tuesday afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 3,700 for the first time, and investors had decided the time was right to discount a pro-Nafta vote. There was nothing unusual in that, except that by celebrating Nafta's approval before the event, investors left themselves with no room to buy stocks after the vote. As Michael Metz, the market strategist at broking house Oppenheimer said on Tuesday night: 'If Nafta is approved, it (the market) goes down quietly. If it is rejected, it goes down noisily.' In the end, Nafta was approved by a comfortable margin, and the markets went down, although not as quietly as Metz had anticipated. At one stage on Thursday the Dow was down 35 points, before a late round of computerised program buying helped the average finish the session only 20 points off on the day. It was a different story in the bond market, however. Like equities, bond prices suffered from pre-Nafta nerves. Unlike equities, bond prices never enjoyed the luxury of discounting a pro-Nafta vote. Instead, they fell steadily throughout the week, under pressure not just from Nafta worries but also from the latest evidence of a strengthening economy. That evidence came in several forms, including: a rise in October industrial production; a big decline in weekly jobless claims; fresh signs of recovery in the housing market; improving business activity in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's district; and a jump in export sales. The declines in bonds pushed long-term interest rates higher. This spooked the stock markets, which worry that higher long-term interest rates will choke of the supply of funds flowing into equities, as well as hinder corporate profitability. The fact that equity investors are choosing to mostly ignore the signs of an improving economy, and focus instead upon rising interest rates, suggests that the equity markets may undergoing an important transition. For the past two and a half years investors have been buying stocks because of declining interest rates. Now that interest rates appear to have bottomed and are heading up again, investors will have to look to corporate profits for inspiration. At some point - and it has not yet been reached - the stock markets will have to learn to live with higher interest rates, and start drawing strength from the fact that the economy is getting stronger and corporate earnings are improving. Before they reach that point, however, the markets are going to have to give up some ground. Stocks are just too expensive for the transition from an interest rate-led market to a profits-led market to be a smooth one. Those analysts who expect a correction are looking for a decline in the Dow in the region of five per cent, or at least well below 3,600. This may be an overly pessimistic outlook. Consider what happened yesterday. The bond market, in the wake of yet more positive economic news, plunged, pushing bond yields up to 6.35 per cent, their highest level since mid-August. The jump in bond yields hit the stock markets hard, but by midday the Dow was down 20 points and rebounding from its lows, and a good deal of the selling could be put down to trading related to the expiration of stock futures and options. This bull market is not going to end without a fight. Monday    3677.52  -  6.99 Tuesday   3710.77  + 33.25 Wednesday 3704.35  -  6.42 Thursday  3685.34  - 19.01 Friday    3694.01  +  8.67</p>

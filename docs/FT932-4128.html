			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil halts additive project STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, has halted engineering work on a NKr3bn (Pounds 290m) methyltertiary butyl ether plant and said it will charge accounts with a NKr300m loss on the project. There are two reasons behind the move: Statoil failed to obtain an acceptable agreement with a co-investor to reduce its risk in the project; and market prospects for the product are more uncertain now than they were when the decision to build the MTBE plant was taken two years ago. MTBE is used as an additive to boost the octane level of unleaded petrol. The plant was meant to be completed in 1995 and provide 100 permanent jobs. Statoil said it had already awarded a major engineering, procurement and construction contract for the plant to UK-based Fluor Daniel Construction. Mr Arild Steine, a Statoil spokesman, said yesterday the company had committed NKr500m to the project and, as a result of termination clauses in the EPC contract, would lose NKr300m. He refused to reveal the overall EPC contract value. In April, Statoil warned the costs of an associated NKr2.4bn methanol project were threatening to escalate by several hundred million kroner, prompting a comprehensive and critical review of the project with findings to be presented in June. Mr Steine said those findings would be presented an the end of this month at the earliest. Statoil has an 82 per cent stake in the proposed methanol plant and partners Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont de Nemours have 18 per cent. The methanol plant, planned to come on stream in 1996, is to be supplied with 650m cubic metres of gas annually from the NKr25bn Heidrun oil and gas field development, itself facing a cost over-run of NKr4.1bn or 19 per cent. This would allow the methanol plant to produce 830,000 tonnes of methanol a year. The methanol plant would, in turn, have supplied 200,000 tonnes annually of feedstock to the MTBE plant allowing annual output of 500,000 tonnes.</p>

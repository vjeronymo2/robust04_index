The RFA will request cooperative agreement applications for not-for-profit U.S. NGOs, U.S. PVOs, or U.S. colleges and universities to develop a Democracy Fellows Program. The United States Agency for International Development will seek to establish a 5 year cooperative agreement. The goal of the program is to establish a cadre of field experienced technical experts committed to careers in democracy and governance. The grantee will be required to identify, place, and supervise junior and mid-level experts in assignments that will contribute to democracy programs in developing countries, as well as to the career development and commitment of the experts themselves. It is envisioned that the project will include the following activities: (1) Identification of suitable assignments for Fellows; (2) Recruitment, review and selection of Fellows; (3) Orientation, supervision and support of Fellows; (4) Counterpart development; and (5) establishment of an Advisory Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested not-for-profit U.S. NGOs, U.S. PVOs, U.S. colleges, and universities, or a consortium thereof, should send a letter referencing RFA number OP/B/AEP&hyph;95&hyph;001 along with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> three (3) self-addressed mailing labels <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to U.S. Agency for International Development, Office of Procurement, M/OP/B/AEP, Room 1577, SA&hyph;14, Washington, DC 20523&hyph;1429, Attention: Mercedes E.

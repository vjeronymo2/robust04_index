			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The long-awaited government  reshuffling which was expected to be announced on Thursday is,  most evidently, postponed for at least another five days.    Two weeks ago it was announced that Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin had to draft the reshuffling scheme by January 6,  however, TASS learned from reliable sources that on Wednesday  the president returned the draft back to the prime minister for  "improvement". Nobody in the entourage of the president and the  prime minister agrees to elaborate.    However, several officials close to Chernomyrdin hinted that  there would be no major restructuring of the government. The  number of ministries and department will be reduced  inconsiderably, some of them would simply merge.    Although head of the government administration Vladimir  Kvasov confirmed that the government staff will be reduced by 20  per cent, it is still a secret how the nine deputy prime  ministers will be reshuffled.    It remains to guess the future composition of the government  according to who of its members had already moved to their new  offices in the former parliament building.    As for today it is known for sure that the prime minister,  as  well as two of his first deputies -- Oleg Soskovets and Yegor  Gaydar -- have already resettled.    It is impossible to find out who else has moved to the new  premises. The entourage of the prime minister recommends to  wait for a corresponding presidential decree which will make it  all clear.    However, it is rumoured in the government circles that the  prime minister would have two first deputies and two deputies.  The latter may be Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha who are  currently responsible for the social and agrarian policies.    However, a government member who asked not to be named told  TASS that the exact number of deputy prime ministers would  depend on whether four of the current deputies would succeed in  getting leading positions in the new legislature. The four  include Vladimir Shumeyko, Sergey Shakhray, Aleksandr Shokhin  and Boris Fedorov.    Anatoliy Chubays will most evidently remain head of the  property managing committee, but will be stripped of the post of  deputy premier, according to the source.    It is quite probable that Shumeyko and Shakhray will get  leading positions in parliament, but the prospect is dubious for  Shokhin and Fedorov.    Shokhin, the chief Russian foreign debt negotiator, boasts  support of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and if he ends  even as the foreign trade minister this would be a sensation  proving that there is a tough struggle in the Russian  establishment.    Fedorov, who is also the finance minister, had stated before  parliamentary elections, that he would resign if his arch rival  Viktor Gerashchenko, the chief banker, keeps his post. However,  Chernomyrdin would hardly agree to sack Gerashchenko.    In the final analysis, it is clear that the exact government  reshuffling scheme has not been yet determined either by  Chernomyrdin or by Yeltsin. It remains to wait until the new  parliament opens its first session on January 11 and whether the  deputy premiers succeed to get the positions they want there.</p>

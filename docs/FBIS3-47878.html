On  13 January, it was abruptly reported that the cabinet would be  reshuffled shortly after the Diet's passage of the political  reform bills. In reaction, Prime Minister Hosokawa and  officials in the Prime Minister's Official Residence were eager  to discredit the reports, saying: "The cabinet reshuffle is not  under consideration at all." It is true, however, that  Shinseito and Komeito are weighing when to reshuffle the cabinet  with the primary aim of "ousting Mr. Takemura as chief cabinet  secretary" after the Diet's passage of the political reform  bills. Like the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era, some  members of the ruling parties are patients stricken with  "minister disease" and the reports on the cabinet reshuffle are  likely to smolder without interruption in Nagata-cho.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura was quick to react to the  reports of the "cabinet reshuffle." He confirmed the prime  minister's "real intentions" about the reported cabinet  reshuffle before holding a regular morning news conference.  Speaking at the news conference, Mr. Takemura said: "I was  greatly surprised by the reports." He went on to say: "The  prime minister told me that he does not consider reshuffling his  cabinet at all at a time when the political reform bills are at  a crucial stage and his government is saddled with such major  policy tasks as stimulus measures and the compilation of the  1994 fiscal budget." In this way, he suggested that he got a  promise from the prime minister that the latter will keep him in  his chief cabinet secretary post.    Asked if some ruling parties are asking for a cabinet  reshuffle with an eye on the replacement of the chief cabinet  secretary, Mr. Takemura categorically denied the request,  saying, "I do not know of such a request." Mr. Takemura also  stressed: "I have been doing my best to shore up the coalition  government." Asked about the future treatment of Sadao  Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, after the  passage of the political reform bills, whose treatment is said  to have a momentum for the cabinet reshuffle, Mr. Takemura said:  "I conferred with the prime minister about that matter" and went  on to say: "Even if the Diet passes the political reform bills,  there are still major issues such as the demarcation of  (single-seat constituency), the reform of the House of  Councilors, and the reform of local governments. The political  reform is not finished yet." In this way, Mr. Takemura  suggested that Mr. Yamahana will not be replaced after the  passage of the political reform bills.    As parliamentarians close to Mr. Takemura said with  displeasure: "We are aware of the origin of information that has  fueled the reports," Shinseito and Komeito are increasingly  hostile toward Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. Some members  of the two parties are voicing their intentions to seek the  replacement of the chief cabinet secretary at an opportune time.    A senior member of Shinseito "condemns" Mr. Takemura,  saying:  "Mr. Takemura has given his priority to consultations with the  LDP and he is unfit to serve as a troubleshooter in the ruling  parties." Shinseito and Komeito appear to be intending to keep  Mr. Takemura out of the center of power in an attempt to take  the leadership in realigning the political parties after the  passage of the political reform bills. In an interview carried  in a magazine, to go on sale this week, Mr. Takemura made it  clear that he takes a different political stance with Shinseito  Representative Secretary Ozawa. In this way, Mr. Takemura is  increasingly taking an anti-Ozawa attitude.    Aides to the prime minister say: "Some members of the ruling  parties feel that the present cabinet members look good. But we  do not know what will happen to them after an ordinary Diet  session...." (according to a high-ranking government official).  They also say: "We do not know what will happen to the present  cabinet members after the Diet's enactment of the 1994 fiscal  budget," (according to a senior Shinseito member). In this way,  some members of the ruling parties have begun voicing the need  for the cabinet reshuffle before or after an ordinary Diet  session due to be convened in late January with a duration of  150 days.    Therefore, there is a possibility that the passage of the  political reform bills in the Diet will rekindle the rivalry  between Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Shinseito and  Komeito, and spark a full-fledged tug of war between each ruling  party over the cabinet reshuffle.</p>

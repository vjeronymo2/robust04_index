			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / China moves to cool economic expansion CHINA is poised to clamp down on its overheating economy amid reports that its central bank governor has been sacked for failing to impose order on a chaotic financial sector. Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-affiliated newspaper in Hong Kong, reported yesterday that Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier, would have his responsibilities extended to include supervision of the People's Bank. His main task would be to enforce tougher credit curbs. Officials in Beijing have declined to confirm the sacking of Mr Li Guixian, the central bank governor, but there seems little doubt he is being made a scapegoat for an explosion of credit that has fuelled unrestrained economic growth. China's ruling politburo is reported to have convened recently in emergency session to formulate stronger steps to deal with the economic crisis, marked by spiralling inflation and concern over disorder in the financial system. Cost of living increases are reported to have reached 20 per cent on an annualised basis in the first five months of the year in the larger cities. Among criticisms of Mr Li are that he failed to control non-bank financial institutions, such as trust companies, that have lent huge sums for investment in property and industrial development zones. This has helped fuel a capital spending binge that is one of the main causes of China's economic overheating. The State Planning Commission reported last week that the economy would grow at 13-14 per cent in the first six months. This far exceeds the 8-9 per cent growth targets for the year, announced in March at the National People's Congress, or parliament. Measures to cool the economy, including credit curbs, appear to have been ineffective. A panicky leadership has clearly decided that more severe medicine is required. The reported decision to invest Mr Zhu, 65, with greater responsibility for disciplining the economy is a sign of the situation's seriousness. It is also confirmation of Mr Zhu's growing importance; although he can hardly afford to fail in this tough assignment. Reports of an imminent reshuffle of China's economic team coincides with a meeting in Beijing of the standing committee of the country's parliament, at which harsh criticism has been voiced of the leadership's financial management. Mr Cai Cheng, a prominent member of the standing committee, was quoted by Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, as saying poor financial management and weak controls on banks were two of the main reasons for the country's present financial problems. Mr Cai singled out what he described as a failure to reform China's financial system as a principal cause of the present malaise. 'The financial system has not been reformed to suit the market economy,' he said. Vice-premier Zhu Rongji, described as China's economic czar, is regarded as a reformist but has been advocating more decisive steps to regain control of the economy. However, divisions in the leadership, the poor health of premier Li Peng, who is suffering from a heart condition, and fears of the reform process being derailed have delayed decisions. A senior Chinese official has attempted to scotch the latest round of speculation that Beijing may soon scrap its special foreign exchange certificates (FEC) in a one-off bid to unify exchange rates, Reuter adds from Shanghai. Mr Yang Xianlin, head of the policy department at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control, said he had 'received no notification that exchange into FEC will cease', an official newspaper reported yesterday. 'The rumours that the FEC will be abolished are without foundation,' he was quoted as saying. Mr Yang's statement reflects sharpening concern over the future of the FEC, which China introduced in the early 1980s as a special currency for foreigners parallel to its own renminbi yuan. Repeated rumours that the FEC is about to go have swept the country's markets.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING FIT: A 'VUKUTO' WORKOUT;  </P> <P> FUNK-STYLE AEROBICS TAKE ON FEELING OF LIVE ROCK CONCERT  </P> <P> When Laguna Beach fitness instructor Mel Jackson started conducting his  funk-style aerobics class to the beat of live conga drums, tambourines, flutes,  bells and bass guitars, he realized that he had something special on his hands.  </P> <P> So, to encourage the family feeling that was rapidly developing among his  students, he implemented a unique "black only" dress code and gave the class  the most intriguing name he could find.  </P> <P> "I found vukuto (pronounced voo-koo-toh) in a Swahili dictionary that was given  to me by a student," says Jackson. But it wasn't the dark ritual overtones of a  word that sounds like some weird blend of voodoo and karate that attracted  Jackson to vukuto; it is nothing more or less than the Swahili word for sweat.  </P> <P> "The workout you get in my class is the cake," Jackson says. "Vukuto is a blend  of cardiovascular exercise, dance choreography, and muscle isolation exercises  sandwiched between a proper warm-up/stretch and cool-down/stretch. All the  other stuff is just icing."  </P> <P> Mixed in with the aerobics dance workout are the soulful enthusiasm of a  revival meeting, without any religious testimonials, and the "Jumpin' Jack  Flash" audio-kinetic involvement of a live rock concert, without the stench of  smoke and cheap perfume.  </P> <P> "It's like the difference between watching MTV and going to a live concert,"  says Pam Warner of Corona del Mar resident . "It's disciplined and wild at the  same time -- and the workout does wonders for my bad back."  </P> <P> While there are other exercise classes that are conducted to live music -- most  notably Zahava's Monday night class at Legion Hall in Laguna Beach -- Jackson's  Vukuto is the only one that encourages joyful, foot-stomping interaction  between the "audience" and the "performers."  </P> <P> What makes Vukuto unique is that -- once it all gets going -- it's hard to tell  who's working and who's playing. Also, the avant-garde, aluminum and concrete  ambience of Laguna Beach's Club Postnuclear, where all Jackson's classes are  held, definitely contributes to the "Saturday Morning Live!" feel of Vukuto.  </P> <P> Jackson brings it all together by standing between stage and dance floor. From  this position he skillfully cues both the musicians on stage and the exercisers  on the floor in a way that catalyzes both groups. The result is everyone starts  jumping and shouting like a bunch of Grateful Deadheads.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the musicians come out on the floor and surround us," says long-time  student Brenda Thompson of Lake Forest. "That really gets you going."  </P> <P> Wherever they happen to be, the musicians enthusiastically perform aerobic  dance movements while playing their instruments. On the floor, aerobic dancers  mimic, sweat and chant like revivalists under the spell of the Rev. Mel at the  Church of the Truly Physical.  </P> <P> Although all the low-impact movements are safe and sound, neither Jackson, the  band, nor the dancers always know what's coming next.  </P> <P> "A lot of it is improvisational," Jackson says. "Sometimes we're all surprised  when one set of movements just flows into the next. Sometimes a student will  even grab a tambourine and jump in with the band."  </P> <P> This blend of funk aerobics, dance choreography and live music is held every  Saturday and Sunday morning at Club Postnuclear on Laguna Canyon Road. Between  8:30 and 9 a.m., Jackson's assistant, Karen Lee, leads a "primer" session  designed to help newcomers tune in to the basic move sequences. Most involve  movement of the trunk and shoulders in addition to traditional movement of the  arms and legs. At 9, the band and Jackson show up and that's when the "meeting"  begins.  </P> <P> Jackson says that planned spontaneity has always been a key theme in Vukuto.  </P> <P> "It just sort of happened about two years ago," Jackson says. "A friend of  mine, Markus Ritchie, started playing drums as background for some of my  classes. But Markus is a real showman -- and he loves to dance -- so he started  swiping my tambourine and dancing around with the class. Everyone loved it."  </P> <P> Reasoning -- a la Frank Zappa -- that if some is good, more is better, and too  much is just enough, Jackson brought in other instruments and other musicians  until he was able to scrap recorded music altogether. That's about when the  popularity of Jackson's classes began to soar.  </P> <P> "We went from 10 to 15 people per class to 20 to 30 in just a few months,"  Jackson says. "And now, because we get as many as 60 people showing up on  Sunday, we have to cut it off at 50 so everyone has enough room to move."  </P> <P> Jackson says the word is out among musicians as well. Between five to 10  musicians show up every Saturday and Sunday morning to get in on the action.  </P> <P> "First-timers just follow my cues and blend in with the three to four regular  players," Jackson says. "It's amazing, but it always seems to work out fine."  </P> <P> The owners of Club Postnuclear have since scrapped their own standard aerobics  program, of which Jackson's classes were just a part. They then leased the  facility to Jackson.  </P> <P> In addition to the weekend Vukuto classes, Jackson personally conducts other  classes seven days a week. "Techno-funk," a cardiovascular workout coupled with  muscle-isolation floor work, runs Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9 a.m. and  6 p.m.  </P> <P> "Choreographic Funk," which focuses more on dance technique, is held Tuesday  and Thursday mornings at 9 a.m. Lee conducts "Fundamental Funk," for beginners,  on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> Jackson also teaches a "Street Dancing" class for "juniors and teens with an  attitude." The class, designed for boys and girls age 13 and up, runs Tuesdays  and Thursdays at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> An additional seven classes at Ken Norton's Gold's Gym in El Toro, and seven  private training sessions a week keep Jackson as busy as a fitness professional  can physically afford to be.  </P> <P> Jackson and Ritchie have great plans for Vukuto.  </P> <P> "We're still developing the concept," Jackson says. "But eventually we'd like  to build it into a complete traveling show. We'd show up at a club or studio  just like we were doing a gig and people from all over could dance, exercise  and enjoy live music all at the same time."  </P> <P> Adds Ritchie, "We're also looking at a Vukuto record album and the possibility  of marketing the class to MTV or a video company."  </P> <P>  For more information call (714) 494-0818.  </P> <P> </P></p>

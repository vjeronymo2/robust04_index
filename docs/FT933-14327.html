			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Opinion polls predict big socialist loss JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party will not gain a parliamentary majority in Sunday's election but the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition group, will be a bigger loser, according to opinion polls released yesterday. The results of the newspaper-sponsored polls, the largest of which sampled 110,000 voters, reflected increasing support for newer, pro-reform parties such as the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party, both of which could win 40-50 seats in the 511-seat parliament. But the LDP, which entered the election with 227 seats after losing the support of one of its factions, may not be as battered as was predicted when the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa fell after losing a no-confidence motion late last month. It is now expected to secure 220-230 seats. The polls - published by the Nikkei Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Asahi Shimbun and the Mainichi Shimbun daily newspapers - indicated many voters had yet to decide. But they suggested the LDP would form a coalition government, with the JNP likely to have enough seats to make it an influential partner. There is also a possibility that the JNP could form a coalition with opposition parties, but Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the party's leader, has suggested a coalition with the LDP is more likely. However, Mr Hosokawa has also suggested a coalition government is likely to collapse quickly. This would force another election within a year, giving his party and other new groups more time to prepare for a campaign and select candidates. The snap poll has put pressure on the new parties; the JRP has been able to muster only 69 candidates, the JNP 57 and the New Party Harbinger 16. JRP officials are already planning for the next election, which they expect early next year. Each of the polls indicated that the SDP, which now has 140 seats and has traditionally won the protest vote, would be badly bruised on Sunday. Estimates put the number of seats it is likely to win at between 69 to 100. The party appears to have alienated old supporters through a last-minute attempt to overhaul a foreign policy more appropriate to the 1970s, but it has also put off other potential voters by not reforming the policies quickly enough. On average, the four polls found that the Japan Communist party would keep its present total of 16 seats, and could take as many as 20 seats. Meanwhile, the Komeito, backed by the Soka Gakkai religious movement, is expected to keep its 46 seats. If the polls are accurate, a coalition among the Komeito, SDP, JNP and JRP could form a new government. But policy differences should ensure their administration was short-lived.</p>

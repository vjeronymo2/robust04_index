			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Observer: Bid farewell Ashes to ashes. Cigar-smoking Harry Turner, the characterful chief executive of Television South West, is moving on. Always noted for his grand gestures, he was caught out by the grandest: his bid of over Pounds 16m a year for his franchise. It was a touch too rich for the Independent Television Commission - a view endorsed by both the High Court and the House of Lords. TSW is now running down to the handover to West Country Television on January 1. 'I am a mover and a shaker and there isn't going to be much moving and shaking at TSW any more,' he says. After more than 35 years in the media, all but five of them in ITV, it is time to take a break. 'I'm riding off into the sunset and will probably turn up as a belly dancer in Libya,' he adds. Although his pay-off is probably in the Pounds 200,000 bracket, TSW's greatest tribute is not trying to replace him. He is irreplaceable.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioners themselves note that contractors are used predominantly for construction (which generally is not a covered function), are almost never used for operations, and, therefore, post-accident testing for contractors would be rare. By this same reasoning, contractors would only rarely be subject to reasonable suspicion testing, i.e., when performing covered functions. If the Petitioners are correct that few contractor employees will be performing covered functions, then there should be a very minimal burden on operators. If a contractor does not perform covered functions, then no operator monitoring will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those instances where a contractor employee is performing a covered function, RSPA is not persuaded that the employee should be removed, without a test, because the operator suspects that the employee is alcohol-impaired. If the operator has the opportunity to observe the employee and determines that reasonable suspicion exists that the employee is impaired, the employee must be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although an operator may choose, under &sect;199.245, to allow a contractor to carry out the required alcohol testing, training, and education, the operator may find that it is simpler and more cost-effective to assume that responsibility directly. Unlike random and pre-employment testing, which involve large numbers of tests, post-accident and reasonable suspicion testing should result in relatively few tests. RSPA's experience with drug testing is that fewer than 3% of the total tests conducted have been in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations. Regardless of whether it employs contractors, an operator must have an alcohol misuse plan, provide educational materials to its employees, train supervisors, and be prepared to conduct tests. An operator could make copies of its educational materials available to contractor employees, use trained supervisors to observe contractor employees who are performing safety-sensitive functions, and test contractor employees in those few instances when testing is required. The arguments advanced by the Petitioners do not demonstrate that the requirement to ensure contractor compliance with the alcohol rule is unduly burdensome, impractical, or unnecessary. Therefore, RSPA is retaining the requirement that the operator is responsible for ensuring that employees who perform covered functions for the operator, whether directly or by contract, are subject to the requirements of the RSPA rule. Accordingly, no change to the rule is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA Should Clarify That Operators May Continue To Remove an Employee Without Conducting a Test  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioners state that many operators currently remove a safety-sensitive employee from the job, without performing an alcohol test, who is suspected of being alcohol-impaired. The Petitioners urge RSPA to amend the final rule and allow employers to continue this practice as long as the employee is made aware that the employer is relying on company policy or a labor agreement and not the DOT regulations, for the authority to remove the employee. The Petitioners contend that if the employee is not allowed to return to the job unless the other DOT requirements are met, such as evaluation by a SAP and follow-up testing, then the operator should be permitted to remove an employee without performing an alcohol test. The Petitioners suggested that, for reporting purposes, operators should be required to notify DOT of those employees who were not tested, but nonetheless removed from the job, counseled in alcohol counseling programs, or dismissed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. Section 199.225(b) requires each operator to require an employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in the alcohol misuse rule (e.g., has an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, or has used alcohol while performing covered functions). Section 199.225(b)(4)(ii) provides that, notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion test, an operator shall not allow an employee to perform covered functions while the employee appears to be under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, until eight hours have passed or the employee has been tested and has a result below 0.02. As discussed in the Common Preamble (59 FR 7328), an employer who observes an employee exhibiting the appearance of alcohol misuse, must test that employee. However, ``when it is infeasible or impossible to conduct a reasonable suspicion test in a timely manner (e.g., an EBT is unavailable or broken), the employee is not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions for eight hours (or until obtaining a result below 0.02 on a test if an EBT subsequently becomes available within the 8-hour period).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

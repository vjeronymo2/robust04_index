			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Lending by Japan's 11  major commercial banks in fiscal 1993 posted the first fall  since the banks started taking statistics in 1954, a banking  group said Monday [11 April].    Both consumer and corporate loans remained sluggish  throughout the year that ended March 31, said an official of the  Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.    The outstanding balance of lending by the 11 banks, known as  city banks in Japan, came to 221.97 trillion yen at the end of  the year, down 0.6 percent from a year earlier with a scant 0.1  percent growth in the latest reporting month alone, the  federation said.    The official brushed aside views that banks have been  reluctant to expand lending after incurring huge bad loans from  the collapse of the asset-inflated economy of the late 1980s.    "Banks took an active posture with various measures to  increase lending, (but) corporate demand for funds stayed  sluggish," he said.    Six city banks posted declines in fiscal 1993 lending, led  by  2.31 percent at the Bank of Tokyo, 2.30 percent at Fuji Bank and  2.08 percent at Sanwa Bank.    Daiwa Bank marked the highest growth of 5.85 percent among  the five banks that increased lending. Mitsubishi Bank followed  with 1.00 percent, and the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank with 0.87  percent.    The ranking of lending balance remained unchanged from the  previous year, with 32.37 trillion yen at Sakura Bank, 28.18  trillion yen at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and 27.28 trillion yen at  Sumitomo Bank.    The year-end balance of lending by Japan's three long-term  credit banks also marked the first fall, falling 0.2 percent  from the year- before level and dropping 0.1 percent for March  alone to 47.45 trillion yen.    The lending balance at Japan's seven trust banks stood at  25.43 trillion yen, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier and 1.7  percent in March.    As for deposits released together, the federation said the  outstanding balance of deposits at the city banks in fiscal 1993  rose for the first time in three years, climbing 2.0 percent  from the year before to 196.17 trillion yen.    The officials said deposits tended to be higher toward the  end of the year, with a 4.0 percent growth seen in the second  half after a 1.9 percent fall in the first half.    Corporate deposits increased for the first time in three  years as deposits by government-affiliated companies and  temporary deposits of investment funds by insurance firms  increased to more than offset declines in other general  corporate deposits, the official said.    Individual deposits remained buoyant led by demand deposits,  he said.    Real deposits, excluding checks and bills, rose a strong 3.1  percent in March alone.    The balance of debenture issuance -- equivalent to deposits  at other banks -- at the long-term credit banks for fiscal 1993  came to 51.33 trillion yen, down 0.9 percent to mark the second  consecutive fall. The March issuance alone dropped 0.4 percent.    The balance of deposits at the trust banks gained 4.9  percent  in fiscal 1993 to 10.09 trillion yen, recording the first  increase in three years.</p>

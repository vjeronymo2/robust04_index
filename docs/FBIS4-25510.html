			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- China conducted an  underground nuclear test earlier today, a Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here.    "China always stands for complete prohibition and thorough  destruction of nuclear weapons and, within this context, the  realization of a comprehensive nuclear test ban," the spokesman  said.    Proceeding from this fundamental position, China has all  along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and  the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely  limited, he said.    China fully respects and understands the position and  concern  of many non-nuclear weapon states on the question of nuclear  testing, he said.    Right now, the spokesman said, China is actively  participating in negotiations on a "comprehensive nuclear test  ban treaty", and supports the conclusion of such a treaty no  later than 1996 after negotiations.    He said the treaty should be a step towards the complete  prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.    "We call on other nuclear weapon states to give up their  policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit  terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of  nuclear weapons," he said.    "We are ready to make continued unremitting efforts with the  international community for an early realization of this  ultimate goal," the spokesman said.</p>

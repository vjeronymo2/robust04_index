			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Engines equipped with adjustable operating parameters would have to comply with all the regulations with the parameters adjusted to any setting in the full range of adjustment. For example, this could include adjustment of the high-speed needle for alteration of the air/fuel ratio or adjustment of the speed set screw. This would ensure that changes to the adjustable operating parameters that might readily occur in use would not cause the engine to fail to comply with these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to require that manufacturers label each engine and that the label meet the same requirements with respect to durability and visibility as required in the current on-highway program. The engine manufacturer would be responsible for proper labeling of engines from each engine family. In addition, EPA is proposing labeling requirements for vehicle and equipment manufacturers if the engine label is obscured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing that each engine must have a unique <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  engine identification number which may be part of the engine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  label or engraved on the engine. Such identification is <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  necessary for tracking individual engines. Use of engine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  identification numbers would facilitate setting up a tracking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  system and allow manufacturers to sample in-use engines for their <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  programs. This identification would be essential for development <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of a long-term in-use durability program. EPA requests comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  on the labeling proposal as well as on current engine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  identification practices within the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA also proposes to require that all engine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  crankcases must be closed to preclude the emissions that occur <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  when a crankcase is vented to the atmosphere. Since most <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  currently produced engines do have closed crankcases, EPA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  believes this requirement would impact relatively few <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  manufacturers. Finally, small SI engine noise levels would not <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  be allowed to increase as a result of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on these proposed certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  requirements. While EPA is today proposing vehicle and equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  manufacturer labeling responsibilities, EPA is considering <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  whether to instead make engine manufacturers responsible for <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ensuring that the emission control label is visible once the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  certified engine is incorporated into a given piece of nonroad <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  equipment. EPA requests comment on this specific issue as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Vehicle/Equipment Manufacturer Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commencing on this rule's effective date, manufacturers of <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  small SI vehicles and equipment and importers would be prohibited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  from introducing into U.S. commerce any vehicle or equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  powered by a small SI engine which does not incorporate the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  appropriate certified handheld or nonhandheld engine. Failure to <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  do so would make the equipment manufacturer liable for the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  assessment of civil penalties. EPA is proposing this requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  because it is concerned that engines certified to meet handheld <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  engine standards may in fact be used in nonhandheld equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This would significantly and negatively impact air quality <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  benefits which are to accrue as a result of this rule. Due to <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the potential for engines in different categories to be <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  substituted for one another, this prohibition would ensure that <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the regulated engines are used in appropriate applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, EPA is proposing to require that the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  original emission control engine label is visible once the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  certified engine is placed in the vehicle or equipment. If the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  engine label is obscured as a result of the vehicle or equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  manufacturer's placement of the engine in the nonroad vehicle or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  equipment, the vehicle or equipment manufacturer would be <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  required to attach an identical but supplemental label, in a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  readily visible location on a part necessary for normal vehicle <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  or equipment operation before it is introduced into United States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  equipment manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. For <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  further discussion, see ``V.F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Definitions.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Certification Procedures_Application Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The engine manufacturer would be required to submit an <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  application to EPA requesting a certificate of conformity for <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  each engine family for every model or calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Certificates would be issued to cover production for a single <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  model year. See ``V. W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Definition of Model Year, Annual Production Period'' for further <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  discussion of these issues. An application for a certificate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  would be submitted every model year even when the engine family <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  does not change from the previous certificate, although <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  representative test data could be reused in the succeeding model <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  year's application. If the emissions from the test engine were <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  below the applicable standards and EPA believed that all other <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  requirements of the regulation were met, EPA would issue a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  certificate of conformity for that engine family. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application would need to provide EPA with sufficient <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  information to determine the appropriate test results and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  emission characteristics of the engine family. It would also <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  allow EPA to determine test engine compliance with the applicable <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  emission standards in a timely manner. It would be important that <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the engine manufacturer succinctly, fully, and accurately submit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  all pertinent information to EPA and maintain internal records <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  which could be easily accessed if such access is determined to be <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  necessary by EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

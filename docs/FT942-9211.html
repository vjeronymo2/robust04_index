			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon chief executive resigns Mr Bennie Wooley is resigning as chief executive of Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and engineering services group that has seen its share price fall by two thirds over the past year. The move follows a strategic review which concluded that the group should focus on its original life sciences business. Mr Wooley has headed the company for 14 years during which it diversified into engineering and environmental consultancy in the US and bought consultants Travers Morgan in the UK. The review concluded that neither of these divisions had the earnings prospects originally envisaged. The group yesterday announced a sharp fall in operating income from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 2.57m for the six months to March 31. At the pre-tax level profits were slightly ahead at Pounds 989,000 (Pounds 984,000) reflecting Pounds 3m of restructuring costs in the first half of last year. The company, which has issued two profit warnings since March last year, said income from operations had been 'significantly' below expectations but that it was continuing to generate cash surplus to operations. This was reflected in an unchanged interim dividend of 0.875p. The US arm incurred an operating loss of Pounds 388,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 942,000 last time, while profits from Travers Morgan fell to Pounds 343,000 (Pounds 1.23m). Operating income from life sciences slipped to Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 4.37m) on turnover of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 19.7m). The group has appointed Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, to help it identify strategies for the engineering businesses. Mr Christopher Cliffe, finance director, said this would cover options other than disposal. Mr David Anslow, currently chief operating officer international, is to take over as chief executive with Mr Cliffe taking on the additional role as deputy chief executive with responsibility for strategic development. Although profits from life sciences are expected to pick up in the second half, the company warned that the shortfall for the group as a whole was unlikely to be made up. The shares closed 3p lower at 86p.</p>

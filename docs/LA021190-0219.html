			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TRASH YOUR NEIGHBORS WILL ENVY  </P> <P> Old habits are hard to break. Starting new ones can be even tougher,  particularly when others keep telling us it's a good idea.  </P> <P> Recycling is one of those new habits people are talking about. But I'll wager  that some of you, the minute you spotted the word recycling, decided to turn  this page.  </P> <P> If that's you, wait! Like it or not, sorting your trash for recyclables is fast  becoming a way of life. Six county cities offer some form of curbside  collection for glass bottles and jars, aluminum and tin cans, plastic soda and  milk containers, newspapers and even cardboard. Statewide, about 140  municipalities have curbside programs, triple the number of just two years ago.  </P> <P> Most cities have adopted recycling strategies because it's the law. By 1992,  all California cities are required to establish recycling programs to reduce by  half the amount of solid waste being dumped at landfills before the end of the  decade.  </P> <P> So get ready to separate your garbage, because recycling is coming to your  neighborhood -- soon. And when it does, you'd best get in the habit, or run the  risk of getting the evil eye from your neighbor. I know. I was the target of  such a stare.  </P> <P> About a month ago my Los Angeles County town began curbside recycling. Every  resident was given a bright orange plastic basket for recyclables -- bottles,  cans and newspapers. Items have to be bagged separately, then put on the curb  in the basket on trash day.  </P> <P> The flyer that arrived with the plastic basket said the program is voluntary.  But tell that to my neighbor, who dutifully hauled out his load of recyclables  on the first day of the program. I, of course, forgot to save my beer cans,  applesauce jars and newspapers that first week.  </P> <P> Now, I am an ardent believer in recycling. Southern California generates more  waste than any region in the nation. And nowhere is the trash pile bigger than  in Orange County, where 4.4 million tons of solid waste is produced every year.  That's roughly 2.1 tons for every man, woman and child -- the highest  per-capita ratio of any county in the nation.  </P> <P> These staggering numbers worry me -- as they should anyone planning to live in  the Los Angeles basin in the next century, when the shortage of landfills and  the glut of trash could create a noxious mess. Recycling makes sense, and to  that end I have tried to remember in recent years to stack my newspapers in the  garage and take them periodically across town to a local recycler. Same with  bottles and cans.  </P> <P> But work, kids and weekends often sidetracked my efforts. My spirit was  willing, but the results were erratic.  </P> <P> That's why I welcomed the city's curbside program. How easy can it get? Valet  service for recyclables. Trouble is, when the program started, I wasn't in the  habit of saving bottles and cans and old papers. So when the day arrived to  haul the stuff out in the bright orange basket, I was caught without a single  contribution by my neighbor, who wisecracked from his driveway: "Don't you care  about the environment?"  </P> <P> For a reporter who thrives on covering debates over air quality or ocean  pollution, it was an embarrassing exchange.  </P> <P> Trust me, it has not happened since.  </P> <P> Fortunately, thousands of Orange County people have joined the recycling ranks.  An estimated 175,000 to 200,000 county residents voluntarily participate in  curbside collection programs in Anaheim, Brea, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Orange  and Irvine. Half a dozen more cities may start such recycling by the end of  summer.  </P> <P> Nowhere has recycling been as successful as in Irvine, the first city in the  county to adopt a program, in September, 1987. More than 71% of the 26,000  residences eligible for the program are participating, officials say. In some  pockets of the city, participation is nearly 90%.  </P> <P> In the first two years of the program, 13,196 tons of old cans, glass bottles,  plastic soda containers and newsprint were collected. City officials say enough  newspapers were recycled to save about 192,000 35-foot trees.  </P> <P> "Everyone thought we were nuts, just nuts when we started this program," said  Maryanne Hetherington-Wysard, an Irvine public works official. "Now others are  following. A lot of people are getting into the habit."  </P> <P> Including one Times reporter.  </P></p>

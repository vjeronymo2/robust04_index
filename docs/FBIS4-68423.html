			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Davit Bitsadze: "A Poverty-Stricken Country and </F> Looted Banks"]    [Text] The public at large knows the story of the  erroneous monetary-credit policy that began during the late  unlamented rule of the ex-president and still triumphantly  continues. The final, decisive battle against this destructive  phenomenon of our economy has been declared by the republic's  Procuracy, the Chamber of Control, and the Internal Affairs and  Security ministries. They have shed light on numerous alarming  facts, which we present to readers today and will continue to in  the future. Let everyone know who is involved in these filthy  and destructive affairs that threaten to lay waste to the  country.    The criminal threesome took shape all of a sudden. It  included D. Kinkladze, the chairman of Gori's Diadema  Cooperative, E. Sulashvili, the head accountant of Tbilisi's  Bagebi-92 Firm, and B. Leviashvili, a Gori resident of unknown  occupation. In October-December 1992, they used false credit  advices, tax orders, and expired limited checks to deposit 101  million rubles illegally in the account of a small business  called Rkina-Betoni in the Gardabani Branch of Binsotsbank.  However, they failed to steal the money, the crime was detected  and the money was sequestered.    The threesome's fantasy was even grander; they decided to  create a commercial bank and obtained the support of National  Bank President D. Dvalishvili and Georgian Rescue Corps Deputy  Chairman G. Arveladze. Although the Argobank (that's what they  decided to call it) did not have the money required by the  capital fund or the necessary facilities, the former  [Dvalishvili] readily registered it, and on the basis of a  letter from Arveladze he granted it a billion rubles in credit  for half a year, because it was supposedly part of the Rescue  Corps. Of course, everything went according to the scenario:  Argobank deposited funds in various companies and cooperatives;  in return it obtained U.S. dollars and divvied them up. For  their crime, Kinkladze and Sulashvili are in jail; Leviashvili  fled to Moscow and is being sought.    In the same spirit of the times, Irakli Shavliashvili, the  general director of Trialeti Cooperative in Tbilisi, assumed the  mantle of someone concerned about his country and sent a  touching letter to the government in 1992: "Lend me two billion  rubles after I deliver a ship full of sugar to Batumi Harbor."  Attached to the letter was former Vice Premier P. Koguashvili's  resolution directing the appropriate officials to issue a letter  guaranteeing the loan. The boastful and hypocritical  Shavliashvili, armed with the letter, actually obtained the Head  of Government's resolution as well, ordering National Bank  President Demur Dvalishvili to speed up the documentation and  thus speed up the transaction. As always, Demur Dvalishvili did  just what he was told. National Bank Vice President N. Pipia was  also hasty, failing to realize that the credit was supposed to  be issued after the sugar was delivered to Batumi, and he  directed Industria-Bank Board Chairman Z. Gendzekhadze to issue  a two-billion ruble loan to Trialeti. Shavliashvili was lying in  wait, and on that same day he transferred 1.98 billion rubles to  Moscow, where it was converted, and 4,541,863 U.S. dollars wound  up in the Warsaw Branch of Amerbank. To this day no one knows  what happened to the money and whether there is any real chance  for the state to get it back.    Shavliashvili was restless, and like a spider he spun new  webs of deceitful manipulation. He signed agreements with  Tbilisi firms such as Guri, Medasi, Lasha, and Bani and Company,  such that these companies deposited 2.618 billion rubles in  Trialeti. Naturally, these firms had obtained the money through  state credits. In all the cases, the loans were issued for the  purpose of bringing food into the republic. One bitter economist  had this to say: "If food had really been brought in with the  money which Georgia's banks loaned out, we would have enough for  several years." People who have looked into it also say that the  job shouldn't have been turned over to private persons, that the  state ought to have a monopoly on it. Many also say that state  banks ought not to grant loans to companies and cooperatives;  that should be the commercial banks' job. It's certainly  something to think about. Keep in mind also that bankers are  profiting from it and have got rich.    Readers probably want to know what happened to I.  Shavliashvili. Irakli Shavliashvili and his associates,  presidents Zaal Godadze and Akaki Berdzenishvili of Medasi and  Petra, skipped the country after getting their hands on  billions, and are now in hiding. The Security Ministry has been  asked to help find their whereabouts.    For years, money has been drained out of the National Bank  by  using a shabby, primitive trick--supposedly to bring food into  the country. Because nothing was done to see that the money was  spent as intended, sharpsters had a clear field and could easily  turn credit into hard currency. In this way, a few people are  getting rich while thousands and hundreds of thousands are  getting poor. I. Iashvili, the President of Ika, is among those  newly enriched. The National Bank granted 500 million coupons in  his name. He, in turn, deposited the money in a firm called  002/1, from which he was supposed to receive food and industrial  goods. In fact, however, he got what he was trying for--U.S.  dollars.    A. Adeishvili, chief of the Saketerzetmshenproekt  Administration, also got in on the currency boom. He asked T.  Sigua, the former chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, and R.  Gotsiridze, the former Vice Premier, for a loan of 1.2 billion  rubles. His request did not use the notorious phrase "to acquire  food"; he used a more original trick--the idea of bringing in  fuel--and he promised to "help the citizens who had been cheated  by the Imedi Firm." That is how he hooked the gullible. The  President of the National Bank readily complied with R.  Gotsiridze's resolution and authorized the state's commercial  Agromretsvbank to issue the requested amount of the loan to the  Administration. Adeishvili pulled another clever trick. He  really did pay 88 million rubles to the citizens who had been  cheated but used the rest of the money for his personal  purposes; an investigation is underway.    There have been some particularly alarming cases of fraud  owing to the National Bank's encouragement. The president of its  creative firm Saburtalo-93 is G. Lomidze, who ought to earn a  place in the Guinness Book of World Records for it.    To be more specific, G. Lomidze wrote an authorization and  from the National Bank's Clearing Center he took 10 million  coupons' worth of transfer documents to the Borzhomi Branch of  Binsotsbank, in which he had opened an account. He put an 8 in  front of the 10 million coupons to yield the enormous sum of 810  million coupons. The Borzhomi doughheads "failed to notice" the  inserted number (in such documents, you know, the amount is also  written in words) and gave him the whole amount. By a prior  arrangement, the swindler transferred 800 million to the account  of the Forvard Brokerage Firm on the Caucasian Stock Exchange.  The purpose this time, again, was a "noble" one--to bring food  in for hungry people, although that was the furthest thing from  the so-called president's mind. The greedy and vengeful G.  Lomidze pocketed 11,300 dollars. In turn, Forvard set up its  next lightning swindle: along with three other brokerage firms  on the Caucasian Exchange it carried out another  800-million-ruble commodityless transaction, causing a  considerable loss to the state.    But that wasn't the end of G. Lomidze's fraudulent odyssey.  This time, he got his hands on documents transferring 19 million  coupons to various organizations. Using the same old method, he  put a 7 in front of that number. Again, the personnel of  Borzhomi's Agrobank were gullible enough to give him 719 million  coupons. At Lomidze's request, 700 million coupons were  deposited in the account of a company called Sameba--naturally,  for the purpose of buying food. Then, as a result of an  unauthorized deal between that firm and Saburtalo-93, he  pocketed 10,000 dollars, but distributed 19 million coupons to  three firms for the intended purpose. In this way, Lomidze  easily got his hands on 1.5 billion coupons.    A comment: It has been determined that the blank passport  with which G. Lomidze acted had been stolen along with some  others from the passport desk of Tbilisi Vakskiy Rayon's  Internal Affairs Department, and criminal proceedings have been  instituted. The firms mentioned above, moreover, were doing  their financial dealings without being registered with the Tax  Inspectorate. Nobody checked on their activities, which is why  they were able to operate so successfully.    Now let's look at the "heroic deeds" of the firm called  Andria, and its President V. Kavtelidze. It is located in  Tbilisi's Vakskiy Rayon. This executive had no trouble getting  things going, obtaining a 1.5-billion-ruble loan from Tbilisi's  Samepo Bank. He was also motivated by "good  intentions"--bringing food in for the hungry people. Kavtelidze  distributed the funds this way: he transferred one-third to  various firms in order to appropriate them later. In fact, he  pocketed 37,500 dollars instead of buying food. He transferred  the remaining billion to a company called Berika for "commercial  purposes." In fact, he was merely slaking his lust and readily  sacrificed his country and its people.    We could talk endlessly about the National Bank's  anti-national policy. Other banks are guilty of the same,  including rayon-level banks. The Shulaveri Woolen Mill obtained  a loan of 2.75 billion coupons from Marneuli's Agrobank. The  entire sum (supposedly to procure wool) was transferred to  Tbilisi's Kristal-LKG Corporation, which in turn deposited it in  the account of a firm called Kapital-Plus "to buy food with." A.  Lysenko, the General Director of Kapital-Plus, added it to other  monies and transferred more than 1.5 billion coupons to seven  brokerage firms on the Caucasian Stock Exchange, again "to buy  food." In fact, however, he obtained and pocketed 27,432 U.S.  dollars. As a result of a commodityless transaction of about  11,000 dollars, the Tatishvili Brothers' Mukhranis Veli Company  issued it for "meat that was procured"; in fact, nobody procured  a single kilogram of meat.    This is not the only commodityless transaction by the  Tatishvilis, along with other crimes. G. Galidava, the president  of the firm called Uta, and his bookkeeper K. Chachua,  established contact with that criminal gang through G. Gogsadze,  a broker on the Caucasian Stock Exchange. They deposited 380  million out of 500 million coupons borrowed from the bank,  supposedly to buy meat; instead, they acquired 7,500 U.S.  dollars. Now the Tatishvilis' depredations are at an end; they  are in custody. The same fate has befallen other criminals who  were in league with them.    G. Dolidze, the President of the KG Benevolent Corporation  in  Telavi, has shown himself to be an outstanding swindler and  money-grubber. Using false tax orders and limited checks, he  managed to deposit over two billion rubles in the Telavi,  Signakhi, and Lagodekhi branches of Agromretsvbank, which he  then transferred to various firms and corporations supposedly to  acquire wine-making materials, but the deal fell apart, he was  caught in the act, his hopes were dashed, and he got no dollars.  V. Bilikhodze, the chairman of the Universali Cooperative in  Ozurgeti, used false limited checks to steal 450 million rubles  from the bank in a short time.    Investigative agencies have also received information about  the improper use of credit funds on a large scale by firms named  Kvatakhevi, Gigi, Achiko and Company, and others. Other  commercial outfits are also being investigated.    After learning these facts, readers can easily see why our  country is in such a predicament and why the treasury is empty.  Some questions: What motivated the National Bank and other banks  when issuing credit? Were they obligated to monitor the proper  spending of the credit funds? And does the republic have a  mechanism to provide that monitoring? Finally, what role is  assigned to the republic's government and Finance Ministry in  this regard? These questions are all of concern to anybody who  cares about the country's fate. The Shavliashvilis, the  Tatishvilis, the Lomidzes, the Kinkladzes, the Adeishvilis, and  all the greedy people who stand behind them are ruining the  country.</p>

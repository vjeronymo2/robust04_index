			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Devaluation - a remedy that has not worked in the long run Sir, Prof Muellbauer (Personal View, September 14) makes a strong case for a devaluation of sterling. It is one that has been advanced many times in the last 20 years, the core of it being that output, employment and manufacturing competitiveness will all be increased while, in the existing state of employment, inflation will not be significantly raised. Indeed, Prof Muellbauer goes further. Econometric models, including the Treasury's, he says, 'take no account of the ways a devaluation could in current circumstances raise output permanently and cut inflation in the longer run'. Those with long memories note that the D-Mark/sterling exchange rate is 2.80 today compared with more than 8 in 1971; that in the intervening years UK inflation has far exceeded Germany's; and that the UK's relative manufacturing competitiveness is probably worse today than it was then. Real wages and labour productivity have risen less fast in the UK than in Germany; and the UK has generally found it more difficult to maintain employment. Some people, including myself, do not believe that these developments are unrelated. Admittedly a strong short-run case can often be made for sterling devaluation, but the obvious failure of the repeated application of the remedy to work in the long run should surely lead us to be wary of it.

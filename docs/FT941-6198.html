			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Olympics hero Norway ponders life in the cold: Norway thinks again The EU's growth pains: Row over voting rights; Norway thinks again After basking in universal praise for its staging of the Winter Olympics, Norway this week was back playing its less popular role as the most stubborn of the four countries applying to join the EU. While Sweden, Finland and Austria each hammered out accession terms on Monday, Norway dug in its heels on fisheries, refusing to back down on the now celebrated statement from Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the young fisheries minister, that Oslo had 'no fish to give away' to EU fishermen. Norway has already applied three times for EU membership. Its applications in 1960 and 1962 were blocked by France; then in 1972 the electorate voted against joining in a referendum following a row with Brussels over fisheries. That referendum split Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour party deeply. Opinion polls over the past year have consistently shown a strong majority of all Norwegians against membership and it was against this unpromising background that Mrs Brundtland once again pointed the country towards the Union. All along, a powerful argument in favour of membership has been the fear that Norway's Nordic neighbours would join, leaving it isolated and transforming the long, open border with Sweden into a frontier with the EU. Since last year's general election opinion has begun to swing towards a Yes vote. The latest polls show support rising to 37 per cent and overtaking the No camp should Sweden join. In Vienna, news that agreement had been struck brought a sense of relief, writes Patrick Blum. Austria's negotiators, especially Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister, were afforded hero status in media coverage. Nevertheless, the outcome of a referendum to approve membership scheduled for June, is far from certain. Until then, opponents - nationalists, traditionalists, special interest groups, and most of the Greens - will look for ammunition in the small print. They may yet be joined by the right-wing Freedom Party led by Mr Jorg Haider, who said he would not advise a Yes or No vote until he had studied the deal. A test of the public mood will come in provincial elections in Salzburg, Tyrol and Carinthia on March 13. The most sensitive issues remain lorry transit and agriculture, and the government may feel it has won a better deal on both than it might have expected.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: COMIC BOOKS ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> Question: Big bucks are being paid for comic books. I've been enthusiastically  collecting comic books for a number of years and have noticed, more and more,  that some of the more expensive books are not in their original condition, but  have been restored.  </P> <P> How important is it to the collector to be aware of restoration in the  framework of getting a fair price? -- M.H.  </P> <P> Answer: Awareness of restoration is very important in determining a comic  book's collectible price.  </P> <P> Here's what Robert M. Overstreet has to say about restoration in "The Official  Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide ($12.95, paperback, 520 pages, House of  Collectibles, Ballantine Books):  </P> <P> "Many of the rare and expensive key books are being upgraded from lower grades  to fine or very fine condition through restoration. It has been brought to our  attention that some dealers have been selling these books to unsuspecting  collectors/investors -- not telling them of the restoration.  </P> <P> "In some cases these restored books are being priced the same as unrestored  books.  </P> <P> "Very important: Examine books very closely for repairing or restoration before  purchase. The more expensive the book, the greater the likelihood of  restoration.  </P> <P> "Major things to look for are: bleaching, whitening, trimming, interior spine  and tear reinforcement, gluing, restapling, missing pieces replaced, wrinkles  pressed out of covers, recoloring and reglossing covers.  </P> <P> "Dealers should state that a book has been restored and not expect to get as  much as a book unrestored in that condition would bring."  </P> <P> The bottom line is that -- unlike some other categories of collectibles, such  as an expertly overhauled firearm -- a restored comic book undoubtedly is not  viewed by veteran collectors as being as valuable as one in its original,  unrestored condition. To spot restoration marks will take some work and  experience on the part of the collector.  </P> <P> Smoking pipe expert and collector Rick Hacker has just completed the second  edition of his "The Ultimate Pipe Book" (Autumngold Publishing, P.O. Box 634,  Beverly Hills 90213; 330 pages, hardcover, bibliography, $19.95 at tobacconists  or by mail).  </P> <P> "You will notice that this new book is considerably thicker than the previous  edition, and Chapters 9 and 10 now contain information on virtually any pipe  the new and even the most advanced collector is likely to find," Hacker wrote.  </P> <P> Hacker adds that he has more than 2,000 pipes in his personal collection,  "ranging from the 1600s up through the most modern of offerings . . . even a  space shuttle pipe made by Dunhill."  </P></p>

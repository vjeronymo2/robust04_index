			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina said today the first fruit of The Nation and the  Emigrants conference is that it is taking place and that there  is the possibility of continued efforts for the normalization of  ties between Cuba and residents abroad.    Robaina dedicated the event at Havana Convention Palace with  a 10-minute speech to 204 Cuban citizens who live in 27  countries and who were invited on a personal basis to  participate in the meeting, which will last until Sunday.    He said: We must collectively establish the areas in which  we, with everyone's participation, may make progress toward the  establishing of the normal relations to which we are entitled.    Robaina said one of the objectives of the meeting is "to  examine what measures can be adopted to normalize ties between  the emigrants and the country, institutions, and families."  Another goal, he said, is to encourage stable relations and  exchanges in the family, cultural, and social realms.    He noted that efforts are being made "to encourage  constructive actions by residents abroad considering that in the  current historic situation, the future of the nation and the  safeguarding of its sovereignty, independence, and achievements  represent a common motive for all Cubans of goodwill."    Robaina said the meeting is being attended by the most  diverse political and ideological currents, "something that does  not block the willingness to work for the objective that brought  us together."    The minister explained that the participants include  professionals, artists, housewives, retired persons, workers,  businessmen, religious persons, and social and student leaders  who love and are identified with the fatherland.    He said their participation in the conference "represents  acknowledgment for our government's courageous decision to  convoke this meeting in the midst of the unpostponable tasks the  nation is tackling."    The foreign minister said the meeting is not the result of  either a miracle or an accident, but, especially, of the  maturity, strength, and independence of Cuba and of "a growing  attitude of respect and understanding in a considerable number  of emigrants who increasingly identify themselves with the  fundamental interests of the nation."    In his brief speech, which was greatly applauded by the  participants, Robaina recalled that the meeting is taking place  in spite of the hostile U.S. policy toward Cuba that so far has  served as a framework for the development of relations between  the island and its emigrants.    The conference was called on 14 February by Robaina. This is  the second effort made in this direction after the dialogue held  in this capital in 1978. Robaina said the first fruit of this  new meeting is precisely the fact that it has taken place and  the possibilities it has opened for a continuation on the road  to the normalization of ties between the nation and its  residents abroad.    He said: Respect and intelligence in discussing each of the  issues that concern us in the relations between the nation and  its emigrants is what must characterize our current dialogue and  serve as the premise for the future.    Following the dedication, the first working session began at  noon behind closed doors. Robaina will speak about Cuba's  emigration policy, sources close to the meeting have reported.    The meeting will last until Sunday. The president of the  Cuban Parliament, Ricardo Alarcon; Council of State Vice  President Carlos Lage; and Abel Prieto, president of the  National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists will also  participate in the meeting. They will discuss issues concerning  the country's life.</p>

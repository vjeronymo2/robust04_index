			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D the victim of high dividend policies Sir, Lord Hanson objects to Treasury financial secretary Stephen Dorrell's querying City practices, and in particular defends the insistence on consistently high dividends in bad times as well as good ('Hanson angered by Dorrell query over 'too high' dividends', June 4/5). But no one who has read the evidence presented to the House of Commons committee on trade and industry inquiry into the competitiveness of UK manufacturing industry can seriously doubt the City's negative influence on the level of industrial investment in the UK compared to that in our main competitor nations. The effect on management is either to require internal rates of return two to three times higher than the nominal interest rate or unrealistically short pay-back periods, to avoid risking the value of dividends. The City view that if UK industry is not investing in R&amp;D it must be because management sees no opportunities must leave research directors gaping, and our foreign competitors laughing. A survey by KPMG Peat Marwick of nearly 700 company directors revealed that the most difficult aspect of performing R&amp;D was finding the money. Managing directors of companies listed on the Stock Exchange were almost at one (82 per cent) in saying the City does not understand R&amp;D investment requirements. If nothing worse, there is a manifest breakdown of comprehension at the critical interface between industry and the financial sector. Stephen Dorrell should be thanked for bringing these issues into the open. Here is where the country should be looking to understand the failure to 'realise the potential' of an outstanding tradition of research in science and technology. Yet last year's white paper on science and technology in the cause of 'wealth creation' (which only two out of 14 City analysts interviewed by KPMG knew about) ignores these problems, while introducing a more dirigiste approach to management of research that could threaten the vitality and originality of the science base.

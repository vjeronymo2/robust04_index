			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> American sprinter Leroy Burrell matched the best performance of the year by  winning the 100-meter dash in 9.96 seconds at a track and field meet in  Sestriere, Italy.  </P> <P> Burrell had been trying for a world record, aided by the high altitude.  </P> <P> Michael Johnson ran the 200 meters in 19.88 seconds, the second-fastest  performance in the world this year. Johnson, who missed the world mark of 19.72  set by Italy's Pietro Mennea in Mexico City in 1979, said a slow start and a  bad curve compromised his record chances.  </P></p>

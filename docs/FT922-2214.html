			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition and rights planned to transform Finlan FINLAN GROUP, the property and building materials company where the 10p and 1p shares were suspended at 2 3/4 p and 3p respectively in May, yesterday announced the acquisition of a private company, a rights issue, a reorganisation of its capital structure and a change of name. It has conditionally agreed to acquire and assume the name of Birkby, the Huddersfield-based rental group, for Pounds 4.05m, to be raised via the issue of 4.05m new ordinary 5p shares. Mr Kim Taylor-Smith, finance director of the old Finlan and the new Birkby, said the name change was appropriate because the reorganisation of Finlan - begun last November and in which the banks gained half the equity - had disposed of its debts and virtually all of its property interests, leaving the company almost a shell. Birkby provides managed workspace, especially in the M62 corridor, commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit. It is forecast to make pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 600,000 in the year to July 31 and has 'good quality earnings', Mr Taylor-Smith said. Finlan is to raise about Pounds 6m net of expenses in the rights issue of up to 6.73m new ordinary 5p shares. Mr Taylor-Smith said the proceeds would be used to reduce borrowings, including the repayment of Pounds 425,000 to FennoScandia Bank, and provide working capital. At 100p each seven new shares will be offered for every three held and one for every Pounds 3.43 nominal of loan stock, following the capital reorganisation. Finlan is to create a new class of 5p shares to replace the 1p ordinary, the 10p ordinary and the preference shares. It will cancel the nominal value of the deferred shares - about Pounds 14m - and release about Pounds 14.6m standing to the credit of the share premium account. This Pounds 28.6m will go to a new and separate reserve, against which Finlan will write off the accumulated deficit of about Pounds 26m on the profit and loss account.</p>

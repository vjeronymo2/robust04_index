			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Goodyear expects record sales GOODYEAR, the Ohio-based tyre manufacturer, expects sales for 1992 in excess of Dollars 11.7bn, the highest in its 94-year history, when results are released on February 9. However, special accounting charges and early debt retirement will leave the company with a reported full-year loss of about Dollars 660m. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said that Goodyear's net income before the special accounting charges should be in the Dollars 360m to Dollars 370m range, and earnings per share should exceed Dollars 5. Comparable 1991 figures were Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.24. However, his projections for 1992 included an undisclosed fourth-quarter gain on the sale of polyester operations, an undisclosed loss on the pending sale of the company's rubber roofing business, and an after-tax charge of Dollars 38m for staff reductions. The company said it had reduced debt to Dollars 1.9bn at the end of 1992, from Dollars 3.7bn in mid-1991, as a result of improved cash-flow, the sale of assets, and a 1991 stock sale. Mr Gault gave a cautiously optimistic outlook for 1993, saying the US tyre replacement market was expected to advance beyond 1992's record 197m units, and that Goodyear should continue to outperform the industry. 'With these growth expectations for US operations and encouraging plans for solid progress from other regions, Goodyear associates are looking toward a third consecutive year of growth,' he said.</p>

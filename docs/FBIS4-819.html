			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bhekie Matsebula] </F>   [Text] South Africa's right wing group -- AWB [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] is reported to be holding political  meetings at Lubodlwana mountain near Hhelehhele in Northern  Hhohho.    This was confirmed on Saturday [16 April] by the chief of  the  area, Prince Mnikwa who said the meetings started a few weeks  ago. He said the Umbutfo [warrior] Swaziland Defence Force  (USDF) which patrols the area had been informed about the  presence of the AWB at the mountain, but no action has been  taken against them. The area is situated near the fence  separating Swaziland from South Africa close to the Matsamo  border gate.    Prince Mnikwa said he was told by his subjects on Monday  last  week, after he came back from hospital for an operation that  last Saturday, that there was a large gathering of Boers at the  Lubodlwana mountain close to a farm owned by a certain Mr.  Botman. "When I asked whether the army had been informed about  this, I was told that they had been informed, but no action was  taken."    Prince Mnikwa said there had been similar reports in the  past, but it had been difficult for him to believe them because  the Boers were never seen. "But now they have been seen holding  a meeting in broad-daylight. I therefore now believe that these  Boers are using my area because they feel it is free from  patrols."    Prince Mnikwa said the behaviour of the AWB was a violation  of the country's laws which prohibit the holding of political  meetings without a permit. He said he was planning to meet with  the Pigg's Peak police station commander, Mr. Smart Dlamini to  discuss what steps would be taken against the AWB.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: New York Met's Otello - Opera The new Met production of Otello will not seem so very new to anyone familiar with Covent Garden's present staging. Once the company had decided to abandon a projected version by John Schlesinger, on the grounds that William Dudley's set would have been too complex for repertory exposure, it went to the Royal Opera team of Elijah Moshinsky as director and Michael Yeargan as set designer. The result, while not quite a remake of the London production, has many of the same features, including especially the feel of Venetian painting: immense neoclassical columns that make the stage look like one of Carpaccio's spacious vistas, and a Titianesque sumptuousness of colour and texture in the costumes (by Peter J. Hall). When the Venetian ambassadors arrive, they do so as a strong forward wave of crimson brocade and fur, shamelessly spectacular. Shamelessness and spectacle carry the weight of the production elsewhere too. Mr Moshinsky's handling of the crowd scenes is extravagantly busy and brilliantly managed: the slicing apart of the curtains at the beginning reveals a proscenium at once filled with activity in an exhilarating chiaroscuro, going up to a top level of soldiers and cannons. Quite what kind of structure is being represented here is unclear, just as the architectural purpose of the grand columns is never fully explicit. The function of the sets is not to portray a city but to provide sufficient space and splendour for action, or contrariwise for the effective stillness, emptiness and isolation of the more intimate scenes. Otello and Desdemona are often pinned against the base of one or other of the pillars; the lighting examines them mercilessly. Only Iago has the freedom to wander and lean. The reason for this production was to salute Placido Domingo on the silver anniversary of his first Met appearance, and his performance in the title role is all the more fascinating for its edge of frustration. The ring of brightness which we hear, for instance, at his first appearance does not come easily to him now - it has to be striven for. In his solo after the eavesdropping scene he gives up the striving, and the voice becomes bleak, grim, heavily baritonal: the raw grain of the wood, without the polish. At other points the sense of strain can be either intense or exquisitely uncomfortable, but always it is just to the expressive moment. The command holds, magnificently. And if we begin to notice the cost, it is not as vocal deficiency but as the cost exacted by the score on the wretched victim it makes its chief character. It also suits the piece that the Iago, Sergei Leiferkus, should be effortlessly in control of his vocal equipment. His gentlemanly correctness begins by seeming perhaps even too finely modulated: evil, one may feel, ought to spit more, be more scarred. But this Iago is not evil, except in being the supreme manager. What delights him is regulation, efficiency, the ability to manipulate scenes and emotions. The 'Credo', in which Mr Leiferkus does bare his tone and show us some vocal fangs, seems an act. Carol Vaness's Desdemona is a less natural piece of casting. She is a mettlesome stage personality, and here she gives the appearance of a precarious restraint: left to herself she would surely be clouting Otello back. Nor is it just a matter of physical behaviour, for there is an evident carefulness too in her singing. She can produce beautiful sequences of rounded, gleaming melody in the middle-high register, soft and yet carrying; but the notes have to be held in place and warily balanced. It is a near miracle that they almost always are so, but one cannot quite believe in the purity, and without purity Desdemona has little going for her. The other parts are paltry in this cruel opera, and they are adequately done. The conducting, on the other hand, is far more than adequate. Valery Gergiev, normally associated with Russian repertory, proves he can be just as passionate about Verdi, and there are moments, notably the close of the third act, when the passion he encourages in the orchestra threatens to drown out even a stage full of voices. And so the orchestra, in its display, equals what we see on stage.</p>

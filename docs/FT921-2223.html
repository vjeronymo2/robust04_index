			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Management: The Russian revolution - Difficulties facing investors Leonid Grigoriev, the economist responsible for attracting foreign capital to Russia, compares his job to that of a gardener. As head of a newly-created Committee for Foreign Investment, he says he has to clear away a multitude of rocks and wild growth before foreign investment can flourish. As foreigners already trying to do business in the former Soviet Union will confirm, the environment remains distinctly hostile. The economy is crying out for foreign investment to convert military production to civilian output, to modernise creaking old factories, and to cut huge waste in the exploitation of natural resources. Yet, after seven decades of protection against foreign capitalists, everything about the place seems designed to discourage foreign investment - apart from jealously guarded natural resources and the potentially enormous future markets. Businessmen cannot get visas upon arrival but need to apply for them in advance, with the support of a local sponsor and specifying which destinations they propose to visit. Private ownership of land is not allowed and that of other assets is difficult; the banking system is paralysed; missing bits of legislation and the existence of powerful vested interests mean that even deals agreed with a Russian partner are obstructed within the state bureaucracy or parliament. Pacing around his office in the former Gosplan building - where officials used to plan the Soviet economy five years at a time - Grigoriev complains that most of his compatriots have no idea of what makes foreign capitalists tick. 'Many people think foreign investment is a substitute for the centralised investments of Gosplan, that the money they used to get from Gosplan will now come from foreigners.' One of the authors of the 500-Day Programme for radical economic reform, Grigoriev still teaches a Moscow university course on US financial corporations, mergers and acquisitions, and bankruptcy. But apart from education, he sees his main task as providing the legislative base for investment - the law on foreign investment adopted last July is already out of date - and convincing the government to provide conditions for investment to flourish. For despite the symbolic victory of occupying the Gosplan building, the young government of economic reformers which he joined three months ago has yet to gain real power over the vast state machinery it inherited from the former Soviet Union. Grigoriev has to break off the interview a few times to shout down the telephone to secure hard currency for colleagues to fly to Washington the next morning. Their mission is to negotiate a bilateral agreement to protect US investors in Russia. In fact, Russia is suffering not so much from an absence of foreign investors as from its inability to satisfy those prepared to defy present problems to do business. The government has achieved many firsts since coming to power: it concluded Russia's first oil production sharing agreement, got a crucial mineral deposits law through parliament, and selected a US-Japanese consortium to investigate huge oil and gas resources off Sakhalin Island. It is even negotiating the first ever deals allowing foreign companies to exploit Russian gold mines. But most of the projects are still facing snags getting off the ground. What is Grigoriev's advice for foreign investors? 'As a government official I say 'You must come here'. But as an honest man, I'm saying 'We're starting from the beginning'. Things may yet get worse before they get better but gradually we will create decent conditions for investment.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                What do you need to clinch a deal in Russia?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Strong direct ties with a local partner such as a region or enterprise; high-level political connections can help.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A presence in Russia, preferably with a permanent office which can be cheaper than several trips a year. There is a limit to how much business can be done over the telephone.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More funds than you first thought  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternative ways of generating revenue alongside your main project, like buying an office block or setting up a furniture factory alongside a substantial industrial project  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Start with a small project to test the market and gain experience.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Be prepared to pay bribes: the perk is a trip to headquarters in the west for travel-hungry Soviet partners who want to do a deal.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

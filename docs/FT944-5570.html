			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian crop loss estimate raised to 54% Australia's winter crop production is now expected to fall by 54 per cent over last year's level as a result of the severe drought in Queensland and New South Wales. The drought is also forecast to slice ADollars 2.9bn of national income generally, equivalent to a 0.7 percentage point reduction in the economic growth rate. The new estimates, released by Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary industries minister, represent yet another increase in the forecast impact of the weather conditions on the nation's rural production and the overall economy. Previously, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics had suggested that the drought would clip national income in 1994-95 by ADollars 2bn. It had also forecast that the winter crop yield would be around 17m tonnes. The new number is 13m tonnes, compared with 28m tonnes in 1993-94. Senator Collins added that the wheat crop was now expected to fall by 50 per cent, to its lowest level since 1972. In its last quarterly crop report, Abare had previously suggested a 38 per cent fall, to 10.4m tonnes. The minister also said that the Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting that the drought would persist until the end of the year at least, followed by poor and late summer rains.</p>

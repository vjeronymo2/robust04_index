			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Vaskovic from the Serbian Assembly] </F>   [Excerpt] The assembly session only resumed a few minutes  ago, but, believe it or not, it is already finished. Actually,  it has been postponed until Tuesday [8 February].    The new Assembly Chairman Dragan Tomic stated that the  reason  for the delay in the session were consultations among the heads  of the deputy caucuses. They were supposed to agree on the  candidates for the [four] posts of deputy assembly chairmen.  The meeting was not attended by any DEPOS representatives. In  addition, only two people were proposed as deputy chairmen.  Tomic thought that the best thing would be to hold more  consultations and that the session should be postponed until  Tuesday.

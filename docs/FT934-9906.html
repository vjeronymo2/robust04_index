			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Balladur takes partners for chairmen's waltz: John Ridding reports on the big reshuffle at the top of France's public sector financial companies IT IS described in France as the waltz of the chairmen. The latest steps, which are due to be completed tomorrow, involve a sweeping reshuffle at the top of French public sector financial companies. Mr Jacques Friedmann, a close associate of the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, will take over as chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's most powerful institutional investors. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the current head of UAP, is to move to loss-making Credit Lyonnais, displacing Mr Jean-Yves Haberer who moves to Credit National, a small private sector bank. When the music stops, the country's largest insurance group and one of the largest banks will have new chairmen to guide them through privatisation. Mr Balladur will be left with a stronger grip on the pillars of the French economic establishment. In August he installed Mr Philippe Jaffre as head of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group and France's largest industrial concern. In May he chose Mr Michel Pebereau, another trusted associate as head of Banque Nationale de Paris, France's third biggest bank. Mr Friedmann's move would place a Balladur appointee into a third key post. Mr Balladur's reshuffle is as much pragmatic as politically motivated. 'He has taken a tighter hold of the top of French business and finance,' says one Paris-based merchant banker. 'But he has done it with a velvet glove.' Nonetheless, the grip will leave an imprint on the management at the top of French finance and industry and forms a central element of the government's plan to privatise 21 publicly-owned groups. Mr Balladur's smooth approach marks a contrast to the 'witch hunts' which characterised the change of power between Socialist and conservative governments in the 1970s and early 1980s. He has taken a gradual approach to changing the heads of public sector groups, leaving Socialist appointees at the head of many companies, and even appointing Socialist business leaders to new posts. The latest round provides a case in point. Mr Jean Peyrelevade has been entrusted with the task of preparing Credit Lyonnais for privatisation, despite the Socialist credentials he earned as adviser to the government of Mr Pierre Mauroy in the early 1980s. The respect he earned as head of the Suez group and at UAP encouraged a pragmatic approach by Mr Balladur. At Air France, presently the most troublesome of France's public sector groups, the government appointed Mr Christian Blanc, a close associate of Mr Michel Rocard, the leader of the Socialist party. Attractive posts for outgoing Socialist appointees are necessary to avoid conflict with President Francois Mitterrand and to prevent upsetting the peaceful co-habitation between the centre-right government and the Socialist head of state. But if the chairmen's waltz has been relatively smooth, the implications are profound. In addition to the domino effect of the changes, the appointments at UAP, BNP and Elf-Aquitaine will leave an enduring stamp on these groups after privatisation. Along with Mr Jaffre and Mr Pebereau, also close to Mr Balladur, Mr Friedmann will play a central role in the government's privatisation plans. He will prepare the insurance group for sale, with an expected target date of next year. By then, Elf-Aquitaine should also be in the private sector, along with BNP which was sold last month under Mr Pebereau's chairmanship. As chairmen of private groups, the three will enjoy stability of tenure. 'Unlike the public sector where mandates are just for three years, it is very hard to remove chairmen of private companies in France,' says one French banker. 'Mr Balladur is ensuring that he has trusted men in key posts for a long time.' In addition to removing their own groups from the public sector, the new chairmen are likely to provide an important part of a system of cross-shareholdings in privatised groups. Elf-Aquitaine bought just over 2 per cent of BNP when it was privatised and forms part of the bank's bloc of stable, long-term investors. UAP is expected to be one of the principal institutional investors in forthcoming privatisations, helping to compensate for the lack of powerful pension funds to help absorb the sale of shares in public sector groups. The main challenge for Mr Balladur's appointees, however, is going to be the management of their own groups. Mr Friedmann has not previously worked in an insurance company, although Mr Didier Pfeiffer, his respected deputy, is expected to ensure a smooth transition. Mr Jaffre at Elf, has not previously worked in industry. It is the Socialists, however, who face the more daunting task. Mr Peyrelevade must try to redress the situation at Credit Lyonnais, which suffered losses of FFr1.85bn (Pounds 210m) in 1992 and which is exposed to problem loans in property and industrial investment. In stepping into Mr Haberer's shoes he may feel he drew the trickiest hand in Mr Balladur's reshuffle.</p>

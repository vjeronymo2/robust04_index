			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Deal near in Senate on phones reform The US Senate commerce committee is expected to agree tomorrow on a far-reaching bill to overhaul the rules governing the telecommunications industry, after resolving a deadlock with competing telephone companies. While the House of Representatives has already passed its telecommunications reform bill, the Senate has been tied up in a battle between the Bell local telephone companies, heirs of the old AT&amp;T monopoly, and the long-distance telephone companies, including the new AT&amp;T. At the heart of the battle has been an argument over when and how to let the Bells into the long-distance market without letting them use their monopolies in the local telephone market to gain an unfair advantage. The Bells are barred from offering long-distance service under the 1984 court order that broke up AT&amp;T. One proposal sponsored by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the commerce committee, would have required the Bells to demonstrate that they faced real competition in their local markets before allowing them into long distance. A competing measure backed by Senator John Breaux, of Louisiana, would simply have imposed a one-year delay on the Bells. The compromise is understood to keep most of Senator Hollings's approach. It would, however, allow them to keep the lucrative market for calls that are too long to be local, but are still within a Bell company's area, until they are able to move into long distance. These 'short haul' calls carry high margins, and a customer who wants them to be carried by another company must usually dial a long access code, rather than simply the telephone number. However, passage of the bill is by no means assured because of the difficulty of finding time for debate.</p>

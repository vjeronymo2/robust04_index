			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Compass to Pounds 55.7m Compass, the catering and healthcare group, lifted profits by a third and turnover by 85 per cent on the back of acquisitions in Europe and the US. Pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to October 2 rose from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 55.7m on turnover ahead from Pounds 497m to Pounds 917.9m. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 216.2m to the latest sales figure. The figures include the first full year from Scandinavian Service Partner, the European caterer, and 15 weeks from Canteen Corporation, the third largest US caterer bought for Pounds 311.7m in early summer. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the acquisitions had settled in comfortably and were performing well. 'There are no surprises and no black holes,' he said of Canteen. 'If anything we feel more optimistic about the prospects than when we acquired it.' Shares in the group closed yesterday 5p down at 330p, still well ahead of the 270p of the 6-for19 rights issue that raised Pounds 146m towards buying Canteen. Earnings per share rose from 17p to 19.2p. The board is proposing to lift the final dividend to 4.56p (4.06p), taking the total for the year to 6.75p (6.06p). The acquisition of Canteen almost doubled the catering division's turnover to Pounds 851.2m, yielding operating profits of Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 33.7m). Margins fell from 7.7 to 5.7 per cent. European catering turnover rose almost fourfold to Pounds 196.5m, and profits rose to Pounds 10.8m from Pounds 2.9m. Again, margins were easier at 5.5 per cent (5.8 per cent.) In the UK profits edged ahead to Pounds 31m on sales of Pounds 456.1m (Pounds 382.2m). The group estimated that the 23 days of the rail strike cost it Pounds 1.7m in lost profits. After adjusting for the rail strike, margins declined from 8 per cent to 7.1 per cent. The lower margins reflected the effect of the new businesses, said Mr Mackay. Underlying margins were moving forwards. Margins at Canteen were flat at 3.3 per cent, which the group believes indicates a bottom. It believes it can lift US margins, which are generally lower than those in Europe, to 5 per cent in the next three or four years. In contrast the healthcare group margins are more than 21 per cent. Sales and profits from the group's 15 hospitals were up 10 per cent at Pounds 66.7m and Pounds 14.4m respectively. Net debt at the end of the year was up from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 213.4m. Interest payable rose from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 7.1m, covered 8.8 times. COMMENT The City was looking for reassurance following the bold acquisition of Canteen. Compass is acting swiftly, building up its management teams, relocating the headquarters, investing in new systems, and getting out of loss making contracts. There appears no reason to doubt that margins have bottomed out. The group is now well positioned to take advantage of good growth opportunities in three big markets, so further large scale acquisitions can be ruled out. Pencilled-in profits this year are Pounds 75m, with earnings more than 20 per cent higher at 23.5p. The prospective multiple of just over 14 still looks attractive for a group with so much still to go for.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Dymarskiy, RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent, </F> from Paris specially for SEGODNYA under the "Problem" rubric:  "Yevgeniy Saburov Considers Crimea a Region of Political  Stability, but Fears Kiev's Resistance to Economic Reform"]    [Excerpt] Yevgeniy Saburov, science chief of the Russian  Government's Information and Social Technologies Center and  Crimean deputy prime minister, who is on a visit to Paris as a  participant in the conference "How To Do Business in Russia,"  told your correspondent in an exclusive interview that talk  about political instability in Crimea was an insinuation by the  mass media, because if this were really so foreign capital would  not have come there. But at present there are a number of  foreign companies, including French ones, operating in Crimea,  whose economic potential is oriented toward Russian markets.    Yevgeniy Saburov pointed to a difference in principle  between  his current activity and what he did in Vladimir Oblast, where,  he said, significant successes were achieved. Crimea, unlike  Russian regions, is a fairly independent entity that has its  own, albeit incomplete, statehood. Its prospects, the Crimean  deputy prime minister said, depend on drastic changes in  legislation, and this is its main difference from the Russian  situation. Few people know, Yevgeniy Saburov said, that three  edicts have already been signed -- on taxes, on currency  regulation, and on banks. "The Kiev authorities," he added,  "have assured me that any economic transformations will only be  welcome, but I have information that they are already beginning  to put up some resistance. If Ukraine really treated us as its  own territory, and the Crimean population as its own population,  they would have hardly resorted to such actions."    "Initially it seemed to me," Yevgeniy Saburov continued,  "that there is no political bottom line to the Crimean issue,  but only a financial problem, particularly the splitting of the  Black Sea Fleet. In this case the issue is who will have the  right to sell decommissioned ships and who will receive lease  payments -- Ukraine or Crimea. Facts show that Kiev wants to  have this money for itself, although it is Crimea that supplies  Sevastopol with water, food, and all the rest. I think such  conduct is unethical."    At the same time, Yevgeniy Saburov went on, political  implications of the problem are becoming more and more visible.  Kiev is doing its utmost to hamper integrationist processes in  Crimea, fearing that it may lose not only the peninsula, but  also Donbass, Lugansk, Nikolayev, and Odessa -- a vast territory  that accounts for over one-half of Ukraine and, like Crimea, is  attracted by Russia. "I would like to deal with purely economic  matters, but I understand that I will also have to tackle  political problems, although I am not at all enthusiastic about  that," Yevgeniy Saburov stated.

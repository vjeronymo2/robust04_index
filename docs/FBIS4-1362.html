			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing in the  Zambian capital. The two sides met face to face yesterday  morning, in the presence of the mediators, to discuss the  conclusion of the electoral process. It was agreed at that  meeting that the two sides would enjoy an equitable distribution  and control of state finance during the electoral campaign.    Meanwhile, the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] continues to believe that the existing Electoral  Law must undergo some changes so that the grave errors of  September 1992 do not occur again. The media will not have the  right to broadcast election results before the National  Electoral Council has done so.    Nevertheless, the Luanda team to the Lusaka talks continues  to defend its position that everything must stay as it was in  1992. In view of that, no one knows whether the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT]  intends to perpetrate electoral fraud yet again against the  people of Angola.    The mediators headed by UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye have been tireless. Blondin Beye has already  delivered yet another general document to the two sides in a bid  to narrow differences between UNITA and the MPLA-PT in those  areas.    The two sides are expected to have met again yesterday to  start analyzing the new proposal advanced by the mediators.</p>

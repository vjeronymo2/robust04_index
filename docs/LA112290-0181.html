			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> RECYCLING OFFICIAL RESIGNS  </P> <P> The city's waste reduction coordinator, Jane Hinshaw, is resigning, effective  this week.  </P> <P> Hinshaw, who was hired in August, said she was quitting for personal reasons.  </P> <P> As the recycling coordinator -- which was a new position -- she oversaw a study  of the city's amount and types of trash. The report, issued last week, will be  the basis for devising ways to reduce the amount of waste 25% by 1995 and 50%  by 2000, as mandated by a recently enacted state law.  </P> <P> Hinshaw said she was proud of the report and the steady increase in recycling.  Last month, 96 tons of newspaper, glass, plastic and other recyclable materials  were left at the city's nine drop-off sites, up from about 55 tons when the  program started in April, Hinshaw said.  </P></p>

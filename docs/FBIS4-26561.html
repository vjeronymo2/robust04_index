			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (CNS) -- The Director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council of China  was interviewed by deputy-chief of the international affairs  department of the WALL STREET JOURNAL yesterday. He expounded  China's stance on negotiations on issues of the new airport, No.  9 Wharf project, the legislative election of the future Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, choice of the Chief  Executive and the press freedom in Hong Kong after 1997.    With respect to the Sino-British negotiations on the new  airport of Hong Kong which had attracted broad attention, Mr. Lu  said the Chinese side had been always hoping to solve the issue  of the new airport of Hong Kong as early as possible through the  Sino-British negotiations. Since liabilities left for the  future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  by the Hong Kong authorities in its financial budget for the new  airport greatly surpassed HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars], a  solution to this issue was yet to be reached. The Hong Kong  authorities now expressed to increase investment in the new  airport project, thus making it possible to reduce liabilities  to be left for the future government of the region. Therefore,  the issue of the new airport could be expected to be settled  soon. But settlement of this problem depended on the British  side's cooperative stance and actual move.    When talking on the issue of the legislative election of  Hong  Kong, Mr. Lu stressed again the Chinese side advocated an  "orderly and gradual" democratic electoral method with an aim of  realization of the smooth transition as well as maintaining  stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.    As for the issue of what are characteristics qualified for  the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region apart from those requirements stipulated in the Basic  Law, Mr. Lu answered the candidate for such a post would be  required to have administrative management experience, to enjoy  a high reputation among the Hong Kong residents and be  acceptable to the majority. The Chief Executive should be  elected by the Hong Kong residents in accordance with the Basic  Law.    With regard to the press freedom of Hong Kong after 1997,  Mr.  Lu said the Basic Law had relevant provision about this issue  and what was common practice today would still be practiced  after 1997. It was impossible to imagine that all six million  Hong Kong residents were in favor of socialism. On the  contrary, the majority of Hong Kong residents were probably not  for socialism. However, he said, he believed that most of the  Hong Kong residents would be surely in favor of "one China, two  systems". The Hong Kong residents may express their own  opinions freely, but it would be impermissible for any one to  take actions trying to use Hong Kong as a basis to subvert the  Chinese government.</p>

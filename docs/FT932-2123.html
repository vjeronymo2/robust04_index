			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / French ministers balk at new curb FRANCE'S legislative crackdown on crime and clandestine immigration has provoked a backlash from two powerful centrist ministers. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie and Mrs Simone Veil, UDF ministers of justice and social affairs respectively, have written to Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, to ask for government support in deleting an amendment which would let police demand identity papers of people they have 'any reason, apart from racial appearance, to believe are foreign'. The police powers bill of Mr Charles Pasqua, hard-line Gaullist interior minister, now before parliament, has widened the scope of police to make spot identity checks, but not to the extent the amendment's supporters would like. He appeared to indicate yesterday that he had no quarrel with the backbench Gaullist amendment, simply saying it was up to the Senate to decide what to do. Officials said yesterday that Mr Balladur would seek, on his return from the EC summit in Copenhagen, to defuse the row. The two UDF ministers said in their letter it was 'important for law-abiding foreigners not to feel discriminated against'. A 10,000-strong protest march, by left-wing and immigrant organisations opposed to the bill, was held in Paris at the weekend.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article from FINNANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section by Igor Krylov, </F> professor at the Independent Institute of Russian  Entrepreneurship: "The Advertising Law Should Protect the  Consumer"]    [Text] Recently the board of the Antimonopoly Committee  considered and approved the second version of the draft Law "On  Advertising." This 20-page text, which is fairly difficult to  understand and analyze, was sent at the same time to the  government and State Duma committees for remarks. In the opinion  of the chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Reform, Sergey  Glazyev, the Law "On Advertising" should be a priority in the  plans for legislative work.    Legal regulation of the advertising market is a mandatory  condition for its civilized development and protection of the  consumer from unconscientious, not to mention false,  advertising. In the United States, for example, the first  judicial proceedings on unconscientious advertising were  initiated in a case of the Federal Trade Commission (this state  organization was especially created to combat monopolies and  unfair competition as early as 1919).    In the absence of domestic experience and the corresponding  legal experts, we could make a big mess of the draft law.    Actually, this occurred with the first version of the draft  law (it was called "On Advertising and Advertising-Information  Activity") prepared in November of last year by a work group  consisting of workers of the Antimonopoly Committee. The  isolated nature of the work on the document led to a number of  legal errors and simply absurdities. A considerable portion of  the draft amounted to assigning the Antimonopoly Committee an  exceptional number of rights, including to impose fines.    In essence, the draft (the first and second versions do not  differ from one another here) introduces the position of a kind  of "state advertising inspector" who has the right to give  orders and impose fines for failure to fulfill them on  advertisers, advertising agencies, and the mass media. And these  fines are quite significant. In the second version of the draft  the Antimonopoly Committee and its territorial organs may impose  fines of up to 5,000 times the minimum wage (that is, as of  today, up to 75 million rubles [R]) on a legal entity, and up to  five times the salary on an individual. Let me note that for  violation of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of  Monopolistic Activity on Commodity Markets" of 22 March 1991 the  fines possibly imposed by the Antimonopoly Committee are set in  absolute figures and are much more modest (up to R1 million--the  fine imposed on a legal entity; up to R2,000--on officials).    Incidentally, the possibility of applying these punitive  sanctions against unconscientious advertisers was first granted  to the State Committee on Antimonopoy Policy and its territorial  administrations two years ago. It is well known that Article 10  of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic  Activity on Commodity Markets" includes in unfair competition  deliberately false advertising, incorrect comparisons in  advertising, unauthorized use of another's trademark or firm  name, divulgence and use of trade secrets without the owner's  permission...    Nonetheless in two years the State Committee on Antimonopoly  Policy and its territorial organs have not once taken advantage  of these legal possibilities, and committee specialists in  commentaries to antimonopoly legislation recommend combating  unconscientious competition by filing charges with a general or  arbitration court. What is keeping the Antimonopoly Committee,  instead of signing letters to television authorities on the  unconscientious advertising of MMM-Invest, from fining the  "leader of Russian business" at least a token million rubles for  the lie about the official approval of their "merits" by the  King of Belgium and the European Economic Community? Why is it  that while doing nothing to apply the rights they have in  fighting against advertising piracy, committee specialists are  demanding considerably greater ones?    The real danger from introducing the post of "state  advertising inspector" could be very, very great. On the one  hand, as distinct, for example, from the tax inspector, the fire  monitor, or the sanitary-epidemiological supervisor, the draft  law does not provide him with any clear-cut criteria to use in  his work. In complete contradiction to world practice, Point 2  of Article 23 of the draft establishes that "...in order to deem  advertising unconscientious it is not necessary to show a fact  of deception or a public danger of it. When there is a potential  possibility as such, which must be proved by the organ of state  administration (that is, the Antimonopoly  Committee)...advertising may be categorized as unconscientious."  In American judicial practice, for example, they clearly  understood the falseness of this path even by 1931 (in the  decision on the case "FTC v. Raladam," the U.S. Supreme Court  developed a precedent according to which advertising may be  deemed false or deceptive only if there is evidence of direct  harm from it).    On the other hand, anybody who is at all familiar with the  ways of doing business here will easily understand what a  desirable target for bribery the "state advertising inspector"  will be. It will be possible not only to completely ruin the  competitor but also line the pockets of one's own advertising  agency or advertising department of the mass media through  placement of counter-advertising, as it says in Point 4 of  Article 25 of the draft, "through the same means of  communication, using the same specifications of length, space,  location, and order of presentation of advertising." Reading  this, it is painful to recall our advertising realities: The  rate for the smallest advertising space--1/64, for example in  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already exceeded R2 million; and in  order to begin any negotiations on advertising on central  television you should be able to come up with at least 10  million.    The Antimonopoly Committee is extremely timid and unwilling  to share its rights with any professional association in this  sphere. In Point 2 of Article 30 organs of "self-regulation of  advertising activity" are given the right only to participate in  overseeing the observance of legislation on unconscientious  advertising "in conjunction with the corresponding organs of  state administration." Yet, for example, in France it is the  professional association of advertisers and representatives of  the mass media that annually issue to the agencies the so-called  accreditation card. Only possession of this card gives them the  right to the traditional 15-percent rebate from advertising  rates of the mass media. Such a practice of economic incentives  for the advertising agency to observe legal and  professional-ethnical norms would be more than appropriate for  us.    The clearly inadequate development of the draft in the  professional environment is also indicated by such strange  requirements as establishing the maximum volume of advertising  in a newspaper no later than three months before the end of the  subscription campaign or the need to store advertising materials  for a year. Experience shows that the editors have extremely  little chance of influencing the volume of the advertising flow;  just as it shows that in practice there are no original-mockups  of advertising in a form suitable for long-term storage,  permanent changes made in a text by fax, telephone, etc.    Fundamentally important norms in the draft are in need of  concretization--the peculiarities of financial advertising  (Point 6 of Article 18) and the prohibition of indirect  advertising (Point 2 of Article 16).    The Law "On Advertising" is among the normative documents  which, on the one hand, are most important for forming a  civilized market economy in Russia and, on the other, affect the  interests of the majority of Russians who during the past three  years have been forced, whether they liked it or not, to be  active "consumers of advertising." The main thing here is to  find the optimal combination of state intervention and  professional public self-regulation which, in my view, the  developers have not yet managed to do. It is not too late to  rectify the situation--it necessary to publish the draft law for  professional discussion and listen attentively to constructive  criticism of it.</p>

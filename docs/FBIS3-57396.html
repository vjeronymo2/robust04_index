According to the press service of the  Latvian Foreign Ministry, the delegation has come to Latvia to  discuss possible cooperation between Latvia and the United  States in military sphere as well as in security issues.    Andrejevs voiced his concern about the security of Latvia,  particularly in respect of the radar base in Skrunda, because  the presence of such site on the Latvian territory might cause  various misinterpretations and incidents. The U.S. delegates  said that, if the Latvian security was threatened, Latvia could  consult with NATO and make use of the opportunities offered by  the programme "Partnership for Peace". The head of the American  delegation said that his country understood Latvia's concern  over its security, therefore the contacts were being established  to launch bilateral cooperation.    The talks also dealt with issues connected with the  programme  "Partnership for Peace". Andrejevs said that the Latvian  Government was ready to sign the agreements on joining the  programme. The U.S. delegation said that NATO was offering a  possibility to consult with its advisors in order to find the  best kind of Latvian participation in the programme. The guests  also thought that the programme could encourage the Baltic  States to cooperate on security issues.    Speaking about the defence problems, Pavlovskis stressed  that  they are mainly financial problems. The U.S. delegates said  that a limited financial assistance could probably be obtained  from the NATO.</p>

The first two fatalities, for which no further data was  provided, were confirmed while the local health authorities are  already on the verge of desperation because the promised  equipment and insecticides have not arrived from La Paz to carry  out a new fumigation campaign against the mosquito that  transmits the virus.    Meanwhile, according to new reports collected by local radio  stations, there are high rates of incidence of malaria in the  communities of Puerto Rico, Nueva Esperanza, and Santa Rosa de  Abuna, with the affected provinces being Manuripi, Abuna,  Federico Roman, and Madre de Dios.    Pando Health Unit Director Juan Cayoja reported that a  commission from the National Health Secretariat is expected to  arrive within the next few days, and will bring a new  insecticide that the rural fumigation brigades will use.    It is precisely the lack of that insecticide--to replace the  old DDT which is no longer used because it damages the  ecosystem--that was blamed in early October as the reason for  the suspension of the fumigation activities, which resulted in  the malaria outbreak.    Now the insecticide INCON will be used, which does not  damage  the environment, Cayoja said.    He added that in addition to the two deaths, approximately  one thousand people throughout the department are infected with  malaria, and more deaths are feared from lack of resources to  assist them in a timely fashion.    Cases of malaria have also appeared in the poorer  neighborhoods of Cobija, inhabited primarily by farmers.    According to Cayoja, the health alert will be in effect  during the entire rainy season, which recently began.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "Where Were We?"] </F>   [Text] I think that any presentation would be superfluous.  It is us, those you already know, almost all of us. We hope  that we will have just as many readers, from whom we have  received touching demonstrations of affection and solidarity  during these months of forced silence. I think that none of  them, seeing IL GIORNALE today--as its editor (the real one)  wanted it, of course--can still have any doubts over the  necessity, in which we found ourselves, to leave it. These  words are by no means intended to be controversial: to each his  own ideas and above all, his own style. Ours induces us to  immediately clarify certain points to those readers who will  want to follow us.    The first concerns the shareholders of LA VOCE. Upon leaving  IL GIORNALE I swore to myself in public: "Never again an  owner." There are no owners here. The ownership is divided  among 100 or so shareholders none of whom, by statute, can hold  more than 4 percent. First among these are all of us: the  editorial staff, clerks, messengers, drivers. But anyone can  become a shareholder as of now with one or more 500,000 lire  shares: All he must do is submit an application and he will  become a "partner" in LA VOCE. This shareholding has been  defined by the high ranks of the financial world as being a  "ragamuffin" because of its dustheap nature. We do not dislike  this term: At this time it is better to stay among the rags  than among the kickbacks.    The second commitment to our readers is our independence  from  any political force, even if we will have to opt for one of  these on 27 March and everybody is asking us--by letter,  telephone, on the street, to the point of being  asphyxiating--which it will be. This is a matter that we will  begin to face tomorrow, but we can make a premise: Even if we  do succeed in formulating one, it will be a preference with a  condition. A recent experience, which we do not want to repeat,  gave us firsthand experience in the incompatibility of our way  of being with the manners of the politicians and their palace,  with whom we do not want to have anything to do. (The author  thinks that he has already demonstrated this by refusing to go  and occupy one of the more comfortable seats.) No preliminary  question of sympathy or ill will can succeed in breaking up our  equidistance from the forces in the field and from their  representatives. If, for example, the Knight [Berlusconi  nickname] were to line up with the positions that long before  being his were and remain ours, by giving up that man of  providence attitude that takes away any credibility from his big  words, we will give him a loyal hand. We intend to do this  solely as free men and journalists and not as the master's  clerks and buglers. Who knows if the master will see the  difference. But I think the reader will appreciate it.    Third commitment: The language. I do not know if there are  still Italians who can distinguish between firmness and  virulence and who prefer calm reasoning and talk to shouts and  invectives. I doubt so, given the triumphant audience reached by  the Olympics of charlatanism and scurrilous language that  television in particular--public and private--delights us with  in the evening. However, whether they are few or many, we will  address ourselves to these readers in the hope that they will  appreciate us. This is why we chose this masthead. At the  beginning of the century LA VOCE, thanks to its founder  Prezzolini, was an arena, not only of great culture, but also of  high journalistic civility. We do not aspire to reaching this  level but are resolute in honoring the name, primarily in style.    Postscripts. In order to be on the newsstand before 27  March, LA VOCE bet the Guinness Book of Records with  its two month preparations. Our readers should pardon any  starting defects: We will correct them as we go.    Second. LA VOCE will not be published on Mondays and will  cost 1,500 lire. We are the first to regret this. But, since  we can only count on our own resources, we had no other means of  balancing the accounts. We hope that our readers will find that  the quality of the product compensates for the higher price.</p>

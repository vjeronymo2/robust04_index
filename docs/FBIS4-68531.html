			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aman Tuleyev, Federation Council deputy, </F> conducted by correspondent Nadezhda Garifullina: "At the Limit  of Patience"]    [Text] The deputies of the Federal Assembly supreme  chamber greeted the appearance of their colleague, Aman Tuleyev,  in the Federation Council meeting hall with a bouquet of  flowers, a hearty welcome by the speaker, and enthusiastic  applause. And there was good reason for congratulations: At the  elections to the local organ of power in the Kuzbass, Tuleyev's  block had won a "crushing victory" over the candidates of  pro-presidential "democratic" orientation. Out of 30 elected  deputies, 23 are in Tuleyev's command. During the break, I  sought out Aman Gumirovich and relayed to him the  congratulations of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA readers and journalists,  and asked:    [Correspondent] What did the voters talk about at the  meetings? What does the oblast population expect from the  Legislative Assembly?    [Tuleyev] The meetings were very difficult. People have been  driven to the brink of desperation. It is that way everywhere,  and I met with all strata of the population, including the  miners, of course. I will never forget the discussion which  lasted for many hours at the "Fizkulturnik" mine, where the  representative of the miners' trade union was also present. The  attitude in the collective is already on the brink of breakdown.  And what can it be like if the miners are demanding that what  they earned in November be paid out to them at least in March or  April?! I remember, some speakers said openly: "If they do not  meet our demands, we will take our pick axes and begin breaking  down the shop stalls, the commercial buildings, the  mayoralities." I say: God forbid, of course, that this  "merciless riot" should occur. Its echo would carry disaster  throughout all of Great Russia, and then it would be the end of  all. Can it be that they do not understand this here, in Moscow?    I visited the "Yuzhnaya" mine. My heart bled. The miners had  begun to pass out from hunger. They are going to the coal mines  hungry!... When has such a thing ever happened? Even during the  war they cared for the people and found ways to support and help  them. But here they are demanding their lifeblood, what they  have earned! Cases of passing out from hunger have been recorded  also in the city of Berezovskiy. The "Pervomayskaya" mine has  been on strike in this city for a month now. Because the miners,  and all the population in general, find themselves in most  difficult, inhuman conditions.    [Correspondent] The fact that the Tuleyev block won the  majority of the mandates in the local organ of self-government,  it seems to me, is a rather indicative fact. As it turns out,  most of the voters of the mining kray have gone over to the  opposition against the ruling regime, and an active process of  rejecting the policy of anti-popular reforms has begun?    [Tuleyev] Yes, the miners themselves are posing the question  of trust in the president. And at the meetings they have often  announced: "We have trust in no one!" Recently, at the request  of the Association of Enterprises and Organizations of the city  of Kemerovo and, naturally, the voters, I sent a deputy's  request to the president, the chairman of the government, and  the speakers of both chambers of the Federal Assembly. This, if  you will, was the soulful cry of thousands and thousands of  people. We studied the systematic reporting on the economy and  the social sphere. We analyzed the meetings with labor  collectives, with the people at their place of residence, and  with managers of all forms of ownership which were held in the  course of the pre-electoral campaign to the Legislative  Assembly. And we came to the irrefutable conclusion: Processes  of disintegration of industry, agriculture, construction and the  social sphere are being consistently implemented in the Kuzbass.    [Correspondent] The conclusion is a difficult and bitter  one,  but are you not exaggerating a bit?    [Tuleyev] Judge by the figures: The decline in volumes of  industrial production in the last three years has comprised over  40 percent, and in construction--around 60 percent. The base  coal industry of the Kuzbass has fallen to the level of the  50's, the chemical industry--of the 60's, and the light and food  industry--to the level of the 70's, to the times when these  sectors were just emerging in our oblast. Hidden unemployment is  reaching 40 percent, while at some enterprises up to half of the  workers have been laid off. Highly skilled workers are becoming  "shuttle runners," "stall-keepers" and second-hand dealers, as a  result of which the threat of stoppage of complex types of  production has arisen due to a shortage of workers. Labor  productivity has fallen to one-third of what it used to be in  industry, and on the whole the economy of the Kuzbass has been  thrown back to the level of the 60's. And this is in peacetime,  half a century after the most destructive war in history... This  has led to ruin, desperation and hopelessness...    Mutual nonpayments have taken on the form of a mass epidemic  disaster. I will say without exaggeration that they have cast  the economy and the social sphere of the Kuzbass into a state of  collapse. The total amount of mutual nonpayments between  enterprises and organizations in Kemerovo Oblast--taking into  consideration the enterprises of other regions and the CIS  republics--reached over a trillion rubles by the end of March.    [Correspondent] But they say that supposedly all these  nonpayments are almost provocation on the part of the "red  directors?"    [Tuleyev] Rubbish! Everything has been destroyed--the  country, the communist party, the soviets which supposedly  hindered the implementation of "democratic transformations." Now  a new image of the enemy is needed. And so they found one: The  "red directors." In fact, however, the mass nonpayments are  caused by the actions of the government, which has refused to  finance, partially or fully, the enterprises of the TEK [not  further expanded] and the budget organizations, and to pay for  the agricultural production which has been taken from the  peasantry. Why, this is a modern form of corvee [feudalism]! The  nonpayments lead to a string of most acute conflicts in the  economy and in the oblast.    In general, if we speak with complete frankness, we must say  that the Yeltsin-Gaydar reforms have set us back not by 20-30  years, but to the epoch of the feudal natural economy. From  commodity-monetary relations, the economy of the Kuzbass has  begun to change over to exchange in kind. Barter is flourishing.  Wages here are paid in whatever you like--from irons, shoes,  fabrics and tobacco goods and even meat to medical preparations  and spare parts for automobiles.    I could go on forever citing examples of the destructive  processes, examples which confirm that the course being  implemented by the "reformers" is unpromising. I will say only  that the government of Russia and the local authorities are ever  more acting in the role of firemen; and in recent months they  are not even able to handle this role, as confirmed by the  results of the first quarter. A sad record has been set for rate  of decline in production--25 percent! Well, it seems that now we  should sound the alarm and urgently alter the course which is  ruinous to Russia. Nothing of the sort! The government of Russia  is not even thinking of correcting it. On the contrary, with  maniacal consistency it rejects any management and regulation of  the economic and social processes.    [Correspondent] Yes, it is certainly not in the best of  situations that the Legislative Assembly of the Kuzbass is  making its debut. Nevertheless, how did you begin?    [Tuleyev] At the first organizational meeting immediately  after the elections, we elected a chairman first of all. I will  not hide the fact that I am beholden to the deputies for their  trust. They voted unanimously for my candidacy, and by secret  ballot. Then we adopted the first document--the statement of the  Legislative Assembly, in which we announced ourselves as the  legal successors of the oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and  thanked our predecessors for their honest fulfillment of their  deputy obligations.    We will have to act under difficult conditions. We have a  great responsibility to the people, while our rights under the  constitution are laughable. Nevertheless, we must do everything  possible for the people, even under these circumstances and with  a poverty budget. I told the deputies: If we do not do anything  specifically in this most difficult situation, these will be the  last elections in the Kuzbass. The people will not go to vote  any more. Therefore, the deputy corps bears a huge  responsibility.    Currently, we are preparing our first resolutions. What have  they done here? The departments have staged competitions--who  will raise prices the most. Communications suppliers are raising  the telephone rates, municipal managers are hiking up the rent.  I might add that those who live in the center for some reason  pay less than those who live on the outskirts. Moreover,  expenditures for transport have risen sharply. Also, payment for  land takes up the lion's share of the family budget: 15,000 for  one sotok! Who can afford to plant a garden? Potatoes will be  like gold. And so it turns out that in every family, 70-80  percent of the income goes just for food. Of course, such a  policy lays the groundwork for social upheaval. Therefore, we  will solve these problems in first priority, and will think  about how to protect the population.    The tragedy of the Kuzbass lies in the fact that it has been  plied to death with drink. Last year, 1,9000 people were  poisoned by vodka which had been brought in. Is the domestic  variety not enough? They are even bringing it in from across the  border. 1,900 families have been left without breadwinners for  this reason alone. And the first request which I made to the  procurator general: We must bring to responsibility those who  are getting the people drunk. As it is, the Kuzbass is dying  off. The mortality rate exceeds the birth rate by 20,000 people!  You know, during my life I have passed through all imaginable  and unimaginable choices, but the last ones were the most  difficult: The people have already been beaten to the end. They  no longer believe anything or anyone.    I wrote about all this in that letter which I mentioned at  the beginning, the letter to the president, the prime minister  and the leaders of the Federal Assembly chambers. At the end I  added a note: I am sending this in order to clear my conscience.  The people have asked, and I have fulfilled their request,  although I know that these appeals will do no good. Therefore, I  asked: Give the rights to the regions, do not hang on to power.  As it is, you are doing nothing yourselves and not allowing us  to do anything.    [Correspondent] This time at the meetings of the Federation  Council you spoke twice on a most acute problem: The crime rate,  corruption, the mafia, the role of the procurator's office, and  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. As I recall, you even  said, addressing the deputies: "We all engage in self-deception  and lead a double game." These are harsh evaluations. What is it  that disturbs you in particular, if we speak of crime?    [Tuleyev] We are holding parliamentary hearings. Well, we  will speak, we will listen, we will shout a bit, we will adopt  laws. But what will change from all this? I have often appealed  to the minister of internal affairs and the procurator general,  citing blatant cases of corruption in the oblast. It is like  talking to thin air. The air did not even move! Any head of  administration knows that in every oblast they are aware of all  the corrupt dealers, swindlers and bandits. They could take them  all in one night, and the next day there would be order in  Russia. Yet those who are supposed to do this--do nothing. And  so we lie and lie, lie and lie. Why is the struggle not being  waged? Why, because the roots of corruption have penetrated into  the government itself, into the highest echelons. There has been  a very strong merging together of the state apparatus, the  administrations of all levels, the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  the KGB [secret police] or the MB [Ministry of Security], the  procurator's office, and so forth.    And so we, the deputies, are sounding the alarm: There is  corruption and bribery, there are mafioso clans in Russia! Yet  the president believes otherwise: Everything is normal in the  country, we are waging a struggle against corruption, and he  awards Russia's highest honor to the minister of internal  affairs. Well, where is this done? I would understand if Yerin  had become a Hero of Russia for a heroic struggle against the  mafia. But he distinguished himself by shooting defenseless  people in the House of Soviets!    Yeltsin, Shumeyko and Gaydar say that now we are creating a  class of property owners in Russia. We are creating it.  Moreover, by high-speed methods and on a criminal basis. I  stated openly at the Federation Council: Yerin is forced to keep  quiet, because if he springs up, he will be removed.    We are men of law, but our laws do not work, our edicts do  not work. If a person wants to act in accordance with the law,  he is killed. I will not recall the renowned Moscow terrorist  actions of recent days, but all this is "flourishing" also in  the provinces. Murder for hire is becoming the norm of our  abnormal existence. The commercial director of the Kuznetsk  Metallurgical Combine, carrying out the will of the government,  shipped orders where they were supposed to be shipped--to the  government. Well, and what happened? They shot him along with  his wife, riddled him with bullet holes like a dog. The laws are  not being carried out. Everything is dictated by the mafia. If  you do not fulfill the order of the mafia, that is the end of  you. And every manager, every head of administration, lives in  fear.    For me this is a most basic question: The entire tragedy  lies  in the fact that the laws do not work, and the first violator is  the President of Russia himself. If only he were to set the  example of a respectful attitude toward the law and the  constitution by saying: "Here is the law. It may not be perfect,  but it must be fulfilled!" After all, why do you think I spoke  out in support of Kazannik? To speak honestly, I must say that  my attitude toward him has always been negative, but in the  amnesty situation Kazannik acted courageously. He was the first  person to stand up in defense of the law. The first person who  said a firm "no" to telephone law. Enough of violating the law!  That is why I supported him.    And to the acting procurator general, Aleksey Nikolayevich  Ilyushenko, I said directly: You should not try to become  procurator general. The people will not believe you anyway.  Moreover, we must remove Minister Yerin for the lawlessness in  the country, and announce early presidential elections. If we do  not do this, nothing will change. We can adopt a hundred  wonderful laws, but the first ones to violate them will be the  president, the MVD, the procurator, and so forth... As long as  these people are in power, we, unfortunately, will not be able  to accomplish anything.    I am glad that all the deputies in our oblast Legislative  Assembly are professionally trained people, some of whom are  former chairmen of soviets, and that all have a fervent desire  to work. Now we will begin to strike at corruption. We have made  a number of inquiries, and based on the results we will publish  a list of corrupt bureaucrats and will demand their resignation,  especially in the upper echelons of Russian power. As for  Moscow, I would like to emphasize once again: One way or the  other, early presidential elections cannot be avoided. The  sooner we re-elect the president and the government, the better  it will be both for them, and for Russia, and for the cause.    [Correspondent] You said that the Kuzbass has reached its  final limits. But do you realize what has to be done in order to  stop the slippage into the abyss?    [Tuleyev] I would propose a minimum program of urgent  measures in the economy and in the social sphere: To begin the  management of the economy by methods which have been tested in  world practice and in our country in past decades; to use  indicative economic planning (instead of the directive form used  in Soviet times), which is widely used in many countries of the  world and in major corporations; to return validity to various  forms of the state order, with precise adherence to  responsibilities on the part of the state; to return to the  compilation of national economic balances and economic balances  by regions, with the application of market levers of their  realization; to change over to the regulation of prices and  incomes, and to immediately review the tax benefits granted to  producers of goods and services...    These are but a few points. Altogether there are 14 of them,  first priority and immediate tasks. I will not list all of them.  I have insisted and will continue to insist on the immediate  indexation of wages, pensions, stipends and subsidies, based on  the rates of inflation. We must stop the continued  impoverishment of the population. Having toured the entire  oblast in recent weeks, I was simply appalled by the crying  poverty of the people. In the Kuzbass today, one-third of the  population is poverty-stricken. One in every four families  either never sees meat, or can afford it only once a month. And  all this is on the background of the furious rates of  accumulation of wealth by 5-7 percent of the population of  Kemerovo Oblast. I will never reconcile myself to this. At every  meeting with the voters--in the mining and other collectives--I  spoke about my social program, and everywhere they understood  and supported me. This is dear to me. It is my faith in the  people and their support that gives me the strength to live and  to fight.</p>

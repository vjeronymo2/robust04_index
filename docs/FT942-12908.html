			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Pakistan primes flagship for sell-off - PTC could be be worth Dollars 9bn The Pakistan government plans to appoint a group of consultants by the end of this month to put a value on Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) in the first phase of preparing the company for privatisation later this year. The consultants' report is expected to be followed by preparation of a schedule for the sale of 26 per cent of PTC's shares. The government wants to sell those shares to a 'strategic investor' - a consortium or individual company committed to technical modernisation of phone services. Another 25 per cent of the company will probably be sold through a public floatation. The PTC is widely regarded as the flagship among Pakistan's government-owned companies which are being offered for privatisation. The company has expanded rapidly over the past three years, investing up to Dollars 1bn to add phone lines to its network. As a result, the number of subscribers has almost doubled to 2.2m. Another 670,000 customers are expected to be connected within the next year. One sign that the backlog of potential subscribers has eased came recently when the company for the first time advertised in Karachi - Pakistan's largest city and business capital - offering to provide instant connections. The company's growth is reflected in profits and the value placed on its assets. Government officials involved with promoting privatisation programme say the company could be worth almost Dollars 9bn. Last year, PTC earned net profits equivalent to just over Dollars 500m. In spite of PTC's lucrative business potential, its privatisation has been dogged by controversy. The process was held up for more than two years, largely due to objections from the armed forces over fears that its takeover by the private sector would be a threat to national security. But last month, the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, overcame those objections after giving assurances that part of the money raised through the PTC's partial privatisation would be used for setting up a smaller communication network exclusively for use by the armed forces. In spite of the government's determination to go ahead, many businessmen are concerned over the future of the plan. One, who has brokered three factory privatisations during the past three years, said: 'This is a giant. It would be hard to find many investors - institutional or private - who could easily bring together the financial package to buy it out. I suspect it may take between two to four years before private owners are able to come in.' He is sceptical of a Dollars 9bn valuation. 'If there has to be a substantial lowering of price, that could also cause a further delay,' he said. Last month, representatives of donor countries such as the UK, Germany and Japan, meeting with Pakistani government officials during the annual aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting in Paris, urged Islamabad to press ahead with its plans to privatise telephone, gas and electricity companies. Some Pakistani officials and economists acknowledged that such privatisations offered the only hope of repaying part of of the country's foreign debt of more than Dollars 28bn. More than two-thirds of the country's annual budget of about Rs300bn (Dollars 10bn) is taken up by on debt servicing and defence, leaving scant resources for projects such as road construction, energy, healthcare and education.</p>

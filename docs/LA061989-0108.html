BRIEFING;  </P> <P> COMPUTE ASSOCIATES TO BUY CULLINET  </P> <P> Computer Associates International Inc. said today it will buy Cullinet Software  Inc. for about $320 million in stock, a move that will strengthen its standing  as the world's biggest independent software company.  </P> <P> Computer Associates had $1.03 billion in revenue last year, becoming the first  software company to reach the billion-dollar mark. Cullinet had revenue of $203  million.  </P> <P> Both companies get most of their revenue from software that runs on big  mainframe computers made by International Business Machines Corp., although  Computer Associates' appetite for acquisitions has carried it into other  fields.  </P> <P> Computer Associates is headed by Charles B. Wang, who has vowed to increase  revenue by 30% a year. Its growth strategy has vaulted it ahead of such  better-known companies as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Inspector Hans-Joerg Kuebart by an </F> unidentified FOCUS correspondent; place and date not given:  "The Fighter Is Indispensable"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Were you worried about the delays in the  development of the "Light Fighter?"    [Kuebart] The Air Force needs a new fighter plane as of  2002. The decision about procurement is to be made in 1995.  Therefore, it is important that there are no delays in the  development of the new fighter, which would call the date of  such a decision into question.    [FOCUS] Do you need a fighter plane at all?    [Kuebart] The fighter plane is an air defense means with  specific strengths, which other air defense means do not have to  the same extent. I just mention the particular flexibility, the  great range, and the speedy deployment of flying air defense.  In particular in the new air defense concept, which is oriented  toward area protection and focal points in the future, the  fighter plane thus becomes an indispensable element. In the  future, too, a credible and effective air defense will be  possible only in a construct that unites ground-based and  air-based weapons systems.    [FOCUS] Do you think the procurement of 140 planes is  sufficient -- particularly with a view to out-of-area missions?    [Kuebart] The Bundeswehr needs a modern and efficient  fighter plane as a successor to the F-4F Phantom to exercise  German rights of sovereignty in the air space, to make an  appropriate contribution to the alliance, to sufficiently secure  the effectiveness of NATO's air defense in Central Europe  together with the allied armed forces, and to contribute to the  protection of the allies in crises. The number of planes, which  has been considerably reduced compared with the original Air  Force plans, takes the changed security policy conditions into  consideration.    [FOCUS] Will the "thrift" fighter have to be reequipped  sooner or later?    [Kuebart] In the view of the Air Force the operational  demands on the new fighter plane, which have been changed as a  result of the reorientation, are acceptable and do not require  short-term corrections.</p>

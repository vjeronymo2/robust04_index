			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: DSM in short production cut DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday reconfirmed the dire state of the European petrochemical industry when the company announced it was cutting production temporarily between Christmas and January 1 next year. Petrochemical manufacturers normally try to keep their capital-intensive plants running at full capacity to cover their fixed costs. The company said it would cut high density polyethylene and polypropylene production because of poor prices and high stock levels. DSM refused to detail the scale of the cutbacks. DSM's move follows a decision in September to cut ethylene production on one of the trains on its second cracker. DSM has annual capacity to manufacture just over 1m tonnes of ethylene and 220,000 tonnes of high-density polyethylene. Mr Arthur Spiertz, public affairs manager, said: 'DSM is dissatisfied with current market prices and associated profitability levels, so the lower output also serves to support the company's price policy.' The move highlights the plight of the sector, which is suffering from massive overcapacity. Five European manufacturers are expected to introduce an additional 2m tonnes of ethylene capacity between 1991 and 1994. European operating rates are presently about 85 per cent.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Eat, drink and be merry . . . - Radio FAITHFUL LISTENERS to the Bible readings on Radio 4, LW, had a treat this week with Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon. The notional Preacher 'commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry', but then decided that 'all is vanity'. His conclusions are unhappy, but the Authorised Version's expression of them superb. Robert Stephens read it appropriately. He also read in the Song of Solomon, but this anthology of allegorical intimacy is partly a woman's song, and the rose of Sharon was ably personified by Cathy Tyson. The near-theatrical style, directed by Ned Chaillet, sounded well, as the lovely familiar phrases poured forth. This was not vanity. More familiar phrases on Sunday in Radio 3's Macbeth. It is good to hear fresh voices in well-known lines; Tim McInnerny was a convincing Macbeth and Harriet Walter a musically menacing Lady. I liked Kim Wall as Malcolm, a young voice with energy that increased as events demanded. David Robb rightly gave Banquo more dignity than Macbeth. I found the Weird Sisters tame; perhaps they were as scared of Richard Avery's Hecate as I was. We had much soldierly singing, and a lot of Latin that would have stung the Scots to some equally untextual condemnation of the Pope. But in general Nigel Bryant gave a good, straightforward, only modestly-cut production. Also on Radio 3, A Hard Heart, a new play commissioned from Howard Barker. This opens at the Almeida Theatre in a fortnight's time, and is broadcast again on April 21 - an unusual tribute to the relative values of live and broadcast theatre. The story is simple: Riddler, a brilliant, arrogant woman, persuades the Queen that she can save their besieged city if her spoiled son Attila is excused military service. But while she works at her tactics, she is distracted by a vagrant improbably in love with her. She sends him to the enemy lines with details of the defence layout, thinking that they won't believe such an obvious trick. But Attila has signalled it all from the roof of his chamber, so that he will be spared when the assault comes. Riddler maintains that she has never failed, yet she must see the Queen cutting her wrists at the defeat. The vagrant holds that the scheme worked - but only in that it proved Riddler's love for him. The emotional pattern is bold, if hard to sympathise with; Anna Massey's Riddler may indeed have thought herself a god. Douglas Hodge depicted a nasty young Attila, and Kenneth Cranham a rather sane vagrant. Only Deborah Findlay's Queen was granted any dignity. Tactics, for what they are worth, are weak; director Richard Wortley has asked for constant artillery, but there is little other evidence of battle. Radio 4's Classic Serial (first of six parts last Saturday) is Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, adapted by John Peacock and directed by Jane Morgan. Though time passes swiftly, the first instalment is mostly involved with deploying the characters; and unless we know the novel we don't yet know how much they'll matter. The scene is in Lubeck in the last century, the background is high-level business, the Generaldirektor, Johann Buddenbrook, is Jack May. Take it from here The motion at the Radio 4 Debate on Sunday, at the Royal Geographical Society, was that the only way to save the planet is for the West to accept a lower material standard of living. I won't recount the arguments made, many of them the matter of common discussion among sensible people, apart from that brought out by Tom Burke, adviser to the Environment Secretary (opposing). It is a dangerous delusion to suppose that a moral revolution can possibly save the planet, he said, and in audible capital letters, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. He is probably right, but the motion was carried by 112 votes to 43.</p>

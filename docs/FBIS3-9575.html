			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "No Longer Relevant...."] </F>   [Text] In a public opinion poll conducted by the  Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic in March, 1,273  citizens were asked to reply to the question: "Which politician  active in the Slovak Republic enjoys your trust at present?"  The replies acquired do not yet reflect the situation that  arose after the 27th meeting of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic with its consequences [passage of the vote of  no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar's government and the  appointment of a new government]. Compared with the poll  carried out in early February, there was a visible increase in  trust in President Michal Kovac and a reduction in the  proportion of citizens who do not trust any politician.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trust in Representatives of Political Lifein Slovakia as Expressed by Citi-|  |zens(in percent)                                                           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Jan               |Feb               |Mar               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Meciar   |23                |22                |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Michal Kovac      |23                |20                |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Weiss       |12                |15                |16                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ivan Gasparovic   |9                 |8                 |7                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jan Carnogursky   |5                 |5                 |6                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozef Moravcik    |5                 |5                 |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do not trust any  |41                |43                |31                |  |politician        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

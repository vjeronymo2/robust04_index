			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BAKKERS 'THANKFUL' FOR VISIT  </P> <P> Tammy Faye Bakker, in Minnesota for about a week to visit her husband, says  that imprisoned former television evangelist Jim Bakker is "doing as well as  can be expected." Mrs. Bakker, accompanied by the couple's son, Jamie, and  Bakker's sister, Donna Puckett, spent about six hours on Thanksgiving Day at  the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., where Jim Bakker is serving at  least the first months of his 45-year prison term for fraud and conspiracy.  "We're very thankful we could be together on Thanksgiving," Tammy Faye said.  "We had a nice visit."  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Bread lines 'IT IS tempting to suppose that one of the reasons why the peaceable Swiss have always shown so little in the way of riotous tendencies is to be found in all those gorgeous breads they bake and consume,' says author Sue Style, in A Taste of Switzerland (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages). With 3,000 small bakeries, plus those owned by chain stores, the 6m Swiss are serious bread fans. For my morning snack I was able to try tailleaux grebons, leaves of wholemeal pastry with bits of lard, fougassette, a bacon bread, sweet baby brioche and a croissant. Pain mi-blanc, pain a l'ancienne, pain complet and pain Vaudois were among a dozen others on offer. The thrifty Swiss never waste anything, as this Sue Style recipe shows. TORTA DI PANE (serves eight) A typical Tessiner family pudding made from stale bread, steeped in milk. Ingredients: 8oz stale bread (about 11 medium slices); 1 3/4 pints milk; 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla essence; 3 eggs; 1 tsp salt; 5oz sugar, 2oz plain (semi-sweet) chocolate, grated, or cocoa powder; 2 1/2 oz raisins. Optional: small grass of grappa, 2 1/2 oz pine nuts. Break up the bread and put in a bowl. Boil the milk with the vanilla and leave to infuse for a few minutes. Remove the pod, if used, and pour the milk over the bread. Leave for three to four hours or overnight. Reduce to a puree in a food processor or vegetable mill. Beat together the eggs, salt and sugar until light and fluffy. Add to the bread mixture, with the grated chocolate or cocoa powder, raisins and grappa, if using. Heat the oven to 180'C/350'F, Gas Mark 4. Pour into a shallow, buttered ovenproof dish, scatter pine nuts on top and bake for 1-1 1/4 hours or until set. Keeps well for several days in the refrigerator, covered with foil.</p>

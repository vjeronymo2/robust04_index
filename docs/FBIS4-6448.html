			<p>BFN     [Text] Security officials in the Ramos administration  yesterday expressed serious concern and alarm over the emergence  of radical Muslim extremist groups in Mindanao that are involved  in various criminal activities.    Acting Defense Secretary Feliciano Gacis, who briefed the  29-member National Security Council (NSC) on the internal  security and peace and order situation, said the radical Muslim  extremist groups "pose and immediate threat" to the security and  stability in southern Philippines. [sentence as published]    These groups, like the Abu Sayaff group, are giving military  and police authorities more problems than the Muslim  secessionist guerrillas because of their propensity to violence,  terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal activities in pursuit  of their objectives."    Several international Islamic organizations, particularly  those based in Libya and Pakistan are suspected to be providing  financial support to these groups which are attempting to  establish an Islamic society in the country.    Apart from these radical Muslim extremist groups, Gacis also  pointed out the rising criminality in southern Philippines which  is largely fueled by Muslim separatist guerrillas who are  turning themselves into bandits.    Commonly called "lost commands," Gacis said these groups are  also classified as threat to the peace and order in  predominantly Muslim areas in Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu and  Tawi-tawi.    These groups carry out various lawless activities, like  piracy, hold-up, robberies, extortion, illegal logging, and  kidnap-for-ransom.    Apart from internal security threats, which Gacis claimed to  be fast diminishing because of government's efforts to address  the root causes of rebellion, crime and other lawlessness,  members of the Ramos Cabinet also briefed the NSC about the  status of the government's reform programs in both political and  economic fields, the assessment of the impact of the oil price  increase, and the country's security concerns in East Asia,  particularly on the South China Sea area and the Korean  peninsula.    On the political and economic reforms, Executive Secretary  Teofisto Guingona claimed "the country is now poised for  take-off" because most of the economic and political reforms  have been put in place.    The economic reforms, Guingona explained, are designed to  level the playing field, promote global competitiveness and make  opportunities available to everyone in a fair and equitable  manner.    Among the major measures the government has done to  implement  these economic reforms were liberalizing the financial sector,  deregulating the transport and communications sector, and  reforming fiscal management, power sector, investment and trade,  agriculture, infrastructure, and environmental and natural  resources.    In the political field, Guingona enumerated the government's  gains in the peace process, peace and order, devolution and  implementation of the local government code and the redirection  of the foreign policy toward economic diplomacy.    Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, for his part,  outlined the country's position on the growing tension in the  Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / GPA may seek protection from its creditors GPA Group has established a working party to look at the implications of examination, the Irish equivalent to administration, if talks with bondholders prove unsuccessful. GPA is understood to have lined up an examiner, although creditors could request an alternative examiner. The troubled aircraft leasing company remains confident, however, that its meeting with bondholders on Thursday will lead to a moratorium on debt repayments giving it valuable breathing space to agree a deal with a 'white knight'. The examination working party is one of five committees set up under the overall restructuring, named Project Rebound. The other committees have been set up to deal with bondholders, potential new investors, existing shareholders and the aircraft manufacturers. Mr Patrick Blaney was recently appointed to the board as chief operating officer with responsibility for Project Rebound. GPA hopes to secure a debt moratorium with bondholders, which hold more than than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) of unsecured debt, when it meets them in the US on Thursday. The meeting is being organised by Mr David Ying, director at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house. The bonds are currently trading at around 15 per cent of their face value, indicating that the market does not believe that they will be paid in full. GPA has a temporary waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until May 17, when more than Dollars 50m of the bonds mature. A further Dollars 170m of bonds mature by the end of June. The group's lenders will only allow payment of the bonds if the group succeeds in persuading new shareholders to inject up to Dollars 200m. To this end the group is talking to GE Capital about the possibility of selling assets in exchange for warrants to subscribe for shares at a later date. If the talks do not prove conclusive in the short term a debt-for-equity swap with the bondholders is seen as inevitable. GPA is already considering one option whereby shareholders could see their holding in the company diluted to less than 5 per cent if bondholders swap all their debt for equity. Bondholders, some of which are being advised by Lazard Freres, are likely to resist such attempts, although they may be willing to swap some of their debt for equity. The company has been in informal discussions with bondholders for the past month. The talks are being led by Mr Mike Dolan, managing director of GPA Capital. According to one of the group's principal lenders, examination is being carefully considered although it remains the least favourite option. Examination gives a company court-ratified protection from its creditors for three weeks while an examiner or reporting accountant considers the options for its rescue. It then allows a further three months before formal proposals must be put forward. The group would not have to pay interest on its debt obligations or repay any of the principal to secured or unsecured creditors if it was to go into examination. Some of the group's core lenders oppose such a move, fearing that creditors would be able to seize GPA's assets, mainly aircraft, registered outside Ireland. Most of the banks also remain pessimistic about the group's chances of negotiating a satisfactory deal with GE Capital. Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, the Wall Street firm specialising in bank debt trading, said: 'By negotiating with GE in a vacuum it narrows the options for the remaining participants in the restructuring.'</p>

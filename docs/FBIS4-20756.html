			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Chalabi, chairman of Constitution </F> Committee of Iraqi National Congress]    [Text] It is common knowledge that the Gulf war would not  be considered over just with the liberation of Kuwait and the  defeat of Saddam Husayn and his regime, but rather it will be  considered over when the regime of Saddam Husayn is iradicated.  This is because aggression under all laws, legislation, and  customs does not end or stop by resisting the actions with which  aggression was perpetrated, but rather by resisting the  perpetrator, by punishing him, and by preventing him from  repeating the crimes he committed. Therefore, in order for the  punishment to be effectual the criminal must be apprehended.    Proponents of the strategy calling for Saddam's regime to  stay in power say that this regime, having endured confrontation  with storms, hurricanes, and earthquakes, while facing the  blockade imposed on it for more than three years, has shown a  unique ability to stand fast and to overcome difficulties. They  say this calls for ending the boycott against him in order to  resume economic and diplomatic relations with his regime.  Advocates of this idea do not forget to bring up the subject of  the danger of partitioning Iraq into a Kurdish state in the  north, a Sunni state in the center, and a Shiite state in the  south, that is in case the Baghdad regime were to cease to exist.    This strategy has undoubtedly scored some undeniable  success.  At the Security Council, Saddam's regime entered a new stage  favorable to him after the Security Council welcomed Iraq's  acceptance of Resolution 715. This resolution places all the  civilian and military establishments and installations under UN  observation and erects a system of constant monitoring and  verification aimed at preventing the Iraqi regime from  possessing prohibited weapons. Saddam Husayn has surprised the  Security Council by accepting what he previously constantly  rejected, speculating on the Security Council's reaction in  order to see where this will lead.    This speculation is based on the evaluation of the positions  of the Security Council members, the undercurrent of disputes  between members of the international alliance in the Gulf war,  particularly within the framework of the terms for lifting the  oil ban on Iraq, and the quest for dialogue and normalization  with Washington, which the Iraqi president is so anxious to  realize.    If those who advocate keeping Saddam in power in Iraq, such  as some Arab and European governments, oil companies, newspapers  publishers, writers, and commentators, be they Arab or non-Arab,  have achieved a measure of success--which is evident in bringing  certain countries closer to accepting his [Saddam's]  rehabilitation and reconciliation with him--those advocating his  removal from power have also scored an undeniable measure of  success in their strategy.    The Alliance, which the Iraqi National Congress [INC] has  set  up, is comprised of various races, communities, religions,  political currents in the Iraqi opposition, including Kurds,  Islamists, nationalists, democrats, and Marxists. The Alliance  has been able to build a geographic, physical, and human base  inside Iraq. This was something that the opposition had always  lacked before this achievement was realized. This Alliance,  represented by the INC, has also been able to establish a solid  political and organizational structure having its own  jurisdictions, powers, and authority--a step, the first of its  kind that the Iraqi opposition adopted. The Alliance has also  been able to gain a solid international ground, by virtue of the  international and regional recognition it gained. Those who  question its reality are only those who do not understand its  significance and dimensions or those who want to mislead the  people by distorting facts and obliterating them.    I do not understand why critics of the INC insist that one  and all members of the opposition should join it so that unity  can be achieved through it. It is known that in the principles  of politics and law consensus that includes every individual is  impossible, even in matters of jurisprudence, let alone in  matters of politics.    The proponents of the strategy that seeks to get rid of  Saddam are aware how skillful he is in cheating and misleading.  Clause 22 of Resolution 687, to which he adheres, essentially  consists of two elements. One is technical, contained in the  report by the committee charged with ensuring the removal of  weapons of mass destruction that the regime possesses, and the  second is political, relating to the Security Council's being  satisfied with what has been accomplished so far with regard to  the destruction of the banned weapons. It also concerns making  sure that [Saddam] will not again be able to possess such  weapons in the future. Therefore, it is not imperative that the  two elements be implemented in succession, whereby if the first  is implemented then it follows that the second should be  implemented too. This gives the Security Council the option of  lifting the embargo on Saddam's regime, even if the committee  concerned announces Saddam's compliance with the terms of the  aforementioned clause, as its chairman Rolf Ekeus declared.  [sentence as published]    It would have been far more equitable and right had the  Security Council acted according to Chapter Seven, since it is  empowered to do so by Resolutions 706 and 712, in order to force  the Baghdad regime to pump its oil and sell it and allocate its  revenues to meeting the people's basic needs for food and  medicine under UN supervision, as provided for in the two  resolutions in question. This would enable them to alleviate the  crushing hardship the Iraqi people are suffering and, at the  same time, prevent Saddam from once again utilizing the oil  revenues, if restored to his control, for his evil purposes and  reckless policy of subjugating the people and committing  invasion and aggression.    In light of the efforts of the strategy seeking to maintain  Saddam in office, it must be admitted that the counter-strategy  seeking to remove him has scored brilliant successes in the  international arena. The Iraqi opposition, as is known, has been  able to win international support for its struggle.    This support sometimes has come from the United Nations and  other times from influential international powers such as the  United States and Britain. It is worth mentioning that UN  support for the Iraqi people and Iraqi opposition in Resolution  688 issued by the Security Council recognizes the Iraqi people's  brave stand in the face of Saddam's regime, respecting its  rights, and setting out methods that would change the Iraqi  regime into a democratic regime respecting human rights.    The support and backing the influential international powers  have given the Iraqi opposition in order to achieve its  objectives of liberation and change has steadily increased since  it has been able to organize its ranks and enhance them with  cadres capable of undertaking serious work. This was realized at  the Vienna meeting in late June 1992 under the INC banner. One  of the expressions of strong support and backing that stand out  is that of Vice President Al Gore who on 1 September l993 sent a  message to the chairman of the INC Executive Council. (AL-HAYAH  September 1993 issue no. 11161).    In this context President Bill Clinton said in his message  to  the House of Representatives and the Senate in late November  1993 that the "only way for Iraq to return to the community of  civilized nations is through the democratic process, respect for  human rights, and adherence to the principles of international  behavior." He added: "The Iraqi Government should represent all  its people and abide by the integrity of its land and  sovereignty." He expressed the belief that "the INC adheres to  the objectives that would turn Iraq into a stabilizing force in  the Gulf area." He noted that "setting up a no-fly zone in  northern Iraq allows for monitoring of Iraq's compliance with  Security Council Resolutions 687 and 688 and deters it from  launching a major military assault in the area."    One might wonder of what use are these pledges and  commitments, with the United States having defaulted on many of  them, as it did in the recent case of Somalia. In order to  further clarify this point we would say that the INC leadership  is fully aware that international pledges and promises alone are  not enough. Therefore, they must be examined in order to see how  compatible they are with the interests of the party making them,  so that if there is an imbalance or lack of balance between  commitment on one hand and interest on the other, implementation  of such commitment will falter and sometimes even fall as has  actually happened in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti.    It must be recognized therefore that there is a great and  serious difference between the consequences of what happened in  Iraq and the area around it and of what is happening in Somalia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other parts of the world. When  Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, the United States dispatched to  the Gulf about 700,000 troops of allied forces with the latest  equipment and technology and the deadliest weapons. The United  States went ahead with fulfilling its commitments despite the  very heavy burden they constituted. At the same time it has been  unable or unwilling to send a few thousand troops to this or  that trouble spot in the world.    It must be admitted that the importance of strategic  locations in the world vary greatly and that the international  vital interests in those areas vary greatly too. Therefore, the  consequences of Saddam's aggression against Kuwait and the Gulf  region security should be dealt with with the same firmness and  effectiveness. Perhaps the interview THE NEW YORK TIMES  published on 19 January 1993 with the permanent U.S. delegate to  the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, in which she spoke about  what she called new terms that President Clinton's  administration is trying to impose on Iraq before the ban on its  oil exports is lifted, corroborates what we said.    In the interview Albright said the new U.S. position calls  for dealing with the question of sanctions in two stages. The  first is that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the committee responsible  for the Iraqi arms program, should testify that Baghdad has  abandoned nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs in  accordance with Resolution 687, and the second is that the  committee should prove that it is capable of actual monitoring  of the Iraqi industry in order to ensure that Iraq will not  return to producing such weapons. Albright said: "We want a  record proving compliance for a period of six to 12 months of  continuous monitoring."    In the preamble of its Resolution 687, the Security Council  has expressed its distrust in Saddam Husayn's regime, and this  is the resolution Saddam Husayn has been using as an excuse for  reconciliation and for lifting the seige. [as published] He has  shown that he is unable to respect any treaty, agreement, or  covenant that Iraq has signed or joined that aims at deterring  him from committing more of such actions. His peaceful  intentions are in dire need of being tested. He is in a state of  continuous blatant violation of Resolution 688. So far he has  failed to stop persecuting his own people and complying with  methods provided in the resolution for this purpose, the aim of  which is to end the dictatorial character of the Iraqi regime  and establish democracy in its place. It is true that the  resolution in question was not issued in accordance with Chapter  Seven of the UN Charter, as in the case of other UN resolutions  issued about the invasion of Kuwait and its consequences, but  this does not in any way mean that it lacks the force of law.  The resolution that was issued in accordance with Chapter Six of  the UN Charter becomes binding when it is implemented, as in the  case of setting up a no-fly zone and the security zone in  northern Iraq and the no-fly zone in the south.    In light of the above, one can see how the attempts at  reconciliation with the Saddam's regime have reached a dead end  because this reconciliation calls for conditions and obligations  that the present regime is unable to fulfill. First, it must be  established that all weapons of mass destruction in his  possession have been destroyed. Second, he should prove  categorically that he will not again possess any such weapons  now or in the future. Third, Saddam Husayn should finally and  irrevocably respect Kuwait's sovereignty and regional security  and accept the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders as  provided in Security Council Resolution 832. Finally, Saddam  should stop repressing the Iraqi people and should comply with  the provisions of Resolution 688 that calls for the  establishment of democracy and respecting human rights in the  country.</p>

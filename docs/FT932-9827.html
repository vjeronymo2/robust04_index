			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: BBC governors skate on thin ice - Television The BBC governors ought to be worried men and women. At the end of last year their charter renewal process seemed to be going swimmingly. Government had broadly endorsed the continuation of the status quo. The BBC countered with a promise of ever-extending choice, within a more accountable organisation. But now fault-lines are emerging, and look set to deepen. The reverberating row about top BBC salaries refuses to die down. Traditionally, these payments were loosely linked to the top end of the civil service. This financial year top civil servant rates, Sir Robin Butler and Sir Terry Burns apart, are a shade over Pounds 90,000. The BBC is now being credited with doubling those monies. So, governors have plainly brought the old policy to an end. What then is the new? And on what principles is it based? There is double danger for governors if they cite competitive pressure in the market. In the first place, being led by the nose by what others do is a recipe for broadcast inflation without end. Secondly, whenever the BBC too cheerfully bends a knee to the market, then it calls in question the special 'non-market' funding protection offered by the licence fee. Remember too that the licence fee is pegged to the Retail Price Index, as the bulk of the BBC workforce knows only too well. An unexplained fattening of differentials at the top therefore makes general staff relations ever more edgy. The governors would be wrong to hope that this problem will simply go away. Commentators will hang on each and every emerging annual report for the next twist in the story. If governors are regularly to be damned, there is a case for their publishing details of their salary policy now, in full, and putting their trust in public understanding. By chance the matching row over the LWT share scheme gives them a neat opportunity, not - it is to be hoped  -for making irrelevant comparisons, but simply in offering covering fire. A full explanation would give some substance to the governors' promise of 'openness,' of which so far there is little sign. Rather the governors dumbly close ranks when under fire, and so weaken any claim that they are genuinely independent, or representative of the broad public interest. The obvious cosiness between governors and its appointed management has inevitably emboldened others to seek to usurp the governors' function. So, both the ITC and the Radio Authority made a mark with proposals that they might take under their wing the relevant BBC services, thus reducing the BBC to but one client licence-holder among many others. It should be disturbing to BBC governors that they have left the Corporation wide open to takeover bids of this sort. The governors need to be seen to stand back and govern, which means giving management the necessary steer. Fortunately, opportunity is at hand. By now, reports from public meetings should have convinced any open-minded governors that the scheme for a Long Wave Rolling Radio News has little listener support, and continues to arouse special hostility among adherents to Radio Four. The governors have already said the scheme is on hold until reception of Radio Four on FM can be improved to listener satisfaction. They will now know that this too cannot be delivered except at exorbitant cost. Yet BBC management continues to turn a deaf ear. If 'accountability' has any meaning, then the accountable governors should require their management to put the scheme to one side. The BBC should press to retain an ability to offer extended commentary by way of a split service when occasion demands, as it did in the Gulf and as it may soon over Bosnia. This sort of editorial imperative is something listeners understand and accept. But the broader expansion into what would be a sixth free-standing network finds no following wind among the public, and will create a running sore if pressed. Greater long-term anxieties attend BBC management's introduction of what is known as Producer Choice, setting in place an internal market of great complexity and arguable value. It would be wrong to assume that BBC staff are wholly hostile to these new mechanics; best intelligence is that one third are wide-eyed believers, one third sullen sceptics, and one third bemused agnostics. What concerns all three groups, and should concern the viewers and listeners they serve, is that the process be seen to be independently assessed, so that sensible modifications can be put in place and benefits properly verified, not simply asserted. Here again is natural governor business. Unfortunately the recent record again gives pause. As part of the warm-up for the new arrangements, Pounds 60 million or more of television monies went unaccounted for. A gubernatorial explanation was promised but has yet to arrive. There is also a stubborn reluctance to come clean about the set-up costs for the new system, or for the monitoring of the system once in place. Yet, as the press now reminds us almost daily, the BBC is gaily recruiting systems-minder after systems-minder, a massive buildup of what must surely count as 'non-core' activity. Little wonder that the sceptics remain convinced that the whole exercise is designed not to save money but to force a casualisation of programme-making staff. Sceptics would further argue that the internal pricing is skewed to that end. The governors need to take these charges seriously. They have businessmen in their number well-equipped to take a quizzical look, spot where the new systems may be unproductively overburdensome, and then give the public a balanced assessment. It would be useful too to have at this early stage some idea of the expected outturn in terms of savings and operational efficiency. In the broad, are we to assume that the changes will prove themselves by enabling the BBC to live comfortably within its pegged licence fee throughout the next charter period? That high prize might be worth the fuss. Or, at the end of the exercise, will we be surprised by a supplementary bill? If that turns out to be the end game, then the licence-payers may well be moved to disbelieve grandiose management claims. And the BBC and its governors will be skating on extremely thin ice. Christopher Dunkley is on holiday. Brian Wenham was on the staff of the BBC 1969-1987, and is now on the Board of Carlton Television.</p>

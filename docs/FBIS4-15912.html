			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 12 April (AFP) -- Ukraine said Tuesday [12  April] it had dismantled a disputed Black Sea fleet unit based  at Odessa and placed its personnel under the control of its own  armed forces in response to the wishes of fleet servicemen there.    The announcement was made by Ukrainian Deputy Defense  Minister Ivan Bijan and reported by INTERFAX-UKRAINE news agency  as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Ukraine to discuss  the dispute.    "It's up to Russia to decide how to react to this  resolution," the agency quoted General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of  staff of the Ukrainian Army, as saying.    A spokesman for the Russian Navy told AFP that the Ukrainian  move was made unilaterally but said it "means nothing" as the  future of the fleet would have to be resolved through  negotiations.    A Russian delegation led by Admiral Felix Gromov, commander  of the Russian Navy, held talks with Ukrainian officials in Kiev  Tuesday regarding the dispute, but the negotiations ended  without agreement, INTERFAX reported.    The Ukrainian move came a day after Russia accused Ukrainian  special forces of storming the base at Odessa, wounding  servicemen and arrested three Russian naval officers.    Bijan said the three officers had been released following  demands from the Russian Government.    The decision to place the Odessa division under Ukrainian  control was taken because "a considerable number of the men who  serve in the division expressed their desire to serve in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces," Bijan stated.    The Odessa unit is a submarine maintenance division  consisting of only several dozen servicemen, a shipyard and  basic communications facilities, informed sources said.    Details surrounding the attack on the base Sunday were still  hazy, but naval officials suggested that it occurred when  Russian sailors defied Ukrainian orders and left Odessa with a  ship carrying expensive naval equipment.    Control over the fleet, based at the Crimean port of  Sevastopol, has been a crucial point of contention between  Russia and Ukraine, which officially exercise joint command over  it.    The fleet was to have been divided into two equal parts  under  a 1992 accord but this has been delayed due to reluctance by the  mainly Russian officer corps to be under Ukrainian command.    Ukraine has also said it would give up its half of the fleet  in lieu of payment of its multi-billion dollar debt to Russia,  but this plan also has so far not been implemented.    Bijan said Ukrainian servicemen were "breaking Ukrainian  law"  by serving in the fleet, but gave no further explanation.    Separately, Ukraine agreed Tuesday to pay back its huge debt  for gas deliveries with cash payments and by offering to Russia  part ownership of pipelines and other facilities on its  territory, officials said here.    The head of Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem Vyakhirev,  said following talks here with a Ukrainian delegation that Kiev  would pay 600 million dollars by June.    Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev  would  privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other  installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the  newly-privatised companies.    Details of the plan however have yet to be hammered out and  the two sides agreed to establish working groups to determine  how the shared ownership would be implemented.    Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas  deliveries and the dispute forced Moscow drastically to cut the  gas flow to Ukraine in March.    Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines  would allow it better to control deliveries to its European  clients including France, Italy and Germany.</p>

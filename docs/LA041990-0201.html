			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA VALLEY FALLS TO A REVIVED VILLA PARK  </P> <P> A week away from the Century League baseball race did wonders for Villa Park  High School.  </P> <P> The Spartans, a team slipping in the league standings, managed to latch on to a  little consistency during spring break. They won three of four games in the  Santa Ana Elks tournament, losing only to El Toro in the championship game.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Villa Park returned to league play and maintained that level of  play. The Spartans, behind the pitching of Todd Blyleven, beat Santa Ana  Valley, 3-0, to remain in a third-place tie with El Modena.  </P> <P> Both teams are 1 1/2 games behind Canyon and Foothill, who share first place.  </P> <P> "We needed to sustain the momentum we built during the Santa Ana tournament,"  Coach Dave Ochoa said. "I thought it was important that we come back with a win  in league."  </P> <P> So Ocha gave the ball to Blyleven, the team's most consistent pitcher.  </P> <P> Blyleven (4-2), who entered the game with an earned-run average of 0.56,  allowed three hits while pitching his third shutout of the season. He struck  out 11, bringing his season total to 63.  </P> <P> "Todd's the one guy who's been consistent all season," Ochoa said. "We expect a  great game from him every time he goes out there."  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley was also coming off a good showing in the Santa Ana Elks  tournament. The Falcons won three of four games to win the consolation  championship.  </P> <P> "We've had been hurting ourselves with mental mistakes all season," Coach  Herschel Musick said. "But last week we seemed to pull things together."  </P> <P> They came apart again Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Falcons made three costly mistakes that led to three runs.  </P> <P> In the third, the Spartans' Alex Vicario led off with a single to right field.  However, Armando Cueva let the ball get past him in right, which allowed  Vicario to reach third base.  </P> <P> Aaron Boone followed with a sacrifice fly to score Vicario.  </P> <P> With two outs in the inning, James Hong walked and went to second on an error.  He scored on a single by Jason Martian.  </P> <P> The Spartans (11-6-1 and 4-4 in league play) added another run in the fifth  when Boone scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> "We were very opportunistic today," Ochoa said. "We got a couple breaks and  made the most of them. It was enough."  </P> <P> Especially with Blyleven on the mound.  </P> <P> The Falcons (8-10, 2-6) had only one runner get as far as third base through  six innings.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> El Modena 5, Canyon 4 (10 innings) -- Gavin Brown doubled in the top of the  10th and scored on an error on Bill Fischer's ground ball. Canyon (7-10-1,  5-2-1) led, 4-0, before El Modena (9-7, 5-2) tied the score with a run in the  sixth and three in the seventh.  </P> <P> Santa Ana 6, Foothill 2 -- Jesse Rosas, who struck out five in four innings,  and John Morales held Foothill to five hits and Dan Alvarez had two RBIs during  a five-run third inning for host Santa Ana (7-11, 3-5). Santa Ana is the only  Century League team that has beaten Foothill (8-9-1, 5-2-1) this season.  </P></p>
